## Question

Do all diabetics over 60 need rsv vaccination

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether all adults aged 60 years and older with diabetes should receive an RSV vaccine, and how to frame the recommendation accurately. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the current ACIP/CDC recommendations and how they changed in 2024. Then, I should verify how diabetes fits into the "increased risk" category for ages 60–74. Next, I will review the disease burden and vaccine efficacy data in older adults with diabetes. After that, I need to check safety signals, especially Guillain-Barré syndrome, and how they influence risk–benefit. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation and note any exceptions or shared decision-making points, anchoring on ACIP and ADA guidance.

> Let me first confirm the current national recommendations, because I need to ensure I'm not relying on outdated guidance. In June 2024, ACIP updated to a tiered approach: a single dose of an FDA-licensed RSV vaccine is recommended for all adults aged 75 years and older, and for adults aged 60–74 years who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease, using shared clinical decision-making for the latter group, with only one lifetime dose advised at this time.

> Wait, let me verify how diabetes is categorized within "increased risk" for ages 60–74. ACIP explicitly lists diabetes mellitus among chronic medical conditions that increase the risk of severe RSV-associated disease, alongside cardiovascular and pulmonary disease, kidney and liver disorders, neurologic/neuromuscular conditions, and residence in long-term care facilities, so adults with diabetes aged 60–74 years are in the target group for vaccination under the updated recommendation [^115wnmhF] [^113iQZgB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "all diabetics over 60" without parsing the age brackets. I should confirm the exact wording: the recommendation is universal for those aged 75 and older, and risk-based for those 60–74 years, with diabetes being one of the qualifying risk conditions; therefore, it is not accurate to say "all diabetics over 60 must be vaccinated", because adults 60–64 with diabetes are strongly considered but the formal recommendation is risk-based rather than universal in that younger 60s bracket, whereas adults 75 and older are universally recommended to receive the vaccine [^115wnmhF] [^112qndgU] [^1132FJsJ].

> Next, I should review the disease burden to ensure the risk signal is real and clinically meaningful. Adults aged 65 years and older experience an estimated 60,000–160,000 RSV-associated hospitalizations and 6,000–10,000 deaths annually in the U.S., and diabetes is among the most common comorbidities in hospitalized RSV cases, with diabetes increasing hospitalization risk roughly 2–4 fold in multiple cohorts, underscoring a substantial absolute and relative risk in this population [^114ebnTj] [^1162ydLr] [^113LR9F7].

> I will now examine vaccine effectiveness, because benefit must be demonstrated in the target groups. In the pivotal AReSVi-006 trial of the adjuvanted RSVPreF3 OA vaccine, efficacy against RSV-LRTD was 82.6% overall and 94.1% against severe RSV-LRTD, with high efficacy maintained in participants with coexisting cardiorespiratory or endocrine/metabolic conditions, including diabetes, and real-world data from 2023–2024 show approximately 77–83% effectiveness against ED visits and hospitalizations in adults 60 and older, supporting clinical benefit in the recommended populations [^1139Su1S] [^1122wruA] [^112PyX6x] [^113iQZgB].

> But wait, what about safety signals that could temper enthusiasm. I need to check the Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) signal. Early post-licensure and trial safety monitoring identified a small excess of GBS cases after RSV vaccination on the order of about 7–9 per million doses, primarily with the protein subunit vaccines, whereas an mRNA RSV vaccine has not shown a clear GBS signal to date; ACIP concluded that benefits outweigh risks, but clinicians should discuss this rare risk and tailor decisions in patients with higher baseline GBS risk or strong preferences [^1178h4PT] [^117QpjVU] [^114mGq12].

> Let me consider practical implementation and timing, because operational details matter. RSV vaccination is currently a single lifetime dose, optimally given before RSV season, and coadministration with influenza vaccine is acceptable, though slight reductions in influenza H3N2 titers have been observed with one adjuvanted RSV product without clear clinical consequence; shared decision-making is particularly important for adults 60–74 years, where diabetes status, frailty, residence in long-term care, and patient values should guide the discussion [^113u1Hg4] [^114uFhpj] [^112j45PJ].

> I should double-check that diabetes-specific guidelines align with this interpretation. The ADA Standards of Care 2025 explicitly incorporates ACIP's updated recommendation, advising RSV vaccination for adults aged 75 years and older and for adults aged 60–74 years at increased risk, which includes people with diabetes, consistent with ACIP's risk-based approach for the 60–74 bracket [^113wmRPS] [^1116gg4M] [^112Q1mrs].

> Putting this together, my final synthesis is as follows: No, not all adults with diabetes over 60 are universally mandated to receive an RSV vaccine. Adults aged 75 years and older, including those with diabetes, should receive a single lifetime RSV vaccine dose as a routine recommendation, whereas adults aged 60–74 years with diabetes are strongly considered for vaccination under a risk-based recommendation using shared clinical decision-making, given diabetes confers increased risk of severe RSV disease and the vaccines demonstrate high efficacy and favorable benefit–risk balance in this population [^115wnmhF] [^112qndgU] [^1139Su1S] [^1178h4PT].

---

No, not all diabetics over 60 need the RSV vaccine. The CDC/ACIP recommends a **single RSV vaccine dose** for adults aged ≥ 75 years and for adults aged 60–74 years who are at **increased risk** for severe RSV disease, including those with diabetes and other chronic conditions [^115wnmhF] [^1132FJsJ]. For adults aged 60–74 years without additional risk factors, RSV vaccination is **not universally recommended** and should be based on shared clinical decision-making [^112j45PJ]. Diabetes alone does not mandate vaccination; risk is higher with insulin use, chronic kidney disease, or other comorbidities, so clinicians should individualize decisions [^113iQZgB].

---

## Current CDC/ACIP recommendations

The CDC and ACIP provide **clear guidance** on RSV vaccination for older adults:

- **Adults aged ≥ 75 years**: Recommended to receive a single dose of RSV vaccine [^115wnmhF].

- **Adults aged 60–74 years**: Recommended to receive a single dose if they are at increased risk for severe RSV disease, including those with chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, chronic lung or heart disease, moderate or severe immunocompromise, or residence in nursing homes [^115wnmhF] [^1132FJsJ].

- **Adults aged 60–74 years without increased risk**: Vaccination is not universally recommended; decisions should be made using shared clinical decision-making (SCDM) based on individual risk factors, patient preferences, and clinical judgment [^112j45PJ].

---

## Risk of severe RSV disease in diabetic patients

Diabetes mellitus is a **chronic condition** that increases the risk of severe RSV disease. Adults with diabetes have higher rates of RSV-associated hospitalizations and complications than those without diabetes [^113LR9F7]. The risk is further elevated in patients with poorly controlled diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or other comorbidities [^113kpTHL].

---

## Evidence supporting RSV vaccination in diabetic patients

Clinical trials and real-world studies demonstrate that RSV vaccination is effective in **reducing the risk of severe RSV disease** in older adults, including those with chronic conditions such as diabetes [^1139Su1S]. The vaccines have shown high efficacy in preventing RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease and severe outcomes in this population [^114YUd5B].

---

## Clinical considerations for diabetic patients aged 60–74 years

For diabetic patients aged 60–74 years, clinicians should consider the following factors when deciding on RSV vaccination:

- **Glycemic control**: Poorly controlled diabetes increases the risk of severe RSV disease.

- **Presence of comorbidities**: Chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, or other chronic conditions further elevate risk [^113LR9F7].

- **Patient preferences**: Shared decision-making should incorporate patient values, preferences, and clinical judgment [^112j45PJ].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Age group** | **Recommendation** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| ≥ 75 years | Recommended | Universal recommendation |
| 60–74 years with increased risk | Recommended | - Includes diabetes with additional risk factors <br/> - Shared clinical decision-making |
| 60–74 years without increased risk | Not universally recommended | Shared clinical decision-making |

---

## Conclusion and clinical guidance

Not all diabetics over 60 need the RSV vaccine. The CDC/ACIP recommends vaccination for adults aged ≥ 75 years and for adults aged 60–74 years who are at **increased risk** for severe RSV disease, including those with diabetes and other chronic conditions. For diabetic patients aged 60–74 years without additional risk factors, vaccination is not universally recommended and should be based on shared clinical decision-making. Clinicians should individualize decisions based on glycemic control, comorbidities, and patient preferences.

### Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-related hospitalization and increased rate of cardiovascular events in older adults [^116sEsyB]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has traditionally been neglected as an important acute respiratory infection (ARI) outside of childhood, thus the perceived risk in adults aged ≥ 60 years is low. Vaccines (Arexvy, GSK; ABRYSVO, Pfizer; mRESVIA, Moderna) have recently been approved in the US, Canada, and Europe for adults aged ≥ 60 years. Findings from randomized trials indicate they have similar safety profiles as the first and second doses of the Pfizer‐BioNTech COVID‐19 vaccine, although excess rates of Guillain‐Barré syndrome have been suggested from early analyses of safety monitoring and administrative billing databases. Although usually only 20%–30% as incident as influenza, evidence suggests that RSV is significantly more likely to cause severe disease in hospitalized older adults, particularly in terms of mortality, need for mechanical ventilation and/or critical care, and hospital length of stay. This appears to be compounded in the oldest old and those with comorbidities, as the hospitalization rate for individuals aged ≥ 80 years is approximately 8 per 1000 compared to 0.5 per 1000 for those aged 45–54 years, while the relative risk for hospitalization is 2–10‐fold higher for those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, heart disease, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease than individuals without those comorbidities.

Prior to the COVID‐19 pandemic, RSV, along withand influenza, had the greatest contribution to the global acute respiratory infection burden, accounting for approximately 1.2 million deaths per year and 22 million disability‐adjusted life‐years lost in adults aged ≥ 60 years. Somewhat underappreciated is the substantial impact of these pathogens on the likelihood of cardiovascular outcomes. For example, the rate of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke is significantly greater in the weeks following an influenza diagnosis or hospitalization, as is the rate of any acute cardiovascular event following a clinically diagnosed or laboratory‐confirmed influenza. Others have shown the risk of ischemic heart disease or heart failure can be elevated for nearly a decade following pneumonia. These findings are supported by studies indicating that vaccination against influenza or pneumococcus is protective against cardiovascular events and related death, particularly in those who are already at high risk. While it appears that many types of respiratory infections are associated with subsequent cardiovascular outcomes, and that cardiac events are a common complication of laboratory‐confirmed RSV hospitalizations, especially in severe cases, there is a paucity of data comparing outcomes among older adults hospitalized due to RSV compared to other types of hospital admissions.

### An adjuvanted, postfusion F protein-based vaccine did not prevent respiratory syncytial virus illness in older adults [^114nwNDr]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

A total of 802 patients (406 in the RSV vaccine group and 396 in the placebo group) were considered high risk for ARI at baseline; the VE in this group was 51.2% (90% CI, –33.3%–83.9%), with 1.2% and 2.5% in the RSV vaccine and placebo groups, respectively, meeting the RSV-associated ARI end point. Serious adverse cardiopulmonary events, which could have represented an RSV end point (no subject was tested for RSV while hospitalized), were balanced across study arms (occurring in 1.5% of RSV vaccine recipients and 1.9% of placebo recipients). When defined as 2 lower respiratory tract illness symptoms plus seroresponse, the VE was 10.7% (90% CI, –47.1%–46.0%). There was no subgroup of subjects identifiable by baseline clinical conditions in which efficacy was demonstrable. Among subjects who had RSV-associated ARI, a numerically larger proportion receiving placebo than RSV vaccine had cardiac disorders (31.3% vs 11.8%), type 2 diabetes mellitus (31.3% vs 29.4%), or respiratory disorders (12.5% vs 11.8%). No subject who met the RSV-associated ARI end point in the RSV vaccine group had a history at baseline of cardiac failure, chronic kidney disease, asthma, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. RSV-associated ARI events were not clustered at the end of the RSV season in RSV vaccine recipients (10 of 16 events occurred in months 3 and 4 after dosing).

### Noninferior immunogenicity and consistent safety of respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F protein vaccine in adults 50–59 years compared to ≥ 60 years of age [^116EekpG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The adjuvanted respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prefusion F protein-based vaccine (RSVPreF3 OA) is approved in adults aged ≥ 60 years. We evaluated RSVPreF3 OA immunogenicity and safety in adults aged 50–59 years without or with increased risk for RSV disease due to specific chronic medical conditions.

Methods

This observer-blind, phase 3, noninferiority trial included adults aged 50–59 years, stratified into 2 subcohorts: those with and those without predefined, stable, chronic medical conditions leading to an increased risk for RSV disease. Participants in both subcohorts were randomized 2:1 to receive RSVPreF3 OA or placebo. A control group of adults aged ≥ 60 years received RSVPreF3 OA. Primary outcomes were RSV-A and RSV-B neutralization titers (geometric mean titer ratios and sero-response rate differences) 1 month post-vaccination in 50–59-year-olds versus ≥ 60-year-olds. Cell-mediated immunity and safety were also assessed.

Results

The exposed population included 1152 participants aged 50–59 years and 381 participants aged ≥ 60 years. RSVPreF3 OA was immunologically noninferior in 50–59-year-olds versus ≥ 60-year-olds; noninferiority criteria were met for RSV-A and RSV-B neutralization titers in those with and those without increased risk for RSV disease. Frequencies of RSVPreF3-specific polyfunctional CD4+ T cells increased substantially from pre- to 1 month post-vaccination. Most solicited adverse events had mild-to-moderate intensity and were transient. Unsolicited and serious adverse event rates were similar in all groups.

Conclusions

RSVPreF3 OA was immunologically noninferior in 50–59-year-olds compared to ≥ 60-year-olds, in whom efficacy was previously demonstrated. The safety profile in 50–59-year-olds was consistent with that in ≥ 60-year-olds.

### Why the UK is vaccinating its older adult population against RSV-what geriatricians should know [^115EGHUE]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

The UK is launching a new free vaccination programme against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in adults aged 75 or over. This follows the development of safe and effective vaccines against RSV and the growing realisation of the burden of RSV-related disease in older adults-estimated at circa 8000 deaths and 175 000 GP episodes every year in the UK. It is likely that the full burden of RSV-related illness is under-appreciated and under-reported due to a lack of testing and awareness of its dangers in older adults. Healthcare professionals working with older people should be aware of the evidence base and be in a position to advise patients on the risks and benefits of vaccination and nonvaccination. We briefly review the evidence for the safety and effectiveness of the two licensed vaccines against RSV with a special focus on what geriatricians and others working with frailer, older people need to know.

### Patient-and community-level characteristics associated with respiratory syncytial virus vaccination [^112HrAP5]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What patient- and community-level characteristics are associated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccination among hospitalized adults 60 years or older during 2023 to 2024?

Findings

In this cross-sectional analysis of 6746 hospitalized adults in 20 states, RSV vaccination was associated with being 75 years or older and having pulmonary disease, immunocompromised status, low or moderate social vulnerability, and at least grade 12 education or General Educational Development. Residents of long-term care facilities and patients with Medicaid or no insurance were less likely to receive RSV vaccine.

Meaning

These findings suggest that RSV vaccination was appropriately prioritized among older adults and those with certain high-risk conditions in 2023 to 2024, but sociodemographic differences in uptake also occurred.

Recommendations for Use of RSV Vaccines in Older Adults

On June 21, 2023, ACIP recommended that adults aged ≥ 60 years may receive a single dose of RSV vaccine, using shared clinical decision-making. §§§§

Clinical Guidance

Shared Clinical Decision-Making for Adults Aged ≥ 60 years. Unlike routine and risk-based vaccine recommendations, recommendations based on shared clinical decision-making do not target all persons in a particular age group or an identifiable risk group. For RSV vaccination, the decision to vaccinate a patient should be based on a discussion between the health care provider and the patient, which might be guided by the patient's risk for disease and their characteristics, values, and preferences; the provider's clinical discretion; and the characteristics of the vaccine.

As part of this discussion, providers and patients should consider the patient's risk for severe RSV-associated disease. Epidemiologic evidence indicates that persons aged ≥ 60 years who are at highest risk for severe RSV disease and who might be most likely to benefit from vaccination include those with chronic medical conditions such as lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma; cardiovascular diseases such as congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease; moderate or severe immune compromise (either attributable to a medical condition or receipt of immunosuppressive medications or treatment); diabetes mellitus; neurologic or neuromuscular conditions; kidney disorders, liver disorders, and hematologic disorders; persons who are frail; persons of advanced age; and persons with other underlying conditions or factors that the provider determines might increase the risk for severe RSV-associated respiratory disease (Box). Adults aged ≥ 60 years who are residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are also at risk for severe RSV disease. It should be noted that the numbers of persons enrolled in the trials who were frail, were of advanced age, and lived in long-term care facilities were limited, and persons with compromised immunity were excluded (some of whom might have an attenuated immune response to RSV vaccination). However, adults aged ≥ 60 years in these populations may receive vaccination using shared clinical decision-making given the potential for benefit.

### Respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F protein vaccine is efficacious in older adults with underlying medical conditions [^114D3Zqm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The observed neutralizing GMTs tended to be higher among participants with at least 1 coexisting condition of interest than among those without such conditions. In the absence of a correlate of protection, the clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. Nevertheless, efficacy point estimates also tended to be higher among those with these conditions versus those without, which could be due to more severe presentations of RSV-LRTD among those with the selected coexisting conditions.

Analyses on the total vaccinated trial population showed that RSVPreF3 OA was well tolerated and had an acceptable safety profile; most solicited adverse events were transient with mild to moderate severity, and no imbalances were observed in the rates of serious adverse events or potential immune-mediated diseases. Together, these results indicate a positive benefit-risk balance of the vaccine in older adults, including those with coexisting medical conditions.

The analyses presented here have some limitations. The efficacy and immunogenicity analyses in the different subgroups were descriptive and were not adjusted for multiplicity. However, the magnitude of the vaccine efficacy estimates and high CI lower limits support the statistical robustness of these analyses. Although the proportion of older adults with coexisting medical conditions and the type of conditions were as expected from this population of older adults, enrollment was restricted to those who were considered medically stable. However, efficacy against RSV-LRTD and RSV-ARI remained high, with an increasing number of underlying conditions (92.0% and 88.0%, respectively, among older adults with at least 2 medical conditions of interest), suggesting that the vaccine may protect some of the most vulnerable older adults with multimorbidity.

In conclusion, this phase 3 trial showed that a single dose of the adjuvanted RSVPreF3 OA vaccine was immunogenic and efficacious in preventing RSV-LRTD and RSV-ARI in older adults with cardiorespiratory and endocrine or metabolic conditions associated with an increased risk of severe RSV disease.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^114qr2fh]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

Adult immunizations in diabetes mellitus — vaccine-specific guidance includes influenza, pneumococcal, hepatitis B, COVID-19, tetanus, and zoster. The intranasal influenza vaccine should be used with caution because its safety in persons with DM has not been established, and inactivated influenza vaccine may be considered for persons with DM. For pneumococcal vaccination, the CDC/ACIP recommends a single dose of PCV15 or PCV20 for adults with DM who have not previously received PCV or whose previous vaccination history is unknown, and when PCV15 is used, it should be followed by a dose of PPSV23. Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all persons with DM aged 59 years or younger and should be considered for persons 60 years or older with shared clinical decision-making based on risk assessment and likelihood of an adequate immune response; a 2‑dose hepatitis B vaccine, HEPLISAV‑B, had greater seroprotection rates among persons with DM compared with the 3‑dose hepatitis B vaccine 28 weeks after vaccination. Individuals with DM, when infected with COVID‑19, are more likely to be hospitalized, need higher levels of care, and have higher mortality; hence, individuals with DM should be vaccinated according to current CDC recommendations. Tetanus prophylaxis in wound management is recommended and could be important for persons with DM who have foot ulcers. The recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) is recommended for adults 50 years of age and older according to the CDC/ACIP schedule, and the live attenuated zoster vaccine is no longer available for use in the United States.

Implications for Public Health Practice

On February 29, 2024, ACIP announced that, based on a thorough review of currently available data, the estimated benefits of RSV vaccination continued to outweigh potential risks. RSV vaccination continues to be recommended for adults aged ≥ 60 years using shared clinical decision-making. CDC and FDA are conducting active safety evaluations to assess risks for GBS and other adverse events of special interest after RSV vaccination. Results of these studies will help guide future CDC RSV vaccine recommendations.

### Understanding respiratory syncytial virus vaccination… [^113z23FH]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction Adults 60 years and older are at increased risk for respiratory syncytial virus infection and severe disease and death secondary to RSV. 1 Recognizing this risk, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices began recommending the RSV vaccine in June 2023 for all adults 60 years and older using shared clinical decision-making. 2 In addition to RSV, the ACIP recommends the SCDM approach for the following four vaccines and age groups 3:
- Meningitis B;
- Human papillomavirus;
- Hepatitis B;
- Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 20; and
- Pneumococcal polysaccharide 23.

Among this age group, certain patient populations have a further elevated risk for severe RSV-associated disease, including individuals with any of the following chronic conditions 2:
- Lung disease
- Cardiovascular diseases
- Diabetes mellitus
- Neurologic conditions
- Kidney disorders
- Liver disorders
- Hematologic disorders
- Immune compromised
- Other underlying conditions a health care provider determines might increase the risk for severe respiratory disease. Currently Available RSV Vaccines for Patients 60 Years and Older The CDC currently recommends two FDA-approved vaccines for use with SCDM in patients 60 years and older. 4, 5 Arexvy, manufactured by GSK, is an adjuvant recombinant glycoprotein F vaccine. Abrysvo, produced by Pfizer, is a bivalent recombinant glycoprotein F protein vaccine with efficacy against RSV A and RSV B.

Abrysvo is also approved for use in patients who are pregnant from 32 weeks through 36 weeks of gestation from September through January. 1 When administered to immune-competent adults 60 years and older, a single dose of RSV vaccine significantly reduces the risk for RSV lower respiratory tract disease, such as pneumonia. When considering protection against RSV-related LRTD in the first RSV season following vaccination, Arexvy showed an 83% efficacy, and a single dose of Abrysvo showed an 89% efficacy.

Evidence base 28 — Vaccination outcomes in persons with diabetes mellitus (DM): A cohort study of adults ≤ 65 years of age with DM showed that DM increased the risk of influenza-associated hospitalizations by 6% (risk ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02–1.10; absolute risk difference = 6 per 1000 adults per year), and rates of influenza and pneumonia were similar between diabetic and nondiabetic populations (P = 0.11). Vaccines can safely and effectively reduce serious complications from influenza, with a systematic review finding reduction in all-cause mortality ranging between 33% and 68% among persons older than 65 years with DM and with seasonal influenza vaccination. Other systematic reviews have demonstrated effective immunogenicity of influenza vaccine with decreased risk for hospitalization and mortality among persons with DM (especially those aged > 65 years) compared with healthy individuals, and a randomized controlled trial found the inactivated influenza vaccine was tolerated with mild-to-moderate adverse effects and with similar immune response among persons with DM compared to those without DM. CDC/ACIP recommends a yearly influenza vaccine for all individuals with DM.

### Respiratory syncytial virus in adults with comorbidities: an update on epidemiology, vaccines, and treatments [^111RHfgr]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is widely known as a frequent cause of respiratory distress among adults, particularly in older people. Recent years have witnessed several improvements in respiratory virus detection, leading to more questions about therapeutic management strategies.

Objectives

This narrative review focuses on the RSV burden in older people and adults with risk factors and provides an update on the main recent developments regarding managing this infection.

Sources

A comprehensive PubMed search was conducted till August 2023 to identify studies on RSV among the adult population. We included observational studies, RCTs on vaccines, and different therapies.

Content

This review should give clinicians an overview of RSV epidemiology and burden among older people and adults with pre-existing risk factors, the most recent randomized clinical trials on RSV vaccines, and the existing data on the different therapeutics existing and under development.

Implications

There is a growing body of evidence on RSV burden in adults. The landscape of preventive and curative treatments is quickly evolving.

RSV Vaccination Timing

RSV vaccination is currently approved and recommended for administration as a single dose; sufficient evidence does not exist at this time to determine the need for revaccination. Optimally, vaccination should occur before the onset of the RSV season; however, typical RSV seasonality was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and has not returned to prepandemic patterns. For the 2023–24 season, clinicians should offer RSV vaccination to adults aged ≥ 60 years using shared clinical decision-making as early as vaccine supply becomes available and should continue to offer vaccination to eligible adults who remain unvaccinated.

Vaccine Administration, Including Coadministration with Other Vaccines

Coadministration of RSV vaccines with other adult vaccines during the same visit is acceptable. *Available data on immunogenicity of coadministration of RSV vaccines and other vaccines are currently limited. Coadministration of RSV and seasonal influenza vaccines met noninferiority criteria for immunogenicity with the exception of the FluA/Darwin H3N2 strain when the GSK RSV vaccine was coadministered with adjuvanted quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. RSV and influenza antibody titers were somewhat lower with coadministration; however, the clinical significance of this is unknown.

Administering RSV vaccine with one or more other vaccines at the same visit might increase local or systemic reactogenicity. Data are only available for coadministration of RSV and influenza vaccines, and evidence is mixed regarding increased reactogenicity. Data are lacking on the safety of coadministration with other vaccines that might be recommended for persons in this age group, such as COVID-19 vaccines; pneumococcal vaccines; adult tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccines; and the recombinant zoster vaccine (the recombinant zoster vaccine and GSK's RSV vaccine contains the same adjuvant). When deciding whether to coadminister other vaccines with an RSV vaccine, providers should consider whether the patient is up to date with currently recommended vaccines, the feasibility of the patient returning for additional vaccine doses, risk for acquiring vaccine-preventable disease, vaccine reactogenicity profiles, and patient preferences. Postlicensure efficacy and safety monitoring of coadministered RSV vaccines with other vaccines will further direct guidance.

Precautions and Contraindications

As with all vaccines, RSV vaccination should be delayed for persons experiencing moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever (precaution). RSV vaccines are contraindicated for and should not be administered to persons with a history of severe allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis, to any component of the vaccine.

Summary of respiratory vaccine recommendations for patients with heart disease — Influenza is annual for persons aged ≥ 6 mo; nasal vaccine not recommended for patients aged > 50 y, and specific vaccines are recommended for those aged ≥ 65 y. Pneumococcal is 1-time vaccination with PCV20 or PCV21 for adults aged ≥ 19 y, while other vaccines require 2 vaccinations. COVID-19 guidance lists initial and 2024–2025 vaccine for persons aged ≥ 6 mo, noting that recommendations for annual vaccination may change as circulating virus biology changes. RSV is 1-time vaccination for adults aged ≥ 60 y. Zoster requires 2 doses of recombinant zoster vaccine 2–6 mo apart for those adults aged ≥ 50 y. Other vaccines are recommended by the CDC for all adults (regardless of heart disease).

### Bivalent RSVpreF vaccine in adults 18 to… [^112WjUor]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Older individuals and adults with certain chronic or immunocompromising health conditions are at increased risk of severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease.

Methods

In this phase 3 randomized trial of RSVpreF safety and immunogenicity in 18–59-year-olds at high risk of severe RSV disease, participants were randomized 2:1 to 1 RSVpreF (120µg) or placebo dose. Primary safety endpoints included reactogenicity events and adverse events (AEs) through 7 days and 1 month after vaccination, respectively, and serious AEs (SAEs) and newly diagnosed chronic medical conditions (NDCMCs) throughout the study. In primary analyses, immunogenicity elicited 1 month after RSVpreF was bridged to a randomly selected subset of ≥ 60-year-olds receiving RSVpreF from the immunogenicity subset in the pivotal phase 3 RENOIR trial, which demonstrated RSVpreF efficacy. Noninferiority was declared if 95% confidence interval (CI) lower bounds were > .667 (neutralizing titer adjusted geometric mean ratios) and > -10% (seroresponse rate differences) for RSV-A and RSV-B.

Results

Overall, 678 participants received RSVpreF (n = 453) or placebo (n = 225). Most reactogenicity events were mild/moderate; severe events occurred in ≤ 2.0% of participants overall. AE frequencies were similar in RSVpreF (7.1%) and placebo recipients (7.6%). No vaccine-related SAEs or NDCMCs were reported. One month after RSVpreF administration, noninferiority criteria were met in 18–59-year-olds versus ≥ 60-year-olds for RSV-A and RSV-B neutralizing titers and seroresponse rates.

Conclusions

RSVpreF was well tolerated with no safety concerns and demonstrated immunobridging to efficacy in 18–59-year-olds at high risk of severe RSV disease versus ≥ 60-year-olds in whom efficacy was previously demonstrated, supporting use of RSVpreF to prevent RSV-associated disease in this population.

Diabetes immunizations — COVID-19, hepatitis B, influenza, and pneumococcal vaccines — are specified with age- and product-specific guidance: COVID-19 vaccination "is recommended for everyone aged 6 months and older in the U.S". using "an appropriate number of doses of updated vaccines". For hepatitis B, vaccination "is recommended for adults with diabetes aged < 60 years", while "for adults aged ≥ 60 years, hepatitis B vaccine may be administered at the discretion of the treating clinician". For influenza, "it is recommended for all individuals ≥ 6 months of age who do not have a contraindication", the live attenuated vaccine "is an option for people who are 2–49 years of age and are not pregnant", but people with chronic conditions such as diabetes "are cautioned against taking the live attenuated influenza vaccine and are instead recommended to receive the inactive or recombinant influenza vaccination", and "as of the 2024–2025 season, all influenza vaccines offered in the U.S. are trivalent". For pneumococcal disease, "all people with diabetes should receive one of the CDC-recommended pneumococcal vaccines".

### Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines uptake among pharmacists: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Kb4w3]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Influenza and diseases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (e.g. pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease) can result in serious health complications, particularly among older people, children, and individuals with weakened immune systems –. Epidemiological data suggests that the flu virus could be the cause of hundreds of millions of illnesses and around 100,000 deaths annually worldwide (with some sources suggesting the number could be even higher, exceeding 300,000 deaths) –. Streptococcus pneumoniae causes even more dangerous infections, resulting in the highest morbidity and mortality rates among lower respiratory tract infections. Based on data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the estimated number of deaths caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae-induced diseases in 2021 was approximately 550,000.

Vaccination is the most effective strategy for preventing influenza virus and pneumococcal infections. In the case of influenza, it is recommended for all people over 6 months of age who have no contraindications to vaccination –. The pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for children (until the age of 5), individuals over 65, and those at risk of experiencing a more severe infection, such as those with chronic cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, and diabetes mellitus –. The guidelines we have cited were based on literature reviews and have been published by internationally recognized institutions from the USA, Canada, and Australia, including the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It should be emphasized that pneumococcal vaccination strategies can vary between countries, and this can be influenced by aspects such as the availability and price of vaccines, local conditions (prevalence of vaccine serotypes), and antimicrobial resistance patterns. In the case of implementing a vaccination program for older adults, local disease burden and cost-effectiveness considerations should also be taken into account. Also, it is worth quoting the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), indicating the need to implement vaccination programs for children first (covering as many people in this group as possible) and then consider implementing a vaccination program for older adults.

### Noninferior immunogenicity and consistent safety of respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F protein vaccine in adults 50–59 years compared to ≥ 60 years of age [^1162vLP9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Design, Participants, and Interventions

This ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study (: NCT05590403) takes place in 60 centers in 8 countries (Argentina, Canada, Germany, Japan, The Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and United States). The study includes a cohort with 50–59-year-old participants and a control cohort with participants aged 60 years and older. The cohort with 50–59-year-olds was divided into an at-increased-risk (AIR) and a non-AIR subcohort. The AIR subcohort only included participants diagnosed with at least 1 predefined, stable, chronic medical condition recognized to increase the risk for RSV disease. These conditions were as follows: chronic pulmonary disease (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, cystic fibrosis, lung fibrosis, restrictive lung disease, interstitial lung disease, emphysema, and bronchiectasis), chronic cardiovascular disease (ie, chronic heart failure, coronary artery disease, and cardiac arrhythmia), diabetes mellitus types 1 and 2, chronic renal disease, and chronic liver disease. The non-AIR subcohort excluded individuals with these specific conditions but could include people with other stable, non-immunocompromising conditions (eg, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or hypothyroidism). Inclusion criteria for the cohort of those aged 60 years and older were aligned with those used in the phase 3 efficacy study; participants aged 60 years and older could have stable, non-immunocompromising, chronic conditions, including those described to increase the risk for RSV disease. A condition was considered stable if there were no changes in treatment or severity in the 3 months before enrollment. Detailed eligibility criteria and enrollment rules are listed in the Supplementary Methods.

### Respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F protein vaccine is efficacious in older adults with underlying medical conditions [^117Q4TAD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

With supportive care remaining the current clinical standard for RSV treatment and considering the high prevalence of multimorbidity in older adults, there is a high unmet medical need for RSV vaccines in older adults that are also effective in those with chronic medical conditions. Several RSV vaccines are under development, and an adjuvanted RSV vaccine for older adults (RSVPreF3 OA, Arexvy, GSK), based on the RSV fusion (F) protein stabilized in its prefusion conformation, was recently approved. In the ongoing phase 3 AReSVi-006 trial, RSVPreF3 OA was immunogenic and showed 82.6% efficacy against RSV-related LRTD (RSV-LRTD), 94.1% against severe RSV-LRTD, and 71.7% against RSV-ARI in adults ≥ 60 years of age during 1 RSV season. The vaccine had an acceptable safety profile. The analyses reported here aimed to evaluate vaccine efficacy and immunogenicity of a single dose of RSVPreF3 OA in adults aged ≥ 60 years with coexisting cardiorespiratory and endocrine or metabolic conditions associated with an increased risk of severe RSV disease.

### Respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospitalization in adults with comorbidities in 2 European countries: a modeling study [^113LR9F7]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Individuals with comorbidities are at increased risk of severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. We estimated RSV-associated respiratory hospitalization among adults aged ≥ 45 years with comorbidities in Denmark and Scotland.

Methods

By analyzing national hospital and virologic data, we estimated annual RSV-associated hospitalizations by 7 selected comorbidities and ages between 2010 and 2018. We estimated rate ratios of RSV-associated hospitalization for adults with comorbidity than the overall population.

Results

In Denmark, annual RSV-associated hospitalization rates per 1000 adults ranged from 3.1 for asthma to 19.4 for chronic kidney disease (CKD). In Scotland, rates ranged from 2.4 for chronic liver disease to 9.0 for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In both countries, we found a 2- to 4-fold increased risk of RSV hospitalization for adults with COPD, ischemic heart disease, stroke, and diabetes; a 1.5- to 3-fold increased risk for asthma; and a 3- to 7-fold increased risk for CKD. RSV hospitalization rates among adults aged 45 to 64 years with COPD, asthma, ischemic heart disease, or CKD were higher than the overall population.

Conclusions

This study provides important evidence for identifying risk groups and assisting health authorities in RSV vaccination policy making.

### Respiratory syncytial virus infections in adults: a narrative review [^114zCeTP]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), an RNA virus spread by droplet infection that affects all ages, is increasingly recognised as an important pathogen in adults, especially among older people living with comorbidities. Distinguishing RSV from other acute viral infections on clinical grounds alone, with sufficient precision to be clinically useful, is not possible. The reference standard diagnosis is by PCR: point-of-care tests perform less well with lower viral loads. Testing samples from a single respiratory tract site could result in underdetection. RSV is identified in 6–11% of outpatient respiratory tract infection (RTI) consultations in older adults (≥ 60 years, or ≥ 65 years, depending on the study) and accounts for 4–11% of adults (≥ 18 years) hospitalised with RTI, with 6–15% of those hospitalised admitted to intensive care, and 1–12% of all adults hospitalised with RSV respiratory tract infection dying. Community-based studies estimate the yearly incidence of RSV infection at around 3–7% in adults aged 60 years and older in high-income countries. Although RSV accounts for a similar disease burden as influenza in adults, those hospitalised with severe RSV disease are typically older (most ≥ 60 years) and have more comorbidities, more respiratory symptoms, and are frequently without fever. Long-term sequelae are common and include deterioration of underlying disease (typically heart failure and COPD). There are few evidence-based RSV-specific treatments currently available, with supportive care being the main modality. Two protein subunit vaccines for protection from severe RSV in adults aged 60 years and older were licensed in 2023, and a third-an mRNA-based vaccine-recently gained market approval in the USA. The phase 3 studies in these three vaccines showed good protection against severe disease. Data on real-world vaccine effectiveness in older adults, including subgroups at high risk for RSV-associated hospitalisation, are needed to establish the best use of these newly approved RSV vaccines. New diagnostics and therapeutics are being developed, which will also need rigorous evaluation within their target populations to ensure they are used only for those in whom there is evidence of improved outcomes. There is an urgent need to reconceptualise this illness from one that is serious in children, but far less important than influenza in older people, to thinking of RSV as also a major risk to health for older people that needs targeted prevention and treatment.

Abstract

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes substantial morbidity and mortality in older adults. In May 2023, two RSV vaccines were approved for prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease in adults aged ≥ 60 years. In June 2023, CDC recommended RSV vaccination for adults aged ≥ 60 years, using shared clinical decision-making. Using data from the Respiratory Syncytial Virus–Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network, a population-based hospitalization surveillance system operating in 12 states, this analysis examined characteristics (including age, underlying medical conditions, and clinical outcomes) of 3,218 adults aged ≥ 60 years who were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection during July 2022–June 2023. Among a random sample of 1,634 older adult patients with RSV-associated hospitalization, 54.1% were aged ≥ 75 years, and the most common underlying medical conditions were obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, and diabetes. Severe outcomes occurred in 18.5% (95% CI = 15.9%–21.2%) of hospitalized patients aged ≥ 60 years. Overall, 17.0% (95% CI = 14.5%–19.7%) of patients with RSV infection were admitted to an intensive care unit, 4.8% (95% CI = 3.5%–6.3%) required mechanical ventilation, and 4.7% (95% CI = 3.6%–6.1%) died; 17.2% (95% CI = 14.9%–19.8%) of all cases occurred in long-term care facility residents. These data highlight the importance of prioritizing those at highest risk for severe RSV disease and suggest that clinicians and patients consider age (particularly age ≥ 75 years), long-term care facility residence, and underlying medical conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure, in shared clinical decision-making when offering RSV vaccine to adults aged ≥ 60 years.

Introduction

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is increasingly recognized as an important cause of severe respiratory disease in older adults. In the United States, an estimated 60,000–160,000 RSV-associated hospitalizations and 6,000–10,000 RSV-associated deaths occur each year among adults aged ≥ 65 years. On June 21, 2023, CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended RSV vaccination for adults aged ≥ 60 years using shared clinical decision-making †. Understanding the severity of RSV disease compared with that of other respiratory viral diseases in older adults is needed to guide this shared patient-provider clinical decision-making.

LOOKING FORWARD

Considerable progress was made in developing RSV vaccines for older adults. The United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) recently approved two RSV vaccines for this age group: RSVpreF (unadjuvanted bivalent RSV vaccine with F protein in prefusion conformation) and RSVPreF3 (adjuvanted monovalent RSV vaccine with F protein in prefusion conformation), both of which demonstrated very high efficacy rates along with durable protection for at least 2 years. The RSVPreF3 vaccine has been also licensed in Japan and Canada. RSVpreF, tested on 34 284 participants enrolled between August 31, 2021, and July 14, 2022, showed 66.7% (96.6% CI: 28.8; 85.8) efficacy against RSV-associated LRTI with at least two symptoms and 85.7% (96.6% CI: 32.0; 98.7) with at least three symptoms at the end of the first season. RSVPreF3, evaluated on participants enrolled in 2021–2023, demonstrated an efficacy of 74.5% (95% CI: 60.0; 84.5) against RSV-associated LRTI over combined seasons 1 and 2. In season 1, the efficacy against RSV-associated LRTI was 82.6% (95% CI: 57.9; 94.1) and 87.5% (95% CI: 58.9; 97.6) against RSV-associated medically attended LRTI. In the season 2, the efficacy against RSV-associated LRTD was 56.1% (95% CI: 28.2; 74.4). Both vaccines demonstrated similar efficacies in adults ≥ 75 years as well as those with comorbidities. Concerns emerged regarding certain side effects, such as Guillain–Barré syndrome and atrial fibrillation, observed postvaccination in trials of both vaccines. Based on the safety and efficacy data as well as current disease burden data, the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended single dose of RSV vaccine in adults ≥ 60 years based on shared clinical decision-making considering individual risk factors, health status, and preferences. The ACIP estimates that in the US alone, every one million vaccine doses given over two seasons would prevent 41 000–44 000 outpatient visits, 3190 to 3460 hospitalisations and 155 to 167 deaths in adults ≥ 60 years of age. In the UK, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has recommended a single dose of RSV vaccine in all adults ≥ 75 years. These developments, along with the promising efficacy of mRNA-1345 against RSV-related LRTI, represent an exciting opening chapter in RSV prevention for the elderly.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116DQohh]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccination — people with HIV: For people with HIV, offer a single RSV vaccine (Abrysvo, Arexvy, or mRESVIA) to individuals aged ≥ 75 years and those aged 60 to 74 years with qualifying comorbid conditions (CIII). Individuals aged 60 to 74 years with HIV and CD4 < 200 cells/mm3 are eligible for RSV vaccination, although the vaccines have not been studied in this population, and many clinicians may choose to wait for immune reconstitution prior to administering the vaccine (CIII). Optimally, vaccination should occur before the onset of the fall and winter RSV season. For pregnant women with HIV, administer a single RSV vaccine (Abrysvo) between 32 to 36 weeks gestation with seasonal administration during September through January in most of the continental United States (CIII); the adjuvanted vaccine, Arexvy, and the mRNA vaccine, mRESVIA, have not been studied in pregnancy and should not be used as an alternative. In locations where seasonality differs from the continental United States, providers should follow local guidance on timing. These recommendations are aligned with ACIP guidance for the general population, and ACIP recommended that adults aged ≥ 75 years and adults aged 60 to 74 years with comorbid conditions receive a single dose; ACIP and the American College of Gynecology recommended seasonal administration during weeks 32 through 36 of pregnancy, ideally at least 14 days before delivery.

### Noninferior immunogenicity and consistent safety of respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F protein vaccine in adults 50–59 years compared to ≥ 60 years of age [^114CmLtR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Several solicited AEs were reported at higher rates in 50–59-year-olds than in those aged 60 years and older. Higher vaccine reactogenicity in younger versus older adults was not unexpected as it has been observed with other vaccines. However, symptoms were transient, and incidences of grade 3 reactions were similarly low among 50–59-year-olds and those aged 60 years and older. The rates of unsolicited AEs, SAEs, and pIMDs were balanced between study groups. Hence, the overall safety profile in adults aged 50–59 years was consistent with the known safety profile in those aged 60 years and older.

Respiratory syncytial virus poses a significant burden in 50–59-year-olds, with increased hospitalization rates and a greater use of medical resources among those with underlying medical conditions. Respiratory syncytial virus can also compromise the quality of life in this population, leading to an impairment in daily functioning. Considering that a substantial proportion of adults aged 50–59 years are living with conditions that increase the risk for RSV disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or diabetes, an effective vaccine in this population could help decrease the total RSV burden.

### Noninferior immunogenicity and consistent safety of respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F protein vaccine in adults 50–59 years compared to ≥ 60 years of age [^115S7WRb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

A strength of our study was the inclusion of several internal control groups: a non-AIR subcohort of 50–59-year-olds, placebo groups for both the 50–59-AIR and 50–59-non-AIR subcohorts, and a cohort of participants aged 60 years and older that was similar to the population in which efficacy was demonstrated. Including these in the same study allowed us to control for possible differences in seasonality or regionality in RSV epidemiology. Another strength was the heterogenous study population from different geographic areas, providing good external validity.

Our study has some limitations. There was no surveillance for RSV-LRTD, and as there is no established correlate of protection against RSV, we do not have direct evidence for efficacy in 50–59-year-olds. However, the high efficacy previously demonstrated in those aged 60 years and older, including in those with chronic conditions associated with an increased risk for RSV disease, together with the comparable immune response observed in this study are highly suggestive of the vaccine being efficacious in adults aged 50–59 years with or without the predefined chronic conditions. Additional limitations are the inclusion of participants with stable chronic conditions only and the exclusion of adults with immunocompromising conditions, who also have an increased risk for severe RSV outcomes. Also, some conditions that may increase the risk for RSV disease (eg, neurological or neuromuscular disorders) were not specifically selected in the AIR subcohort or excluded from the non-AIR subcohort. Finally, the primary objective of our study was to demonstrate noninferiority comparing the 50–59-RSV groups with the ≥ 60-RSV group; the study was not designed to show differences in immune responses between all of the study groups. Neither was it powered to identify rare AEs following vaccination.

In summary, this study demonstrated that RSVPreF3 OA was at least as immunogenic in adults aged 50–59 years (with or without increased risk for RSV disease) as in those aged 60 years and older, and showed that RSVPreF3 OA had an acceptable safety profile in 50–59-year-olds consistent with that in those aged 60 years and older. Together with the previously demonstrated efficacy in the older age group, these results suggest that RSVPreF3 OA could provide a substantial clinical benefit to 50–59-year-olds and help address the unmet medical need in this population.

DISCUSSION

RSV is an important respiratory pathogen both in older adults and in adults < 60 years of age, particularly those with risk factors for severe disease. A global meta-analysis including data predominantly from Europe, North America, and Australasia reported that among adults ≥ 18 years of age with comorbidities, RSV caused 7.03% (95% CI: 5.18–9.48) of symptomatic respiratory infections in annual studies and 7.69% (95% CI: 6.23–9.46) in seasonal studies. Adults with cardiovascular and respiratory comorbidities have a substantially higher risk of RSV-associated hospitalization compared with those without. In a German study from 2015–2018, patients 18–59 years of age with risk factors (including congestive heart failure [CHF], arrhythmia, ischemic heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]) were 3.3–6.2 times more likely to be hospitalized due to RSV than those without. A US study from 2017–2020 reported that in patients < 60 years of age with CHF, RSV-associated hospitalization rates were 13–33 times those without, whereas other conditions (including asthma, COPD, and diabetes mellitus) also substantially increased the risk of hospitalization. Collectively, these data highlight the important unmet need to prevent RSV illness in adults < 60 years of age with risk factors who are currently not eligible for vaccinations against RSV.

RESULTS

Trial Population

Between May 2021 and January 2022, 26 664 adults aged ≥ 60 years old were enrolled in the trial, of whom 24 966 were part of the exposed population (12 467 received RSVPreF3 OA and 12 499 received placebo) (Figure 1). Of these, more than 95.0% of participants in both groups had at least 1 coexisting general medical condition (Table 1). The most common conditions were vascular hypertensive disorders (57.2% of all participants in the exposed population), osteoarthropathies (33.5%), elevated cholesterol (24.8%), and diabetes mellitus (22.9%) (Supplementary Table 1). In total, 39.6% (RSVPreF3 OA) and 38.9% (placebo) of participants had at least 1 of the coexisting medical conditions of interest (i.e. associated with severe RSV disease); 20.0% and 19.4% had at least 1 cardiorespiratory condition of interest, and 25.7% and 25.9% had at least 1 endocrine or metabolic condition of interest (mostly diabetes; Table 1). The mean body mass index in both groups was 29.1 kg/m 2. Other baseline characteristics were also balanced between groups (Table 1 and shown previously).

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in older adults: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2023 [^114mGq12]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale for Recommendations

Vaccination with a single dose of the GSK or Pfizer RSV vaccines demonstrated moderate to high efficacy in preventing symptomatic RSV-associated LRTD over two consecutive RSV seasons among adults aged ≥ 60 years. Although trials were underpowered to estimate efficacy against RSV-associated hospitalization and death, prevention of LRTD, including medically attended LRTD, suggests that vaccination might prevent considerable morbidity from RSV disease among adults aged ≥ 60 years.

Although both vaccines were generally well-tolerated with an acceptable safety profile, six cases of inflammatory neurologic events (including GBS, ADEM, and others) were reported after RSV vaccination in clinical trials. Whether these events occurred due to chance, or whether RSV vaccination increases the risk for inflammatory neurologic events is currently unknown. Until additional evidence becomes available from postmarketing surveillance clarifying the existence of any potential risk, RSV vaccination in older adults should be targeted to those who are at highest risk for severe RSV disease and therefore most likely to benefit from vaccination. The recommendation for shared clinical decision-making is intended to allow flexibility for providers and patients to consider individual risk for RSV disease, while taking into account patient preferences.

### The annual economic burden of respiratory syncytial virus in adults in the United States [^1173zSag]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Additional analyses were conducted to assess the societal economic and health burden of RSV-associated hospitalization in adults aged 50 to 59 years and adults aged 18 to 49 years with potential underlying RSV risk factors. While estimated hospitalizations were lower in those aged 50 to 59 years (20 750) than estimates for older adults in this study (39 140 in ages 60–64 years, 34 530 in ages 65–69 years, 59 740 in ages 70–79 years, and 39 800 in ages ≥ 80 years), the $1.1 billion economic burden due to RSV hospitalization in adults aged 50 to 59 years added considerably to the total burden of costs in older adults. Among adults aged 18 to 49 years with potential RSV factors (asthma, CAD, COPD, CHF, diabetes, obesity), the burden per person was the highest in adults with CHF ($153 400 per 1000 people), followed by diabetes ($48 000 per 1000 people) and COPD ($22 100 per person). This substantially higher burden in those with CHF is aligned with studies showing that individuals with CHF are more likely to have longer hospital stays and more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit due to RSV infection. The risk factors for severe RSV disease have not been comprehensively studied, and identifying groups at risk may assist decision makers to assess which individuals will benefit the most from recently approved RSV vaccines. The estimates from the current study also reveal increased economic burden in older individuals at high risk of severe outcomes from RSV disease, reinforcing the need for safe and effective immunization programs in these subpopulations.

### The annual economic burden of respiratory syncytial virus in adults in the United States [^117URpUU]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common and highly infectious respiratory virus that can cause severe disease in older adults and adults with underlying comorbidities (eg, chronic lung and heart disease), leading to an exacerbation of chronic illness, hospitalization, and in some cases, death. A recent meta-analysis estimated that 5.2 million cases of RSV-associated acute respiratory infection occur in high-income countries annually, with approximately 302 000 to 720 000 hospitalizations and 16 000 to 67 000 deaths during hospitalizations among adults aged ≥ 60 years. A subset of older adults hospitalized for RSV require a higher level of care after hospitalization. As the global population ages, the morbidity and mortality associated with respiratory infections such as RSV are expected to steadily increase. While the risk factors for severe RSV are less studied relative to other common respiratory viruses, available evidence suggests that adults of all ages with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), asthma, or diabetes may be at increased risk of developing RSV that results in hospitalization.

### Noninferior immunogenicity and consistent safety of respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F protein vaccine in adults 50–59 years compared to ≥ 60 years of age [^116miiFe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

(See the Editorial Commentary by Branche on pages 1099–101; Major Article by Clark et al. on pages 1088–98.)

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of acute respiratory illness. Older adults and individuals with certain underlying medical conditions (eg, chronic pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and chronic renal and liver diseases) are at increased risk of severe outcomes for RSV infection compared to younger adults and those without these conditions.

To help reduce the RSV burden in older adults, an adjuvanted RSV prefusion F protein–based vaccine (RSVPreF3 OA, Arexvy; GSK) was developed. This vaccine had an efficacy of 82.6% (96.95% confidence interval [CI]: 57.9–94.1%) against RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease [RSV-LRTD] and 94.1% (95% CI: 62.4–99.9%) against severe RSV-LRTD over 1 RSV season in individuals aged 60 years and older, and had sustained efficacy over 2 seasons. High efficacy was also shown among those aged 60 years and older with 1 or more chronic conditions that increase the risk for RSV disease (94.6% [95% CI: 65.9–99.9%] against RSV-LRTD over 1 season). RSVPreF3 OA and another RSV prefusion F-based vaccine were the first 2 vaccines approved for the prevention of RSV-LRTD in those aged 60 years and older.

Respiratory syncytial virus–associated illness also causes significant morbidity in adults younger than 60 years, especially in those with the aforementioned chronic medical conditions. Individuals aged 50–59 years also report a substantial impact of RSV disease on the quality of life, including on productivity, social activities, and emotional and physical functioning. However, to date, no RSV vaccine has been studied or approved in 50–59-year-olds. We therefore evaluated the immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety of RSVPreF3 OA in adults aged 50–59 years, including those with chronic medical conditions leading to an increased risk for RSV disease. The study aimed to demonstrate noninferiority of the humoral immune response in this population compared to adults aged 60 years and older, the population for which RSVPreF3 OA efficacy has been demonstrated. Figure 1 summarizes the study findings in plain language.

### Use of hepatitis B vaccination for adults with diabetes mellitus: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^114JGg54]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2011). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes acute and chronic infection of the liver leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. In the United States, since 1996, a total of 29 outbreaks of HBV infection in one or multiple long-term-care (LTC) facilities, including nursing homes and assisted-living facilities, were reported to CDC; of these, 25 involved adults with diabetes receiving assisted blood glucose monitoring. These outbreaks prompted the Hepatitis Vaccines Work Group of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to evaluate the risk for HBV infection among all adults with diagnosed diabetes. The Work Group reviewed HBV infection-related morbidity and mortality and the effectiveness of implementing infection prevention and control measures. The strength of scientific evidence regarding protection was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, * and safety, values, and cost-effectiveness were incorporated into a recommendation using the GRADE system. Based on the Work Group findings, on October 25, 2011, ACIP recommended that all previously unvaccinated adults aged 19 through 59 years with diabetes mellitus (type 1 and type 2) be vaccinated against hepatitis B as soon as possible after a diagnosis of diabetes is made (recommendation category A). Data on the risk for hepatitis B among adults aged ≥ 60 years are less robust. Therefore, ACIP recommended that unvaccinated adults aged ≥ 60 years with diabetes may be vaccinated at the discretion of the treating clinician after assessing their risk and the likelihood of an adequate immune response to vaccination (recommendation category B). This report summarizes these recommendations and provides the rationale used by ACIP to inform their decision making.

Introduction

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes substantial morbidity and mortality in older adults, resulting in approximately 60,000–160,000 hospitalizations and 6,000–10,000 deaths annually among adults aged ≥ 65 years. In May 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved two RSV vaccines for prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease in adults aged ≥ 60 years. * In June 2023, CDC recommended RSV vaccination for adults aged ≥ 60 years using shared clinical decision-making between patient and clinicians; † adults at highest risk for severe RSV disease are most likely to benefit and should be prioritized for vaccination. To describe persons who experienced severe RSV disease requiring hospitalization, data from a large, geographically diverse surveillance system were analyzed to identify characteristics of adults aged ≥ 60 years hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection during the 2022–23 respiratory virus season.

### Residency in long-term care facilities: an important risk factor for respiratory syncytial virus hospitalization [^114jCL67]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a seasonal winter virus and a major cause of lower respiratory tract disease in older adults, resulting in approximately 60 000–160 000 hospitalizations and 6000–10 000 deaths in the United States annually among adults aged ≥ 65 years. Research and development of interventions to prevent disease in older and at-risk adults have been underway for several decades and in May 2023, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 2 new RSV vaccines for prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease in adults aged ≥ 60 years. Following FDA approval, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initially recommended RSV vaccination for adults aged ≥ 60 years using shared clinical decision making and further clarified guidance in June 2024 to recommend vaccinations for all adults aged ≥ 75 years and those aged 60–74 years at increased risk for severe RSV disease. Of critical importance, therefore, is to define clinical and demographic characteristics that increase the risk for severe RSV disease and identify the populations who will derive the greatest benefit from vaccine prevention.

Numerous studies have established older age as the most well-defined risk factor, such that the incidence of RSV-associated hospitalization increases significantly with each subsequent decade of life after 60 years. Other risk factors include preexisting chronic medical conditions including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF) and diabetes, and underlying frailty. Residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs), either skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) or assisted living (AL) facilities, represent an important intersection of these risk factors, encompassing older age, multimorbidity, and frailty. Although RSV was first recognized as an important pathogen in adult populations after being described as a cause of SNF outbreaks, data on incidence in adults living in LTCFs remain scarce and derived primarily from passive surveillance or retrospective analyses of national claims database.

To capture the full burden of RSV infection among adults, we conducted a prospective, active surveillance study over 3 winters and calculated the population-based incidence of RSV-associated hospitalization in older adults and those living in LTCFs in Rochester, New York.

### The disease burden of respiratory syncytial virus in older adults [^111SYjXn]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The prevalence and severity of RSV among older adults, particularly those aged 60 and over, are becoming increasingly recognized, with several studies highlighting its widespread nature both in industrialized and developing countries. The disease burden is likely to be comparable to seasonal influenza. The frail elderly and those with multimorbidities are at substantial risk of severe disease (including prolonged hospitalization) and death. As a result, RSV vaccines displaying efficacies of up to 94.1% with duration of protection extending at least two seasons offer hope. However, concerns about possible side effects require continued monitoring and rigorous research to ensure the safe and effective management of RSV among the older adults.

3 Results

Prior to matching, a total of 104,095 patient admissions due to RSV (n = 2558), influenza (n = 16,688), UTI (n = 73,587), or fracture (n = 11,262) were identified (Table S3). After matching, 2234, 2308, and 1612 matched pairs remained to compare RSV patients to influenza, UTI, and fracture patients, respectively (Table 1). Within the matched pairs (e.g. RSV vs. influenza), the mean age was 80 years, approximately 60% were women, and about half had received influenza vaccination. Approximately 7% of patients were considered highly frail, and the prevalence of comorbidities tended to be high, especially chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (~45%), dyslipidemia (~45%), diabetes (~40%), AF (~30%), asthma (~30%), and heart failure (~28%). These conditions tended to be much more prevalent in RSV patients compared to other patient groups prior to matching (Table S3). Descriptive statistics pre‐ and post‐matching for patients stratified based on the absence (Tables S4 and S5) or presence of pre‐existing cardiovascular conditions (Tables S6 and S7) are provided in the Supporting Informations.

### Patient-and community-level characteristics associated with respiratory syncytial virus vaccination [^111Cgv9o]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cross-sectional study of hospitalized adults, knowledge of RSV disease and RSV vaccine eligibility was low. Among unvaccinated patients during the 2023–2024 season, 41.7% reported being open to future RSV vaccination, indicating the opportunity to expand RSV disease prevention substantially. The updated RSV recommendations for all adults 75 years and older and those aged 60 to 74 years at increased risk of RSV disease simplify the previous SCDM recommendation. Ongoing monitoring in future RSV seasons is needed to determine whether simplified recommendations, increases in awareness of RSV disease and vaccine information, and expansion in access to primary prevention services will lead to improved RSV vaccination coverage among older adults at higher risk for severe disease.

### Multimorbidity profiles and severe in-hospital outcomes in adults with respiratory syncytial virus [^113kpTHL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Adults hospitalized with acute respiratory infections, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), often have multiple underlying conditions. Few data are available on the combined effect of conditions on risk of severe outcomes from RSV disease.

Methods

We enrolled adults hospitalized with RSV at 26 hospitals in 20 US states admitted January 2022-July 2024. Seventeen underlying conditions were selected after excluding those with rare prevalence (≤ 1%) or high pairwise correlation (≥ 0.7). We applied Bayesian profile regression to identify profiles of conditions associated with increased risk of RSV severe outcomes, stratifying among adults aged 18–59 and ≥ 60 years.

Results

We analyzed data from 1111 adults hospitalized with RSV (median age [IQR] = 66 [53–75]). Among 397 adults aged 18–59 years, two profiles were identified: (1) minimal prevalence with fewer underlying conditions and a posterior median ICU admission risk of 21% (95% credible interval = [16‒25]); (2) cardiorenal/diabetes with frequent heart failure, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and increased ICU admission risk (37% [27‒48]). Among 714 adults aged ≥ 60 years, four profiles were identified: (1) minimal prevalence (ICU admission risk = 22% [18‒26]), (2) cardiorenal/diabetes (27% [21‒34]), (3) hematologic malignancy and transplant receipt (12% [6‒21]), and (4) chronic pulmonary disease with home oxygen dependence (44% [25‒66]).

Conclusion

Distinct underlying condition profiles with varying risks of critical illness were observed among inpatients with RSV. These findings could support recognition of high-risk patients to inform RSV prevention strategies and suggest the role of multimorbidity in severe RSV disease risk warrants further attention.

### Bivalent RSVpreF vaccine in adults 18 to… [^112Zzu9A]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

After RSV infection, only a relatively short duration of natural immunity occurs, and management consists primarily of supportive care. The bivalent RSV prefusion F protein-based (RSVpreF) vaccine received regulatory approvals in adults ≥ 60 years old on the basis of efficacy and safety data from the pivotal phase 3 study, which demonstrated vaccine efficacy of 89% against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) with ≥ 3 signs or symptoms at the end of the first RSV season. RSVpreF is also approved for maternal immunization to protect infants from birth to 6 months old on the basis of efficacy and safety data from a pivotal study in pregnant individuals.

There is an important need to evaluate the ability of RSVpreF to protect adults < 60 years of age who are at high risk of severe RSV disease or complications from RSV disease, as well as immunocompromised adults. Adults with certain serious underlying chronic diseases, including cardiac, renal, and respiratory diseases, and diabetes mellitus, have elevated rates of RSV-associated illness, hospitalizations, and in-hospital fatalities compared with individuals without these conditions. The impact of RSV disease on this population is likely underestimated because of lack of systematic diagnostic systems and robust surveillance. Additionally, management of RSV disease in adults is currently supportive.

The pivotal phase 3 RENOIR study of RSVpreF enrolled participants ≥ 60 years of age who were healthy or had stable chronic medical conditions (adults < 60 years of age or those with immunocompromise were not included). Here we evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of RSVpreF in adults 18–59 years of age who are at high risk of severe RSV disease due to certain chronic medical conditions, including pulmonary, cardiovascular, and renal disease, and metabolic disorders, such as diabetes mellitus.

### Another shot to protect people with diabetes: add hepatitis B vaccination to the checklist [^113vvP6A]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

The average outpatient visit for an adult patient with diabetes involves numerous interventions and discussions: management of multiple medications; assessment of control of glycemia, blood pressure, and dyslipidemia; counseling regarding diet and exercise; screening for diabetes complications; and often assessment and management of other acute and chronic concerns. Now clinicians have another intervention for many of their adult patients with diabetes: the vaccination series for hepatitis B virus (HBV). Late last year, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that all previously unvaccinated adults with diabetes aged 19–60 years be vaccinated against HBV as soon as possible after a diagnosis of diabetes is made, and that vaccination be considered for those aged 60 and over, after assessing risk and likelihood of an adequate immune response.

HBV causes acute liver infection associated with substantial morbidity and occasionally mortality. Approximately 1 in 20 acute infections progresses to chronic infection that can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer; individuals with chronic HBV infection serve as a reservoir for ongoing transmission of the disease. Diabetes does not immediately come to mind as a risk factor for an infectious disease most commonly associated with high-risk sexual and drug-taking behaviors. However, at least 29 outbreaks of HBV in long-term care facilities and hospitals have been reported to the CDC, with the majority involving adults with diabetes receiving "assisted blood glucose monitoring", in which such monitoring is done by a health care professional with responsibility for more than one patient. HBV is highly transmissible and stable for long periods of time on surfaces such as lancing devices and blood glucose meters, even when no blood is visible. Blood sufficient to transmit the virus has also been found in the reservoirs of insulin pens, resulting in warnings against sharing such devices between patients. HBV outbreaks related to assisted blood glucose monitoring and shared insulin pens, while dramatic, have involved few people with diabetes compared with the 19 million adults with diagnosed diabetes in the U.S. and should be entirely preventable with adequate infection control procedures. Why, then, did ACIP recommend vaccination for all adults with diabetes up to age 60 (and issue a permissive recommendation for older adults, who would be most likely to need long-term care)?

### Safety and immunogenicity of respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F protein vaccine when Co-administered with adjuvanted seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccine in older adults: a phase 3 randomized trial [^114uFhpj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

(See the Major Article by Ferguson et al. on pages 1074–84; Editorial Commentary by Branche on pages 1099–101.)

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of acute respiratory illness. In addition to infants, people of advanced age and those with certain underlying medical conditions (eg, heart or lung disease and diabetes) are at increased risk for severe RSV disease. The adjuvanted RSV prefusion F protein-based vaccine (RSVPreF3 OA, Arexvy, GSK) demonstrated efficacy against RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease, was immunogenic, and had an acceptable safety profile in adults ≥ 60 years old.

Older adults and people with diabetes, cardiopulmonary and other chronic conditions are also at increased risk of severe outcomes and complications of influenza. Due to immunosenescence, influenza vaccines are often less effective in ≥ 65-year-olds than in younger people. High-dose and adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines have been shown to improve effectiveness compared to conventional vaccines and are therefore recommended in older adults.

Influenza and RSV viruses co-circulate, and in regions with temperate climates, seasonal epidemics of both viruses occur mainly during winter months. In these regions, seasonal influenza vaccination is therefore typically offered in early autumn, which is when RSV vaccination may also be recommended. Co-administration of influenza and RSV vaccines during a single consultation could help protect older adults against both infections, while reducing the number of doctor's appointments, improving convenience, and thereby increasing vaccination coverage. However, for co-administration of 2 vaccines to be recommended, it should not impact the immunogenicity and safety of either vaccine.

Co-administration of RSVPreF3 OA with non-adjuvanted (conventional and high-dose) seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccines was recently evaluated. The current study assessed the immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety of co-administration versus sequential administration of RSVPreF3 OA and the adjuvanted inactivated seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccine (FLU-aQIV, Fluad Tetra/FLUAD QUADRIVALENT/Fluad Quad, Seqirus) in adults aged ≥ 65 years.

### Influenza, updated COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus vaccination coverage among adults-United States, fall 2023 [^11144baj]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) typically circulate in the United States during the fall through early spring each year, causing epidemics of respiratory illness, although patterns of influenza and RSV transmission shifted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain groups, including older adults (those aged ≥ 65 years), persons with chronic conditions, and racial and ethnic minority populations, have experienced disproportionate influenza-, COVID-19–, and RSV-associated morbidity and mortality. Since 2010, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended routine annual influenza vaccination for all persons aged ≥ 6 months who do not have contraindications. On September 12, 2023, ACIP recommended updated 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccination for all persons aged ≥ 6 months to help protect against currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. In June 2023, ACIP recommended that adults aged ≥ 60 years may receive a single dose of RSV vaccine, using shared clinical decision-making, which is the first time a vaccine for prevention of RSV-associated respiratory disease has been recommended *. CDC monitors coverage with these vaccines and makes these data available during the respiratory season for use in planning vaccination activities.

### Respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F protein vaccine is efficacious in older adults with underlying medical conditions [^116dexZo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This large, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicountry, phase 3 trial enrolled a diverse population of adults aged ≥ 60 years, with age-related medical conditions representative of those occurring in the general older adult population. More than 95% of participants had at least 1 coexisting general medical condition, and nearly 40% had at least 1 of the selected coexisting cardiorespiratory or endocrine and metabolic conditions associated with an increased risk of severe RSV disease. The efficacy of RSVPreF3 OA in preventing RSV-LRTD and RSV-ARI during 1 RSV season remained high in participants with at least 1 of these conditions of interest (94.6% for RSV-LRTD, 81.0% for RSV-ARI), at least 1 cardiorespiratory condition (92.1% for RSV-LRTD, 88.1% for RSV-ARI), at least 1 endocrine or metabolic condition (100% for RSV-LRTD, 79.4% for RSV-ARI), and at least 2 conditions of interest (92.0% for RSV-LRTD, 88.0% for RSV-ARI). Consistent with the high efficacy, RSVPreF3 OA elicited humoral immune responses in older adults with these medical conditions that were at least as high as immune responses in those without these conditions.

Older adults with chronic medical conditions have been shown to have a higher risk of symptomatic RSV-ARI, of requiring medically attended visits, and of progressing to severe disease. In our trial, we indeed observed higher background incidence rates of both RSV-ARI (up to 36% higher) and RSV-LRTD (up to 68% higher) among participants with 1 or more of the cardiorespiratory or endocrine and metabolic conditions of interest compared with those without any of these conditions. Considering the high efficacy of RSVPreF3 OA in older adults with coexisting medical conditions of interest observed in our trial, and the disproportionate contribution to the total RSV burden borne by this population, RSVPreF3 OA vaccination of this at-risk group could have a substantial impact on public health. The high efficacy against RSV-LRTD (87.5%) and RSV-ARI (79.0%) episodes with medically attended visits in our trial (Supplementary results) suggests that the vaccine could reduce the number of RSV-related medical visits and lower the burden on healthcare systems.

Introduction

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is a leading cause of severe acute respiratory disease in older adults and adults with underlying comorbiditiesand may also result in long-term sequelae and trigger cardiac events. Among US adults aged 65 years and older, approximately 160 000 RSV-related acute respiratory infection (ARI) hospitalizations and 120 000 emergency department (ED) visits are estimated to occur annually.

On June 21, 2023, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended persons aged 60 years and older may receive a single dose of a vaccine licensed to prevent RSV lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) using shared clinical decision-making, citing in part lack of vaccine effectiveness (VE) data from the phase 3 pivotal trials regarding RSV-related hospitalizations and among high risk groups. We evaluated, in a large US health care network, Respiratory Syncytial Virus Prefusion F (RSVpreF) effectiveness against RSV-related LRTD inpatient or ED visit.

1 Introduction

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of acute respiratory illness in adults and has significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs in the United States. The clinical and economic burdens are even greater for older adults because increased age and underlying comorbidities are major risk factors for RSV‐associated illness. RSV‐associated hospitalization rates more than double from age 65–74 years to ages ≥ 75 years. In 2023, there were an estimated 225,000 RSV‐associated hospitalizations and 20,000 deaths annually among US adults ≥ 65 years. For older adults, certain comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease, pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, and obesity confer even higher risk for severe RSV outcomes. The annual economic burden was equally staggering, with an estimated $5.5 billion in hospitalization costs in US adults ≥ 65 years.

Despite significant morbidity, mortality, and economic burden of RSV in older adults, it remains underdiagnosed and primarily managed with supportive care. The US Food and Drug Administration approval of two RSV vaccines for older adults in 2023, Arexvy (GSK) and Abrysvo (Pfizer), provided a much‐needed preventive tool. A single dose of either vaccine demonstrated moderate to high efficacy in preventing symptomatic RSV‐associated lower respiratory tract disease. These vaccines were recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for adults aged ≥ 60 years under a shared clinical decision‐making (SCDM) framework in advance of the 2023–2024 respiratory season.

Vaccine implementation, particularly for older adults, presents unique challenges. Uptake can be influenced by various factors including vaccine availability, healthcare provider recommendations, patient perceptions, convenience, and location of getting the vaccine, and the ability to receive more than one vaccine in a single visit. Although the CDC currently tracks RSV vaccination coverage through data sources such as IQVIA and the National Immunization Survey, they are limited in their ability to stratify data by key factors like specific comorbidities. Early assessment suggested some heterogeneity in vaccine uptake within the recommended population, but a comprehensive national view by defined factors has yet to be documented.

### Characteristics and outcomes among adults aged ≥ 60 years hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed respiratory syncytial virus-RSV-NET, 12 States, July 2022-June 2023 [^11597Zgk]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes substantial morbidity and mortality in older adults. In May 2023, two RSV vaccines were approved for prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease in adults aged ≥ 60 years. In June 2023, CDC recommended RSV vaccination for adults aged ≥ 60 years, using shared clinical decision-making. Using data from the Respiratory Syncytial Virus-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network, a population-based hospitalization surveillance system operating in 12 states, this analysis examined characteristics (including age, underlying medical conditions, and clinical outcomes) of 3,218 adults aged ≥ 60 years who were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection during July 2022-June 2023. Among a random sample of 1,634 older adult patients with RSV-associated hospitalization, 54.1% were aged ≥ 75 years, and the most common underlying medical conditions were obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, and diabetes. Severe outcomes occurred in 18.5% (95% CI = 15.9%-21.2%) of hospitalized patients aged ≥ 60 years. Overall, 17.0% (95% CI = 14.5%-19.7%) of patients with RSV infection were admitted to an intensive care unit, 4.8% (95% CI = 3.5%-6.3%) required mechanical ventilation, and 4.7% (95% CI = 3.6%-6.1%) died; 17.2% (95% CI = 14.9%-19.8%) of all cases occurred in long-term care facility residents. These data highlight the importance of prioritizing those at highest risk for severe RSV disease and suggest that clinicians and patients consider age (particularly age ≥ 75 years), long-term care facility residence, and underlying medical conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure, in shared clinical decision-making when offering RSV vaccine to adults aged ≥ 60 years.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in adults aged ≥ 60 years: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2024 [^112qndgU]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of respiratory illness and hospitalization in older adults during fall and winter in the United States. The 2023–2024 RSV season was the first during which RSV vaccination was recommended for U.S. adults aged ≥ 60 years, using shared clinical decision-making. On June 26, 2024, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted to update this recommendation as follows: a single dose of any Food and Drug Administration-approved RSV vaccine (Arexvy [GSK]; Abrysvo [Pfizer]; or mResvia [Moderna]) is now recommended for all adults aged ≥ 75 years and for adults aged 60–74 years who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease. Adults who have previously received RSV vaccine should not receive another dose. This report summarizes the evidence considered for these updated recommendations, including postlicensure data on vaccine effectiveness and safety, and provides clinical guidance for the use of RSV vaccines in adults aged ≥ 60 years. These updated recommendations are intended to maximize RSV vaccination coverage among persons most likely to benefit, by clarifying who is at highest risk and by reducing implementation barriers associated with the previous shared clinical decision-making recommendation. Continued postlicensure monitoring will guide future recommendations.

### Efficacy and safety of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prefusion F protein vaccine (RSVPreF3 OA) in older adults over 2 RSV seasons [^115Qx3Pt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a contagious pathogen that causes seasonal epidemics of acute respiratory illness (ARI). RSV infection does not confer robust long-term immunity, and reinfections are common throughout life. While infection typically causes mild symptoms in adults, older adults and those with certain chronic conditions (like cardiorespiratory diseases or diabetes) are at increased risk of severe lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD), hospitalization, cardiorespiratory complications, and death due to RSV.

Two vaccines — both based on RSV fusion protein (F) stabilized in its prefusion conformation — have recently been authorized to prevent RSV-LRTD in individuals aged 60 years and older. The ongoing AReSVi-006 trial, which studies 1 of these vaccines (RSVPreF3 OA; Arexvy; GSK), showed that RSVPreF3 OA had an acceptable safety profile and high efficacy against RSV-LRTD (82.6%), severe RSV-LRTD (94.1%), and RSV-ARI (71.7%) over 1 RSV season. Efficacy was observed in different age groups and in participants with co-existing medical conditions.

The AReSVi-006 trial also investigates RSVPreF3 OA efficacy and safety over multiple RSV seasons. We report the efficacy and safety over 2 seasons of 1 RSVPreF3 OA dose and of a first dose followed by revaccination 1 year later.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in older adults: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2023 [^113mC1rg]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a cause of severe respiratory illness in older adults. In May 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first vaccines for prevention of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease in adults aged ≥ 60 years. Since May 2022, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccines Adult Work Group met at least monthly to review available evidence regarding the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of these vaccines among adults aged ≥ 60 years. On June 21, 2023, ACIP voted to recommend that adults aged ≥ 60 years may receive a single dose of an RSV vaccine, using shared clinical decision-making. This report summarizes the body of evidence considered for this recommendation and provides clinical guidance for the use of RSV vaccines in adults aged ≥ 60 years. RSV vaccines have demonstrated moderate to high efficacy in preventing RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease and have the potential to prevent substantial morbidity and mortality among older adults; postmarketing surveillance will direct future guidance.

### Incidence of respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospitalization among adults in Ontario, Canada, 2017–2019 [^113RcbZo]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

As observed in our cohort, RSV hospitalization frequently occurs among adults with preexisting conditions. We found a higher incidence in those with each comorbidity compared to those without underlying conditions, a trend well documented in recent literature. Similar to our findings, a study conducted in the United States from 2017 to 2020 found that among adults aged ≥ 18 years hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed RSV, incidence rates in patients with asthma, diabetes, and COPD were 2.0–3.6, 2.4–11.4, and 3.2–13.4 times the incidence compared to those without each respective comorbidity; IRR estimates in the current study are likely higher due to use of a reference group that had no identified comorbidities. A separate US study further found CKD (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 4.4; P < .001), HF (aOR = 2.1; P < .001), and stroke (aOR = 2.0; p = 0.045) to be significant predictors of hospitalization among adults with RSV; these 3 comorbidities were associated with substantially higher incidence in our study. Although dementia was one of the highest risk conditions in our study, it has not been as commonly explored as other comorbidities. Further research clarifying which conditions contribute to the highest risk of severe RSV-related disease will be helpful to inform recommendations. As comorbidities also typically increase in prevalence with age, and approximately 96% of our study population had at least 1 comorbidity identified, we evaluated the incidence of RSV-associated hospitalization by number of comorbidities. Our results demonstrate that the accumulation of conditions is also associated with much higher incidence across all ages.

### Phase 1 / 2 randomized study of the immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of a respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F vaccine in adults with concomitant inactivated influenza vaccine [^11689o87]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of severe lower respiratory disease in infants and young children and an important respiratory pathogen in older adults. In adults older than 65 years in the United States, attack rates are 3%–7%, and RSV is associated with approximately 177 000 hospitalizations and 14 000 deaths annually. However, disease burden in older adults is likely underestimated due to lack of standard RSV testing practices and lower viral shedding compared with infant RSV disease.

Immunity to RSV is incomplete, with reinfection throughout life despite the presence of relatively high serum RSV neutralization titers. Several risk factors for serious disease have been identified, including older age and comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, stroke, chronic kidney disease, and immunosuppression. Poor protection against reinfection and risk of severe disease in older adults are likely associated with age-related changes in T-cell responses and effector memory to the virus. Despite no known correlate of immunity among older adults, limited data associate higher serum RSV neutralization titers with less severe disease, and low serum and nasal RSV antibodies are associated with increased risk. Currently, RSV disease management in adults is limited to supportive measures. Antiviral approaches have proven unsuccessful in natural infection. Vaccination remains a high priority.

### Respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F protein vaccine is efficacious in older adults with underlying medical conditions [^114YUd5B]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Older adults with chronic cardiorespiratory or endocrine/metabolic conditions are at increased risk of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-related acute respiratory illness (RSV-ARI) and severe respiratory disease. In an ongoing, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicountry, phase 3 trial in ≥ 60-year-old participants, an AS01E-adjuvanted RSV prefusion F protein-based vaccine (RSVPreF3 OA) was efficacious against RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease (RSV-LRTD), severe RSV-LRTD, and RSV-ARI. We evaluated efficacy and immunogenicity among participants with coexisting cardiorespiratory or endocrine/metabolic conditions that increase the risk of severe RSV disease ("conditions of interest").

Methods

Medically stable ≥ 60-year-old participants received 1 dose of RSVPreF3 OA or placebo. Efficacy against first RSV-LRTD and RSV-ARI episodes was assessed in subgroups with/without coexisting cardiorespiratory or endocrine/metabolic conditions of interest. Immunogenicity was analyzed post hoc in these subgroups.

Results

In total, 12 467 participants received RSVPreF3 OA and 12 499 received placebo. Of these, 39.6% (RSVPreF3 OA) and 38.9% (placebo) had ≥ 1 coexisting condition of interest. The median efficacy follow-up was 6.7 months. Efficacy against RSV-LRTD was high in participants with ≥ 1 condition of interest (94.6%), ≥ 1 cardiorespiratory (92.1%), ≥ 1 endocrine/metabolic (100%), and ≥ 2 conditions of interest (92.0%). Efficacy against RSV-ARI was 81.0% in participants with ≥ 1 condition of interest (88.1% for cardiorespiratory, 79.4% for endocrine/metabolic conditions) and 88.0% in participants with ≥ 2 conditions of interest. Postvaccination neutralizing titers were at least as high in participants with ≥ 1 condition of interest as in those without.

Conclusions

RSVPreF3 OA was efficacious against RSV-LRTD and RSV-ARI in older adults with coexisting medical conditions associated with an increased risk of severe RSV disease.

### 2025 concise clinical guidance: an ACC expert consensus statement on adult immunizations as part of cardiovascular care: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^117QpjVU]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccination — burden, products, effectiveness, safety, and adult recommendations are outlined. RSV causes substantial illness and mortality in older adults, resulting in an estimated 60,000 to 160,000 hospitalizations and 6,000 to 10,000 deaths annually among adults aged ≥ 65 years, and increased risk for severe RSV disease is associated with conditions including congestive heart failure (HF), coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and residence in long-term care facilities. As of June 2025, 2 subunit protein RSV vaccines are licensed for adults aged ≥ 50 years and a third mRNA vaccine is approved for adults aged ≥ 60 years, with FDA review for use in adults aged < 60 years. The effectiveness of the 3 RSV vaccines is about 80% during the first year, diminishing during the next year to approximately 70%. The 2 protein subunit vaccines have been associated with a small increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome during the 42 days after vaccination (7–9 cases/million doses), which has not been seen with the mRNA vaccine. Current national recommendations are: all adults aged ≥ 75 years who have not yet received the RSV vaccine and adults aged 50–74 years who have chronic medical conditions; the RSV vaccine is not currently recommended as an annual vaccine, and guidance on reimmunization is pending.

### Respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F protein vaccine in older adults [^1139Su1S]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of acute respiratory infection, lower respiratory tract disease, clinical complications, and death in older adults. There is currently no licensed vaccine against RSV infection.

Methods

In an ongoing, international, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, adults 60 years of age or older to receive a single dose of an AS01 E -adjuvanted RSV prefusion F protein-based candidate vaccine (RSVPreF3 OA) or placebo before the RSV season. The primary objective was to show vaccine efficacy of one dose of the RSVPreF3 OA vaccine against RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease, confirmed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), during one RSV season. The criterion for meeting the primary objective was a lower limit of the confidence interval around the efficacy estimate of more than 20%. Efficacy against severe RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease and RSV-related acute respiratory infection was assessed, and analyses according to RSV subtype (A and B) were performed. Safety was evaluated.

Results

A total of 24,966 participants received one dose of the RSVPreF3 OA vaccine (12,467 participants) or placebo (12,499). Over a median follow-up of 6.7 months, vaccine efficacy against RT-PCR-confirmed RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease was 82.6% (96.95% confidence interval [CI] 57.9 to 94.1), with 7 cases (1.0 per 1000 participant-years) in the vaccine group and 40 cases (5.8 per 1000 participant-years) in the placebo group. Vaccine efficacy was 94.1% (95% CI, 62.4 to 99.9) against severe RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease (assessed on the basis of clinical signs or by the investigator) and 71.7% (95% CI, 56.2 to 82.3) against RSV-related acute respiratory infection. Vaccine efficacy was similar against the RSV A and B subtypes (for RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease: 84.6% and 80.9%, respectively; for RSV-related acute respiratory infection: 71.9% and 70.6%, respectively). High vaccine efficacy was observed in various age groups and in participants with coexisting conditions. The RSVPreF3 OA vaccine was more reactogenic than placebo, but most adverse events for which reports were solicited were transient, with mild-to-moderate severity. The incidences of serious adverse events and potential immune-mediated diseases were similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

A single dose of the RSVPreF3 OA vaccine had an acceptable safety profile and prevented RSV-related acute respiratory infection and lower respiratory tract disease and severe RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease in adults 60 years of age or older, regardless of RSV subtype and the presence of underlying coexisting conditions.

- Severe obesity
- Moderate or severe immune compromise
- Residence in a nursing home
- Other chronic medical conditions or risk factors that a healthcare provider determines would increase the risk for severe disease due to viral respiratory infection (e.g., frailty. Effectiveness GSK's Arexvy In studies of the real-world effectiveness of Arexvy during the 2023–2024 RSV season, the first since licensure of Arexvy, Arexvy was approximately 77% effective in preventing RSV-associated emergency department encounters and 83% effective in preventing RSV-associated hospitalizations in adults 60 and older. In addition, effectiveness was demonstrated among adults ages 60 years or older with certain immunocompromising conditions and those with end-stage renal disease and in all adults 75 years or older.

Moderna's mResvia Due to the recency of mResvia licensure, real-world vaccine effectiveness against RSV-associated hospitalization and other severe illness cannot yet be estimated. Vaccine efficacy data are available from one large phase 2/3 randomized, blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial in participants ages 60 and older. In this trial, efficacy of a single dose of mResvia against symptomatic RSV was approximately 80% during the first 4 months following vaccination and approximately 56% during the first 12 months after vaccination. CDC will continue to monitor real-world RSV vaccine effectiveness during each respiratory virus season.

### RSV vaccination for adults 60 years of age and over… [^112uEFXw]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Healthcare Providers: RSV Vaccination for Adults Types and composition of RSV vaccines There are three RSV vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug Administration for use in adults. CDC recommends RSV vaccination for all adults ages 75 and older and for adults ages 50–74 who are at increased risk of severe RSV. GSK's Arexvy consists of a recombinant RSV F protein antigen, stabilized in the prefusion conformation, and AS01. Pfizer's Abrysvo consists of a recombinant RSV F protein antigen, stabilized in the prefusion conformation. The vaccine is supplied as a single-dose vial of 120 μg of lyophilized preF antigen component to be reconstituted with the accompanying vial of sterile water diluent component. Moderna's mResvia consists of a single 0.

5 mL-dose vial containing 50 μg of nucleoside modified mRNA encoding the RSV F glycoprotein, stabilized in the prefusion conformation. Consult the package insert for proper storage and handling details, shelf life, and more: Package Insert – MRESVIA. Administering RSV vaccines Do not use any RSV vaccine beyond the expiration date printed on the label. Route Administer RSV vaccine intramuscularly. The preferred site of administration is the deltoid region of the upper arm. Do not administer RSV vaccine intravenously, intradermally, or subcutaneously. Number of doses The RSV vaccine is not currently an annual vaccine. CDC recommends only a single dose of an age-appropriate RSV vaccine for all adults ages 75 and older and for adults ages 50–74 with increased risk of severe RSV disease.

When deciding whether to coadminister other vaccines with an RSV vaccine, providers should consider whether the patient is up to date with currently recommended vaccines, the feasibility of the patient returning for additional vaccine doses, risk for acquiring vaccine-preventable disease, vaccine reactogenicity profiles, and patient preferences. Post-licensure efficacy and safety monitoring of coadministered RSV vaccines with other vaccines will further direct guidance.

### Clinical effectiveness of first and repeat influenza vaccination in adult and elderly diabetic patients [^114SjEF4]. Diabetes Care (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Influenza vaccine uptake remains low among the high-risk group of patients with diabetes, partly because of conflicting evidence regarding its potential benefits. We assessed the clinical effectiveness of influenza vaccination in adults with diabetes and specifically examined potential modification of effect by age and prior influenza vaccine uptake.

Research Design and Methods

The study was part of the Prevention of Influenza, Surveillance and Management (PRISMA) study, a nested case-control study conducted during the 1999–2000 influenza A epidemic, among 75,235 patients from primary care of any age recommended for vaccination. Among 9,238 adult patients with diabetes, 131 cases arose who were either hospitalized for diabetes dysregulation, acute respiratory disease, or cardiovascular disease and 61 cases who died, and we compared them with 1,561 control subjects. We evaluated the effect of (prior) influenza vaccination by means of logistic regression analysis controlling for age, sex, health insurance coverage, prior health care use, medication use, and comorbid conditions.

Results

Vaccination was associated with a 56% reduction in any complication (95% CI 36–70%), a 54% reduction in hospitalizations (26–71%), and 58% reduction in deaths (13–80%). Among study subjects aged 18–64 years, we observed somewhat higher reductions in the occurrence of any complication than among those aged > 65 years (72 vs. 39%). In first-time vaccinated subjects, the primary end point was reduced by 47% (0.2–72%), and in those who received vaccination in the year before, the reduction was 58% (4–81%).

Conclusions

Adults with type 2 diabetes, like other individuals from recognized risk groups, benefit considerably from influenza vaccination, and no difference in vaccine effectiveness was observed between first-time and repeat vaccination.

Influenza (A), COVID-19 (B), and respiratory syncytial virus (C and D) vaccination status * and vaccination intent † among adults, § by demographic characteristics, — National Immunization Survey-Adult COVID Module, United States, November 3–9, 2024

Abbreviations: AI/AN = American Indian or Alaska Native; NH/OPI = Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander; RSV = respiratory syncytial virus.

* Estimates of vaccination coverage were calculated for November 3–9, 2024, using a nondecreasing composite estimation procedure that uses data from all completed interviews during August 18, 2024–November 9, 2024 (influenza vaccination among persons aged ≥ 18 years, 136,195); September 1, 2024–November 9, 2024 (COVID-19 vaccination among persons aged ≥ 18 years, 112,040); September 24, 2023–November 9, 2024 (RSV vaccination among persons aged ≥ 75 years, 79,566); and August 25, 2024–November 9, 2024 (RSV vaccination among persons aged 60–74 years, at increased risk for severe RSV disease, 8,667).

† Estimates for vaccination intent are based on interviews conducted during November 3–9, 2024, and were adjusted to the cumulative vaccination coverage estimate for that week. Influenza (9,445), COVID-19 (9,439), RSV intent among adults aged ≥ 75 years (984), and RSV vaccination intent among persons aged 60–74 years, at increased risk for severe RSV disease (644). Estimates for vaccination or vaccination intent are not shown for groups with sample size < 30.

§ Estimates presented for influenza and COVID-19 vaccination coverage and vaccination intent are among adults aged ≥ 18 years. Estimates for RSV vaccination and intent are among adults aged ≥ 75 years and adults aged 60–74 years who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease. A respondent was considered to be at increased risk for severe RSV disease based on previously defined criteria: chronic lung diseases, diabetes with insulin use, heart conditions, immunocompromised state, solid organ or blood stem cell transplant (including bone marrow transplant), cancer, liver disease, sickle cell disease or thalassemia, or residence in a nursing home.

### Advisory committee on immunization practices recommended immunization schedule for children and adolescents aged 18 years or younger-United States, 2025 [^113RhVgK]. AAO (2025). High credibility.

COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) risk and vaccine impact are described as follows: older adults, immunocompromised individuals, and those with certain comorbidities are at risk for severe illness from COVID-19, and from October 2023 to May 2024, rates of hospitalization due to COVID-19 were greatest in adults 75 years of age or older. COVID-19 vaccination reduces the risk of severe disease, hospitalization, and death, with the 2023 to 2024 COVID-19 vaccines decreasing the risk of emergency department and urgent care visits by 50% in the first 2 months after vaccination; however, protection decreased over time, with little effect remaining 4 to 6 months after vaccination, and COVID-19 vaccines have been updated annually to address the currently circulating strains and waning immunity from prior vaccination and infection. For RSV, infants, young children, older adults, and people with immunocompromise are at risk for severe infection and hospitalization; approximately 100,000 to 150,000 adults 60 years of age or older are hospitalized for RSV annually in the United States; RSV is also the most common cause of pneumonia and bronchiolitis among children younger than 1 year of age; and other risk factors for severe RSV disease include medical comorbidities such as chronic cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal, or hematologic disease.

### Bivalent RSVpreF vaccine in adults 18 to… [^112XJ5Vz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of severe respiratory disease in infants, older adults, and those with health conditions that increase the risk of severe RSV illness. These risk factors in adults are similar to those for severe influenza and include older age, chronic cardiac and pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, and immunocompromising conditions.

Although the incidence of severe RSV illness is highest in infants, young children, and older adults, there is also a substantial and underestimated burden due to RSV in adults < 60 years of age, especially among those with risk factors for severe disease. A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies investigating medically attended RSV events among US adults reported underdetection-adjusted hospitalization incidences of 67/100 000 and 13/100 000 for those 50–64 and 18–49 years of age, respectively. After adjustment for underdetection, emergency department admission rates and outpatient visits were respectively 110/100 000 and 1722/100 000 for those 50–64 years of age and 198/100 000 and 1401/100 000 for those 18–49 years of age. Consistent with these findings on rates of medically attended RSV events, in 2022, the annual economic burden in the United States due to RSV-associated hospitalization in adults 50–59 years of age was estimated to be US$1.1 billion.

Immunogenicity Assessments

The humoral immune response was evaluated on serum samples collected on day 1 (prevaccination) and day 31 (1 month postvaccination) from a subset of participants in selected countries and sites (immunogenicity subset). RSV-A and RSV-B neutralizing titers were quantified using neutralization assays with assay cutoffs of 18 estimated dilution 60 (ED60) for RSV-A and 30 ED60 for RSV-B. RSVPreF3-binding immunoglobulin G concentrations were quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, with an assay cutoff of 25 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay units/mL.

Selection of Coexisting Medical Conditions of Interest

Subgroup analyses reported here were based on the presence or absence of selected coexisting medical conditions that are known to increase the risk of severe RSV disease, complemented with relevant risk factors of influenza complications, collectively referred to as "conditions of interest". These included cardiorespiratory conditions (any chronic respiratory or pulmonary disease [including COPD, asthma, and other conditions] and chronic heart failure) and endocrine and metabolic conditions (diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2 and advanced liver or renal disease). Information about coexisting medical conditions was gathered by interviewing the participants and/or reviewing their medical records. To generate the subgroups, the selected medical conditions of interest were identified in the database using a predefined list of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Terminology preferred terms.

Vaccine Efficacy Against RSV Disease in Participants With Coexisting Medical Conditions

A total of 24 960 participants were part of the modified exposed population for efficacy analyses. The median efficacy follow-up was 6.7 months. The RSV-LRTD incidence rates in the placebo group tended to be higher among participants with the selected coexisting conditions of interest (6.6–8.9/1000 person-years) than among those without any of these conditions (5.3/1000 person-years). A similar observation was made for the RSV-ARI incidence rates, which were 15.2–17.8/1000 person-years among placebo recipients with coexisting conditions of interest and 13.1/1000 person-years among those without these conditions (Table 2). Efficacy of RSVPreF3 OA against RSV-LRTD was 94.6% (95% CI, 65.9–99.9) in participants with at least 1 of the conditions of interest (92.1% [46.7–99.8] among those with cardiorespiratory conditions and 100% [74.0–100] among those with endocrine or metabolic conditions) and 92.0% (46.1–99.8) in participants with at least 2 of these conditions (Table 2).

### Noninferior immunogenicity and consistent safety of respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F protein vaccine in adults 50–59 years compared to ≥ 60 years of age [^114CHkCR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study demonstrated that the humoral immune response induced by RSVPreF3 OA in adults aged 50–59 years was noninferior to that in adults aged 60 years and older. Noninferiority was demonstrated for 50–59-year-olds without and for those with chronic conditions that increase the risk for RSV disease, both for RSV-A and RSV-B neutralization titers. Given that RSVPreF3 OA efficacy was demonstrated in adults aged 60 years and older, these results suggest that RSVPreF3 OA may also be efficacious in 50–59-year-olds, both in those without and those with underlying conditions that increase the risk for RSV disease.

A robust humoral immune response was seen in all 3 RSVPreF3 OA-vaccinated groups. Interestingly, post-vaccination RSV-A and RSV-B neutralization GMTs were not lower (rather, numerically higher) in the AIR than in the non-AIR subcohort, despite the trend for a greater body mass index and proportion of smokers in this subcohort, 2 factors that have been associated with lower immune responses to some vaccines in several studies. Similarly, among those aged 60 years and older in the phase 3 efficacy study, a trend for higher RSV neutralization titers was observed in participants with underlying medical conditions, and the vaccine efficacy against RSV-LRTD tended to be higher in this population (94.6% over 1 RSV season) compared with the overall population (82.6%).

We also observed numerically higher neutralization titers in adults aged 50–59 years than in those aged 60 years and older. A trend for lower RSV neutralization titers in older age groups was seen previously after RSVPreF3 OA immunization. However, the clinical relevance of these observations is not known as our study was not designed to detect between-group differences in immune responses, and 95% CIs between groups mostly overlapped.

Vaccination with RSVPreF3 OA also induced a robust CD4+ T-cell response in all groups. This increase in CD4+ T-cell frequencies is important as T-cell immunity is thought to play a role in protecting against RSV disease and controlling disease severity. Consistent with previous studies in individuals aged 60 years and older, RSVPreF3 OA did not induce an increase in CD8+ T cells in 50–59-year-olds.

### Efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of the bivalent RSV prefusion F (RSVpreF) vaccine in older adults over 2 RSV seasons [^114ZCefZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

RSV is an important cause of lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) in older adults. RSVpreF is a bivalent stabilized prefusion F vaccine containing antigens against RSV-A and RSV-B. In this phase 3 trial in ≥ 60-year-olds, RSVpreF demonstrated vaccine efficacy (VE) of 88.9% and 77.8% against RSV-associated LRTI with ≥ 3 symptoms at the end of RSV seasons 1 and 2, respectively. Here we describe final safety and efficacy results and present immunogenicity data.

Methods

This study was conducted over 2 RSV seasons. Participants were randomized (1:1) to 1 dose of RSVpreF 120-µg or placebo. A secondary objective was to describe RSVpreF immunogenicity 1-month postvaccination and before season 2 visits in a participant subset from the USA and Japan.

Results

One-month postvaccination neutralization titer geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) was 12.1 for combined RSV-A/RSV-B. Geometric mean titers decreased at the preseason 2 visit, but remained substantially higher than baseline (RSV-A/RSV-B GMFR = 4.7). One month postvaccination, GMFRs for RSV-A/RSV-B neutralizing responses ranged from 12.0–13.0 for subgroups stratified by age (60–69, 70–79, ≥ 80 years). RSV-A/RSV-B GMFRs in participants with prespecified chronic conditions were generally similar to those without (range, 11.4–14.4). A consistent favorable safety profile and durable VE was seen through 2 RSV seasons.

Conclusion

High RSV neutralizing titers were observed 1 month after RSVpreF vaccination in ≥ 60-year-olds, with similarly robust responses across age subgroups and baseline chronic conditions. These robust immune responses corresponded with high RSVpreF VE against RSV-associated LRTI. RSVpreF had a favorable safety profile over 2 seasons.NCT05035212; EudraCT, 2021–003693–31.

### Incidence of respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospitalization among adults in Ontario, Canada, 2017–2019 [^116vCnXK]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes substantial morbidity and mortality among adults. Given recent RSV vaccine authorizations, data on groups at highest risk are needed to support vaccine program decision making.

Methods

We identified adults aged ≥ 18 years hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed RSV and hospitalizations with RSV-related diagnostic codes in Ontario, Canada (2017–2019). We calculated incidence of hospitalization with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Poisson regression stratified by demographic and clinical risk factors, and substratified by age. We reported secondary outcomes including the proportion of individuals with fatal outcomes.

Results

Over 2 respiratory virus seasons, we identified 3928 RSV-associated hospitalizations. Incidence increased steadily with age from 2.0 (95% CI, 1.8–2.3) per 100 000 for those aged 18–49 years to 43.7 (95% CI, 41.0–46.6) per 100 000 for those aged 70–79 years, with a sharp increase to 134.7 (95% CI, 128.6–141.1) per 100 000 for those aged ≥ 80 years. Incidence was higher for those with comorbidities, including chronic kidney disease (receiving dialysis) (494.7; 95% CI, 410.7–595.8) and transplant recipients (370.9; 95% CI, 318.0–432.6), as well as for those living in lower (22.4; 95% CI, 21.1–23.7) versus higher-income neighborhoods (11.8; 95% CI, 10.8–12.8). Among those hospitalized, 10.3% (n = 403) died within 30 days of admission, and 93.1% of deaths occurred in those aged ≥ 60 years. Of survivors, 44.6% of community-dwelling adults aged ≥ 60 years had functional decline requiring formal supports at discharge.

Discussion

We found a substantial burden of RSV among older adults, particularly among those with preexisting medical conditions and those of lower socioeconomic status. These results will inform equitable vaccine recommendations for adults.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccination — The FDA approved 2 vaccines for those aged ≥ 60 years based on risk for severe RSV disease, and in clinical trials efficacy of preventing RSV-associated lower respiratory infection varied from 77% to 81%. Of 38 177 participants who received the vaccines, 6 cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome were reported. Persons aged 60–74 years who have heart or lung disease or weakened immune systems, who are frail, or who live in a group setting are at increased likelihood of severe RSV disease and should receive 1 dose of an RSV vaccine, and persons aged ≥ 75 years should receive 1 dose of an RSV vaccine. Data regarding RSV vaccine in people with HIV are limited, and risks and benefits should be assessed based on shared decision-making.
