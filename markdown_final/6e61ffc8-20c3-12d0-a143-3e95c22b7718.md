## Question

When should a primary care specialist refer a patient of DM to endocrinologist

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when a primary care specialist should refer a patient with diabetes mellitus to an endocrinologist. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching care model and whether primary care can reasonably manage the case. Then, I should verify disease-specific triggers such as type 1 diabetes, persistent hyperglycemia, and hypoglycemia. Next, I will examine complexity signals like polypharmacy, insulin initiation, and advanced technologies. After that, I need to check for complications and comorbidities that warrant specialty input. I will then consider special populations, including older adults, pregnancy, and pediatrics. Finally, I should review system-level factors, communication requirements, and a practical decision framework, while double-checking where guidelines differ and why.

> Let me first confirm the care model so I don't jump to conclusions: most patients with type 2 diabetes are managed in primary care, but a coordinated, multidisciplinary approach is recommended, and referral to endocrinology is appropriate when complexity exceeds primary care scope or goals are not met despite guideline-concordant therapy, which aligns with ADA and AACE guidance and the reality of workforce constraints [^8016dbbd] [^c71baab0] [^f031eae0].

> I need to check disease-specific triggers next. Type 1 diabetes generally warrants endocrinology-led care given insulin therapy, technology, and acute risk; ADA explicitly supports access to clinicians with T1D expertise, and the Endocrine Society advises endocrinologist-led care for older adults with T1D or when complex hyperglycemia treatment is needed, so I should confirm T1D early and refer accordingly [^cdab616b] [^36ea4765].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about type 2 diabetes. Persistent hyperglycemia despite optimized dual or triple therapy, or A1c persistently above goal (commonly A1c ≥ 8.0–8.5% depending on individualization), should prompt referral; observational data show endocrinologists achieve faster A1c reductions and higher odds of ≥ 1% A1c drop, and AACE emphasizes intensification when targets are unmet, so I should verify medication adherence and dosing before concluding "failure" and then refer if still uncontrolled [^650fc834] [^a591d492] [^845d04d9].

> I will now examine hypoglycemia risk because this is a critical safety signal. Recurrent or severe hypoglycemia, or impaired hypoglycemia awareness, warrants endocrinology referral for evaluation of therapy de-intensification, CGM, and structured education; ADA and the Endocrine Society both highlight this as a referral indication, and I should confirm frequency, severity, and precipitating factors before referring [^609ac824] [^36ea4765] [^7968ea24].

> Next, I should review complexity signals. Complex pharmacotherapy such as three or more glucose-lowering agents, initiation or intensification of insulin (especially multiple daily injections or pump therapy), or use of advanced technologies like CGM or insulin pumps should trigger referral; AACE's technology guideline and the Endocrine Society's older-adult guidance support specialist oversight for these scenarios, and I need to ensure the local team has the capacity and training before attempting in primary care [^37f5ca03] [^36ea4765].

> Let me consider complications and comorbidities carefully. Multiple diabetes complications, rapidly progressing or advanced chronic kidney disease, refractory hypertension, or complex cardiovascular disease are situations where endocrinology co-management is appropriate; ADA and KDIGO-aligned guidance support nephrology referral for eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or UACR > 300 mg/g, and endocrinology can assist with glycemic strategies and cardiometabolic risk reduction in these settings [^eb90250e] [^134b5b92] [^ed2988fa].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a special population? I should double-check those. In older adults, frailty, functional decline, or recurrent hypoglycemia justify endocrinology involvement to individualize targets and simplify regimens; in pregnancy or preconception, optimize glycemic control and consider endocrinology for complex cases; in pediatrics, T2DM management and T1D care generally warrant pediatric endocrinology input, with AAP recommending specialist involvement when goals are not met or insulin is initiated [^bb9e8ad1] [^e053568b] [^6cc78466].

> I need to ensure system-level factors are not overlooked. Limited access to endocrinologists and long wait times mean I should prioritize referrals for the highest-need patients and consider shared care models, eConsults, or Project ECHO to extend capacity; graduation programs that return stable patients to primary care can improve access for new referrals, and I should communicate clearly with the specialist to avoid delays and fragmentation [^0d561c65] [^7dc8cf3d] [^d7245b10].

> Hold on, I should verify the communication requirements because poor handoffs undermine care. Referrals should include the reason, current medications, recent labs, and specific questions; specialists should close the loop with timely feedback, and both parties should document shared goals and responsibilities to support coordinated care, which is repeatedly identified as a critical quality gap in primary–specialty transitions [^d7245b10] [^f6930be7].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework, and I will double-check it against guidelines. Refer to endocrinology when any of the following are present: confirmed or suspected type 1 diabetes; persistent hyperglycemia despite optimized dual/triple therapy or A1c persistently above individualized goal; recurrent or severe hypoglycemia or impaired awareness; complex pharmacotherapy (≥ 3 agents, insulin initiation/intensification, pumps/CGM); multiple complications or advanced CKD; special populations (older adults with frailty/hypoglycemia, pregnancy/preconception, pediatrics); or when the primary care team lacks experience or confidence with the management plan, aligning with ADA, AACE, and Endocrine Society guidance [^8016dbbd] [^36ea4765] [^ed2988fa].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought an A1c threshold of ≥ 9.0% alone should mandate referral, but I should correct that. While A1c ≥ 9.0% is a red flag for poor control, guidelines emphasize verifying adherence, dosing, and social determinants first, and then individualizing the threshold based on comorbidity, hypoglycemia risk, and duration; thus, persistent A1c above goal despite appropriate therapy is the truer trigger than a single high value [^a0092a27] [^845d04d9].

> Finally, I should confirm that my plan supports closing the loop. After referral, I will track whether A1c improves, hypoglycemia abates, or technology is successfully adopted, and I will request the specialist's plan for returning stable patients to primary care so we can sustain gains and keep specialty access available for those who need it most [^0d561c65] [^8016dbbd].

Primary care should refer patients with diabetes to endocrinology when **A1c remains above goal despite optimized therapy** [^a591d492] or when **complex insulin regimens** (multiple daily injections, pumps, or CGM) are needed [^37f5ca03]. Referral is also indicated for **recurrent or severe hypoglycemia** [^609ac824], **unclear diabetes type** (especially suspected LADA) [^26c3dda2], or **multiple complications** (CKD, retinopathy, neuropathy, CVD) [^d010f830]. Additional triggers include pregnancy or preconception planning [^e053568b], persistent hyperglycemia in older adults with frailty or cognitive impairment [^bb9e8ad1], and use of advanced therapies (GLP-1 agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors) in complex comorbidity [^notfound]. Early referral improves outcomes [^650fc834] and should be coordinated with clear communication and shared care plans [^d7245b10].

---

## Indications for referral to endocrinology

### Persistent hyperglycemia despite optimized therapy

- **A1c above goal**: A1c remains above individualized target despite adherence to optimized therapy (≥ 2 agents, including metformin, at maximal tolerated doses) [^a591d492].
- **Therapy escalation**: Need for complex insulin regimens (multiple daily injections, insulin pumps, or CGM) [^37f5ca03].
- **Rapid progression**: Rapidly worsening hyperglycemia or frequent adjustments without improvement [^notfound].

---

### Hypoglycemia and glycemic variability

- **Recurrent hypoglycemia**: Frequent or severe episodes, especially with impaired awareness [^609ac824].
- **Glycemic variability**: Wide swings requiring specialist adjustment and education [^notfound].

---

### Unclear diabetes type or atypical features

Unclear diabetes type or atypical features include suspected **latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA)** [^26c3dda2] or atypical phenotypes, and diagnostic uncertainty when the **type remains unclear after initial evaluation**.

---

### Presence of diabetes-related complications

- **Chronic kidney disease**: eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or rapidly declining kidney function [^134b5b92].
- **Retinopathy**: Advanced or non-resolving retinopathy requiring specialist input [^notfound].
- **Neuropathy**: Severe or atypical neuropathy needing specialist evaluation [^notfound].
- **Cardiovascular disease**: Complex CVD with difficult-to-control risk factors [^7f8f2da6].

---

### Special populations and clinical scenarios

- **Pregnancy**: Preconception planning or pregnancy with diabetes [^e053568b].
- **Older adults**: Frailty, cognitive impairment, or multiple comorbidities [^bb9e8ad1].
- **Pediatrics**: Type 1 diabetes or complex type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents [^6cc78466].
- **Advanced therapies**: GLP-1 agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, or bariatric surgery considerations [^notfound].

## Benefits of timely referral

Timely referral to endocrinology provides several benefits, including **improved glycemic control** with faster A1c reduction and better long-term outcomes [^650fc834] [^a591d492]. It also enables **individualized care** through specialist expertise in complex cases and advanced therapies. Early involvement helps prevent or slow complications via aggressive risk-factor management, and coordinated care with clear communication and shared plans reduces fragmentation [^d7245b10].

---

## Communication and coordination

Effective referral requires **clear communication** — provide the reason, current medications, labs, and goals — and a **shared care plan** that outlines responsibilities and follow-up to ensure continuity [^d7245b10].

---

## Situations where primary care can manage without referral

Primary care can manage **stable, uncomplicated type 2 diabetes** with A1c at goal on simple regimens, as well as routine monitoring of A1c, blood pressure, lipids, and screening for complications. Basic education and support can be provided by primary care or diabetes educators, and mild hyperglycemia can be addressed with lifestyle and standard oral therapy.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Primary care should refer to endocrinology when **A1c remains above goal despite optimized therapy**, complex insulin regimens are needed, or there is recurrent/severe hypoglycemia. Referral is also indicated for unclear diabetes type, multiple complications, pregnancy or preconception, older adults with frailty, or when advanced therapies are contemplated. Timely referral improves outcomes, and clear communication with shared care plans optimizes coordination.

### Treatment of diabetes in older adults: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^36ea4765]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Role of the endocrinologist and diabetes care specialist — In patients aged 65 years and older with newly diagnosed diabetes, we advise that an endocrinologist or diabetes care specialist should work with the primary care provider, a multidisciplinary team, and the patient in the development of individualized diabetes treatment goals (Ungraded Good Practice Statement). In patients aged 65 years and older with diabetes, an endocrinologist or diabetes care specialist should be primarily responsible for diabetes care if the patient has T1D, or requires complex hyperglycemia treatment to achieve treatment goals, or has recurrent severe hypoglycemia, or has multiple diabetes complications (Ungraded Good Practice Statement). Possible roles include no role, consultant-only collaborative care, and overall diabetes management; under no role, care is by the primary care team when goals are achieved with lifestyle or simple oral agent therapy (one or two medications). Consultant-only collaborative care includes assistance with assessment and goal setting, with consultation at diagnosis or when there is a change in diabetes status such as treatment goals no longer being achieved, recurrent hypoglycemia, or development of one or more diabetes complications. For overall management, specific indications to assume control include complex hyperglycemia treatment (use of three or more glucose-lowering agents; the addition of insulin, especially multiple types or injections), recurrent severe hypoglycemia, multiple diabetes complications, and a long history of diabetes.

### From artisan to architect: the specialist and systems of provision of diabetes care in 2001 [^d934fd5b]. Endocrine Practice (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To discuss the future role of the diabetes specialist and the endocrinologist in the care of patients with diabetes.

Methods

We reviewed the literature on health care systems, integrated approaches to provision of health care, health care in the primary-care setting for patients with chronic illness, and population-based health care for patients with diabetes.

Results

Specialists who care for patients with diabetes will assume a more significant role as caretakers of teams of health care professionals who are responsible for the primary care of patients with diabetes. The integration of specialist care at the primary-care level may lead to improved outcomes at the primary-care level, increased access to specialty care, and decreased costs for the health care system. Alternative systems, such as regulatory barriers to specialist care, are less likely to accomplish these outcomes.

Conclusion

In the near future, specialists will be expected to care for those who provide primary care for patients with diabetes. Endocrinologists and endocrinology training programs should recognize this emerging role and prepare for it.

### Identifying profiles of patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes who would benefit from referral to an endocrinologist [^a591d492]. Endocrine Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the outcomes of glycemic uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type 2 patients receiving treatment from endocrinologists with those treated by primary care physicians. Additionally, this research aims to identify patient profiles that would benefit from personalized referral-a novel medical approach that aims to match the most suitable specialist for effectively managing patient while considering the patient's profile.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study uses the Maccabi Healthcare Services diabetes registry to match 508 pairs of glycemic uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type 2 patients treated by endocrinologists (EndoG) and primary care physicians (PcPG). Using a generalized additive model, we analyzed the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) trend over 1 year for each group. We employed the odds ratio (OR) from conditional logistic regression to determine the likelihood of favorable outcomes in the EndoG compared to the PcPG, using the entire cohort and subcohort profiles.

Results

The generalized additive model comparison indicated an improvement in HbA1c levels in both groups, with the EndoG outperforming the PcPG. Furthermore, the EndoG group had an OR = 2.27 (95% confidence interval, 1.6 to 3.2) for reducing HbA1c by at least 1% within a year and an OR = 1.68 (95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 2.76) for achieving low-density lipoprotein levels < 100 mg/dl. We identified 96 profiles with positive outcomes, all favoring treatment by endocrinologists.

Conclusions

EndoG demonstrated superior HbA1c control over time and achieved better outcomes compared to PcPG. The identification of 96 profiles benefiting from endocrinologist referral emphasizes the potential of personalized referral.

Coordinated care and care management

In the early years of having diabetes, good glycemic control can be relatively easy to attain and comorbid conditions may be few, although as time progresses the disease burden increases and complications inevitably arise. For a single physician to provide comprehensive medical management for someone with diabetes is virtually impossible.

Referring more patients to endocrinologists cannot be the answer, since the demand exceeds the supply and the discipline is not growing as fast as the patient population. Also, a greater reliance on specialists would likely require several more different specialists, since, for example, people with diabetes have on average five different medical problems. Because comorbidities are seldom independent of one another, people trained to handle a variety of issues in a single encounter would seem to be more cost-effective.

Increasing the number of primary care physicians (PCPs) is also unrealistic when specialty medicine pays much more, and medical school enrollment is not keeping up with the incidence of chronic disease and the growth in ambulatory care visits. Thus, PCPs will be in increasingly short supply, and because they provide more of the care to the disadvantaged and minority populations (i.e. those with a greater propensity to develop diabetes), the disparities we now see may only worsen. The outlook for growth in other health professional disciplines is not appreciably better.

The complexity of chronic diseases has led to the recommendation that such care be distributed across a multidisciplinary team, coordinated by a PCP or in some cases a specialist. This concept goes beyond case management, where treatment is tailored to patients' conditions and centered on acute goals of therapy and often operates independently of patients' primary physicians. This new model of care has been termed the "patient-centered medical home" (PCMH). Its primary elements are that it is team-based and coordinated and directed by a single physician, resulting in well-orchestrated, continuous, comprehensive, and timely care that (hopefully) reduces the overuse and misuse of services and leads to better outcomes at reduced cost.

In the management of diabetes, a patient-centered multidisciplinary team has long been advocated and its elements defined. But in practice it has been generally confined to an endocrinologist and diabetes educator(s). Many successful and innovative approaches to diabetes management that represent a hybrid between case management and the PCMH have been described and could serve as lessons for what could or does not work.

### Coordinated primary and specialty care for type 2 diabetes mellitus, guidelines, and systems: an educational needs assessment [^c194ebfd]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine knowledge, competence, and attitudinal issues among primary care providers (PCPs) and diabetes specialists regarding the use and application of evidence-based clinical guidelines and the coordination of care between PCPs and diabetes specialists specifically related to referral practices for patients with diabetes.

Methods

A survey tool was completed by 491 PCPs and 249 diabetes specialists. Data were collected from specialists online and from PCP attendees at live symposia across the United States. Results were analyzed for frequency of response and evaluation of significant relationships among the variables.

Results

Suboptimal practice patterns and interprofessional communication as well as gaps in diabetes-related knowledge and processes were identified. PCPs reported a lack of clarity about who, PCP or specialist, should assume clinical responsibility for the management of diabetes after a specialty referral. PCPs were most likely to refer patients to diabetes specialists for management issues relating to insulin therapy and use of advanced treatment strategies, such as insulin pens and continuous glucose monitoring. A minority of PCPs and even fewer specialists reported the routine use of clinical guidelines in practice.

Conclusion

This research-based assessment identified critical educational needs and gaps related to coordinated care for patients with diabetes as well as the need for quality- and performance-based educational interventions.

Immunization practice standards in diabetes mellitus — clinic workflows to improve vaccination rates include the following key points: assess immunization status of all persons with DM at every encounter; stay up to date on the latest recommendations from the CDC, noting that vaccination recommendations change frequently and clinicians should always find the most recent recommendations before advising their patients; implement policies or workflow changes to facilitate review of immunization status by care team staff and to provide patient reminders; strongly recommend any vaccines a person may need; provide a nonjudgmental environment to address any questions or concerns; recognize that a strong recommendation from a clinician is the best predictor for a person choosing to get immunized; administer vaccines, if stocked in practice, or refer persons with DM to local vaccine providers, which may include primary care clinicians, pharmacies, or public health offices; and document administered or received vaccines in the patient's health record and the state immunization registry.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: what does the primary care physician need to know? [^c381a079]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in the United States and is soon to be the leading cause of liver transplantation. Patients at the greatest risk are those with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In 2019 the American Diabetes Association guidelines called, for the first time, for clinicians to screen for steatohepatitis and fibrosis all patients with type 2 diabetes and liver steatosis or abnormal plasma aminotransferases. This requires primary care physicians to be aware of key aspects related to the diagnosis and treatment of NAFLD, as well as to when to refer to a specialist. Unfortunately, there is still significant medical inertia as clinicians remain unaware of its high morbidity/mortality. Early diagnosis in the primary care setting is critical to prevent progression to end-stage liver disease. Patients with NAFLD are also at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Despite general perception to the contrary, weight loss by lifestyle intervention or bariatric surgery and several pharmacological treatments (eg, vitamin E in nondiabetics, pioglitazone or glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists in patients with or without diabetes) can often be successful to reverse steatohepatitis and prevent disease progression.

Most patients with T2DM are managed in primary care unless they develop T2DM-related complications. For example, if a patient has resistant hyperglycemia despite receiving recommended treatments, and/or resistant hypertension despite receiving recommended treatments, and the primary care clinician does not have the relevant experience or time capacity to manage these escalations, then the patient may be referred for specialist assessment. In the same context, for example, a patient with resistant hyperglycemia may be referred to an endocrinologist for evaluation and/or a patient with continuously increasing UACR and/or continuously decreasing eGFR should be referred to a nephrologist. Such referrals may be based on clinical practice guideline recommendations. However, it is important to note that although guidelines are evidence based, the recommendations provided cannot always be applied to clinical practice because real-world factors, such as a local shortage of endocrinologists or nephrologists, may be a reality for some communities; consequently, in situations such as these, the management of care of patients in primary care should be optimized. This also means that the size of the MDT working with a patient with diabetes will be different for similar patients because it will be impacted by factors such as resources, staffing, HCP experience, cost, and location.

### Differential shared care for diabetes: does it provide the optimal partition between primary and specialist care? [^c258aa1b]. Diabetic Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Aims

To establish whether a system of differential shared care between general practitioners and specialists is compatible with patients receiving the level of care they require.

Methods

We sought to trace 200 shared care patients whose care had been kept at the general practitioner level after initial referral and compared them with a group of patients who had been re-referred to the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital Diabetes Centre for specialist review.

Results

There were no significant differences in glycaemic, blood pressure and lipid levels of returned and non-returned patients at initial assessment. However, non-returned patients were less likely to have a history of macrovascular disease or risk factor (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.4; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2–0.6). Their referral letter was also more likely to emphasize their type and/or duration of diabetes (adjusted OR 4.6; 95% CI 2.5–8.4). Nearly half (47.1%) of the non-returned group changed their doctor in the years following their initial specialist review, increasing their likelihood of not being re-referred five-fold (adjusted OR 5.0; 95% CI 2.9–8.8). At initial assessment, non-returned patients were given less treatment recommendations (adjusted OR 0.5; 95% CI 0.3–0.7). Doctors registered with the Diabetes Shared Care Programme referred more patients than their non-shared care counterparts. However, a higher proportion of these doctors (52.5% vs. 21.3%; χ² = 16.5, 1 d.f. P = 0.00005) were selective in whom they re-referred.

Conclusion

Differential shared care encourages appropriate referral to specialist services, without compromise to standards of care. Diabet. Med. 18, 554–557 (2001)

### Comparison of the adherence to the American diabetes association guidelines of diabetes care in primary care and subspecialty clinics [^96871d89]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Although, from our study, it appears that the glycemic control is worse in a specialist clinic, there are several factors which could explain this. It could be due to referral bias, wherein, patients who are referred to specialist care are poorly controlled when they are referred. Patients seen by specialists are usually under the care of multiple physicians leading to fragmentation of care and deferment of some services to other providers. Specialists are also more likely to individualize glycemic targets depending on co morbid conditions and therefore assessing control based on A1c less than 7% may not be valid for the complexity of patients seen at the DM clinic. Our data also does not reflect the duration of specialist care for the patients. In the management of a chronic condition likely diabetes, long term follow up is needed to assess improvement in outcomes. This is especially relevant since longitudinal follow up studies of patients under specialist care have shown improvement in diabetes parameters and outcomes over time. Also, it has been the practice of our DM clinic to return the patients who have achieved stable and improved glycemic control back to their primary care providers. Therefore, patients who are not well controlled remain in the DM clinic and this may partly explain the presence of fewer patients with A1c < 7%.

Our study does have limitations. While a randomized controlled trial is the ideal type of study to measure the impact of an intervention, ours is a retrospective observational study. Our data only reflect the measures at a single point. We do not have follow up data and therefore it is not possible to gauge change over time. We do not have information on all the comorbidities of the patients which can affect their metabolic control and glycemic targets. Our study also does not include data about patients receiving care from other specialists, which may lead to physicians' inaction with regards to medication adjustment for uncontrolled blood pressure and lipids.

### Diabetic retinopathy preferred practice pattern ® [^33ec9bf1]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy counseling and referral — The ophthalmologist should refer patients with diabetes to a primary care physician or endocrinologist for appropriate management and should communicate examination results to the physician managing the patient's ongoing diabetes care; some patients with DR will lose substantial vision despite being treated, and patients whose conditions fail to respond to surgery or for whom further treatment is unavailable should be provided with professional support and offered referral for counseling, vision rehabilitation, or social services as appropriate; empathic communication is helpful, referrals should be considered for counseling, vocational rehabilitation and/or peer support groups for patients with depression, anxiety, and loss of independence or employment, and because vision rehabilitation improves functional ability, patients with functionally limiting visual impairment should be referred for vision rehabilitation and social services.

### Model of care for the management of complex type 2 diabetes managed in the community by primary care physicians with specialist support: an open controlled trial [^a3a21a5e]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

To evaluate patient outcomes for a novel integrated primary/specialist model of community care for complex Type 2 diabetes mellitus management compared with outcomes for usual care at a tertiary hospital for diabetes outpatients.

Methods

This was a prospective open controlled trial performed in a primary and tertiary care setting in Australia. A total of 330 patients with Type 2 diabetes aged > 18 years were allocated to an intervention (n = 185) or usual care group (n = 145). The intervention arm was a community-based model of care led by a general practitioner with advanced skills and an endocrinologist partnership. Usual care was provided via the hospital diabetes outpatient department. The primary end point was HbA(1c) concentration at 12 months. Secondary end points included serum lipids and blood pressure.

Results

The mean change in HbA1c concentration in the intervention group was -9 mmol/mol (-0.8%) at 12 months and in the usual care group it was -2 mmol/mol (-0.2%) (95% CI -5,1). The percentage of patients in the intervention group achieving the HbA(1c) target of ≤ 53 mmol/mol (7%) increased from 21 to 42% (P < 0.001); for the usual care group there was a 1% increase to 39% of patients attaining this target (P = 0.99). Patients in the intervention group experienced significant improvements in blood pressure and total cholesterol compared with those in the usual care group. The percentage of patients achieving clinical targets was greater in the intervention group for the combined target of HbA(1c) concentration, blood pressure and LDL cholesterol.

Conclusions

A community-based, integrated model of complex diabetes care, delivered by general practitioners with advanced skills, produced clinical and process benefits compared with a tertiary diabetes outpatient clinic.

### Establishing screening programs for presymptomatic type 1 diabetes: practical guidance for diabetes care providers [^94ef2f71]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Building a Team to Plan the Screening Program

A team will need to be established to plan and ultimately advocate for the screening program. Providers from disciplines and settings who would be involved in conducting the screenings would be valuable members of the team.

For example, endocrinologists and primary care providers (PCPs) (ie, pediatricians, family practitioners, and internal medicine physicians) can offer care to family members of their patients with T1D, but PCPs will be most crucial for screening of the general population. Individuals at risk for developing T1D are likely not being followed by an endocrinologist. Therefore, it is important that PCPs are included in any screening team, and that efforts are made toward raising their awareness of early T1D and of screening.

In the United States and Europe, PCPs currently screen for other metabolic conditions, so it is feasible that they can also play a crucial role in T1D screening. Non-diabetes specialists, such as gastroenterologists, see people with non-endocrine autoimmune diseases (eg, celiac disease) who may have a higher risk of developing T1D. To capture people outside of an endocrinology practice for screening, it will be important to include providers from other specialties on the team. Both PCPs and specialists could contribute valuable insights on how to implement screening processes within their specific clinical environments and how to motivate their respective colleagues to take part in the screening program.

Developing Processes for the Screening Program

When establishing T1D screening processes, it is important to consider how they can be streamlined and built into existing workflows, as specialists and PCPs may report feeling like they are already working at their full capacity with a busy patient load. Several components of the program can be standardized, including communication with patients, ordering electronic health record (EHR)-preferred AAb panels, timing of screening, diagnostic codes, follow-up procedures, monitoring, and communication with endocrinology with positive results for support and/or referral.

### Family physician and endocrinologist coordination as the basis for diabetes care in clinical practice [^55a71387]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, our results show that a training and continuous communication between primary care and endocrinology is possible in clinical practice and results in benefits in terms of health care and cardiovascular risk factors control, with an appropriate use of personal resources. A reduction in diabetes complications as well as cardiovascular events will be expected.

### Differences in achieving HbA1c goals among patients seen by endocrinologists and primary care providers [^650fc834]. Endocrine Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective: This study evaluated whether there is a difference in the proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes who achieve a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) < 7% within one year following treatment by an endocrinologist or primary care physician (PCP). Methods: We conducted a retrospective, propensity-matched study of patients with type 2 diabetes that were not optimally controlled and seen within our health system from 2007–2016. We assessed differences in short term health outcomes for patients following an endocrinologist visit compared to a PCP visit. Results: Patients seen by endocrinologists obtained HbA1c control at a faster rate (hazard ratio = 1.226; 95% confidence interval = 1.01 to 1.488) than those seen by a PCP. Furthermore, 34.5% and 29.5% of those treated by endocrinologists and PCPs, respectively, obtained HbA1c control by one year. Endocrinologists were more likely to prescribe a new medication class within 90 days than PCPs (14.1% versus 10.3%, respectively, P = 0.043). There was no difference in the risk of hospitalization between groups; 24.4% and 24.1% of those treated by endocrinologists and PCPs, respectively, were hospitalized within one year. Conclusion: Patients treated by endocrinology specialists were more likely to achieve a target HbA1c of < 7% (53 mmol/mol) than those treated by PCPs in our health-care system. The performance difference may be partially explained by a higher rate of adding new classes of diabetes medications to the patient's pharmacologic regimens within 90 days by endocrinologists compared with PCPs. The long-term impact of these differences is unknown but has the potential to have an unfavorable impact on the health of the population.

### Australian practice nurses' perspectives on integrating specialist diabetes care with primary care: a qualitative study [^168f7df1]. Family Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Diabetes Care Project and the Australian National Diabetes Strategy both recommend that more effective integration is needed between primary and specialist services to improve diabetes care. Based on this recommendation, the Australian Diabetes Alliance Program (DAP) was co-designed with relevant stakeholders and piloted by a tertiary diabetes specialist team as an integrated model of care to improve timely access to specialist care. The pilot program from 2015 was proven effective and transitioned to business as usual from 2017 in the Hunter New England Local Health District (HNELHD), New South Wales, Australia. The program involves collaboration between a hospital specialist team (Endocrinologist and Diabetes Educator) with primary care teams (general practitioner [GP] and practice nurse [PN]) to provide education, case conferences, and performance monitoring, which has been described previously. Case conferencing requires hospital specialist teams to visit primary care practices and participate in a consultation with a patient, their GP and PN, and develop a diabetes management plan within 40 min. PNs have the opportunity to upskill during case conferencing as a result of the education they receive from the Endocrinologist and Diabetes Educator related to the clinical management of diabetes. Two to three days of case conferences are provided to each primary care practice, with approximately 10 patients seen per clinic day. The case conferencing clinics are provided once at baseline, and then the same patients are reviewed at a 6-month follow-up. The DAP team works closely with primary care practices to deliver case conferencing as needed, depending on factors like the size of the practice, patient demographics, hospital referrals, and others. PNs are responsible for completing a pre-clinic form and providing pathology referral and a 3-day food and blood glucose diary to patients prior to their case conference. Patients also attend a 6-month follow-up case conference with the hospital specialist team and primary care team in their primary care practice. The hospital specialist team also delivers performance appraisals on a 6-monthly basis using a report that includes data from a de-identified diabetes management practice performance report. The delivery of DAP occurred through a Service Level Agreement between HNELHD and the Primary Health Network Hunter New England and Central Coast. A systematic review of 167 studies demonstrated that the integrated model of care which included elements used by DAP, were shown to be associated with perceived improved quality of care by healthcare providers and patients, higher patient satisfaction, and greater accessibility to care by patients.

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^9d0ce4ef]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Today's guidelines not only generally have the proviso that patients who do not meet the A1C goal be followed every 2–3 months to enable adjustment of the ongoing treatment regimen, but also indicate that clinical judgment should be individually tailored. However, this case-by-case approach may not be the best practice tactic for the vast majority of patients, since the progressive nature of diabetes demands prompt and consistent therapeutic attention.

A well-controlled A1C of < 7.0% with oral monotherapy for up to 3 years is typically achieved by ~50% of type 2 diabetic patients. It has been suggested that this unsatisfactory outcome is partly the consequence of first-line therapy being begun only after A1C reaches levels higher than those at which the expected glucose-lowering from monotherapy could be expected to return glucose control to target levels. This result has been attributed in part to physicians — both specialists and those in primary care — not being well prepared for early interventions and therefore often missing the critical window to launch effective management. Despite poor and worsening A1C, many people are kept on the same medications, thus aggravating their glycemic burden and risking worsening health problems. Interestingly, a recent survey of awareness and attitudes in eight countries found that 51% of patients had never heard of A1C and that > 10% of physicians measured it less than once a year.

Before the recent enhanced focus on more structured guidelines with specific recommended A1C targets, diabetes management with antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy was often inadequate, with appropriate changes in medical regimens implemented only when A1C levels were > 9.0% and/or several months to years after ascertaining that A1C readings were higher than acceptable. As a result of incremental treatment not keeping abreast with degenerating glycemic status (Fig. 2) and most individuals who managed to successfully achieve recommended A1C targets demonstrating an inability to maintain glycemic status, glycemic burden was unnecessarily extended in parallel with a substantial increase in CV risk. For example, Alvarez Guisasola et al. reported that 26% of the 2,025 people that they monitored from seven European countries had an average A1C of 7.2% after 2.6 years of metformin-sulfonylurea or metformin-thiazolidinedione combinations. After 5 years, 20% of the 176 patients with A1C assessments were under control (mean A1C 7.4%), with 30% of this subgroup on insulin, resonating the often-observed temporal decline in glycemic management.

### Key service delivery processes, challenges and barriers to healthcare access for managing diabetes outside target HbA1c levels in primary care settings in Qatar: a qualitative inquiry of healthcare professionals' and service users' perspectives [^79a247a1]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Consultation with patients

The HCPs mentioned a range of factors that influenced the quality of the consultation process (online supplemental table 1). The overall feedback from the physicians was that patients expected specialised care while visiting primary care clinics and expressed the desire to be seen by an endocrinologist or a diabetes specialist doctor. For example, a physician mentioned:

Some patients have low level of trust with the family physicians, and they often question me if I have specialized in diabetes and if they can be referred to endocrinologist, it is the lack of trust. I then have to convince them and assure that we are trained to provide comprehensive and specialized care to them. So, there can be the trust problem while interacting with the patients. (PT10)

Time constraints were also particularly highlighted by different HCPs who participated in the FGD, suggesting that the allotted time was not sufficient to properly address the concerns of the patients and explain to them the necessary health information (relating to medication and lifestyle modifications) in detail, as reported in online supplemental table 1.

Treatment and management of patients

The key points that were discussed by HCPs pertaining to treatment and management of persons with the condition included the lack of availability of certain medications for non-Qatari patients such as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists drugs, the need for innovative strategies for high-risk patient groups and further expanding the information channels regarding medication (online supplemental table 1).

More, the HCPs highlighted that the deranged biomarkers of high-risk patients (such as extremely elevated blood sugar levels) can pose a challenge in planning an intervention and procedure to manage a complication resulting from uncontrolled diabetes of the patients. For example, an ophthalmologist reported:

There is problem when I plan to manage diabetic retinopathy or retinal hemorrhage some of the patients may require giving injection or perform a surgery but having highly elevated… uncontrolled blood sugar levels/high diabetic sugar we cannot perform the procedure. That can pose as a challenge in management of the associated eye complication which requires surgery. (PT7)

Desirable health outcomes

According to the HCPs perspective, the desirable health outcomes for persons with diabetes outside target range HbA1c levels resulting from them accessing primary care clinics were optimal glycaemic control, regularly following treatment plans and strengthening and reinforcing health education for the patients to help them make the necessary behaviour and lifestyle modifications to control their disease condition and prevent complications and comorbidities (online supplemental table 1).

### Family physician and endocrinologist coordination as the basis for diabetes care in clinical practice [^d0fec45a]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular morbidity is a major burden in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The estimated risk of death is two to six times fold compared with the non-diabetic population. Intensive treatment of multiple modifiable risk factors including hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, waist perimeter, physical inactivity and smoking reduces micro and macrovascular events.

Data from the Steno 2 study show that a multifactorial intervention involving multiple risk factors significantly reduces the risk of both cardiovascular and microvascular events. However, other approaches are possible. Patients assigned to conventional treatment were treated by their general physicians (GP). Meanwhile these assigned to the intensive group were followed up by a specialized team at the Steno Diabetes Centre. Glycemic targets during last period of follow-up were similar in both groups. Despite suboptimal glycemic control in both groups, GPs were unable to achieve low-risk values in a similar percentage of patients as the specialized centre, indicating scope for diabetes management at primary care level to be improved. Inadequate glycemic and modifiable risk factors control are due both to patient non adherence, and to the failure of providers to initiate or intensify the therapy appropriately. In addition, GP care without well developed support for family doctors was associated with adverse outcomes for diabetic patients. In shared care schemes featuring more intensive support there was no difference in mortality between care in hospital and care in general practice, glycated haemoglobin tended to be lower in primary care and losses to follow up were significantly lower in the primary care setting. Surveys in Spain revealed that metabolic control of diabetic subjects treated at primary care level was worse than in diabetes centres. These finding suggested that diabetes management in primary care level might be improved if diabetes specialist strategies were implemented by GP.

### Comparison of the adherence to the American diabetes association guidelines of diabetes care in primary care and subspecialty clinics [^c36b9572]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

This study was approved by the Michigan State University and Sparrow Hospital Institutional Review Boards. ADA recommends that A1c should be determined at least two times a year in patients who are meeting treatment goals and who have stable glycemia control and quarterly in patients whose therapy has changed or who are not meeting glycemic goals. For blood pressure control, the ADA recommends that hypertension should be treated to a systolic blood pressure goal of < 140 mmHg and a diastolic goal of < 80 mmHg. Lower systolic blood pressure targets such as < 130 mmHg may be appropriate for certain individuals, such as younger patients, if it can be achieved without undue treatment burden. However, in the earlier versions of the ADA guidelines, the recommended blood pressure target was < 130/80, and we have used that level to determine if blood pressure was controlled or not. For lipid levels, the ADA recommends that, individuals without overt cardiovascular disease, the goals should be: LDL cholesterol < 100 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol > 50 mg/dL for women and > 40 mg/dL for men and triglycerides < 150 mg/dL.

Study population

390 randomly selected charts of adult patients with diabetes from diabetes (DM), Internal Medicine (IM) and Family practice (FP) clinics at Michigan State University (MSU) were retrospectively reviewed. The DM clinic is located in one of our affiliated hospitals and provides subspecialty care to a referral population of approximately 1 million around Lansing, the capital city of Michigan. Diabetes care at this center is delivered by 2 board certified endocrinologists (who are also full time faculty members of the MSU Department of Medicine), 3 endocrinology fellows, 2 nurse-practitioners, and 2 dietitians. All non-physician health care providers at the center are certified diabetes educators. Patients at the DM clinic are typically seen only by referral from another physician and are transferred back to their primary care physician when their diabetes care is optimized. The IM and FP clinics are located in the outpatient facilities of MSU and cater to patients with a variety of illnesses including diabetes. Providers at the Internal Medicine clinic and Family Practice clinics are board certified internists, family practitioners as well as resident physicians who work under the supervision of an attending physician.

### Hormonal evaluation of hyperandrogenism in women… [^e0b56ce4]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

A 19-year-old woman presented to her primary care physician for evaluation of oligomenorrhea. She has had fewer than 6 menstrual cycles per year since menarche at 13 years of age. Her last menstrual cycle was 9 months ago, and at that time, she sought gynecologic evaluation. Her gynecologist considered the possibility of polycystic ovary syndrome and obtained laboratory measurements for thyrotropin, prolactin, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone but questioned the diagnosis of PCOS because of a normal luteinizing hormone-to-follicle-stimulating hormone ratio.

### Optimizing multidisciplinary care of patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus [^3592da52]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Multidisciplinary Team Approach to Reducing Risk of Chronic Kidney Disease Progression in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Chronic Kidney Disease

Assuming there are no significant barriers to referrals, patients with T2DM receiving a CKD diagnosis (particularly a diagnosis of CKD stages 3–5) will probably work with an MDT who includes a specialist clinician as well as continue to receive ongoing care from primary care. This expanded team is probably the ideal situation. Indeed, the recent American Diabetes Association (ADA)–Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) consensus report recommends a MDT-based integrative approach (particularly for those with stages 3–5 CKD). Furthermore, MDTs in CKD care are associated with improved outcomes for patients with advanced-stage CKD versus alternatives (non-MDT) care approaches. Two separate systematic reviews found that MDTs in CKD care were associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality and temporary catheterization for dialysis, and possibly also a reduced risk of hospitalization, versus non-MDT care. MDTs are also associated with a risk reduction of 36% for kidney replacement in patients with advanced CKD versus non-MDT care. MDTs also appear to have cost benefits versus non-MDT care. The specialist clinicians within the MDT caring for a patient with CKD will probably include a nephrologist (usually for patients with CKD stages 4–5) and possibly other specialists (if not already included), such as a cardiologist and/or endocrinologist if the patient has ongoing resistant hyperglycemia and/or comorbid CVD (both are also risk factors for CKD progression). Indeed, the average MDT involved in CKD care is composed of four members (plus the patient), with a nephrologist the most common non-primary care team member.

### Diagnosis and management of diabetes: synopsis of the 2016 American diabetes association standards of medical care in diabetes [^511a1f4f]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Description

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) published the 2016 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes (Standards) to provide clinicians, patients, researchers, payers, and other interested parties with the components of diabetes care, general treatment goals, and tools to evaluate the quality of care.

Methods

The ADA Professional Practice Committee performed a systematic search on MEDLINE to revise or clarify recommendations based on new evidence. The committee assigns the recommendations a rating of A, B, or C, depending on the quality of evidence. The E rating for expert opinion is assigned to recommendations based on expert consensus or clinical experience. The Standards were reviewed and approved by the Executive Committee of the ADA Board of Directors, which includes health care professionals, scientists, and laypersons. Feedback from the larger clinical community was incorporated into the 2016 revision.

Recommendations

The synopsis focuses on 8 key areas that are important to primary care providers. The recommendations highlight individualized care to manage the disease, prevent or delay complications, and improve outcomes.

### Optimizing multidisciplinary care of patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus [^134b5b92]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Adapted from de Boer et al. under a CC-BY license

Early identification and management of CKD is needed to prevent CKD progression and CV events. CKD treatment guidelines provide recommendations about how and when to screen for CKD as well as test result thresholds for referrals, and the relevance of these recommendations has been reported previously. However, many clinical practices have not incorporated these recommendations. Early detection, usually within the primary care setting, reduces the risk of progression and risk of requiring kidney replacement therapy (dialysis or transplantation), which is expensive and can have significant health status and quality-of-life implications for a patient.

Primary care clinicians typically focus on managing modifiable risk factors in patients with T2DM and CKD, including blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and albuminuria, as well as monitoring kidney function and coordinating care. However, it is typically the role of specialists, such as nephrologists, to consider treatment and associated CV risk in patients with advanced CKD. Patient transition from primary to secondary specialist care usually occurs following referral from a primary care clinician; therefore, the latter are often considered gatekeepers to further care. When a patient with T2DM visits their primary care clinician, if all confirmatory kidney screening tests point to CKD, they should be referred to a nephrologist, particularly when the test results show UACR > 300 mg/g and/or eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m². Although the criteria for when this should happen are included in the ADA-KDIGO 2022 consensus report (Fig. 1), it is important to consider the practitioner's comfort level with the management and treatment of these patients.

### 2019 endocrine society measures set for older adults with type 2 diabetes who are at risk for hypoglycemia [^97080d95]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

Hypoglycemia in the outpatient setting has a significant financial impact on the health care system and negative impact on a person's quality of life. Primary care physicians must address a multitude of issues in a visit with a person with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), often leaving little time to ask about hypoglycemia.

Objective

To develop quality measures that focus on outpatient hypoglycemia episodes for patients 65 and older with T2DM, which facilitate a clinician's ability to identify opportunities to improve the quality of care and reduce hypoglycemic episodes.

Participants and Process

A technical expert panel established by the Endocrine Society in March 2019, which includes endocrinologists, primary care physicians, a diabetes care and education specialist/pharmacist, and a patient, developed 3 outpatient hypoglycemia quality measures. The measure set is intended to improve quality of care for patients with T2DM who are at greatest risk for hypoglycemia. The measures were available for public comment in July 2019. A fourth measure on shared decision-making was removed from the final measure set based on public feedback.

Conclusion

A lack of outpatient hypoglycemia measures focusing on older adults with T2DM is a barrier to improving care of people with diabetes and reducing hypoglycemic episodes. This paper provides measure specifications for 3 measures that may be used to focus quality improvement efforts on patients at greatest risk for hypoglycemia.

### Developing services to support the delivery of care to people with early-onset type 2 diabetes [^8e41e1d9]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

6.1 A suggested strategy

A sustainable, age focussed, integrated care partnership between primary care and specialist services is likely to be the most productive approach to addressing the needs of those with early‐onset type 2 diabetes. In England, this is in keeping with the NHS Long TermPlan and there will be a need for policy‐makers, internationally, to understand how this partnership can manifest in their own healthcare settings.

Globally, the prevalence of early‐onset type 2 diabetes is variable with cases in some low and middle‐income countriesexceeding high‐income countries. National strategies will need to be tailored to the needs of the population, the organisation of healthcare and the resources available.

A variety of approaches are likely to be needed, as a single service model is unlikely to fulfil the needs of all communities or geographical locations. These models must take into consideration variability in local geographical caseload, ethnic diversity of affected individuals, local resources, and the availability of relevant expertise across the sector. See Figure 2 for a schematic outlining the key components. Furthermore, it is inevitable that not all initiatives will be successful so it is important that each is accompanied by ongoing monitoring and evaluation using the NDA and local data.

FIGURE 2
A schematic representation of key aspects of a model of care for those with early‐onset type 2 diabetes. A diagnosis of type 2 diabetes below 40 years could (1) prompt the consideration of specialist tests of atypical features present. Following confirmation of subtype, (2) a 'low risk' patient (most would be at diagnosis) could be referred to a GP with a special interest in early‐onset type 2 diabetes who has developed relevant skills. If an individual became 'higher risk' at any time (3) they could be referred to a community diabetes clinic with specialist input or access to a multi‐disciplinary team with further referral to secondary care services when needed. An over‐arching theme of this integrated community system would be a data‐driven approach with knowledge of numbers of the affected individuals in a geography, proportions meeting the three treatment targets and receiving the eight/nine care processes and other demographic characteristics that may warrant approaches that drive better engagement.

Irrespective of the model of care most appropriate for a given geographical location, it is likely to require the following key components:

6. Diabetes care providers in the hospital

Inpatient diabetes management may be effectively provided by primary care physicians, endocrinologists, or hospitalists, but involvement of appropriately trained specialists or specialty teams may reduce length of stay, improve glycemic control, and improve outcomes. In the care of diabetes, implementation of standardized order sets for scheduled and correction-dose insulin may reduce reliance on sliding-scale management. A team approach is needed to establish hospital pathways. To achieve glycemic targets associated with improved hospital outcomes, hospitals will need multidisciplinary support for using insulin infusion therapy outside of critical care units or will need to develop protocols for subcutaneous insulin therapy that effectively and safely achieve glycemic targets.

7. DSME in the hospital

Teaching diabetes self-management to patients in hospitals is a challenging task. Patients are ill, under increased stress related to their hospitalization and diagnosis, and in an environment not conducive to learning. Ideally, people with diabetes should be taught at a time and place conducive to learning, as outpatients in a recognized program of diabetes education.

For the hospitalized patient, diabetes "survival skills" education is generally a feasible approach. Patients and/or family members receive sufficient information and training to enable safe care at home. Those newly diagnosed with diabetes or who are new to insulin and/or blood glucose monitoring need to be instructed before discharge. Those patients hospitalized because of a crisis related to diabetes management or poor care at home need education to prevent subsequent episodes of hospitalization. An assessment of the need for a home health referral or referral to an outpatient diabetes education program should be part of discharge planning for all patients.

8. MNT in the hospital

Hospital diets continue to be ordered by calorie levels based on the "ADA diet". However, since 1994 the ADA has not endorsed any single meal plan or specified percentages of macronutrients, and the term "ADA diet" should no longer be used. Current nutrition recommendations advise individualization based on treatment goals, physiologic parameters, and medication usage. Because of the complexity of nutrition issues in the hospital, a registered dietitian, knowledgeable and skilled in MNT, should serve as an inpatient team member. The dietitian is responsible for integrating information about the patient's clinical condition, eating, and lifestyle habits and for establishing treatment goals in order to determine a realistic plan for nutrition therapy.

Moreover, "Any report of a change in mobility, presence of falls, noticeable decrease in IADLs after recent discharge from a hospital, or presence of continuing fatigue should prompt the clinician to screen for functional loss and/or frailty", and "An initial screen for physical impairment can be obtained by using the commonly employed measures in geriatric practice".

### Referral and consultation communication between primary care and specialist physicians: finding common ground… [^d7245b10]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Care coordination requires that PCPs referring patients to specialists communicate timely, relevant patient information and the reason for the referral and that specialists communicate findings and recommendations back to the PCP. 21 Equally important is the receipt and recognition of this information by the respective parties. 1 On the basis of primary care and chronic care frameworks, 1, 22 we examined factors hypothesized to influence these components of communication. We used 4 questions adapted from the Primary Care Assessment Tool, Provider Survey. 23 We asked PCPs, "When referring a patient to a specialist, how often do you send the specialist notification of the patient's history and the reason for consultation. " and "How often do you receive useful information about your referred patients from specialists".

We asked physicians about the extent to which they thought they had adequate time to spend with their patients during office visits and the practices' payer mix. Because practices caring for patients with more complex and comorbid conditions face greater coordination challenges, we assessed whether the practice cared for patients with 1 or more of 4 prevalent and costly chronic conditions and the percentage of the physician's patients with any chronic condition. Practice supports for patients with chronic conditions indicate a capacity for care management and are hypothesized to be associated with communication in connection with consultations and referrals.

These supports include nonphysician patient educators, nurse care managers, and the receipt by the physician of quality reports regarding his/her patients with chronic conditions. 22–24 These items were asked of physicians in practices treating any 1 of 4 prevalent chronic conditions. We also assessed the presence and use of HIT in the practice, focusing on elements with the potential to support communication and information sharing. Physicians who have practiced 20 years or more and physicians in small and nonmetropolitan areas report sending and receiving communication regarding referrals and consultations at higher rates than their counterparts, regardless of specialty. The PCPs in group- and staff-model HMOs, community health centers, and hospital or medical school practices report sending referral information to specialists at higher rates than counterparts in group practices.

Among PCPs, reports of sending communication to specialists decreased as the number of managed care contracts increased. For specialists, this association was in the opposite direction.

### Options for combination therapy in type 2 diabetes: comparison of the ADA / EASD position statement and AACE / ACE algorithm [^6e576906]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Treating patients with diabetes is one of the most challenging and important activities a physician (primary care physician or specialist) can undertake. A key to successful therapy for type 2 diabetes is the insight that this condition is progressive and that the need for additional agents over time is normative. The ability to individualize therapy by patient and medication characteristics comes from experience and knowledge of pertinent clinical studies. However, guidelines from expert bodies such as the American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology can help clinicians of all levels of expertise to approach therapy choices more rationally. There is unity across these guidelines about the role and benefits of metformin as first-line pharmacological treatment, probability of good efficacy, low risk of hypoglycemia, modest weight loss, and overall long-term data. Unfortunately, this unity does not extend to recommendations for subsequent pharmacological agents and their use in combination to intensify treatment when insulin is not (yet) appropriate. Across both statements, some drug classes seem more prominent, and looking at their benefit-risk profile, it is clear why this is the case. The most profound recent change in diabetes therapy has been the introduction of incretin therapies. Incretin therapies minimize 2 important adverse effects seen with many other therapies: hypoglycemia and weight gain. These agents have increased the range of options available for early intensification of treatment of type 2 diabetes. In combination with more established therapies, there are more opportunities than ever to accommodate patient preferences while improving glycemic control and harnessing extraglycemic benefits of a second (or third) agent.

### When there is too much to do: how practicing physicians prioritize among recommended interventions [^278187a3]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Recent evidence suggests that patients are receiving only 50% of recommended processes of care. It is important to understand physician priorities among recommended interventions and how these priorities are influenced both intentionally as well as unintentionally.

Methods

A survey was mailed to all primary care physicians (PCPs) from two VA hospital networks (N = 289), one of which had participated in a broad, evidence-based guideline development effort 8 to 12 months earlier, and all endocrinologists nationwide in the VA (N = 213); response rate, 63% (n = 315). Using the method of paired comparisons, we assessed physician priorities among 11 clinical triggers for interventions in the management of an uncomplicated patient with type 2 diabetes.

Results

Both PCPs and specialists consistently identified several high-impact clinical triggers for treatment as the highest priority interventions (hemoglobin A1c = 9.5%, diastolic blood pressure [DBP] = 95 mm Hg, low-density lipoprotein = 145 mg/dl). Several low-impact interventions that are commonly used as performance measures also received relatively high ratings. Treatments that have recently been found to be highly beneficial were often rated as being of low importance (e.g., treating when DBP = 88 mm Hg). Almost 80% of PCPs rated tight glycemic control as more important than tight DBP control, in direct contrast to clinical trial evidence. Specialists' ratings followed the same general pattern, but were more consistent with the epidemiological evidence. The PCPs at the sites that participated in the guideline intervention rated blood pressure control significantly higher.

Conclusion

Although several high-priority aspects of diabetes care were clearly identified, there were also notable examples of ratings that were clearly inconsistent with the epidemiological literature. Recommendations based upon more recent evidence were substantially underrated and some guidelines used as performance measures were relatively overrated. These results support the arguments that a more proactive approach is needed to facilitate rapid dissemination of new high-priority findings, and that intervention priority, and not just ease of measurement, should be considered carefully when disseminating guidelines and when selecting performance measures.

### Lean implementation for graduating optimally controlled stable type 2 diabetics from endocrine specialty clinic back to primary care [^0d561c65]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

A team-based Graduation program including a compact with PC to graduate stable diabetic patients back to PC was successfully designed, implemented, and sustained in the Endocrine SC. Within 4 months of implementation, the goal of graduating 5% of the stable diabetes patients back to PC was accomplished. This increased to 17% (58) by 6 months, demonstrating feasibility to open access to the Endocrine clinic for the care of new uncontrolled diabetes patients.

Why This Is Important

Timely access to SC for PC patients can be critically important both for patient health and for PCPs with endocrinology-related dilemmas. With only 8046 US endocrinologistsand 10% of the US population with a diagnosis of diabetes, mismatch between the inadequate endocrine workforce –, and a high clinical demand might result in backlog and long wait times for diabetes SC care. More efficient (less wasteful) matching of provider skill level to diabetes care needs might improve the timeliness of access to specialty level diabetes care. This could be accomplished in two ways: (1) Optimizing team-based care within diabetes clinics with more Advanced Practice Providers (APPs) and Certified Diabetes Educators (CDEs) or (2) Optimizing cooperation with PC. Engaging with PC has a potentially bigger impact given its greater population level reach. This was the approach taken in this paper.

Changing Culture and Expectations

Achieving optimal health system efficiency relative to specialty use and access involves setting and changing culture at multiple levels, including expectations of patients, referring physicians, diabetes specialists. During the project, we encountered several cultural issues that needed to be addressed in our setting and will likely be encountered by others.

Team-Based Care

Teamwork is foundational to optimal diabetes careincluding the use of endocrinologists, SC APPs, CDEs, and PCPs, each bringing unique skills and potential for diabetes care improvement. Unfortunately, endocrinologists found that patients did not always agree to see team members other than their endocrinologist.

Primary Care in an Academic Multispecialty System

Recognition of PCPs as key members of the diabetes team, or even as experts in comprehensive care, had not been systemically acculturated either at the patient or the provider level. Formally bringing PCPs into the team with specified roles and processes (compact) is an important shift within an academic health system culture.

Patient Expectations

Patient resistance was the explicit reason for non-graduation in a minority of patients (10%). Endocrinologists sometimes reported that patients expressed fears of "break up" or abandonment by the diabetes care physician.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2010 [^cd3be24f]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a chronic illness that requires continuing medical care and ongoing patient self-management education and support to prevent acute complications and to reduce the risk of long-term complications. Diabetes care is complex and requires that many issues, beyond glycemic control, be addressed. A large body of evidence exists that supports a range of interventions to improve diabetes outcomes.

These standards of care are intended to provide clinicians, patients, researchers, payors, and other interested individuals with the components of diabetes care, general treatment goals, and tools to evaluate the quality of care. While individual preferences, comorbidities, and other patient factors may require modification of goals, targets that are desirable for most patients with diabetes are provided. These standards are not intended to preclude clinical judgment or more extensive evaluation and management of the patient by other specialists as needed. For more detailed information about management of diabetes, refer to references–.

The recommendations included are screening, diagnostic, and therapeutic actions that are known or believed to favorably affect health outcomes of patients with diabetes. A grading system (Table 1), developed by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and modeled after existing methods, was used to clarify and codify the evidence that forms the basis for the recommendations. The level of evidence that supports each recommendation is listed after each recommendation using the letters A, B, C, or E.

Table 1
ADA evidence grading system for clinical practice recommendations

These standards of care are revised annually by the ADA multidisciplinary Professional Practice Committee, and new evidence is incorporated. Members of the Professional Practice Committee and their disclosed conflicts of interest are listed in the Introduction. Subsequently, as with all position statements, the standards of care are reviewed and approved by the Executive Committee of ADA's Board of Directors.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2020 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in CKD [^8ab96742]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). High credibility.

KDIGO 2020 — glycemic targets in diabetes with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not on dialysis recommend an individualized hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) target range from < 6.5% to < 8.0% in patients with diabetes and CKD not treated with dialysis (1C). Trials reported increased harm when strict HbA1c goals (< 6.5%) were imposed, with 31% higher all-cause mortality and 41% higher cardiovascular mortality in those randomized to intensive glycemic control, particularly notable for people with diabetes and CKD. The guideline indicates that appropriate goals for HbA1c in dialysis patients are unknown and that KDIGO suggests lower HbA1c goals (< 6.5%) among lower-risk patients with diabetes, such as early CKD stage 1–2, fewer other health issues, at low hypoglycemic risk, and with good support systems, whereas patients with significant comorbidities and/or limited life expectancy may be candidates for higher HbA1c (eg, < 8%), especially if they are taking insulin, sulfonylureas, or glinides. Safe achievement of optimal HbA1c targets may be facilitated by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) or self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and by selection of antihyperglycemic agents that are not associated with hypoglycemia, and CGM metrics, such as time in the glycemic range and duration of hypoglycemia, may be considered as alternatives to HbA1c for defining glycemic targets for patients in whom individualized HbA1c has been deemed inadequate to prevent significant hypo- or hyperglycemia and/or their complications. Referral to endocrinology or nephrology may be recommended, particularly for patients with type 1 diabetes, when the primary care provider deems the diabetes or diabetes-related CKD to be poorly controlled or outside the scope of their expertise.

### Comparison of the adherence to the American diabetes association guidelines of diabetes care in primary care and subspecialty clinics [^0694d1b7]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Several studies comparing specialist and general practitioner care in diabetes failed to show a consistent superiority of specialist care in diabetes outcomes. In results from the Medical Outcomes Study, Greenfield et al. compared glycemic and BP control, visual function, foot ulcers and albumin excretion rate among endocrinology, general internist and family practice clinics, there was no significant difference in quality measures based on physician specialty except improved foot ulcer prevalence in endocrinologist care. No difference in adjusted outcome and process measures was found between specialist and primary care in another study by Greenfield et al. Similarly, Ismail et al. conducted an observational study which showed that patients seen in specialist clinics had a higher A1c at baseline than those receiving routine primary care, but there was no difference in the rate of improvement with each visit.

There are also other studies demonstrating that specialty care leads to better performance in diabetes management. A retrospective study by Ho et al. comparing specialist and generalist care in the VA setting found that the patients under specialist care had better processes of care including recording of A1c, blood pressure, foot and eye exams, but there was no measurement of outcomes in this study. Zgibor et al. studied type 1diabetic participants in the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications Study and found significantly lower mean A1c levels in those receiving specialist care. In a long term follow up study from the same population they also found that prior specialist use was significantly protective against the development of overt nephropathy, neuropathy and weakly protective against coronary artery disease. Suwattee et al. found that diabetes clinic performed better in A1c, BP and LDL outcomes compared to resident and faculty care in general medicine clinics. Although process measures were significantly more in favor of specialist care in a study by De Berardis et al. there was no difference in diabetes outcomes except total cholesterol. Uchigata et al. studied type 1 diabetics in Japan and found that those receiving specialist care were significantly less likely to develop end stage renal disease and less likely to die. In a study by Grant et al. Endocrinology clinic had better A1c, BP and LDL values and urine albumin screening. Shah et al. showed better A1c values in specialist care while Sone et al. found that baseline A1c values significantly improved under specialist management. In terms of health care expenditure, Levetan et al. showed that for patients admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis, Endocrinologist care reduced the length of stay, hospital expenditure and readmission rate.

### Changing the care pathway for type 2 diabetes at the time of diagnosis: the role of the multidisciplinary team [^d99faa8b]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Conventionally, specialists become involved in the later stages of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, whereas evidence supports the role of time‐limited specialist input at the start of the treatment journey 1. The diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes should be seen as a key opportunity for multidisciplinary teams to intensify therapy aimed at quickly correcting underlying metabolic dysfunction.

Insulin resistance can precede diabetes for a decade 2, during which time β‐cell dysfunction and a higher cardiovascular risk have accrued 2. Over half of people with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes have evidence of diabetes‐related tissue damage 3; therefore, by the time of diagnosis, many years of metabolic dysfunction may have elapsed. Further treatment delay, in the belief that the condition is 'new' or 'mild', cannot be justified.

Current guidelines persist with the concept of a stepwise process to achieve glycaemic control: initial lifestyle intervention, followed by oral agents as monotherapy and then in combination, and finally insulin or glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist therapy 4. This paradigm is responsive to poor metabolic control after it has developed and mitigates against proactive intensification early in the disease trajectory. The National Institute for Clinical and Health Excellence (NICE) advocates continuation of pharmacological treatment until HbA 1c levels are ≥ 59 mmol/mol (7.5%) 4, which has been dubbed a 'treatment to failure' approach 5.

### Preexisting diabetes and pregnancy: an endocrine society and European Society of Endocrinology joint clinical practice guideline [^b48bf60b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Research considerations for screening for pregnancy intention in diabetes — study designs and priority outcomes — are specified: "Direct evidence from pragmatic RCTs is needed to evaluate the benefit of the intervention of a screening question in individuals with diabetes who could become pregnant. Implementation studies are also needed". Suggested evaluations include changes in rates of "1) contraception prescription or referral to a family planning clinic, 2) referral for PCC, 3) unplanned pregnancy, 4) HbA1c at first prenatal visit, and 5) congenital malformations", and assessing whether paired screening questions increase contraception use and decrease HbA1c at the first prenatal visit. Further priorities include "comparing the outcomes of interest and associated costs/savings" across automated reminder/communication approaches, testing "different models of screening (eg, annually)" and "ideal healthcare settings (eg, primary care, urgent care)", and "Addressing the knowledge gap of endocrinologists and primary care clinicians regarding safe and effective contraceptive prescribing".

### Evaluation, intervention, and follow-up of patients with diabetes in a primary health care setting in Brazil: the importance of a specialized mobile consultancy [^e68ab262]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2016). Low credibility.

Education in DM increases patients' self-care, improving their glycemic control and knowledge of the disease. Evidence suggests that educational programs conducted in groups improve cost-effectiveness, particularly in adults with T2DM. In patients with T1DM, the improvement is mainly observed in the psychosocial sphere. In Brazil, a randomized, prospective, multicenter study including individuals with T1DM and T2DM, known as Projeto DOCE ® (Diabetes Aiming Control and Education, Diabetes Objetivando Controle e Educação), developed by a multiprofessional team, showed significant improvement in blood glucose control, but no variation in quality of life scores.

Considering the imbalanced distribution of endocrinologists in Brazil, where most specialists (76.08%) are concentrated in the country's southeastern and southern areas, the current challenge is to provide better job opportunities and professional training continuity in less served regions, allowing a more balanced distribution of specialists operating both in public and private health sectors, and in small and large urban centers.

Considering the precariousness of the glycemic control in patients with DM worldwide, and the direct implications that poor glycemic control imposes on the risk of development of complications and health expenses, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the action of a mobile consultancy unit specialized in DM on clinical and laboratory parameters, as well as on the degree of knowledge of and satisfaction with the disease in patients with T2DM in a primary health care network in Brazil.

### Management of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents [^6cc78466]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Over the past 3 decades, the prevalence of childhood obesity has increased dramatically in North America, ushering in a variety of health problems, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which previously was not typically seen until much later in life. The rapid emergence of childhood T2DM poses challenges to many physicians who find themselves generally ill-equipped to treat adult diseases encountered in children. This clinical practice guideline was developed to provide evidence-based recommendations on managing 10- to 18-year-old patients in whom T2DM has been diagnosed. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) convened a Subcommittee on Management of T2DM in Children and Adolescents with the support of the American Diabetes Association, the Pediatric Endocrine Society, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (formerly the American Dietetic Association). These groups collaborated to develop an evidence report that served as a major source of information for these practice guideline recommendations. The guideline emphasizes the use of management modalities that have been shown to affect clinical outcomes in this pediatric population. Recommendations are made for situations in which either insulin or metformin is the preferred first-line treatment of children and adolescents with T2DM. The recommendations suggest integrating lifestyle modifications (ie, diet and exercise) in concert with medication rather than as an isolated initial treatment approach. Guidelines for frequency of monitoring hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and finger-stick blood glucose (BG) concentrations are presented. Decisions were made on the basis of a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and strength of recommendation. The clinical practice guideline underwent peer review before it was approved by the AAP. This clinical practice guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for the care of all children with T2DM, and its recommendations may not provide the only appropriate approach to the management of children with T2DM. Providers should consult experts trained in the care of children and adolescents with T2DM when treatment goals are not met or when therapy with insulin is initiated. The AAP acknowledges that some primary care clinicians may not be confident of their ability to successfully treat T2DM in a child because of the child's age, coexisting conditions, and/or other concerns. At any point at which a clinician feels he or she is not adequately trained or is uncertain about treatment, a referral to a pediatric medical subspecialist should be made. If a diagnosis of T2DM is made by a pediatric medical subspecialist, the primary care clinician should develop a comanagement strategy with the subspecialist to ensure that the child continues to receive appropriate care consistent with a medical home model in which the pediatrician partners with parents to ensure that all health needs are met.

### Primary care endocrinology in the adult woman [^7bbf157f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus, thyroid disorders, and osteoporosis are endocrine conditions affecting a significant proportion of women presenting to the obstetrician-gynecologist. Obstetrician-gynecologists are often the first health-care providers that young women see in adulthood, and thus, have a critical opportunity to identify women at risk for gestational and overt diabetes and manage the condition in those who have developed it. The obstetrician-gynecologist should be aware of the appropriate therapeutic options and treatment goals (eg, hemoglobin A1c) for women with diabetes. Thyroid disorders often present with menstrual irregularities or infertility, can affect pregnancy outcomes, and contribute to cardiovascular and bone disorders as women age. Finally, osteoporosis and low bone mineral density affect a substantial proportion of older women and some younger women with risk factors for secondary osteoporosis. The morbidity and mortality of osteoporotic fractures is substantial. There are many lifestyle interventions and therapeutic options available for these conditions, and the gynecologist plays a key role in optimizing risk factor assessment, screening, and providing treatment when appropriate.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in primary care and endocrinology clinical settings: Co-sponsored by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) [^8a46c41a]. Endocrine Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide evidence-based recommendations regarding the diagnosis and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to endocrinologists, primary care clinicians, health care professionals, and other stakeholders.

Methods

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology conducted literature searches for relevant articles published from January 1, 2010, to November 15, 2021. A task force of medical experts developed evidence-based guideline recommendations based on a review of clinical evidence, expertise, and informal consensus, according to established American Association of Clinical Endocrinology protocol for guideline development.

Recommendation Summary

This guideline includes 34 evidence-based clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of persons with NAFLD and/or NASH and contains 385 citations that inform the evidence base.

Conclusion

NAFLD is a major public health problem that will only worsen in the future, as it is closely linked to the epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Given this link, endocrinologists and primary care physicians are in an ideal position to identify persons at risk on to prevent the development of cirrhosis and comorbidities. While no U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved medications to treat NAFLD are currently available, management can include lifestyle changes that promote an energy deficit leading to weight loss; consideration of weight loss medications, particularly glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists; and bariatric surgery, for persons who have obesity, as well as some diabetes medications, such as pioglitazone and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, for those with type 2 diabetes mellitus and NASH. Management should also promote cardiometabolic health and reduce the increased cardiovascular risk associated with this complex disease.

### Management of people with type 2 diabetes shared between a specialized outpatient clinic and primary health care is noninferior to management in a specialized outpatient clinic: a randomized, noninferiority trial [^3947d67e]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

To evaluate whether management of people with Type 2 diabetes shared between a specialized outpatient clinic and primary health care has noninferior HbA 1c outcomes compared with mono-sectorial management in a specialized outpatient clinic.

Methods

A randomized controlled, noninferiority study. People with moderate hyperglycaemia, hypertension and/or incipient complications were eligible for the study. All participants had annual comprehensive check-ups at the outpatient clinic. Quarterly check-ups were conducted by general practitioners (GPs) for the shared care group and by endocrinologists at the outpatient clinic for the control group. The primary outcome was the mean difference in HbA 1c from baseline to 12 months of follow-up. The noninferiority margin for HbA 1c was 4.4 mmol/mol.

Results

A total of 140 people were randomized [age 65.0 ± 0.9 years, HbA 1c 52 ± 0.8 mmol/mol (6.9 ± 0.1%), systolic BP 135.6 ± 1.1 mmHg; all mean ± sem]. Peripheral neuropathy was present in 68% of participants and microalbuminuria in 19%; 15% had history of a previous major cardiovascular event. Among study completers (n = 133), HbA 1c increased by 2.3 mmol/mol (0.2%) in the shared care group and by 1.0 mmol/mol (0.1%) in the control group, with a between-group difference of 1.3 mmol/mol [90% confidence interval (CI) -1.3, 3.9] (0.1%, 90% CI -0.1, 0.4). Noninferiority was confirmed in both per protocol and intention to treat analyses.

Conclusion

We found that our shared care programme was noninferior to specialized outpatient management in maintaining glycaemic control in this group of people with Type 2 diabetes. Shared care should be considered for the future diabetes management of Type 2 diabetes.

### Specialist general practitioners and diabetes clinics in primary care: a qualitative and descriptive evaluation [^56142920]. Diabetic Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Aims

The aim of this study was to evaluate an innovative approach to the provision of primary care-based diabetes services in Bradford, UK. The service model differs from others in comprising 19 clinics which offer a specialist service, intermediate between primary and secondary care, to all patients within the Bradford area.

Methods

The study included: analysis of referral, attendance and register data; questionnaires to general practitioners (GPs) and specialist clinic providers; qualitative interviews with clinic and other professional staff and patients; and an economic analysis.

Results

The 19 clinics adopt a range of organizational models. In the first 3 1/2 years, 2415 patients were referred. There was a significant reduction in out-patient attendances at hospital, but also a significant increase in overall patient attendances. Specialist clinic patients differed from hospital patients in being older and having had diabetes for longer since diagnosis. Ten of the 14 clinics run by practising GPs attracted more referrals from within their practices than from outside. GPs and patients across the city believed the clinics were valuable, the main benefits being geographical accessibility, availability of specialists in a community setting, short waiting times for first appointments at most clinics, and continuity of staff. Their reservations included a lack of strategic planning in the location of clinics, long waiting times at some clinics, and poor communication at some clinics with referring GPs. The cost of the primary care clinics is similar to hospital clinics.

Conclusions

This model of specialist primary care services offers an opportunity to develop diabetes services that are convenient to patients, popular with practitioners, and increase capacity. However, the shortcomings as well as the advantages of the model need to be addressed if it is to be implemented elsewhere or for other patient groups.

### Recommendations for early and comprehensive management of type 2 diabetes and its related cardio-renal complications [^7f8f2da6]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Collaborative Multidisciplinary Care

Diabetes is a chronic and complex disease that imposes a heavy economic burden on patients and healthcare systems alike, and requires lifestyle modifications and pharmacotherapy. Hence, a multidisciplinary collaborative care approach may be more effective in allowing some people to cope with the demands of controlling this complex disease.

Multidisciplinary collaborative care usually involves at least two care providers working together with patients and their caregivers, with the overall aim to achieve shared goals within and across settings that provide coordinated, high-quality patient-centered care and improve clinical and humanistic outcomes. A patient with T2D should preferably be followed by a diabetes expert if this is possible. This expert might then refer the patient to another specialist when it is medically appropriate. Since T2D is frequently associated with overweight, DKD, hypertension, and CVD, accurate referrals should be based on comorbidity priority order. For instance, if diabetic retinopathy is evident on screening, prompt referral to an ophthalmologist is recommended. In addition, and per KDIGO 2012 guidelines on CKD management and the recent 2022 consensus statement addressing diabetic patients in particular, patients should be referred for evaluation by a nephrologist if they have an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², or UACR consistently > 300 mg/g, or if there is uncertainty about the etiology of kidney disease, difficulty in the management of renal issues, or rapid progression of kidney disease. Similarly, patients with risk factors or symptoms placing them at high risk for CVD should be referred to a cardiologist. Such conditions include but are not limited to difficulty in controlling high BP or dyslipidemia, shortness of breath, chest pain, and fatigue. In all these scenarios, close collaboration between different specialists and the patient should be at the heart of decision-making.

### Causal deep learning reveals the comparative effectiveness of antihyperglycemic treatments in poorly controlled diabetes [^4f10ed6d]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that ~13% of the adult population of the United States (US), or about 34 million people, have been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. When insufficiently managed, diabetes leads to complications including cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, neuropathy, and blindness, any of which can dramatically impair an individual's quality of life. The high prevalence of diabetes and concomitant complications put a major burden on the US healthcare system in terms of care utilization and costs, with one recent report estimating that one of every four healthcare spending dollars in the US can be directly attributed to diabetes.

Diabetes is typically managed by a combination of lifestyle interventions and pharmacological treatments. For the latter, current guidelines stipulate that unless otherwise contraindicated, initial therapy for type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) should be metformin. If this first-line therapy is insufficient, combination therapy with antihyperglycemic drugs from two or more classes is suggested. There are multiple second-line choices with various risks and benefits, and a clinician may therefore need to attempt multiple treatment combinations before finding one that works for their patient. There have been efforts to determine sequential treatment of diabetes, both with data-driven informatics methodsand with expert-curated guidelines; however, both of these approaches take into account a few patient-specific characteristics and can be ambiguous in suggesting the next best option for an individual patient. Even when glycemic control is achieved, there is currently no simple way to know whether a different combination might be superior for a given patient, either by providing greater glycemic control, by simultaneously managing comorbidities, or by providing equivalent control at a lower cost, or with fewer total drugs or with fewer side effects. Indeed, the enormous heterogeneity of treatment decisions observed in daily clinical practice is indicative that optimal treatment regimens have not been identified. Given the complexity of diabetes treatment, patients can often benefit from focused subspecialist insights, such as referral to an endocrinologist. However, subspecialist care is resource-intensive and the current shortage of endocrinologists is only projected to grow, thus offering an opportunity for a data-driven understanding of the real-world comparative effectiveness of pharmacological diabetes treatment strategies to help guide T2DM management.

### Improved long-term cardiovascular outcomes after intensive versus standard screening of diabetic complications: an observational study [^bb69b565]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetes mellitus is associated with reduced life expectancy owing to severe multi-organ complications. On average, a 50-year-old man without a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) but with diabetes dies 6 year earlier than a subject without diabetes, with the majority of premature causes of death being attributable to CVD. Despite the global decline in mortality and incidence of CVD over the last decades, seen both in subjects with and without diabetes, the latter still experience a 2–3 times higher risk as compared to non-diabetic matched controls. This higher risk, combined with the high prevalence of subjects that already have cardiovascular complications at the time of diabetes diagnosis, makes the screening for chronic complications highly recommended for all patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Early identification of complications can result in the prescription of more aggressive treatment regimen that have the potential to slow their natural progression. For example, a diagnosis of autonomic neuropathy by screening identifies patients at risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Thus, results of complication screening can yield a better awareness of the interplay among micro- and microangiopathies, and help clinicians to tailor treatment and the outpatient schedule visits. In general, evidence of absence of complications or presence of multiple severe complications can both have important implications for appropriate management of diabetes and comorbidities. Poor achievement of glucose targets and the global under-utilization of glucose lowering drugs provided with cardiovascular protective effects suggests that a better screening of cardiorenal complications can promote improvements in therapeutic appropriateness for T2D.

However, the intensity and schedules of complication screening can vary considerably according to the healthcare setting (e.g. primary care versus specialist care) and availability of resources. Diagnostic workup for chronic diabetic complications should not be provided on demand based on patient's complains, but based on routine schedules as recommended by evidence-based international standards.

There is mounting evidence of lower overall mortality in diabetic patients treated by a multi-disciplinary team within diabetes specialist outpatient services versus treatment in primary care. However, it is still unknown whether, even within the same system of health care provision, screening intensity affects cardiovascular outcomes. We hypothesize that providing patients with an intensive session of multi-disciplinary screening of complications could result in better outcomes than when complications are screened in staggered sessions. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether an intensive screening of chronic complications resulted in long-term improvement of cardiovascular outcomes as compared to standard screening.

### Chronic kidney disease in diabetes [^29afd6db]. Canadian Journal of Diabetes (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus, indications for specialist referral, DC 2018 guidelines recommend to refer patients with diabetes to a specialist with expertise in CKD in the following situations:

- chronic, progressive loss of kidney function

- urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio persistently > 60 mg/mmol

- eGFR < 30 mL/min

- inability to remain on renal-protective therapies due to adverse effects, such as hyperkalemia or a > 30% increase in serum creatinine within 3 months of starting an ACEi or ARB

- inability to achieve target BP.

### Primary care physicians' utilization of type 2 diabetes screening guidelines and referrals to behavioral interventions: a survey-linked retrospective study [^230616b2]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of diabetes mellitus, largely type 2 diabetes mellitus, has reached epidemic proportions in the USA. In 2012, up to 29.1 million people were reported to have diabetes of which 28% were previously undiagnosed, with medical costs estimated to be $245 billion. Furthermore, 86 million Americans aged ≥ 20 years had pre-diabetes, with 90% unaware of it.

Early detection and management of diabetes and pre-diabetes are fundamental to preventing and treating diabetes. Expert groups, such as the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and American Diabetes Association (ADA), have recommended screening for diabetes and pre-diabetes (see online supplementary table S1). However, previous retrospective studies have shown suboptimal screening rates (46%–85%) in populations who meet ADA and/or 2008 USPSTF guidelines criteria. Furthermore, the reasons behind guideline inconsistent screening are unknown, in particular, how physicians view the guidelines and how their views relate to actual utilization. Of additional interest for this study was to understand how primary care physicians (PCPs) treat patients newly diagnosed with pre-diabetes and diabetes.

The specific objectives of this study included: (1) to assess PCPs' knowledge and attitude toward type 2 diabetes screening guidelines and preferred screening method; (2) to examine the extent of alignment (concordance) between PCPs' self-reported behavior and their actual screening practices (real-world evidence obtained from electronic medical records (EMR)); and (3) to assess the extent of PCP-driven referral to diabetes prevention and self-management education programs (DPP/DSME).

The guidelines considered in this study included the ADA and the 2008 USPSTF guidelines which were in effect during the study period. The 2015 guidelines were not evaluated as they were not finalized until after the study was in progress.

### Decreased access to bariatric care: an analysis of referral practices to bariatric specialists [^05d4476f]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Substantial evidence reveals tolerability and co-morbid disease resolution after bariatric surgery; however, few physicians refer morbidly obese patients for bariatric consultation.

Objective

To evaluate morbidly obese patient access to bariatric surgical consultation.

Setting

A multidisciplinary, private, bariatric center of excellence.

Methods

Patient surveyed in person regarding preconsultation co-morbidities, physician discussion and support for bariatric surgery, and physician referral practices.

Results

The patients' (n = 388) co-morbid profile was 27.0% diabetes, 54.1% hypertension, 30.1% hyperlipidemia, and 37.1% obstructive sleep apnea. It was reported that 71.1% of patients stated that their primary care physician did not initiate a discussion about bariatric surgery. Among this group, 59.7% of patients initiated a conversation about bariatric surgery, with 80.6% of physicians supporting the decision and 18.4% referring to a bariatric practice. Overall referring specialty profile was 14.4% primary care, 4.4% cardiology, and 3.6% endocrinology. Diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea were more likely to prompt a referral (P = 0.008 and P = 0.014, respectively).

Conclusion

Most primary care and subspecialists do not discuss bariatric surgical options, resulting in decreased access to bariatric care. The main barrier to referral is noncommunication by the primary care physician or subspecialist, despite the vast majority of physicians having positive attitudes about bariatric surgery. Co-morbidities of diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea are more likely to prompt a referral. Primary care physicians are most likely to refer, while endocrinologists are least likely. Improved familiarity with nationally recognized obesity management algorithms could contribute to improved referral rates.

### Primary care management of patients with type 2 diabetes: overcoming inertia and advancing therapy with the use of injectables [^845d04d9]. Clinical Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a progressive disease caused by insulin resistance and associated progressive β-cell functional decline, as well as multiple other related metabolic and pathophysiologic changes. Left unchecked, T2D increases the risk of long-term microvascular and cardiovascular complications and is associated with excess morbidity and mortality. Despite multiple effective options for reducing hyperglycemia, patients are not optimally managed, largely due to delays in appropriate and timely advancement of therapy. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and basal insulin are recommended by treatment guidelines as effective options for advancing therapy to achieve glycemic control. However, injected therapies often face resistance from patients and clinicians. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists are associated with weight loss, low risk of hypoglycemia, and potential beneficial cardiovascular effects. The class is recommended for patients across the spectrum of disease severity and represents an attractive option to add to basal insulin therapy when additional control is needed. Newer second-generation basal insulin analogues offer advantages over first-generation basal insulins in terms of lower hypoglycemia rates and greater flexibility in dosing. Incorporating injectable therapy into patient care in a timely manner has the potential to improve outcomes and must not be overlooked. Primary care clinicians play a significant role in managing patients with T2D, and they must be able to address and overcome patient resistance and their own barriers to advancing therapy if optimal treatment outcomes are to be achieved. The purpose of this expert opinion article was to provide a commentary on the key principle of advancing therapy with injectables to control hyperglycemia.

### Family physician and endocrinologist coordination as the basis for diabetes care in clinical practice [^771afc2a]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Since 1993 a foot care programme for people with diabetes and neuropathy is available in Area 7 of Madrid in order to reduce lower extremity amputations. Patients with peripheral vascular disease (PVD) are likely to be influenced more favourably by surgical procedures and multifactorial management. We have recently reported that diabetic subjects with PVD have a poorer control of modifiable risk factors than diabetic subjects with other clinical manifestations of cardiovascular disease. Bearing in mind that most of the type 2 diabetes patients are treated in a primary care setting, and that a better metabolic control can reduce their complications, a reduction in the burden of diabetes mellitus should be achieved with a more efficient implementation of multifactorial management at primary level. In addition, general practitioner and endocrinologist coordination should be the basis for diabetes care.

Since 2003 the Foot Care programme in Area 7 of Madrid includes also specific strategies to improve the management of diabetic patients with PVD by empowering family physicians (FP) at primary health centres to carry out multifactorial pharmacologic therapy. Meanwhile a smooth and continuous contact between FP and endocrinology service physicians is maintained.

The impact of these interventions on metabolic control of diabetic patients with PVD treated in a Primary Health Care Level was prospectively assessed over 30 months and the outcomes compared with those patients followed by endocrinologists. In these circumstances we think that FP may achieve follow up and metabolic control at least as good as endocrinologists.

### Antidiabetic treatment patterns and specialty care utilization among patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease [^521dc9bc]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2018). Low credibility.

In the current study, specialty care among the cohort of patients with established CVD was observed to be rather low, particularly by the endocrinology specialty; in fact, 81.9% of these patients did not have an appointment with the department of endocrinology within 1 year prior to December 31, 2016. This may be contributing to the low rates of SGLT-2i and GLP-1RA therapy utilization observed not only in the population of patients with established CVD, but also in those without established CVD, where the likelihood of not being seen by an endocrinologist was essentially the same (81.2%). We suspect this may be due in large part to access/availability limitations for endocrinology specialists which results in only the most "severe cases" of diabetes referred to endocrinology, a scenario likely not unique to Cleveland Clinic, unfortunately. Department of cardiology appointments were somewhat more prevalent in patients with established CVD, yet, 62.0% of such patients did not have one visit with this specialty within the last 1 year prior to December 31st, 2016. While it is possible that some of these patients may have obtained specialty care outside of Cleveland Clinic, this percentage would be expected to be low given Cleveland Clinic is a tertiary care center where patients are referred to receive specialty care. Patients with established CVD may be more likely to receive the therapies that have been demonstrated to confer CV benefit if they are seen by either endocrinology or cardiology specialists. As endocrinologists would be expected to be the most familiar with these newer therapies, the most recent diabetes management guidelines, and the results of CVOTs pertaining to antidiabetic therapies, it would seem important that patients with established CVD and type 2 diabetes be referred to endocrinology for specialty care. While cardiologists may not be likely to prescribe these antidiabetic medications directly, visits with this specialty may at least result in conversations with patients about the cardiovascular implications of diabetes and the potential utility of SGLT-2i and GLP-1RA therapies and perhaps recommendations to referring physicians. Improving access to both endocrinologists and cardiologists for patients with type 2 diabetes and established CVD would seem important given our observations that the therapies that have demonstrated CV benefit are not being readily used in this population, and given the ever-increasing complexity of diabetes and CV-risk management overall. Lastly, we observed that in both patients with and without established CVD, approximately 75% were seen by a primary care provider (IM or family medicine) at least 1 time within the 1-year observation period. In patients with established CVD, approximately 35% of patients were seen ≥ 4 times by a PCP within the same 1-year period. This observation highlights the opportunity that PCPs have to initiate these medications associated with CV risk reduction when appropriate.

### Preexisting diabetes and pregnancy: an endocrine society and European Society of Endocrinology joint clinical practice guideline [^cdb39d26]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The justification for a screening question about the possibilities of pregnancy is based on the significant benefits for PCC, which are used as a surrogate, and lack of considerable harm.

Comments

Two subgroups need additional consideration: adolescent girls/young individuals with T1DM and women with T2DM. Serious adverse pregnancy outcomes can be especially high among adolescents and young women. The early and unpredictable timing of sexual debut, the high percentage of individuals who have at least one episode of unprotected sex, the higher occurrence of major malformations (20.5%), and the high prevalence of serious adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes support early intervention to reduce risks. As is true for all individuals, contraceptive counseling for adolescents should be devoid of coercion, involve shared decision making, and respect individual autonomy. Access to contraception for adolescents should be available prior to sexual debut.

Women with T2DM may have lower awareness of pregnancy risks related to diabetes and reduced PCC attendance than do those with T1DM, as well as increased risk for certain adverse outcomes.

Research Considerations

Direct evidence from pragmatic RCTs is needed to evaluate the benefit of the intervention of a screening question in individuals with diabetes who could become pregnant. Implementation studies are also needed. Suggested studies include:

Evaluating how a screening question about pregnancy intention changes rates of 1) contraception prescription or referral to a family planning clinic, 2) referral for PCC, 3) unplanned pregnancy, 4) HbA1c at first prenatal visit, and 5) congenital malformations.
Evaluating whether pairing a screening question about pregnancy intention and a screening question about immediate contraceptive needs increases referrals for PCC or to a family planning clinic and contraceptive use and reduces unplanned pregnancies and congenital malformations as well as decreases HbA1c at the first prenatal visit.
Comparing the outcomes of interest and associated costs/savings among various approaches to screening for pregnancy intention; these approaches could include automated direct communication to individuals, automated reminders to clinic staff to prescreen at visits, and automated reminders to clinicians to screen regarding pregnancy intention during visits with protocols streamlining referrals for PCC and/or contraception provision. Similarly, evaluating the effects of different intervals of screening (eg, annually) and ideal healthcare settings (eg, primary care, urgent care) can clarify the downstream effects of screening for pregnancy intent.
Addressing the knowledge gap of endocrinologists and primary care clinicians regarding safe and effective contraceptive prescribing.

### American association of clinical endocrinology disease state clinical review: evaluation and management of immune checkpoint inhibitor-mediated endocrinopathies: a practical case-based clinical approach [^81a30c54]. Endocrine Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this case-based clinical review was to provide a practical approach for clinicians regarding the management of patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-mediated endocrinopathies.

Methods

A literature search of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus was conducted using appropriate keywords. The discussions and strategies for the diagnosis and management of ICI-mediated endocrinopathies are based on evidence available from prospective, randomized clinical studies; cohort studies; cross-sectional studies; case-based studies; and an expert consensus.

Results

Immunotherapy with ICIs has transformed the treatment landscape of diverse types of cancers but frequently results in immune-mediated endocrinopathies that can cause acute and persistent morbidity and, rarely, death. The patterns of endocrinopathies differ between the inhibitors of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 and programmed cell death protein 1 or programmed cell death protein 1 ligand pathways but most often involve the thyroid and pituitary glands. The less common but important presentations include insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus, primary adrenal insufficiency, primary hypoparathyroidism, central diabetes insipidus, primary hypogonadism, and pancreatitis, with or without subsequent progression to diabetes mellitus or exocrine insufficiency.

Conclusion

In recent years, with increasing numbers of patients with cancer being treated with ICIs, more clinicians in a variety of specialties have been called upon to diagnose and treat ICI-mediated endocrinopathies. Herein, we reviewed case scenarios of various clinical manifestations and emphasized the need for a high index of clinical suspicion by all clinicians caring for these patients, including endocrinologists, oncologists, primary care providers, and emergency department physicians. We also provided diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for ICI-induced endocrinopathies and proposed that patients on ICI therapy be evaluated and treated by a multidisciplinary team in collaboration with endocrinologists.

### Innovations in diabetes care for a better "New normal" beyond COVID-19 [^7dc8cf3d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

eConsultation

eConsults are another innovation that greatly increases the collaboration of different service lines, providing access to high-quality endocrinology care, and was particularly useful during the pandemic. eConsults are patient-specific, asynchronous virtual communication between a specialist and referring provider (typically primary care) that occurs within a shared EHR or other secure electronic platform. The benefits of eConsults across specialties are well documented and include increased access to specialty care, provider satisfaction, and educational benefits for primary care providers. More specifically, eConsults for diabetes care in the Veterans Administration Health System have resulted in more rapid access to specialty care with comparable clinical outcomes to in-person care. In COVID-19, both outpatient and inpatient eConsults have been pivotal in enabling the specialty endocrinologist to provide timely and efficient consultation. In addition, it enables endocrinologist-led foundational education to providers who benefit from real-time feedback on cases, which can bring back joy to endocrinology work.

Project ECHO

Project ECHO is a scalable, global, evidence-based telementoring program that aims to build internal capacity of primary care providers for diabetes care through ongoing case-based learning. The format includes a "hub" (eg, endocrinologist) that engages with a geographically dispersed group of primary care clinicians (spokes) by video, who present their cases on a routine basis and progressively build local diabetes expertise. Initial centralization of knowledge acquisition followed by dissemination to multiple primary care providers enhances the reach of endocrinology far beyond specialist capacity, holding great promise for continued reach of new therapeutics to the masses. Diabetes/endocrinology ECHO programs are currently active in 4 countries and are of greatest value when targeting primary care providers with limited access to specialty care (e.g. community health centers).

### Disrupted specialist outpatient services and alternative modes of service for patients with diabetes mellitus: a population-based, retrospective cohort study in Hong Kong [^00dbbf9f]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common non‐communicable disease (NCD) and has become a major public health challenge, affecting 463 million people worldwide.DM is associated with greater risks of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and premature mortality. To reduce or delay the development of complications or mortality, international clinical practice guidelines recommend individuals with DM have a comprehensive medical evaluation at least annually, including medication adjustment, laboratory tests, and assessments of complications. In Hong Kong, people with DM in stable or mild conditions are managed by primary care, while complicated or severe cases are referred to specialist services. A DM care report conducted by the Hong Kong Hospital Authority (HA), a statutory body that provides all the public health care in Hong Kong, showed that 36.7% of the patients with DM were under care in specialist services in 2019–2020.

Visits to routine medical care for patients with DM were affected globally during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic. In Hong Kong, publicly provided specialist outpatient clinic (SOPC) services were reduced after the first confirmed local COVID‐19 case to focus the manpower and healthcare resources on the challenge of the pandemic. There are concerns that disruptions to SOPC follow‐up in patients with DM may have led to suboptimal glycaemic control and other unmet medical needs, consequently increasing risks of CVD and mortality.

Primary care services were largely maintained during the COVID‐19 pandemic in Hong Kong, which served as alternative modes of care for SOPC patients with DM. A meta‐analysis showed that structured care in primary care for people with DM is a good substitute and achieves metabolic control similar to SOPC, at least in the short term. In addition, prior studies indicated that drug‐refill service, defined as repeat dispensing of medication without clinic attendance, was associated with better glycaemic control for patients with DM than those who did not receive refills. However, it is still uncertain whether primary care clinic visits or drug‐refill services could reduce the risk of mortality and complications in patients with DM affected by SOPC disruptions during the COVID‐19 pandemic in Hong Kong.

Using a population‐based retrospective cohort of patients in Hong Kong, we aim to examine the association of disrupted SOPC service and alternative modes of care with all‐cause mortality, CVD, and kidney failure incidence among SOPC patients with DM. The findings can not only suggest a preferable approach to ongoing management of patients with DM, but also inform health policies about the contingency care plans in future public health crises.

### Highlighting the new consensus guidelines for managing people at risk of, and with early-stage type 1 diabetes-relevance to clinical care in the UK [^4aa1b23b]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Second, the guidance highlights the urgent need to educate our health care professional colleagues around the single antibody and early stages of T1D so that they are aware of them and how to manage and support them. The roles of national professional bodies, the Association of British Clinical Diabetologists, the British Society for Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes, the Primary Care Diabetes Society, Breakthrough T1D and Diabetes UK will be critical here and educational webinars, written material and conference workshops are planned. Clinical coding for early‐stage T1D is now available through SNOMED (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms) as well as an ICD 10 (International classification of diabetes, 10th revision) code. Our primary care colleagues should be encouraged to implement them into their clinical interfaces to help alert to the risk of impending hyperglycaemia in patients presenting with other symptoms. Such approaches will reduce the risk of missed diagnosis and fatalities, and support with identification of cohorts for future potential pharmacological interventions. The support of the wider diabetes multidisciplinary team including nurses, dieticians, psychologists and their respective societies is essential. Whilst the guidelines suggest that there is a need for primary care to take on some of the early‐stage monitoring and managing of antibody positive children and adults, we recommend that within the UK NHS system, that these patients best sit in secondary care. This will facilitate the use of appropriate glucose monitoring systems, careful timing of insulin initiation and will also protect our busy primary care colleagues from what is an emerging T1D subspecialty. Meanwhile for our secondary care colleagues, the application of the diagnostic term 'T1D' to the early T1D stages allows them to use all the technology and services that we currently use for our patients already on insulin. Modelling the potential impact of screening on the expansion of clinical services suggests an initial increase but care will be less intensive than for insulin treated patients.

### Expert roundtable on continuous glucose monitoring [^b5aea363]. Endocrine Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to define an expert opinion on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus, including its advantages, barriers, and best clinical practices for initiation, patient-clinician communication, and data management.

Methods

A series of virtual discussions was held to recommend improvements to clinical practice and design clinical tools for primary care clinicians. Participants included endocrinologists, primary care physicians, physician assistants, advanced practice nurses, and diabetes care and education specialists.

Results

The expert panels recommended CGM as a supplement to blood glucose monitoring and hemoglobin A1c for managing diabetes in persons with diabetes (PWDs). CGM can help predict potential pitfalls in glycemic management, including hypo and hyperglycemic excursions, which directly influence lifestyle changes, medication initiation, and dosing decisions. A toolkit was designed with practical guidance on the integration of CGM into clinical practice, interpretation of results, clinical guidelines, a patient action plan, and other useful management tools.

Conclusion

This review summarizes the findings from a roundtable discussion with endocrinology and primary care clinicians, a discussion of the advantages and challenges of CGM, and clinical approaches to improving the care of PWDs. CGM offers more detailed tracking of glucose levels than blood glucose monitoring or hemoglobin A1c, and it can detect asymptomatic hypoglycemia. Specialized education of providers, the cost to patients and providers, and data management are barriers to the widespread adoption of CGM for PWDs.

### Type 1 diabetes through the life span: a position statement of the American diabetes association [^26c3dda2]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Incidence and Prevalence of Type 1 Diabetes

The exact number of individuals with type 1 diabetes around the world is not known, but in the U.S. there are estimated to be up to 3 million. Although it has long been called "juvenile diabetes" due to the more frequent and relatively straightforward diagnosis in children, the majority of individuals with type 1 diabetes are adults.

Most children are referred and treated in tertiary centers, where clinical data are more readily captured. The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study estimated that, in 2009, 18,436 U.S. youth were newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (12,945 non-Hispanic white, 3,098 Hispanic, 2,070 non-Hispanic black, 276 Asian-Pacific Islander, and 47 American Indian). Worldwide, ∼78,000 youth are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes annually. Incidence varies tremendously among countries: East Asians and American Indians have the lowest incidence rates (0.1–8 per 100,000/year) as compared with the Finnish who have the highest rates (> 64.2 per 100,000/year). In the U.S. the number of youth with type 1 diabetes was estimated to be 166,984.

The precise incidence of new-onset type 1 diabetes in those over 20 years of age is unknown. This may be due to the prolonged phase of onset and the subtleties in distinguishing the different types of diabetes. In one European study of adults aged 30–70 years, ∼9% tested positive for GAD antibodies (GADA) within 5 years of a diabetes diagnosis, consistent with other studies.

Adults with type 1 diabetes often receive care in primary care settings rather than with an endocrinologist. Unlike the consolidated care seen in pediatric diabetes management, the lack of consolidated care in adults makes incidence and prevalence rates difficult to characterize, and therefore they are often underestimated. The number of adults living with type 1 diabetes is increasing due to two factors: 1) the rising number of new-onset cases of type 1 diabetes in adults, including those diagnosed with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA), and 2) individuals with childhood-onset diabetes are living longer.

### Primary and tertiary health professionals' views on the health-care of patients with co-morbid diabetes and chronic kidney disease-a qualitative study [^f6930be7]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Poor communication between health-care providers

All participants highlighted the importance of effective communication of medical information between health providers (including specialist physicians, GPs and providers of pathology or radiology services). However, they perceived communication to be often poor between and within all levels of care, contributing to poor coordination of care.

Tertiary health professionals and GPs complained about poor communication of referrals, management decisions and investigations between each other. While tertiary health professionals complained that referral letters from GPs often containing inadequate information. Most GPs and some tertiary health professionals also suggested that communication of management decisions back to GPs was poor. GPs reported that this was especially a problem with renal and dialysis services and recounted difficulties in patient care due to delayed (one GP mentioned up to 3 weeks) or no correspondence being sent by tertiary health-care clinics.

"There's not much happening from the GP's end to us, in particular whatever correspondence we see in the clinics… The only information we get… is they just make sure they get a referral to come and see the endocrinologist… and then you pretty much gather the information from the patient". - THP FG 6

"Unfortunately, there's a pretty big disconnect between primary practice and tertiary. There still is. There probably always will be because – there are some units which are very good at communicating with me and try quite earnestly to keep in contact, but other ones who don't". – GP FG 2

Tertiary health professionals identified problems with the main communication pathways - letters and medical records. Letters were reportedly sent out late. There were also identified problems with the medical records system (scanned medical records on an information technology platform) which were often not integrated between departments (with investigation results in different databases), incomplete (with delays in scanning clinic notes into the system, and the absence of a current medication lists), difficult to read (due to handwritten notes being scanned) and difficult to navigate.

Both GPs and tertiary health-care professionals suggested that an integrated electronic medical record that was shared, accessed and updated real-time by all health professionals in tertiary and primary care could improve communication between health professionals. The medical record would ideally contain an updated medical summary and medication list. Further, a policy of mandatory and timely communication of management decisions to the coordinating GP and all involved health providers could be implemented to improve communication

### Unequal referral patterns to ophthalmology subspecialists based on race and ethnicity in diabetes mellitus: a retrospective analysis [^32d6189d]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This large, retrospective study examines the differences between racial and ethnic subgroups when it comes to their referral for specialty evaluation by an ophthalmic specialist following their diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. This study is the first to look at the racial disparities seen between patients when it comes to the timeframe and rate at which they are referred for a diabetic retinopathy examination. Our study demonstrated that black patients were less likely to be referred for an ophthalmic specialist appointment at the time of their diabetes mellitus diagnosis than their white counterparts. While the absolute difference between these groups was modest (79.3% vs 75.75%), it is a statistically significant difference. Black and Hispanic patients were more likely than white patients to already have diabetic retinopathy by the time they attended this referral appointment. Additionally, our study showed that Hispanic patients were more likely to have an A1c > 7% at the time of their first referral as well as have a higher incidence of initiating intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy. Interestingly, this study showed that there was not a statistically significant difference in whether it took patients less or more than a month from their appointment referral date until their actual appointment. Overall, this study is critical in understanding how clinicians can ensure patients with diabetes receive appropriate ophthalmic referral and early evaluation of vision-threatening consequences of diabetes such as diabetic retinopathy, particularly for black and Hispanic patients.

Previous studies have shown that early intervention and frequent monitoring for diabetic retinopathy preserves vision, improves outcomes, and aids in maintaining a patient's quality of life. Recent research has shown that early treatment with anti-VEGF does not yield benefits for a patient's visual acuity, making regular monitoring of patients to be able to treat only as needed crucial. Because diabetic retinopathy can be asymptomatic or present with only mild symptoms such as blurry vision or floaters in the early stages of the disease course, it is unreasonable to rely on patients to recognize the warning signs and see specialized ophthalmic care on their own accord. Instead, this duty falls on clinicians, particularly primary care physicians, to recognize the need for an evaluation by an ophthalmologist or optometrist in this patient population and give appropriate referrals. In fact, the American Diabetes Association recommends that all patients who have Type II Diabetes Mellitus should have a comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmic specialist at the time of their diabetes diagnosis. The long-term implications of delayed diabetic retinopathy care in minorities are of utmost importance, especially considering that black and Hispanic populations suffer from diabetes and diabetic retinopathy at higher rates than other groups.

Screening for Pregnancy Intention

Background

Unfavorable pregnancy outcomes are common in individuals with preexisting diabetes mellitus (PDM) and are related to modifiable factors such as maternal hyperglycemia and body mass index. For outcomes such as congenital malformations or miscarriage, the exposure period begins weeks before the pregnancy is recognized. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines preconception care (PCC) as "a set of interventions that are to be provided before pregnancy, to promote the health and well-being of women and couples, as well as to improve the pregnancy and child-health outcomes". The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines PCC as "a set of interventions that aim to identify and modify biomedical, behavioral, and social risks to a woman's health or pregnancy outcome through prevention and management". As pregnancies are often unplanned, PCC, including a focus on optimizing maternal glycemia, is necessary to improve maternal and fetal/neonatal outcomes. Therefore, understanding the effect of screening for pregnancy intention was deemed a priority.

Screening for pregnancy intention in the general population includes initiatives such as the ONE KEY QUESTION® (OKQ), developed by the Oregon Foundation for Reproductive Health. This initiative proposes that primary care clinicians ask individuals "Would you like to become pregnant in the next year?". For those who answer "yes", the clinician offers preconception counseling and screenings to ensure that modifiable risk factors are addressed before pregnancy. For those who answer "no", the clinician provides counseling on the full range of contraceptive options to ensure that the method they use is optimal for their circumstances. This approach is endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

Question 1. Should a screening question about pregnancy intention vs no screening question be used in every healthcare provider appointment for individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming pregnant?

### Nationwide survey on actual interventions for type 2 diabetes by Japanese practitioners (NSAID study-1): glycemic, weight, and blood pressure management [^ecbe6bb3]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The goal in the treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus is to prevent disease complications. This leads to a prolonged life span, improved quality of life regardless of diabetes, and reduced medical costs. The number of patients with diabetes and the associated national medical healthcare expenditures are still increasing in Japan. The annual Health, Labour and Welfare Report of 2017 showed that approximately 9.5 and 11 million persons (7.9% and 9.1% of total population in Japan) were strongly suspected to or considered to have diabetes, respectively.

Some European countries have a universal healthcare structure based on a gate-keeping system. In this system, patients visit primary care physicians first after obtaining an appointment, and then primary care physicians refer them to specialists if necessary. Japan has a public health insurance system for everyone in the country. This Japanese medical service is based on a free-access policy. Every person in Japan can obtain medical services at any clinic or hospital at any time. In addition, Japanese physicians have the freedom of opening clinics or hospitals specializing in any area. Under these circumstances, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can choose to visit either diabetes specialists or general practitioners depending on their preference. Moreover, approximately 6000 physicians in Japan have been certified as specialists for diabetes care by the Japan Diabetes Society (JDS). This number of diabetes specialists is insufficient to cover all patients with diabetes, and as a result, general practitioners care for many patients with diabetes in Japan. Therefore, the quality of diabetic management by general practitioners as well as by diabetes specialists is critical to reduce diabetes complications, improve quality of life, and reduce medical costs.

### The endocrinologist gap: managing diabetes patients in absence of a specialist [^90e3a736]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

The treatment of pediatric patients with diabetes is frequently orchestrated within a multidisciplinary framework at tertiary, specialized institutions. In situations where emergent surgery is indicated or when a procedure is scheduled in a facility devoid of an endocrinology service, the onus of managing perioperative glycemic levels may rest with the attending anesthesiologist. The objective of this review is to furnish a comprehensive examination of the anesthetic considerations and perioperative governance of pediatric patients with diabetes. Furthermore, this paper delineates a streamlined protocol for perioperative glycemic control, tailored to both major and minor surgical interventions.

### Meeting individualized glycemic targets in primary care patients with type 2 diabetes in Spain [^a0092a27]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Recent clinical guidelines and expert committees on the management of type 2 diabetes have recommended individualization of glycemic targets based on patient characteristics, comorbid conditions, diabetes complications, duration of diabetes and risk of hypoglycemia. The American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (ADA/EASD) recommended a target HbA1c level < 7% (53 mmol/mol) for most patients with type 2 diabetes, however, a more relaxed target (HbA1c 7.5–8% (58–64 mmol/mol)) should be aimed in patients with multiple comorbidities, reduced life expectancy, history of hypoglycemia, or advanced diabetes complications. On the other hand, a more stringent target such as HbA1c < 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) was considered beneficial in younger patients without comorbid conditions and with no adverse effects of antihyperglycemic treatment. Similarly, the national consensus from the Sociedad Española de Diabetes (SED – Spanish Diabetes Society) recommended a stringent HbA1c target of < 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes, age < 70 years, and absence of diabetic complications, otherwise, a less stringent HbA1c goal of < 7.5% (58 mmol/mol) should be the target in the absence of these conditions. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) also recommends the individualization of glycemic targets taking into account several factors that include concurrent illnesses and risk of hypoglycemia.

There are future research opportunities to explore a number of unanswered questions in relation to delivering the best DPP. An RCT to measure the effectiveness of different types of referral routes should be conducted, such as comparing direct to consumer approaches, versus NHS Health Check referrals or primary care referral mechanisms. Analysis should be undertaken to investigate the most effective inclusion criteria, for example, what is the optimal baseline BMI or blood glucose reading for achieving the best results from a DPP. What cohort of patients is a DPP most likely to be effective for? For example, should BME patients, patients with complex mental health needs, vulnerable groups, prisoners, recent migrants, attend specially adapted programs? In-depth analysis into digital technology to prevent T2D is needed. In today's digital world, research is needed to investigate whether patients would readily accept online delivery of the educational element of the lifestyle intervention and track their lifestyle behavior monitoring via an app.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^80b479ee]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Patients with co-occurring conditions — Co-occurring conditions can modify the degree of risk, impact diagnosis, influence patient and provider treatment priorities and clinical decisions, and affect the overall approach to managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Because T2DM is sometimes accompanied by co-occurring conditions, managing T2DM collaboratively with other care providers is often best, and some co-occurring conditions might require early specialist consultation to determine necessary changes in treatment or to establish a common understanding of how care will be coordinated. This approach might entail reference to other VA/DoD clinical practice guidelines for Chronic Kidney Disease, Overweight and Obesity, Hypertension, Dyslipidemia, and Pregnancy, and providers are encouraged to use shared decision making to individualize treatment goals and plans based on patient capabilities, needs, and preferences.

Recommendations

See 2014 ADA Standards of Medical Care for detailed screening information for CVD, nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, and foot care.
Access to health care should include clinicians with expertise in type 1 diabetes management, including (but not limited to) an endocrinologist (or other health care provider with expertise in type 1 diabetes management), a registered dietitian, a diabetes educator, a mental health professional, an exercise specialist/physiologist, and specialists required to treat diabetes complications. (E)
Routine follow-up (generally quarterly) should include review of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and pump data (if applicable), A1C measurement, evidence for acute and/or chronic complications of diabetes (particularly episodes of DKA and mild and/or severe hypoglycemia), measurement of blood pressure and weight (and height in children), foot exam, inspection of injection/insertion sites, and discussion of psychosocial and educational needs (Tables 4 and 5). (E)
Providers should routinely document the patient's age and disease duration. When clinically indicated, laboratory measures such as lipids, renal function measurements, and antibodies for associated autoimmune disease (thyroid or celiac disease) should be documented. (E)
Parent/guardian involvement in care is required throughout childhood, with a gradual shift in responsibility of care from the parent/guardian to the youth. (E)
Health care for adults should be focused on the needs of the individual throughout the various stages of their life, with age-appropriate evaluation and treatment. (E)
Evaluation and treatment of CVD risk should be individualized. (E)
Immunizations should be given as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for children/adults in general and people with diabetes specifically. (C)
Consider screening for celiac disease by measuring IgA antitissue transglutaminase or antiendomysial antibodies, with documentation of normal total serum IgA levels, soon after the diagnosis of diabetes and/or if symptoms develop. Refer the patient to a gastroenterologist if the test is positive. (E)
Consider screening for thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies soon after diagnosis. (E)
Screen for thyroid dysfunction by measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations soon after type 1 diabetes diagnosis (and after stable metabolic control). If normal, consider rechecking every 1–2 years or more frequently if the patient develops unusual glycemic variation or symptoms of thyroid dysfunction or thyromegaly. (E)
Assess for the presence of additional autoimmune conditions at diagnosis and if symptoms develop. (E)
Ongoing nutrition and diabetes self-management education (DSME) and support (DSMS) are needed to address changes in food preferences, access to food, daily schedules, activity patterns, and potential barriers to self-care, including the risk of an eating disorder. (E)
Assess psychosocial status annually and more often as needed; treat and/or refer to a mental health professional as indicated. (E)

### Assessing referrals and improving information availability for consultations in an academic endocrinology clinic [^b772befe]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Outpatient specialty consultations rely on the timeliness and completeness of referral information to facilitate a valuable patient-specialist interaction. This project aimed to increase essential diagnostic information availability at the initial consultation for patients referred for common endocrine conditions frequently lacking such data-diabetes mellitus, thyroid nodule, thyrotoxicosis, and hypercalcemia.

Methods

At an endocrinology clinic at an academic medical center in rural New England, providers see several thousand new patients annually, the majority of whom are referred by providers external to the clinic's healthcare system. Through consensus, endocrinology clinic providers agreed on the two or three data elements essential for a meaningful initial consultation for each. A quality improvement team employed a planned series of interventions based on previously published methods and an innovative approach: dissemination of a referral guideline, an assessment of referral adequacy in the endocrinology clinic workflow, coupled with focused requests for missing items, and a pre-visit lab appointment.

Results

Between April 2015 and March 2016, 762 referrals were reviewed. At baseline for the four conditions, referrals contained all essential elements only 27.5% (22 of 80) of the time. Over a 7-month period, the team implemented the interventions, with subsequent referrals containing all essential elements increasing to 75.5% (P < .0001), largely attributable to the pre-visit lab appointment.

Conclusion

Incoming referrals that lack essential information are a significant problem in specialty care and may adversely affect patient experience, provider satisfaction, and clinic efficiency. Improvement may require innovative approaches, such as the potentially transferable and generalizable ones employed here.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^cb0cafff]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) diabetic retinopathy — screening and follow-up recommendations 7.1–7.7: It is recommended that persons with T2D or adult-onset T1D should have an initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist at the time of diagnosis or shortly after diagnosis, and individualized subsequent screening can be based on type and duration of DM, A1C or mean BG, BP, and the presence and grade of retinopathy (Grade A; BEL 2 and expert opinion of task force). In persons with T1D, an initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist should be performed within 5 years of diagnosis in children and adolescents (Grade B; BEL 4 and expert opinion of task force). Women who are pregnant and have preexisting T1D or T2D should be monitored with eye examinations every trimester during pregnancy and in the postpartum period as determined by the severity of retinopathy during pregnancy (Grade B; BEL 2). Persons with greater than mild nonproliferative retinopathy should have examinations at least once a year and more frequently as advised by their eyecare specialist (Grade B; BEL 4 and expert opinion of task force). Follow-up with eyecare specialists typically should occur on an annual basis, but persons with T1D or T2D who have had a normal ocular examination may be screened every 2 to 3 years (Grade B; BEL 2 and expert opinion of task force). Optimal glucose, BP, weight, and lipid control should be implemented to slow the progression of retinopathy (Grade B; BEL 1). Artificial intelligence systems, authorized by the FDA for detecting greater than mild diabetic retinopathy, can be used as an alternative to traditional screening approaches, and these systems can facilitate diagnosis of vision-threatening retinopathy and identification of persons who require ophthalmologist referral to treatment (Grade B; BEL 2).

### Five-year change of clinical and complications profile of diabetic patients under primary care: a population-based longitudinal study on 127, 977 diabetic patients [^ba79b13a]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2015). Low credibility.

Hong Kong, being an international city with many people leading a Western lifestyle, hosted a significant and increasing number of diabetic patients in recent years. Local data showed that the prevalence of diabetic mellitus was 9.92% (diagnosed plus undiagnosed). Total annual costs for diagnosed Type 2 DM patients in HK were estimated to take up 6.4% of the total expenditure of the public healthcare sector in 2004. In order to enhance the quality of care of patients with chronic diseases like diabetes mellitus under the public primary care setting, various territory-wide quality enhancement programmes have been introduced in phases, including Risk Assessment and Management Programme-Diabetes Mellitus (RAMP-DM), Patient Empowerment Programme, Nurse Allied Health Clinic, Call Centre, etc. RAMP-DM is exclusively for diabetic patients, and it has started implementation since 2009, with its coverage raised from 3.1% in 2009 to 81.9% in 2013 of all the diabetic patients under the care of public primary healthcare sector. The details of the RAMP-DM had been illustrated in our previous protocol paper. Diabetic patients are encouraged to live and work in the community, and primary care approach of community-based care are appropriate to majority of the diabetic patients who do not require specialist care. In spite of this predominant chronic disease in the society, there were no formal standardized guidelines or recommendations provided to the local health care doctors as a local reference on how their diabetic patients should be managed before 2010. In 2010, the HK Reference Framework for Diabetes Care for Adults in Primary Care Setting was published and served as a population-wide guideline for strengthening community-based primary care, focusing on prevention, and quality improvement in the management of DM. Previous studies demonstrated that healthcare systems relying more on primary care rather than specialist care produce better population health outcomes, enhance continuity and access to health care. Nevertheless, currently, limited primary care and population-based data on patient's clinical and complications profile of diabetic patients was available to identify the needs of the practices and population. Continued territory-wide evaluation of diabetes control in the population is vital to sustain improvement in diabetic care and inform health policy makers in service planning and resource allocation to prevent the development of complications and preserve quality of life of the diabetic population.

The aims of this study were to track the recent 5-year changing diabetic care by reviewing the clinical and complication profile, to evaluate the trend in risk-factor control, and to identify the needs and gaps of the practices among diabetic patients based on the 5-year population-based data from 2009 to 2013.

### Perioperative management of type 1 diabetes mellitus [^e3f8e5c8]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Clearly, perioperative management of diabetic patients requires thorough preoperative evaluation and planning whenever possible. A firm understanding of the pathophysiology of type 1 diabetes mellitus, the metabolic stress response, and the interactions between various forms of insulin and other variables such as supplemental nutrition and glucocorticoids can greatly assist in achieving a positive outcome. Consultation with an endocrinologist, internist, or other primary care provider comfortable with managing type 1 diabetes patients is strongly recommended to assist in the details of in-patient care and overseeing of proper ancillary support. It may also be helpful to allow the patient to function as an active decision-maker in the coordination of care, especially because a large percentage of type 1 diabetes patients (particularly those who are on insulin pumps) are well-educated about their disease process and their own physiologic idiosyncrasies. This knowledge can save valuable time and effort toward achieving the ultimate united goal of avoiding perioperative morbidity and mortality by maximizing glycemic control.
