## Question

GBS prenatal prophylaxis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about GBS prenatal prophylaxis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical problem and why we intervene. Then, I should verify the evolution of prevention strategies from risk-based to universal screening. Next, I will review current screening timing and indications for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, including special scenarios like preterm labor and penicillin allergy. After that, I need to check antibiotic choices, dosing, and the minimum effective duration. Finally, I will examine neonatal management pathways, implementation gaps, and future directions such as vaccines, and I will close with a concise, clinically actionable summary anchored to guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and the rationale for prophylaxis. GBS colonizes the vaginal and rectal flora in roughly 10–30% of pregnant women, and in the absence of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, about 1–2% of infants born to colonized mothers develop early-onset GBS disease, which includes sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis with substantial morbidity and mortality, so prevention hinges on interrupting vertical transmission at delivery rather than eradicating colonization earlier in pregnancy [^4d5d7883] [^c2b7062f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about strategy. I should review the historical shift from risk-based to universal screening. Initially, both risk-based and culture-based approaches were acceptable, but a large multicenter cohort and subsequent guideline updates demonstrated that universal late-gestation culture-based screening is about 50% more effective than risk-based strategies, leading to the current standard of universal screening with intrapartum prophylaxis for colonized women [^822deaa3] [^5cb34a88] [^b233c37f].

> Wait, let me verify the optimal screening window. I initially thought 35–37 weeks, but the most recent ACOG guidance moved the universal screen to 36 0/7 to 37 6/7 weeks to maximize predictive value for intrapartum colonization while covering births up to at least 41 weeks; cultures lose predictive power beyond about 5 weeks, so timing matters for accuracy and downstream prophylaxis decisions [^00910133] [^11b869a9] [^88d5aaea].

> I need to ensure I capture who actually needs intrapartum prophylaxis. Indications include a positive late-gestation vaginal–rectal culture, GBS bacteriuria at any time in the current pregnancy, or a prior infant with invasive GBS disease; if GBS status is unknown at labor onset, prophylaxis is indicated with preterm delivery, rupture of membranes for 18 hours or more, or intrapartum fever of 100.4°F or higher, with the caveat that suspected intraamniotic infection warrants broader-spectrum therapy rather than GBS-only prophylaxis [^3995329a] [^88d5aaea] [^b14ab37c].

> Let me think about antibiotic selection and dosing. Penicillin G remains first-line due to narrow spectrum and low resistance risk, with ampicillin as an acceptable alternative; for low-risk penicillin allergy, cefazolin is preferred, whereas high-risk allergy requires clindamycin only if the isolate is susceptible, and vancomycin if clindamycin resistance is present or susceptibility is unknown; dosing should achieve at least 4 hours before delivery when feasible, though even 2 hours can reduce vaginal colony counts and clinical sepsis diagnoses, and obstetric interventions should not be delayed solely to extend antibiotic duration [^84163a96] [^acccb109] [^00910133].

> But wait, what if membranes rupture preterm or labor starts before 37 weeks. I should confirm the preterm algorithm: if GBS status is unknown and there is threatened preterm delivery or PPROM, screen on admission and provide prophylaxis while awaiting results, discontinuing if results are negative and labor ceases; if a patient with PPROM completes a 7-day latency antibiotic course and remains without labor or infection, manage prophylaxis according to the baseline GBS result, repeating screening if more than 5 weeks have elapsed since a negative test [^242bb5d2] [^cea616ad].

> Next, I should review neonatal management because prophylaxis changes risk stratification. Well-appearing infants whose mothers received adequate intrapartum prophylaxis (≥ 4 hours of penicillin, ampicillin, or cefazolin) should be observed for at least 48 hours with no routine labs; if prophylaxis was inadequate or absent, management depends on gestational age and duration of rupture of membranes, with limited evaluation and observation for higher-risk scenarios and consideration of empiric antibiotics for the highest-risk infants; importantly, maternal IAP does not prevent late-onset GBS, so vigilance remains necessary beyond the first week of life [^60b81f69] [^9b5c106f] [^b233c37f].

> I should double-check implementation gaps that blunt effectiveness. Despite universal screening, many early-onset cases still occur due to missed screens, late preterm births before screening, inadequate intrapartum prophylaxis duration, or clindamycin use against resistant isolates; real-world data show that even with perfect adherence, a meaningful fraction of cases would persist, underscoring the need for systems improvements and alternative strategies [^6fe11dc3] [^dab6bb36] [^403da4fe].

> Let me consider future directions, especially vaccines. IAP reduces early-onset disease but does not impact late-onset disease, GBS-associated stillbirth, or maternal invasive disease, and it requires infrastructure that is often lacking in LMIC settings; maternal vaccination against GBS capsular antigens is a promising complementary strategy, with phase 2 data showing transplacental antibody transfer and persistence in infants, though phase 3 efficacy trials and regulatory approval are still pending, so IAP remains the cornerstone while vaccine development proceeds [^ca9ee7ed] [^293448f2] [^8aff2160].

> In summary, I need to ensure the clinical message is precise: universal GBS screening at 36 0/7 to 37 6/7 weeks, intrapartum prophylaxis with penicillin G or ampicillin for those who screen positive or who meet intrapartum risk criteria, careful management of penicillin allergy with susceptibility-guided alternatives, and risk-stratified neonatal observation are the evidence-based pillars that have reduced early-onset GBS by more than 80% in the U.S.; persistent cases reflect implementation challenges and biological limits, reinforcing the urgency of vaccines and continued quality improvement in screening and prophylaxis delivery [^00910133] [^3804a019] [^b233c37f].

GBS prenatal prophylaxis refers to **intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis** given to pregnant women who are GBS colonized or at risk to prevent early-onset neonatal GBS disease [^00910133]. The standard approach is **universal screening at 36–37 weeks** [^00910133] with vaginal–rectal cultures, and intrapartum penicillin G or ampicillin for those with positive results or risk factors [^84163a96]. This strategy reduces early-onset GBS by about 80% [^3804a019] and is recommended by ACOG and CDC [^00910133] [^fae4b23d]. Alternatives (cefazolin, clindamycin, or vancomycin) are used for penicillin allergy, and prophylaxis is not indicated for planned cesarean with intact membranes [^acccb109] [^8d1c46bd]. Neonatal management is risk-based, with observation or limited evaluation depending on gestational age, duration of rupture of membranes, and adequacy of maternal prophylaxis [^60b81f69].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

GBS colonizes 10–30% of pregnant women [^826ded8e], and **vertical transmission** occurs during labor or membrane rupture [^97643eed]. Without prophylaxis, 1–2% of infants born to colonized mothers develop early-onset GBS disease (EOGBS), including sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis, with significant morbidity and mortality [^4d5d7883] [^ca9ee7ed]. Risk factors include preterm birth, prolonged rupture of membranes, intrapartum fever, and previous infant with GBS disease [^97643eed].

---

## Screening strategies

Two main strategies exist: **universal screening** — culture-based screening at 36 0/7–37 6/7 weeks [^00910133] for all pregnant women, with intrapartum prophylaxis for positives; and **risk-based approach** — prophylaxis based on intrapartum risk factors (e.g. preterm labor, prolonged rupture of membranes, intrapartum fever) [^822deaa3]. Universal screening is superior and is the current standard in the United States [^5cb34a88] [^b233c37f].

---

## Indications for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP)

IAP is indicated for:

- Positive GBS vaginal–rectal culture at 36–37 weeks [^00910133].
- GBS bacteriuria at any gestation [^bdf81eba].
- Previous infant with invasive GBS disease [^3995329a].
- Unknown GBS status with risk factors (preterm < 37 weeks, ROM ≥ 18 hours, intrapartum fever ≥ 38°C) [^3995329a].

---

## Recommended antibiotic regimens

| **Antibiotic** | **Indication** | **Dosage** |
|-|-|-|
| Penicillin G | First-line | 5 million units IV initially, then 2.5–3 million units IV every 4 hours until delivery [^5a57d1ab] |
| Ampicillin | Alternative | 2 g IV initially, then 1 g IV every 4 hours until delivery [^notfound] |
| Cefazolin | Penicillin allergy (low risk) | 2 g IV initially, then 1 g IV every 8 hours until delivery [^notfound] |
| Clindamycin | Penicillin allergy (high risk) | 900 mg IV every 8 hours until delivery (if susceptible) [^notfound] |
| Vancomycin | Penicillin allergy (high risk, clindamycin-resistant) | 20 mg/kg IV every 8 hours (max 2 g/dose) until delivery [^acccb109] |

---

## Timing and duration of prophylaxis

IAP should be initiated at **labor onset or membrane rupture** and continued until delivery [^bdf81eba]. Adequate prophylaxis is defined as at least 4 hours of antibiotics before delivery; shorter durations are less effective but still beneficial [^ad92e6ce] [^00910133].

---

## Effectiveness of GBS prenatal prophylaxis

Universal screening and IAP have reduced EOGBS incidence by approximately 80% in the United States, from 1.8 per 1,000 live births in the 1990s to 0.23 per 1,000 in 2015 [^3804a019]. However, **no reduction** has been observed in late-onset GBS disease (LOD), which occurs after 7 days of life and is not prevented by intrapartum prophylaxis [^21587495] [^b233c37f].

---

## Limitations and controversies

- **False negatives**: Prenatal cultures can miss intrapartum colonization, leading to cases despite screening [^0e04d963].
- **Antibiotic resistance**: Concerns about emerging resistance, particularly with clindamycin, necessitate susceptibility testing [^76980a38].
- **Adverse effects**: Potential maternal allergic reactions and neonatal microbiome alterations are concerns, though serious adverse effects are rare [^c571f70c] [^eb530a99].
- **Global implementation**: IAP is less feasible in low-resource settings due to infrastructure and screening limitations [^29e76645].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

ACOG and CDC recommend **universal screening at 36–37 weeks** [^00910133] with intrapartum prophylaxis for positive cultures or risk factors [^3995329a]. They also advise penicillin allergy assessment and susceptibility testing for clindamycin when indicated [^1c358cde] [^acccb109].

---

## Future directions

Research focuses on **developing GBS vaccines** to prevent both EOGBS and LOD, with several candidates in clinical trials [^293448f2] [^ca9ee7ed]. Improved rapid diagnostics and alternative prophylaxis strategies are also being explored [^55447e57] [^8aff2160].

---

GBS prenatal prophylaxis is a **cornerstone of perinatal care**, significantly reducing EOGBS through universal screening and intrapartum antibiotics. Ongoing research and public health efforts aim to address limitations and expand prevention globally.

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease – revised guidelines from CDC, 2010 [^fae4b23d]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Despite substantial progress in prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal (GBS) disease since the 1990s, GBS remains the leading cause of early-onset neonatal sepsis in the United States. In 1996, CDC, in collaboration with relevant professional societies, published guidelines for the prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease (CDC. Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease: a public health perspective. MMWR 1996;45[No. RR-7]); those guidelines were updated and republished in 2002 (CDC. Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease: revised guidelines from CDC. MMWR 2002;51[No. RR-11]). In June 2009, a meeting of clinical and public health representatives was held to reevaluate prevention strategies on the basis of data collected after the issuance of the 2002 guidelines. This report presents CDC's updated guidelines, which have been endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Nurse-Midwives, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American Society for Microbiology. The recommendations were made on the basis of available evidence when such evidence was sufficient and on expert opinion when available evidence was insufficient. The key changes in the 2010 guidelines include the following:

- expanded recommendations on laboratory methods for the identification of GBS,
- clarification of the colony-count threshold required for reporting GBS detected in the urine of pregnant women,
- updated algorithms for GBS screening and intrapartum chemoprophylaxis for women with preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of membranes,
- a change in the recommended dose of penicillin-G for chemoprophylaxis,
- updated prophylaxis regimens for women with penicillin allergy, and
- a revised algorithm for management of newborns with respect to risk for early-onset GBS disease. Universal screening at 35–37 weeks' gestation for maternal GBS colonization and use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis has resulted in substantial reductions in the burden of early-onset GBS disease among newborns. Although early-onset GBS disease has become relatively uncommon in recent years, the rates of maternal GBS colonization (and therefore the risk for early-onset GBS disease in the absence of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis) remain unchanged since the 1970s. Continued efforts are needed to sustain and improve on the progress achieved in the prevention of GBS disease. There also is a need to monitor for potential adverse consequences of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (e.g., emergence of bacterial antimicrobial resistance or increased incidence or severity of non-GBS neonatal pathogens). In the absence of a licensed GBS vaccine, universal screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis continue to be the cornerstones of early-onset GBS disease prevention.

### Policy statement-recommendations for the prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal (GBS) disease [^5a64511a]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for the prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal (GBS) disease were initially published in 1996. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) also published a policy statement on this topic in 1997. In 2002, the CDC published revised guidelines that recommended universal antenatal GBS screening; the AAP endorsed these guidelines and published recommendations based on them in the 2003 Red Book. Since then, the incidence of early-onset GBS disease in neonates has decreased by an estimated 80%. However, in 2010, GBS disease remained the leading cause of early-onset neonatal sepsis. The CDC issued revised guidelines in 2010 based on evaluation of data generated after 2002. These revised and comprehensive guidelines, which have been endorsed by the AAP, reaffirm the major prevention strategy — universal antenatal GBS screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for culture-positive and high-risk women — and include new recommendations for laboratory methods for identification of GBS colonization during pregnancy, algorithms for screening and intrapartum prophylaxis for women with preterm labor and premature rupture of membranes, updated prophylaxis recommendations for women with a penicillin allergy, and a revised algorithm for the care of newborn infants. The purpose of this policy statement is to review and discuss the differences between the 2002 and 2010 CDC guidelines that are most relevant for the practice of pediatrics.

### Updated guidance: prevention and management of perinatal group BInfection [^1c2c98f7]. NeoReviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) remains the most common cause of neonatal early-onset sepsis among term infants and a major cause of late-onset sepsis among both term and preterm infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists published separate but aligned guidelines in 2019 and 2020 for the prevention and management of perinatal GBS disease. Together, these replace prior consensus guidelines provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Maternal intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis based on antenatal screening for GBS colonization remains the primary recommended approach to prevent perinatal GBS disease, though the optimal window for screening is changed to 36 0/7 to 37 6/7 weeks of gestation rather than beginning at 35 0/7 weeks' gestation. Penicillin, ampicillin, or cefazolin are recommended for prophylaxis, with clindamycin and vancomycin reserved for cases of significant maternal penicillin allergy. Pregnant women with a history of penicillin allergy are now recommended to undergo skin testing, because confirmation of or delabeling from a penicillin allergy can provide both short- and long-term health benefits. Aligned with the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations for evaluating newborns for all causes of early-onset sepsis, separate consideration should be given to infants born at less than 35 weeks' and more than or equal to 35 weeks' gestation when performing GBS risk assessment. Empiric antibiotics are recommended for infants at high risk for GBS early-onset disease. Although intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in preventing GBS early-onset disease, currently there is no approach for the prevention of GBS late-onset disease.

### Neonatal group B. streptococcus disease [^9230da0b]. Pediatrics in Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is an important cause of neonatal sepsis in term and preterm infants. Because GBS colonizes human genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts, a significant focus of neonatal GBS disease prevention is to interrupt vertical transmission of GBS from mother to infant during parturition. Routine antepartum GBS screening in pregnant women, as well as widespread use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, have aided in overall reductions in neonatal GBS disease during the past 3 decades. However, neonatal GBS disease persists and may cause mortality and significant short- and long-term morbidity among survivors. Herein, we highlight contemporary epidemiology, microbial pathogenesis, and the clinical presentation spectrum associated with neonatal GBS disease. We summarize obstetric recommendations for antenatal GBS screening, indications for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, and considerations for antibiotic selection. Finally, we review national guidelines for risk assessment and management of infants at risk for GBS disease.

### Management of infants at risk for group B streptococcal disease [^4ed3d5f6]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Group B streptococcal (GBS) infection remains the most common cause of neonatal early-onset sepsis and a significant cause of late-onset sepsis among young infants. Administration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is the only currently available effective strategy for the prevention of perinatal GBS early-onset disease, and there is no effective approach for the prevention of late-onset disease. The American Academy of Pediatrics joins with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to reaffirm the use of universal antenatal microbiologic-based testing for the detection of maternal GBS colonization to facilitate appropriate administration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. The purpose of this clinical report is to provide neonatal clinicians with updated information regarding the epidemiology of GBS disease as well current recommendations for the evaluation of newborn infants at risk for GBS disease and for treatment of those with confirmed GBS infection. This clinical report is endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), July 2019, and should be construed as ACOG clinical guidance.

### Laboratory practices for prenatal group B streptococcal screening – seven states, 2003 [^c1cbe4b7]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2004). Low credibility.

In the United States, group B streptococcus (GBS) is the leading cause of serious bacterial infections in newborns. In 1996, consensus guidelines for use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) to prevent perinatal GBS disease recommended either of two methods for identifying candidates for chemoprophylaxis: 1) late prenatal culture-based screening for GBS colonization or 2) monitoring of women intrapartum for particular risk factors associated with early-onset GBS disease. Evidence that culture-based screening was substantially more effective than the risk-based approach led to revised guidelines in 2002 recommending late prenatal GBS screening for all pregnant women. Although methods for isolation and identification of GBS from prenatal specimens remained the same as those recommended in 1996, the 2002 guidelines recommended that laboratories perform antimicrobial susceptibility testing on prenatal GBS isolates from women at high risk for penicillin anaphylaxis and clarified that laboratories should report the presence of any GBS in urine specimens from pregnant women. To assess laboratory adherence to recommendations in the 2002 guidelines, CDC's Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs)/Emerging Infections Program Network surveyed clinical laboratories about prenatal culture-processing practices in 2003. This report summarizes the results of that survey, which indicated that, although adherence to GBS isolation procedures was high, opportunities exist to improve implementation of recommendations related to antimicrobial susceptibility testing and GBS bacteriuria.

### Prevention of group B streptococcal early-onset disease in newborns: ACOG committee opinion, number 797 [^97643eed]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Group B streptococcus (GBS) is the leading cause of newborn infection. The primary risk factor for neonatal GBS early-onset disease (EOD) is maternal colonization of the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts. Approximately 50% of women who are colonized with GBS will transmit the bacteria to their newborns. Vertical transmission usually occurs during labor or after rupture of membranes. In the absence of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, 1–2% of those newborns will develop GBS EOD. Other risk factors include gestational age of less than 37 weeks, very low birth weight, prolonged rupture of membranes, intraamniotic infection, young maternal age, and maternal black race. The key obstetric measures necessary for effective prevention of GBS EOD continue to include universal prenatal screening by vaginal-rectal culture, correct specimen collection and processing, appropriate implementation of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, and coordination with pediatric care providers. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now recommends performing universal GBS screening between 36 0/7 and 37 6/7 weeks of gestation. All women whose vaginal-rectal cultures at 36 0/7–37 6/7 weeks of gestation are positive for GBS should receive appropriate intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis unless a prelabor cesarean birth is performed in the setting of intact membranes. Although a shorter duration of recommended intrapartum antibiotics is less effective than 4 or more hours of prophylaxis, 2 hours of antibiotic exposure has been shown to reduce GBS vaginal colony counts and decrease the frequency of a clinical neonatal sepsis diagnosis. Obstetric interventions, when necessary, should not be delayed solely to provide 4 hours of antibiotic administration before birth. This Committee Opinion, including, and, updates and replaces the obstetric components of the CDC 2010 guidelines, "Prevention of Perinatal Group B Streptococcal Disease: Revised Guidelines From CDC, 2010".

### Duration of intrapartum prophylaxis for neonatal group B streptococcal disease: a systematic review [^ad92e6ce]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine published evidence regarding duration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis administered to pregnant women colonized with group B Streptococcus (GBS) to reduce infant colonization with GBS and to prevent early-onset GBS sepsis.

Data Sources

A search was conducted in The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2006), EMBASE (1980 to January 2006), CINAHL (1982 to January 2006), and in protocols and guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Academy of Pediatrics, and American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

Methods Of Study Selection

All randomized controlled trials and observational studies in which duration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is reported relative to subsequent neonatal GBS colonization or sepsis were considered. Case series and study designs using historical cohorts or controls for comparison were excluded.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Three prospective cohort studies and one case-control study met inclusion criteria. Heterogeneity of study design and assembly of cohorts precluded meta-analysis. A systematic review of the individual studies was performed. All studies were rated as fair or poor validity with regard to their ability to evaluate duration of intrapartum prophylaxis and transmission of GBS to the newborn. All 4 studies were largely composed of women with existing risk factors for GBS disease of the newborn. One study supported more than 1 hour of prophylaxis, two studies supported more than 2 hours of prophylaxis, and one was inconclusive.

Conclusion

Despite unequivocal clinical guidelines recommending at least 4 hours of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, there are no well-designed studies examining duration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of early-onset GBS disease of the newborn. We recommend continuing to initiate intrapartum prophylaxis according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines; however, the transmission of GBS to neonates exposed to less than 4 hours of intrapartum prophylaxis and their subsequent management require further study.

### Diagnosis and management of group B. streptococcus in pregnancy [^cf9ec149]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Group B streptococcus (GBS) can cause significant maternal and neonatal morbidity. Over the past 30 years, reductions in early-onset GBS neonatal sepsis in the United States have been attributable to the guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for antepartum screening and treating this organism during labor. This article highlights the clinical implications, screening, diagnosis, prophylactic interventions, and future therapies for mothers with GBS during the peripartum period.

Early-onset GBS prevention — prior recommendations and disease burden are outlined. The 2002 guidelines "recommended universal culture-based screening of all pregnant women at 35–37 weeks' gestation to optimize the identification of women who should receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis". Before active prevention, "an estimated 7,500 cases of neonatal GBS disease occurred annually in the United States", with "striking declines in disease incidence" during increased prevention in the 1990s and "a further reduction" after universal screening in 2002; however, "GBS disease remains the leading infectious cause of morbidity and mortality among newborns in the United States".

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease – revised guidelines from CDC, 2010 [^0fc806b6]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Future of GBS prevention — impact gaps and surveillance needs for group B streptococcus (GBS) are identified: Universal screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis have had no measurable impact on late-onset GBS disease, prenatal-onset disease (including stillbirths and miscarriages), or GBS disease among nonpregnant adults, and the burden of prenatal-onset GBS disease has not been assessed adequately with no effective prevention tools identified before the intrapartum period. Until a safe and efficacious vaccine achieves licensure, continued monitoring for potential unintended consequences of intrapartum antibiotic chemoprophylaxis is needed, including tracking sentinel events such as the emergence of penicillin resistance among GBS isolates and an increase in the incidence of disease or deaths due to neonatal pathogens other than GBS, and monitoring for the latter will require long-term surveillance of a large population of term and preterm births.

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease – revised guidelines from CDC, 2010 [^10627108]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Group B streptococcus (GBS) bacteriuria in pregnancy — prevalence, risk, colony counts, and screening — includes that GBS is found in the urine of 2%–7% of pregnant women, and maternal GBS bacteriuria is a marker for heavy genital tract colonization with an increased risk for early-onset disease in the newborn; antibiotics do not eliminate GBS and recolonization after a course of antibiotics is typical. Some women with GBS bacteriuria during the first trimester might not have vaginal-rectal colonization detected at 35–37 weeks' gestation or at the time of delivery, yet maternal GBS bacteriuria at any point during pregnancy is a recognized risk factor for early-onset GBS disease and has been included as an indication for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis since 1996. Most risk data concern significant GBS bacteriuria (generally > 10^5 colony-forming units per milliliter of urine); lower concentrations (< 10^4 cfu/ mL) can be associated with vaginal-rectal colonization, but relatively few data address risk among women with low-colony-count bacteriuria. Routine screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria is recommended in pregnant women, and identification of GBS through this screening represents an opportunity to detect women at high risk; however, in the context of universal late antenatal GBS screening, it is unclear how much additional disease is prevented by screening for low colony-count GBS bacteriuria and whether identification of low colony-count bacteriuria is cost-effective.

### Prevention of group B streptococcal early-onset disease in newborns: ACOG committee opinion, number 797 [^00910133]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Group B streptococcus (GBS) prevention in pregnancy — The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now recommends performing universal GBS screening between 36 0/7 and 37 6/7 weeks of gestation, and all women whose vaginal–rectal cultures at 36 0/7–37 6/7 weeks of gestation are positive for GBS should receive appropriate intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis unless a prelabor cesarean birth is performed in the setting of intact membranes. Although a shorter duration of recommended intrapartum antibiotics is less effective than 4 or more hours of prophylaxis, 2 hours of antibiotic exposure has been shown to reduce GBS vaginal colony counts and decrease the frequency of a clinical neonatal sepsis diagnosis, and obstetric interventions, when necessary, should not be delayed solely to provide 4 hours of antibiotic administration before birth. Key obstetric measures include universal prenatal screening by vaginal–rectal culture and appropriate implementation of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, and targeted intravenous intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis has demonstrated efficacy, whereas neither antepartum nor intrapartum oral or intramuscular regimens have been shown to be comparably effective in reducing GBS early-onset disease (EOD).

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease – revised guidelines from CDC, 2010 [^822deaa3]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Group B streptococcal (GBS) intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis — risk-based versus culture-based selection criteria and CDC recommendations are described. Early guidelines used either a risk-based approach or culture-based screening. Risk-based criteria included any of: delivery at < 37 weeks' gestation, intrapartum temperature ≥ 100.4°F (≥ 38.0°C), or rupture of membranes for ≥ 18 hours. Culture-based screening entailed vaginal and rectal GBS cultures between 35 and 37 weeks' gestation, with colonized women offered intrapartum antibiotics at labor onset or with rupture of membranes if before labor. Under both strategies, prophylaxis was recommended for women with GBS bacteriuria during the current pregnancy or a previous infant with invasive early-onset GBS disease. A large population-based study during 1998–1999 demonstrated superiority of culture-based screening; in 2002 CDC updated guidelines to recommend universal culture-based screening and recommended that women with unknown GBS colonization status at delivery be managed according to intrapartum risk factors.

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease – revised guidelines from CDC, 2010 [^8ef453e7]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

CDC 2010 prevention of perinatal group B Streptococcus (GBS) disease — key updates and prevention approach: GBS remains the leading cause of early-onset neonatal sepsis in the United States, and initial case series reported case-fatality ratios as high as 50%. Universal screening at 35–37 weeks' gestation for maternal GBS colonization and use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis has resulted in sustained reductions in early-onset disease, although rates of maternal GBS colonization remain unchanged since the 1970s. The key 2010 changes include expanded recommendations on laboratory methods, clarification of the colony-count threshold for reporting GBS bacteriuria in pregnancy, updated screening and intrapartum chemoprophylaxis algorithms for women with preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of membranes, a change in the recommended dose of penicillin-G for chemoprophylaxis, updated prophylaxis regimens for women with penicillin allergy, and a revised algorithm for management of newborns with respect to risk for early-onset GBS disease. Colonization with GBS in the genitourinary or gastrointestinal tracts is identified as the primary risk factor, trials showed that administering intravenous antibiotics during labor to women at risk could prevent early-onset disease, and in the absence of a licensed GBS vaccine, universal screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis continue to be the cornerstones of prevention.

### Management of infants at risk for group B streptococcal disease [^b233c37f]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Management of infants at risk for group B streptococcal disease — Group B streptococcal (GBS) infection is described as the most common cause of neonatal early-onset sepsis and a significant cause of late-onset sepsis among young infants. The report states that administration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) is the only currently available effective strategy for prevention of perinatal GBS early-onset disease (EOD), and that there is no effective approach for prevention of late-onset disease. It joins with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to "reaffirm the use of universal antenatal microbiologic-based testing for the detection of maternal GBS colonization to facilitate appropriate administration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis". Background guideline history notes that the 1996 consensus guidelines recommended either an antenatal culture–based or risk factor–based approach for IAP, and that 2002 updates reflected data that universal screening "was ≥ 50% more effective at preventing the disease compared to a risk-based approach".

### Adherence to perinatal group B streptococcal prevention guidelines [^403da4fe]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate compliance with the 2002 revised perinatal group B streptococci (GBS) prevention guidelines in Tennessee, which recommend universal GBS screening of pregnant women at 35–37 weeks of gestation and, when indicated, administration of intrapartum chemoprophylaxis.

Methods

Active Bacterial Core surveillance conducts active, population-based surveillance for invasive GBS disease in 11 Tennessee counties. A retrospective case-cohort study was conducted using a stratified random sample of all live births in surveillance hospitals during 2003–2004, including all early-onset GBS cases. Factors associated with GBS screening and lack of optimal GBS chemoprophylaxis were analyzed using logistic regression.

Results

Screening was performed for 84.7% of pregnant women, but 26.3% of prenatal tests with documented test dates were performed before 35 weeks of gestation. Among women with an indication for GBS prophylaxis, 61.2% received optimal chemoprophylaxis, defined as initiation of a recommended antibiotic 4 hours or more before delivery. When the analysis was restricted to women who were admitted 4 hours or more before delivery, 70.9% received optimal chemoprophylaxis. Women not receiving optimal chemoprophylaxis were more likely to have penicillin allergy (11.7% compared with 2.5%, adjusted odds ratio [OR] 8.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.57–47.04) or preterm delivery (45.5% compared with 13.2%, adjusted OR 5.52, 95% CI 2.29–13.30) and were less likely to have received the recommended prenatal serologic testing for other infectious diseases (77.9% compared with 91.1%, adjusted OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.09–0.98). Forty cases of early-onset GBS were identified (0.36 per 1,000 live births); 25% of these neonates were born to women who received screening at 35 weeks of gestation or later and, when indicated, optimal chemoprophylaxis.

Conclusion

Universal prenatal GBS screening was implemented widely in Tennessee, although the timing of screening and administration of chemoprophylaxis often were not optimal. A substantial burden of early-onset GBS disease occurs despite optimal prenatal screening and chemoprophylaxis, suggesting that alternative strategies, such as vaccination, are needed.

### Early-onset group B streptococcal disease in the United States: potential for further reduction [^6fe11dc3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe lapses in adherence to group B streptococcus (GBS) prevention guidelines among cases of early-onset GBS disease in term and preterm neonates and to estimate the potential for further reduction in disease burden under current prevention strategies.

Methods

We reviewed labor and delivery and prenatal records of mothers of neonates with early-onset GBS disease (aged younger than 7 days with GBS isolated from a normally sterile site) identified at population-based surveillance sites in 2008–2009. We interviewed prenatal care providers about GBS screening practices and obtained relevant laboratory records. We evaluated the data for errors in prenatal screening, laboratory methods, communication of results, and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. Using published data on screening sensitivity and intrapartum prophylaxis effectiveness, we estimated the potential reduction in cases under optimal prevention implementation.

Results

Among 309 cases, 179 (57.9%) had one or more implementation errors. The most common error type in term and preterm case-patients was prenatal screening (80 of 222 [36.0%]) and intrapartum prophylaxis (46 of 85 [54.1%]), respectively. We estimated that under optimal implementation, cases of early-onset GBS disease could be reduced by 26–59% with the largest benefit from a single intervention coming from improved use of intrapartum prophylaxis (16% decrease).

Conclusion

Further reduction of early-onset GBS disease burden is possible under current prevention strategies, particularly with improved implementation of antibiotic prophylaxis. However, even with perfect adherence to recommended practices, the decline in cases may be modest. Therefore, novel prevention approaches such as improved intrapartum assays and vaccines are also needed.

### Neonatal group B streptococcal disease: from pathogenesis to preventive strategies [^8aff2160]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Streptococcus agalactiae, or group B streptococcus (GBS), remains the leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis, as early-onset or late-onset diseases (EOD, LOD). Where consensus guidelines to detect and treat intrapartum women with GBS colonization have been widely adopted, incidence of neonatal EOD has dramatically declined. In response to both successful impacts on the incidence of GBS-EOD and analyses of missed opportunities, the first American guidelines for prevention issued in the 1990s have since been adapted in several stages to improve their efficacy. In some countries in Europe, nationwide guidelines, whether screening-based or risk-based, for the prevention of neonatal GBS diseases have also been issued and adopted, with the expected impact on incidence of GBS-EOD. In spite of universal screening, in spite of the great progress that has been made, GBS-EOD continues to occur and the GBS burden remains a significant public health issue. Continuous efforts to improve screening for GBS status continue to be important and may be able to take advantage of new rapid diagnostic technologies. The current screening-based strategy for prevention is highly effective but imperfect. Given the challenges, limitations and potential complications of maternal intrapartum prophylaxis, a new approach is still needed. Maternal immunization against GBS is an attractive alternative for the prevention of not only neonatal diseases but also stillbirths and maternal diseases. Vaccines against GBS may become the most effective and sustainable long-term preventive strategy.

### Perinatal group B streptococcal disease after universal screening recommendations – United States, 2003–2005 [^ff3af3da]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2007). Low credibility.

Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in the United States. In 2002, CDC, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued revised guidelines for the prevention of perinatal GBS disease. These guidelines recommend universal screening of pregnant women by culture for rectovaginal GBS colonization at 35–37 weeks' gestation and the use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for GBS carriers. To examine rates of neonatal and pregnancy-associated GBS disease after the revised guidelines were issued, CDC analyzed surveillance data from the Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs) system from the period 2003–2005 and compared them with data from 2000–2001, the period immediately preceding the universal screening recommendations. This report describes the results of that analysis, which indicated that annual incidence of early onset GBS disease (i.e., in infants aged 0–6 days) was 33% lower during 2003–2005 than during 2000–2001. However, although incidence among white infants decreased steadily during 2003–2005, incidence increased 70% among black infants. Incidence of GBS disease among infants aged 7–89 days (i.e., late-onset disease) and pregnant women remained stable after revised universal screening guidelines were issued. Continued surveillance is needed to monitor the impact of the guidelines on perinatal GBS disease and trends in racial disparities and to guide interventions to reduce disparities.

### Group B streptococcal disease worldwide for pregnant women, stillbirths, and children: why, what, and how to undertake estimates? [^69b8cfe5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Improving maternal, newborn, and child health is central to Sustainable Development Goal targets for 2030, requiring acceleration especially to prevent 5.6 million deaths around the time of birth. Infections contribute to this burden, but etiological data are limited. Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is an important perinatal pathogen, although previously focus has been primarily on liveborn children, especially early-onset disease. In this first of an 11-article supplement, we discuss the following: (1) Why estimate the worldwide burden of GBS disease? (2) What outcomes of GBS in pregnancy should be included? (3) What data and epidemiological parameters are required? (4) What methods and models can be used to transparently estimate this burden of GBS? (5) What are the challenges with available data? and (6) How can estimates address data gaps to better inform GBS interventions including maternal immunization? We review all available GBS data worldwide, including maternal GBS colonization, risk of neonatal disease (with/without intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis), maternal GBS disease, neonatal/infant GBS disease, and subsequent impairment, plus GBS-associated stillbirth, preterm birth, and neonatal encephalopathy. We summarize our methods for searches, meta-analyses, and modeling including a compartmental model. Our approach is consistent with the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER), published in The Lancet and the Public Library of Science (PLoS). We aim to address priority epidemiological gaps highlighted by WHO to inform potential maternal vaccination.

### Perinatal group B streptococcal disease prevention, Minnesota [^660938fb]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Group B streptococci (GBS) emerged as the leading cause of invasive bacterial infections in newborns in the United States in the 1970s. Although the incidence of GBS disease has declined substantially, it remains the leading cause of serious infection in newborns. Perinatal GBS transmission can be reduced dramatically by diagnosing maternal GBS colonization and administering intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis (IAP) during labor and delivery.

In 1996, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published consensus guidelines recommending 2 methods of perinatal GBS disease prevention. The screening-based approach recommends obtaining vaginal and rectal cultures at 35–37 weeks of gestation. Women with GBS-positive cultures are offered IAP during labor. The risk-based approach recommends administering IAP to women with GBS risk factors when they go into labor. These guidelines are believed to have increased use of GBS disease prevention approaches by prenatal care providers, which has led to a decrease in the incidence of GBS disease. A 2002 study further indicated that routine screening for GBS would prevent ≈50% more newborn GBS infections than would a risk-based approach. This study, along with other data, led CDC to publish revised guidelines in August 2002 recommending universal prenatal screening.

As part of the Minnesota Department of Health Emerging Infections Program, prenatal care providers in Minnesota were surveyed in April 1998 to determine strategies to prevent perinatal GBS disease. In November 2002, a similar survey was undertaken to determine the extent to which Minnesota providers have adopted the revised 2002 CDC guidelines.

### Disease surveillance and the academic, clinical, and public health communities [^ec64c03c]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Revised Recommendations for Preventing Perinatal Group B Streptococcal Disease

Data developed through ABCs provided a basis for revising recommendations for the prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal (GBS) disease. Since its emergence in the 1970s, GBS disease has been the leading invasive bacterial infection associated with illness and death among newborns in the United States. Surviving infants may have long-term developmental disabilities, such as mental retardation or hearing and vision loss. Newborns at increased risk for GBS disease are those born to women who are colonized with GBS in the genital or rectal areas. Although the use of intrapartum prophylaxis has led to a 70% decline in the incidence of GBS disease during the 1990s (Figure 2), early-onset GBS disease (in infants < 7 days old) remains a leading cause of illness and death among newborns. Guidelines issued in 1996 recommended either screening pregnant women for GBS colonization by means of prenatal cultures (screening approach) or assessing obstetric risk factors intrapartum (risk-based approach) to identify candidates for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis.

### Adverse events in women and children who have received intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis treatment: a systematic review [^9b05a1a3]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

A Cochrane meta-analysis concluded that despite an 83% reduction in EOGBS incidence from IAP, IAP for maternal GBS is not supported by conclusive evidence due to a high risk of bias across RCTs. Combining this uncertainty with the results of this review makes it increasingly difficult to ascertain whether the benefits of administering IAP for EOGBS prevention outweigh the harms to mothers and children. Large, well-designed RCTs required to answer this question may no longer be feasible as IAP is now the recommended treatment. Instead, large, better quality, and longitudinal observational studies across countries with widespread IAP may be an alternative to understand the adverse events occurring in participants treated with IAP. Expanding EOGBS prevention from risk-based strategies to universal antenatal screening introduces the risk of increasing the number of low risk women treated with IAP. Up to 30% of mothers positive in pregnancy may become negative by birth, and less than 1% of mothers colonised in labour have a baby with EOGBS, all of whom could be unnecessarily exposed to potential harms. As observational evidence on universal GBS screening effectiveness is limited due to inherent biases, an RCT could inform on both the effectiveness and harms of screening and IAP treatment for neonatal GBS disease prevention.

### Intrapartum antibiotic chemoprophylaxis policies for the prevention of group B streptococcal disease worldwide: systematic review [^60915ba9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS; Streptococcus agalactiae) is a leading cause of early-onset disease in infants (EOGBS), defined as disease occurring on days 0–6 after birth. Colonization of the maternal genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract is a prerequisite for EOGBS disease, with vertical transmission of GBS to babies occurring at or just before birth. The administration of intrapartum antibiotics aims to prevent EOGBS and is traditionally targeted based on known GBS colonization and/or the presence of peripartum clinical risk factors. The potential mechanisms for prevention of EOGBS include reduction or suppression of maternal vaginal GBS colonization and thereby reduction of vertical transmission. In addition, intrapartum antibiotic chemoprophylaxis (IAP) may allow the early treatment of GBS chorioamnionitis or fetal infection.

IAP has been recommended in the United States by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Society for Microbiology, and American College of Nurse-Midwives since the early 1990s, with the first consensus policy in 1996. Initially the United States recommended both risk-based and microbiological screening. However, a large multicenter cohort study in 2002 found microbiological screening to be superior in this setting. Subsequently, policy was changed to recommend microbiologic screening (using a rectovaginal swab) for GBS colonization at 35–37 weeks' gestation or among women with threatened preterm delivery and unknown colonization status, and administration of high-dose intravenous benzylpenicillin or ampicillin in labor among those GBS colonized. Additionally, women with GBS bacteriuria or a previous infant with GBS disease as well as women with unknown colonization status and intrapartum risk factors such as prolonged rupture of membranes or maternal fever, are offered IAP in labor. A significant reduction in the incidence of EOGBS has been reported since the introduction of IAP policies; EOGBS disease in the United States declined from 1.7 per 1000 live births in the 1990s to 0.21 per 1000 live births in 2015. However, a recent Cochrane review found that although IAP may reduce the incidence of EOGBS, it did not result in a significant reduction in the mortality associated with EOGBS. The review was critical of the quality of the studies included and considered there to be a high risk of bias in their methodology and execution.

### Preventing group B strep disease in newborns… [^c571f70c]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Group B Streptococcus disease can be very serious, even deadly, for babies.
- Learn about the steps healthcare providers can take to prevent GBS disease during the first week of a newborn's life. Overview The best way to prevent GBS disease during the first week of life is to give antibiotics, during labor, to women at increased risk. All pregnant women should get screened for GBS bacteria. Keep Reading: GBS Screening During Pregnancy. Antibiotics during labor Healthcare providers give antibiotics to women who are at increased risk of having a baby who will develop GBS disease. The antibiotics help protect babies from infection, but only if given during labor. Antibiotics can't be given before labor begins because the bacteria can grow back quickly. Healthcare providers give the antibiotic by IV. Beta-lactams are the type of antibiotic prescribed the most during labor to prevent GBS disease.

Penicillin and ampicillin are examples of beta-lactams. However, healthcare providers can give other antibiotics to women who are severely allergic to these antibiotics. Why prevention is important Antibiotics are very safe About 1 in 10 women have mild side effects from receiving penicillin. There's a rare chance of having a severe allergic reaction that requires emergency treatment. Antibiotics are very effective Antibiotics are very effective at preventing GBS disease in newborns. Consider the following examples: Treated with antibiotics got antibioticsduring labor. well protectedfrom GBS disease. No antibiotics didn't get antibioticsduring labor. 20 times more likelyto get GBS disease compared to Tanya's baby.

### Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent group B streptococcal infections in newborn infants: a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing various strategies [^826ded8e]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Early-onset Group B Streptococcus (EOGBS) infection, comprising sepsis, pneumonia and meningitis, are a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, with a worldwide incidence of 0.41 per 1000 live births and a mortality rate of 4–10% in high-income countries. EOGBS infections are defined as the presence of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) within 7 days of birth in normally sterile fluids, such as blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Infants may be infected antenatally by vertical transmission in colonised pregnant women. Globally, GBS colonisation of the recto-vaginal tract is present in 10–30% of all pregnant women during pregnancy. Therefore, prevention of the sequelae of GBS colonisation contributes importantly to perinatal health.

Currently, prevention of vertical transmission consists of administration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) at least 4 h before birth, which is associated with a reduced risk of EOGBS infection. IAP is administered according to various screening strategies applied in different settings. Risk-factor based screening ('risk-based') strategies are used in some settings, where IAP is administered according to the presence of any risk factor for EOGBS during pregnancy. In universal microbiology-based screening ('universal') strategies GBS colonisation is determined in all pregnant women antenatally and IAP is administered to women with GBS colonisation. In addition, IAP can be administered with any combination of elements from risk-based and universal strategies ('other').

### Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent group B streptococcal infections in newborn infants: a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing various strategies [^9e1b3ef6]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses reported that universal strategies were associated with a lower incidence of EOGBS infection compared to risk-based strategies or having no strategy. However, IAP strategies still vary considerably around the world and are largely absent in developing countries. Reasons for the variation in IAP strategies include discussion concerning increased antibiotic use, antimicrobial resistance development and risk of a possible increase in non-GBS early-onset sepsis (EOS), caused by pathogens like Escherichia coli. Moreover, even when implementing universal strategies, there is no consensus of timing of GBS determination, though most guidelines recommend determination between 35 and 37 weeks' gestation.

In order to contribute to consensus on GBS prevention strategies, this review elaborates on previous work, while incorporating up-to-date evidence on a variety of outcomes needed for evidence-based and nuanced policy-making. We evaluated the effectiveness of different prevention strategies, by comparing maternal and neonatal infectious morbidity and mortality, the frequency of IAP administration, and the presence of antimicrobial resistance. Furthermore, we evaluated timing of GBS determination in universal strategies to prevent EOGBS infection in newborns.

### Antibiotic choice for group B. streptococcus prophylaxis in mothers with reported penicillin allergy and associated newborn outcomes [^9a06e111]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vertical transmission of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection is the most common cause of early onset neonatal sepsis and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality in the newborn. To date, the only effective strategy to reduce the risk of early onset neonatal GBS disease is intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis in mothers who are known or suspected to be colonized with GBS. Implementation of national guidelines has led to a drastic decline of early onset neonatal GBS sepsis, with a nearly 8-fold decrease since 1990. Beta-lactam antibiotics, specifically penicillin and cephalosporins, are considered first-line for GBS prophylaxis because they are highly effective, have a narrow spectrum of activity, and are less likely to result in antibiotic-related complications. Unfortunately, a penicillin allergy is commonly reported with roughly 10% of the U.S. population reporting a history of a penicillin allergy, although most are unverified. The existing literature shows that there is significant variability in appropriate antibiotic selection for intrapartum GBS prophylaxis, particularly for pregnant individuals who report a penicillin allergy. Alternative antibiotics, such as clindamycin and vancomycin, are often used for patients who report a penicillin allergy even though most have a low-risk allergy or do not have a confirmed true allergy. Inappropriate use of beta-lactam alternatives has been associated with worse outcomes for non-pregnant patients and increased healthcare utilization costs. In pregnant patients, being labeled with a penicillin allergy has been associated with increased maternal morbidities and longer length of hospital stay. However, less is known about the impact of a maternal beta-lactam allergy label on the neonate in the setting of GBS prophylaxis.

While studies have shown that alternative antibiotics such as clindamycin and vancomycin can reach therapeutic levels in the fetus, they have not been demonstrated to effectively prevent neonatal GBS disease and may in fact be associated with increased rates of neonatal early-onset GBS disease. Therefore, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) does not consider these antibiotics to be adequate prophylaxis. If a pregnant mother receives alternative antibiotics and then experiences any risk factors for neonatal GBS infection, such as fever, preterm labor or prolonged rupture of membranes, the neonate must be considered at higher risk of early onset GBS infection. During the time of our data collection (2005–2018), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that this subset of higher risk infants should undergo laboratory testing to assess for infection, with some of these infants going on to receive empiric antibiotics if labs were abnormal.

Impact of group B streptococcus (GBS) prevention efforts on infant management indicates that provider surveys in the early to mid 1990s found pediatricians and neonatologists were more likely to conduct diagnostic evaluations and initiate empiric antibiotics for infants whose mothers received intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis than for those whose mothers did not; studies during 1996–2002 were inconsistent, reporting increased, stable, or decreased use of health services for neonates born to women receiving intrapartum antibiotics, and no studies have reported on the impact of the 2002 guidelines.

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease – revised guidelines from CDC, 2010 [^4c1dcb11]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Implementation and impact of group B Streptococcus (GBS) prevention efforts — following the 2002 recommendation for universal culture screening, implementation was rapid and widespread. The proportion of infants whose mothers were screened before delivery increased from 48.1% during 1998–1999 to 85.0% during 2003–2004; among women screened during 2003–2004, 98.4% had a result available at labor and 24.2% were documented as GBS-positive. Among mothers with an indication for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, receipt increased from 73.8% during 1998–1999 to 85.1% during 2003–2004. Gaps persisted in preterm care: because antenatal screening is recommended at 35–37 weeks of gestation, only 50.3% of women delivering preterm had a known colonization status at admission; among women with unknown status who delivered preterm only 63.4% received intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, 73.5% received prophylaxis for indications of GBS bacteriuria or a previous infant with GBS disease, and 84.5% received prophylaxis when the GBS screen was positive. Screening on admission among women with threatened preterm delivery and unknown colonization status was suboptimal, with only 18% who progressed to delivery and 31% who did not progress to delivery screened. Overall, the proportion of laboring women who received intrapartum antibiotics increased only slightly, from 26.8% to 31.7%, and penicillin and ampicillin remained the most common agents administered, with 76.7% of women receiving intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis receiving these agents.

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease – revised guidelines from CDC, 2010 [^70e7fc1b]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Cesarean delivery and group B streptococcal (GBS) prophylaxis — Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent early-onset GBS disease is not recommended as a routine practice for cesarean deliveries performed before labor onset on women with intact amniotic membranes, regardless of GBS colonization status or gestational age (CIII), and perioperative prophylactic antibiotics for cesarean delivery should not be altered by GBS status; however, women expected to undergo cesarean deliveries should undergo routine vaginal and rectal screening for GBS at 35–37 weeks' gestation because labor or membrane rupture can occur before the planned cesarean, and under those circumstances GBS-colonized women should receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (AII). Health-care providers should inform women of their GBS screening test result and the recommended interventions (BIII).

### Group B streptococci: declining incidence in infants in Germany [^2c4cafc5]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in newborns worldwide. From 2000 to 2008, national guidelines in Germany recommended intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for pregnant women displaying risk factors (eg, perinatal anogenital GBS colonization, rupture of the membranes ≥ 18 hours before birth) for the vertical transmission of GBS to their children. In 2008, these guidelines were revised to advocate universal, culture-based screening for GBS colonization among all pregnant women between 35 and 37 weeks of gestation. For the period 2009–2010, our prospective active surveillance study assessed the incidence of invasive GBS infections in infants 0–90 days of age in Germany. We did this by means of a capture-recapture analysis of 2 separate, independent systems (pediatric reporting versus laboratory reporting). We compared our results with those from a previous study by employing an equivalent design (2001–2003). We detected a 32% reduction in GBS incidence, from 0.47 per 1000 live births (n = 679) in 2001–2003 to 0.34 per 1000 live births (n = 450) in 2009–2010. This decline primarily is tied to a reduced number of GBS cases in children under 1 week of age. In 2009–2010, the ratio of early-onset disease to late-onset disease reversed from 1.52 (206:136), as determined in 2001–2003, to 0.75 (92:122). This study is the first to assess changes in the incidence of invasive GBS in Germany after the implementation of the guidelines for intrapartum prophylaxis for pregnant women colonized with GBS.

### Academic detailing and adherence to guidelines for group B streptococci prenatal screening: a randomized controlled trial [^b3f151e5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection is the most common bacterial infection transmitted vertically from mother to child during labor and delivery. The neonatal infection is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality and can severely affect the quality of life of the child in the short and long term. Efforts are needed internationally to prevent neonatal GBS infections.

Medical guidelines on prenatal care strongly recommend GBS screening of the vagina and anus between 35 and 37 weeks of gestation and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis of colonized women to prevent neonatal infection. Despite their success as a strategy to prevent perinatal GBS disease, these recommendations have mostly been applied in developed countries only. In Brazil, a prevalence of maternal colonization by GBS of between 15 and 25% suggests that universal screening is likely to be cost-effective in this country, and GBS screening is recommended by the Brazilian Medical Guidelines on prenatal care. Interventions potentially effective in promoting the adherence of obstetricians to these guidelines are lacking in this country.

Internationally, the implementation of medical guidelines is a challenge that usually takes many years. Passive continuing medical education, or traditional education, appears to be of limited effect in guideline implementation. Studies have shown that educating physicians in their office is a promising strategy for changing medical practice, mainly through academic detailing (AD), an intervention that combines interactive, one-on-one communication conducted by trained healthcare professionals — typically pharmacists, physicians or nurses — with evidence-based, noncommercial information. AD has been successfully applied to increase the adherence of health professionals to guidelines for screening and to decrease inappropriate use of medicines. It involves face-to-face education, with additional elements such as educational materials, educational meetings, or audit and feedback.

Some studies have assessed the effectiveness of AD in the implementation of guidelines in obstetrics, with mixed effects and favorable results. Multifaceted behavioral interventions, including AD visits, appeared to increase the prophylactic use of oxytocin during the third stage of labor and reduced the likelihood of episiotomy in one study.

No research has investigated the effect of AD in promoting GBS screening in the private or public sector in Brazil. This study examined the effectiveness of AD, conducted through an educational visit by a trained physician to obstetricians, in promoting screening for vaginal and rectal GBS colonization.

### A novel hexavalent capsular polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (GBS6) for the prevention of neonatal group B streptococcal infections by maternal immunization [^ca9ee7ed]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Streptococcus agalactiae, or group B streptococcus (GBS), is an encapsulated gram-positive opportunistic pathogen associated with lower intestinal and rectovaginal colonization in 11%–35% of women. In pregnant women, the species causes ascending infections ranging from relatively benign urinary tract infections to chorioamnionitis, potentially resulting in stillbirth, preterm delivery, and puerperal sepsis. In infants, the disease most commonly occurs within the first week of life (hereafter, "early onset disease") and less commonly occurs between 7 and 90 days of life (hereafter, "late-onset disease"). Neonatal GBS disease generally manifests as sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis. The global mortality rate is 8.4%, with rates in the United States and Africa of 7% and 19%, respectively. Infants surviving GBS meningitis can experience severe neurological consequences, including cognitive delay, cerebral palsy, blindness, or hearing loss.

In the United States, universal screening for rectovaginal GBS colonization is recommended for pregnant women between 35 and 37 weeks of gestation, and carriers receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis during delivery, to prevent disease. After introduction of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, the incidence of early onset disease decreased from 1.7 to 0.22 cases/1000 live births. Late-onset disease rates, however, have remained unaffected, at 0.25 cases/1000 live births. In addition, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis will not affect GBS infections before delivery, either in pregnant women or the developing fetus. Furthermore, as prophylaxis to prevent GBS diseases and infections following cesarean section has led to administration of antibiotics in approximately 40% of all labor and delivery procedures in the United States, apprehension about overuse of antibiotics is growing because of the propensity for development of antimicrobial resistance. Particularly concerning is exposure to antibiotics when the neonate's microbiome becomes established, which may lead to health consequences later in life. Finally, implementation of prenatal screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis requires a well-developed infrastructure that is not available in most low-to-middle-income countries, where healthcare access and standards of prenatal care vary greatly.

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease – revised guidelines from CDC, 2010 [^e03ce210]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Preterm delivery and GBS prophylaxis — management challenges, potential harms/benefits, and recommended actions are detailed. Preterm (at < 37 weeks and 0 days' gestation) delivery is noted as a risk factor, and colonization status is often unknown when labor or rupture of membranes occur before 35–37 weeks' gestation. Clinical trials have demonstrated that certain antibiotic regimens prolong latency, yet other data suggest harms including necrotizing enterocolitis in the neonate and adverse neonatal outcomes such as increased need for supplementary oxygen or cerebral palsy. The 2002 guidelines recommended that if GBS colonization status from the current pregnancy is not known and labor or rupture of membranes occurred before 37 weeks' gestation with substantial risk for preterm delivery, then GBS screening should be performed and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for GBS should be provided pending culture results. When penicillin, ampicillin, or cefazolin prophylaxis was administered for ≥ 4 hours before delivery to women delivering at < 37 weeks' gestation, effectiveness against early-onset GBS disease was 78% (95% confidence interval: 44%–91%).

### Prevention of group B streptococcal early-onset disease in newborns: ACOG committee opinion, number 797 [^88d5aaea]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Group B streptococcus (GBS) prevention — screening and intrapartum prophylaxis indications: All pregnant women should undergo antepartum screening for GBS at 36 0/7–37 6/7 weeks of gestation, providing a 5-week window that includes births up to at least 41 0/7 weeks; women with positive vaginal–rectal cultures at 36 0/7–37 6/7 weeks should receive appropriate intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis unless a prelabor cesarean birth is performed with intact membranes, and women with a positive prenatal GBS culture who have a cesarean before labor with intact membranes do not require prophylaxis; if the prenatal GBS culture is unknown when labor starts, prophylaxis is indicated for risk factors including a substantial risk of preterm birth, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM), rupture of membranes for 18 or more hours at term, or intrapartum fever (temperature 100.4°F [38°C] or higher), and if intraamniotic infection is suspected, broad-spectrum therapy should replace GBS-specific prophylaxis; for term labor with unknown colonization but a prior history of GBS colonization in a previous pregnancy, it is reasonable to offer intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis and clinicians may consider discussing empiric intrapartum prophylaxis as a shared decision-making process.

Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis — antimicrobial agents and goals are defined, with agent selection prioritized. Prophylaxis to reduce risk of GBS early-onset disease (EOD) "is based on a two-pronged approach" of decreasing neonatal colonization and reducing neonatal sepsis by ensuring adequate maternal, fetal, and newborn drug levels. "Intravenous penicillin remains the agent of choice for intrapartum prophylaxis, with intravenous ampicillin as an acceptable alternative", and penicillin is preferred first line due to a narrower spectrum and lower resistance selection risk. Recommended dosages were developed to achieve levels "above the minimal inhibitory concentration for GBS" in fetal blood and amniotic fluid while minimizing maternal toxicity.

### Consequences of prophylaxis for group B streptococcal infections of the neonate [^a0f9d7de]. Seminars in Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

In the 1970s, group B streptococci emerged as the leading cause of neonatal infections. The incidence ranged between 1.5 and 2 cases per 1000 in the U.S. in the 1980s up to the early 1990s. In the 1980s, selective treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics of mothers in labor turned out to be the most successful mode of prevention. In 1996, the CDC, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended the use of one of two prevention strategies: the culture-based strategy or a risk-based strategy for mothers who did not have prenatal cultures. In 2002, the guidelines were updated to recommend as preferable the culture-based method, which was found to result in superior prevention compared with the risk-based method. Subsequent to the 1996 recommendations, early-onset GBS infection has been reduced by greater than 70% and racial inequalities have been narrowed. Whether exposure of millions of mothers to penicillin or ampicillin will have an undesirable effect of causing more Escherichia coli infections in neonates or will result in more ampicillin-resistant organisms being responsible for early-onset neonatal infections remains unclear.

### Intrapartum antibiotics for known maternal group B streptococcal colonization [^51479eb8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Maternal colonization with group B streptococcus (GBS) during pregnancy increases the risk of neonatal infection by vertical transmission. Administration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) during labor has been associated with a reduction in early onset GBS disease (EOGBSD). However, treating all colonized women during labor exposes a large number of women and infants to possible adverse effects without benefit.

Objectives

To assess the effect of intrapartum antibiotics for maternal Group B haemolytic streptococci (GBS) colonization on mortality from any cause, from GBS infection and from organisms other than GBS.

Search Methods

We updated the search of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register on 11 March 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials assessing the impact of maternal IAP on neonatal GBS infections were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently assessed eligibility and quality of the studies.

Main Results

We did not identify any new trials from the updated search so the results remain unchanged as follows. We included four trials involving 852 women. Three trials (involving 500 women) evaluating the effects of IAP versus no treatment were included. The use of IAP did not significantly reduce the incidence of all cause mortality, mortality from GBS infection or from infections caused by bacteria other than GBS. The incidence of early GBS infection was reduced with IAP compared to no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 0.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.74, three trials, 488 infants; risk difference -0.04, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.01; number needed to treat to benefit 25, 95% CI 14 to 100, I² 0%). The incidence of LOD or sepsis from organisms other than GBS and puerperal infection was not significantly different between groups. One trial (involving 352 women) compared intrapartum ampicillin versus penicillin and reported no significant difference in neonatal or maternal outcomes. We found a high risk of bias for one or more key domains in the study methodology and execution.

Authors' Conclusions

Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis appeared to reduce EOGBSD, but this result may well be due to bias as we found a high risk of bias for one or more key domains in the study methodology and execution. There is lack of evidence from well designed and conducted trials to recommend IAP to reduce neonatal EOGBSD. Ideally the effectiveness of IAP to reduce neonatal GBS infections should be studied in adequately sized double-blind controlled trials. The opportunity to conduct such trials has likely been lost, as practice guidelines (albeit without good evidence) have been introduced in many jurisdictions.

### Adverse events in women and children who have received intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis treatment: a systematic review [^eb530a99]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Adverse events from intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) are poorly documented yet essential to inform clinical practice for neonatal group B Streptococcus (GBS) disease prevention. In this systematic review, we appraised and synthesised the evidence on the adverse events of IAP in the mother and/or her child.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Science Citation Index from date of inception until October 16th 2016. Reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews were hand-searched. We included primary studies in English that reported any adverse events from intrapartum antibiotics for any prophylactic purpose compared to controls. The search was not restricted to prophylaxis for GBS but excluded women with symptoms of infection or undergoing caesarean section. Two reviewers assessed the methodological quality of studies, using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomised Studies. Results were synthesised narratively and displayed in text and tables.

Results

From 2364 unique records, 30 studies were included. Despite a wide range of adverse events reported in 17 observational studies and 13 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), the evidence was inconsistent and at high risk of bias. Only one RCT investigated the long-term effects of IAP reporting potentially serious outcomes such as cerebral palsy; however, it had limited applicability and unclear biological plausibility. Seven observational studies showed that IAP for maternal GBS colonisation alters the infant microbiome. However, study populations were not followed through to clinical outcomes, therefore clinical significance is unknown. There was also observational evidence for increased antimicrobial resistance, however studies were at high or unclear risk of bias.

Conclusions

The evidence base to determine the frequency of adverse events from intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for neonatal GBS disease prevention is limited. As RCTs may not be possible, large, better quality, and longitudinal observational studies across countries with widespread IAP could fill this gap.

### Prevention of group B streptococcal disease in the newborn [^fc70fe8f]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among newborns. Universal screening for GBS among women at 35 to 37 weeks of gestation is more effective than administration of intrapartum antibiotics based on risk factors. Lower vaginal and rectal cultures for GBS are collected at 35 to 37 weeks of gestation, and routine dindamycin and erythromycin susceptibility testing is performed in women allergic to penicillin. Women with GBS bacteriuria in the current pregnancy and those who previously delivered a GBS-septic newborn are not screened but automatically receive intrapartum antibiotics. Intrapartum chemoprophylaxis is selected based on maternal allergy history and susceptibility of GBS isolates. Intravenous penicillin G is the preferred antibiotic, with ampicillin as an alternative. Penicillin G should be administered at least four hours before delivery for maximum effectiveness. Cefazolin is recommended in women allergic to penicillin who are at low risk of anaphylaxis. Clindamycin and erythromycin are options for women at high risk for anaphylaxis, and vancomycin should be used in women allergic to penicillin and whose cultures indicate resistance to clindamycin and erytbromycin or when susceptibility is unknown. Asymptomatic neonates born to GBS-colonized mothers should be observed for at least 24 hours for signs of sepsis. Newborns who appear septic should have diagnostic work-up including blood culture followed by initiation of ampicillin and gentamicin. Studies indicate that intrapartum prophylaxis of GBS carriers and selective administration of antibiotics to newborns reduce neonatal GBS sepsis by as much as 80 to 95 percent.

### Uncertainties in screening and prevention of group B. streptococcus disease [^55447e57]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

In autumn 2016, the UK Department of Health (now Department of Health and Social Care) convened 2 meetings to discuss how to address research evidence gaps in order to minimize the impact of infant group B streptococcus (GBS) disease in the United Kingdom. At that meeting, a number of research priorities were highlighted, including improving the screening for GBS colonization in pregnant women, offering intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis and point-of-care testing, and understanding the effect of widespread intrapartum antibiotic use on long-term infant health. Further discussions involved investigating the feasibility of a large prospective study of pregnant women and their infants in order to understand the role of antibodies in the protection against GBS disease in infancy following maternal exposure to GBS colonization. Here, we summarize the research uncertainties identified at that meeting.

### High prevalence of group B. streptococcus colonization among pregnant women in amman, Jordan [^fc76be42]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Group B Streptococcus (S. agalactiae; " GBS") is a gram-positive bacterium with a special capacity to cause perinatal infections of the mother, fetus, and/or newborn. This pathogen causes chorioamnionitis, preterm birth, stillbirth, meningitis and is a leading cause of both early-onset (< 7 days of life) and late-onset (7–89 days of life) neonatal sepsis. Globally, the burden of GBS disease is estimated to be 0.49–0.53 per 1000 livebirths, with a case fatality rate of 8.4–9.6%. The incidence of early-onset GBS disease is estimated to be 0.43 per 1000 livebirths, with a case fatality rate of 12.1%, twice that of late-onset disease.

In the United States, recommendations for routine screening for GBS in women between 35 and 37 weeks pregnant, followed by antibiotic prophylaxis 4h prior to delivery for colonized patients, led to a dramatic decrease in the incidence of early-onset GBS disease in neonates, with no change in the incidence of late-onset GBS. This screen-and-treat paradigm, however, has not been widely adopted outside of the United States, and policy decisions have been challenged by the absence of solid estimates of the number of at-risk mothers and babies in many parts of the world. One barrier to obtaining reliable epidemiological data from low- and middle-income countries has been the absence of accurate point-of-care tests to determine GBS colonization without the need for time-consuming and expensive, laboratory-based cultivation practices.

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease: a public health perspective… [^8dd04b0e]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

CDC recommends use of one of two prevention strategies. In the first strategy, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is offered to women identified as GBS carriers through prenatal screening cultures collected at 35–37 weeks' gestation and to women who develop premature onset of labor or rupture of membranes at less than 37 weeks' gestation. In the second strategy, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is provided to women who develop one or more risk conditions at the time of labor or membrane rupture. Issues addressed by these prevention guidelines include the following: the appropriate clinical and laboratory methods required for prenatal screening programs designed to identify GBS carriers; risk conditions that indicate the need for intrapartum antibiotics; management of newborns whose mothers receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for GBS disease; and education of prenatal patients regarding GBS disease and the available prevention policy.

Because the majority of neonatal GBS infections are acquired in utero, antimicrobial agents administered to neonates, although useful for treatment, are unlikely to prevent the majority of GBS disease. Intrapartum chemoprophylaxis is the most likely method of preventing both early-onset disease and maternal illness resulting from GBS; several antimicrobial regimens have been used for intrapartum chemoprophylaxis. A combination of the features of a screening-based strategy and a strategy focused on prematurity offers a comprehensive approach to perinatal GBS prevention.

This combination strategy relies on detection of GBS by rectovaginal cultures collected at 35–37 weeks' gestation; because some preterm deliveries will occur before culture results are available, the strategy also provides for intrapartum chemoprophylaxis for women who begin labor and/or membrane rupture before 37 completed weeks' gestation. In another approach, administering antimicrobial agents to women with either labor or membrane rupture at less than 37 weeks' gestation who are intrapartum carriers of GBS or whose GBS status is unknown was estimated to require prophylaxis for 8. 9% of parturients. Strategies that treat all GBS carriers or all women with obstetric risk factors are estimated to require administering antimicrobial agents in a substantially higher proportion of deliveries.

CDC 2010 GBS guideline methods — technical working group composition and process describe how recommendations were developed. "In November 2008, CDC formed a technical working group* to revise the 2002 guidelines (15)". The group "consisted of representatives from the ACOG Committee on Obstetric Practice, the American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM), the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases and Committee on the Fetus and Newborn, the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), and CDC's Active Bacterial Core surveillance system, as well as experts in GBS epidemiology, clinical microbiology, and pharmacology". They "held regular telephone conference calls to identify potential areas of change" and identified topics for in‑depth review, with "a thorough review… of the published literature through PubMed searches, other sources… and unpublished data", and when "several sources of data were available, evidence was summarized in tables". "In June 2009, an in-person meeting" developed updated recommendations using "an evidence-based approach when possible and relying on expert scientific opinion when sufficient data were lacking", and "These updated guidelines replace CDC's 2002 guidelines. They are intended for providers of prenatal, obstetric, and neonatal care".

Early-onset group B streptococcal (GBS) disease — infants with signs of sepsis is characterized by preserved clinical presentation despite intrapartum antibiotic exposure and rapid onset; several studies have found no significant difference in presentation between exposed and unexposed infants, and approximately 90% of cases manifest within the first 24 hours of life. In universal screening settings, > 60% of early-onset GBS cases have occurred among infants of women with a negative prenatal GBS culture screen, and culture at 35–37 weeks' gestation can miss intrapartum colonization. For symptomatic infants, detection is increased by performing culture of both blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), noting that blood cultures can be sterile in as many as 15%–33% of newborns with meningitis.

Group B streptococcal (GBS) prevention — universal screening strategy specifies that women with GBS isolated from the urine at any time during the current pregnancy or who had a previous infant with invasive GBS disease should receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis and do not need third trimester screening for GBS colonization (AII). Women with symptomatic or asymptomatic GBS urinary tract infection detected during pregnancy should be treated according to current standards of care for urinary tract infection during pregnancy and should receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent early-onset GBS disease (AIII). All other pregnant women should be screened at 35–37 weeks' gestation for vaginal and rectal GBS colonization (AII). At the time of labor or rupture of membranes, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis should be given to all pregnant women who tested positive for GBS colonization (AII), except in the instance of cesarean delivery performed before onset of labor on a woman with intact amniotic membranes. For circumstances in which screening results are not available at the time of labor and delivery, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis should be given to women who are < 37 weeks' gestation, have a duration of membrane rupture ≥ 18 hours, or have a temperature ≥ 100.4°F (≥ 38.0°C) (AII).

### CDC updates guidelines for the prevention of perinatal… [^5a57d1ab]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Screening Based on the updated CDC guidelines, women who have previously given birth to an infant with invasive GBS disease should receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. Universal culture-based screening is recommended for all other pregnant women to identify candidates for intrapartum prophylaxis. Women with unknown GBS colonization status at the time of delivery should be treated based on the presence of intrapartum risk factors. Candidates for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis can be identified using the indications and nonindications provided in. However, patients who at any time during their current pregnancy have had a GBS-related urinary tract infection or GBS bacteria isolated from the urine should receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis and do not need third-trimester screening for GBS colonization. The use of antimicrobial agents should be avoided before the intrapartum period unless GBS urinary tract infection occurs during the pregnancy.

Pregnant women who test positive for GBS colonization should be given intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of labor or rupture of membranes, with the exception of patients undergoing cesarean delivery before onset of labor with intact amniotic membranes. GBS status should not affect the use of perioperative antibiotics for preventing infectious complications of cesarean delivery. Intrapartum Antibiotic Prophylaxis Figure 1 provides an algorithm for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent early-onset GBS disease. The recommended antibiotic for intrapartum GBS prophylaxis is penicillin, although ampicillin is an acceptable alternative. The dosing regimen for penicillin G should be 5 million units intravenously, followed by 2. 5 to
3. 0 million units intravenously every four hours.

GBS prophylaxis should be given at hospital admission in patients with threatened preterm delivery if their colonization status is unknown or if they had a positive screen within the preceding five weeks. Women who have not had vaginal-rectal GBS screening within the preceding five weeks should be screened for colonization at hospital admission. If admission screening results are negative for GBS or if, at any point, it is determined that a patient admitted with preterm labor is not in true labor, antibiotics given for GBS prophylaxis should be discontinued immediately. The administration of antibiotics for other indications should not be affected by negative GBS culture results.

Indications include previous infant with invasive GBS disease, GBS bacteriuria during any trimester of the current pregnancy, positive GBS vaginal-rectal screening culture in late gestation during current pregnancy, and unknown GBS status at the onset of labor with any of: delivery at < 37 weeks' gestation, amniotic membrane rupture ≥ 18 hours, intrapartum temperature ≥ 100.4°F (≥ 38.0°C), or intrapartum NAAT positive for GBS. Prophylaxis is not indicated for colonization with GBS during a previous pregnancy or GBS bacteriuria during previous pregnancy unless an indication is present for the current pregnancy, for a negative vaginal and rectal GBS screening culture in late gestation during the current pregnancy regardless of intrapartum risk factors, or for cesarean delivery performed before onset of labor on a woman with intact amniotic membranes regardless of GBS colonization status or gestational age.

### Management of infants at risk for group B streptococcal disease [^b14ab37c]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) — ACOG screening and indications specify that ACOG recommends universal antenatal testing of pregnant women for group B streptococcus (GBS) colonization using vaginal–rectal cultures obtained at 36 0/7 to 37 6/7 weeks' gestation, with testing also recommended for those in preterm labor and/or with PROM before 37 0/7 weeks' gestation. IAP at presentation for delivery is indicated for women with antenatal vaginal–rectal culture GBS colonization, GBS bacteriuria at any point during pregnancy, a history of a previous infant with GBS disease, and for women who present in preterm labor and/or with PROM at < 37 0/7 weeks' gestation. For women in labor at ≥ 37 0/7 weeks' gestation with unknown GBS status, IAP should be given if intrapartum risk factors develop — maternal intrapartum temperature ≥ 100.4°F [38°C] or duration of ROM ≥ 18 hours — or if a point-of-care NAAT is positive for group B streptococcus. If a woman with unknown status has a negative point-of-care NAAT but develops intrapartum risk factors, IAP should be administered because the sensitivity of the NAAT may be decreased without an enrichment incubation step. Women with GBS colonization in one pregnancy have an estimated 50% risk of colonization in a subsequent pregnancy, and if a woman with unknown GBS status presents in labor and is known to have had prior GBS colonization, IAP may be considered.

Intrapartum group B streptococcus (GBS) prophylaxis — alternatives for penicillin-allergic mothers and timing are described as follows: The efficacy of alternatives to penicillin or ampicillin used for prevention among infants of penicillin-allergic mothers has not been measured in controlled trials, and an estimated 10% of persons with penicillin allergy have immediate hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins. Available data suggest that erythromycin and clindamycin provided to pregnant women do not reach fetal tissues reliably, and colonization data suggest durations of ≥ 2 hours before delivery might confer some protection.

### Group B streptococcal disease prevention practices of obstetrician-gynecologists [^1495431d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe group B streptococcal (GBS) disease prevention practices of obstetrician-gynecologists.

Methods

We surveyed 1019 ACOG Fellows-the 419 members of the Collaborative Ambulatory Research Network (CARN) and 600 randomly selected non-CARN Fellows.

Results

There were 601 eligible respondents. More than 95% in both the CARN and the non-CARN groups reported adopting one of three GBS prevention strategies. The most commonly reported strategy was a combination approach not described in the consensus guidelines. The second most common strategy was the screening-based strategy; the risk-based strategy was third. Most respondents provided GBS information to all prenatal patients, but those using a risk-based strategy and those in solo practice were less likely to do so. Less than 60% in each group used penicillin as their first choice for GBS prophylaxis. More than 20% in each group who routinely screened for GBS did not collect both vaginal and rectal cultures. Respondents rated ACOG publications as the most important influence on their GBS prevention approach.

Conclusion

Almost all ACOG Fellows have adopted a GBS prevention strategy. The importance of providing GBS prevention information to all patients, use of penicillin, and collection of both vaginal and rectal cultures should be reinforced.

### Group B. streptococcus in pregnancy [^6ea444c4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

To decrease risk of early-onset neonatal sepsis from group B streptococcus (GBS), pregnant patients should undergo screening between 36 0/7 and 37 6/7 weeks' gestation. Patients with a positive vaginal-rectal culture, GBS bacteriuria, or history of newborn with GBS disease should receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) with an agent targeting GBS. If GBS status is unknown at time of labor, IAP should be administered in cases of preterm birth, rupture of membranes for > 18 hours, or intrapartum fever. The antibiotic of choice is intravenous penicillin; alternatives should be considered in cases of penicillin allergy depending on allergy severity.

### The risk factors for group B. streptococcus colonization during pregnancy and influences of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis on maternal and neonatal outcomes [^979467a2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

It was reported by a meta-analysis that estimates of maternal GBS colonization in the world vary by regions, with rates ranging from 11 to 35%. Annually, GBS infection causes high morbidity and mortality worldwide. The incidence rate of systemic invasive GBS diseases in pregnant women is 0.38 per 1000 pregnancies with case fatality rate of 0.2%. The invasive GBS disease rate in newborns is 0.49 per 1000 live births. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends pregnant women at 35–37 weeks of gestation should be screened for GBS carriage through culture-based strategy or risk-based approach. And culture-positive women or women with any risk factors for EOD should receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP). According to the recommendation provided by CDC, GBS-colonized parturient women were offered IAP at the time of labor onset or rupture of membranes until their delivery, and penicillin, ampicillin and cefazolin were currently the agents of choice for IAP.

In China, universal prenatal screening for GBS carriage has not been carried out. Given the regional variations in GBS infection, it is necessary to develop a proper strategy to test GBS colonization status in women at late pregnancy. Since there are no available GBS vaccines, it is essential to evaluate the efficacy of IAP in preventing GBS-related adverse outcomes at different regions. We previously reported the combination of GBS chromogenic media with GBS carrot agar and β-γ detection agar enhanced the detection rate of GBS in vaginal and rectal swabs significantly, which was also used in this research to test GBS status among pregnant women. Wenjing Ji et al. found the incidence of invasive neonatal GBS diseases was 0.31 cases/1,000 live births and the case-fatality rate was 2.3% in China, suggesting enhanced surveillance and preventive strategies should be carried out in China. Moreover, Yao Zhu's group showed that IAP was effective in reducing GBS-EOD and recommended universal screening of maternal GBS and subsequent IAP intervention in China. In this study, we aim to determine the prevalence of GBS among pregnant women in southern China, to find out the high risk-group of invasive GBS diseases and to calculate the efficacy of IAP treatment, which may aid in the development of intervention programs.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 485: prevention of early-onset group B streptococcal disease in newborns [^c41ac320]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

In 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revised its guidelines for the prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease. Although universal screening at 35–37 weeks of gestation and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis continue to be the basis of the prevention strategy, these new guidelines contain important changes for clinical practice. The Committee on Obstetric Practice endorses the new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations, and recognizes that even complete implementation of this complex strategy will not eliminate all cases of early-onset group B streptococcal disease.

### ACOG committee opinion: number 279, December 2002. prevention of early-onset group B streptococcal disease in newborns [^dfdfed80]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

During the past two decades, group B streptococci (GBS), or Streptococcus agalactiae, has emerged as an important cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Intrapartum administration of antibiotics to the woman (during labor or after rupture of membranes, but before delivery) has been demonstrated to reduce early-onset neonatal GBS disease. In 1996, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that obstetric providers adopt either a culture-based or a risk-based approach for the prevention of early-onset GBS. A recent multistate retrospective cohort study of live births in 1998 and 1999 of residents from eight areas of the Active Bacterial Core Surveillance/Emerging Infections Program network suggests that the culture-based approach is superior to the risk-based approach. The Committee on Obstetric Practice supports the new CDC recommendations that obstetric providers adopt a culture-based strategy for the prevention of early-onset GBS disease in the newborn. It is important to acknowledge that complete implementation of this complex strategy will not eliminate all cases of early-onset GBS.

### Avoiding inadequate intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for group B streptococci [^dab6bb36]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the frequency and reasons for inadequate group B streptococci (GBS) prophylaxis at our institution and to estimate what proportion of cases can be avoided with perfect protocol adherence.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of neonates born to GBS-colonized women who received inadequate prophylaxis between April 30, 2013, and May 1, 2014. The maternal chart was analyzed to categorize each case as avoidable (adequate time on labor and delivery to receive antibiotics 4 hours before birth and β-lactam antibiotic-eligible) or unavoidable and to determine whether a violation of the 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protocol (delayed or incorrect antibiotics) occurred.

Results

A total of 197 of 488 (40.4%, 95% confidence interval 36.1–44.8%) newborns of group B-colonized women received inadequate prophylaxis. Of these, 157 cases (79.7%, 73.4–84.8%) were unavoidable and would have occurred even with perfect protocol adherence. The 40 (20.3%, 15.3–26.5%) avoidable cases due to protocol violations resulted from delayed antibiotic administration (first dose of antibiotics more than 1 hour after admission [median 9.33 hours, range 3.83–25 hours] in 25 patients; no antibiotics in four patients; total 29 patients, 72.5%) or incorrect antibiotic selection (11 patients, 27.5%).

Conclusions

Forty percent of patients received inadequate prophylaxis, and four of five cases are unavoidable with our current labor management and the 2010 CDC guidelines. Timeliness and selection of antibiotics remain areas for improvement, but the overall effects on sepsis prevention will be modest.

### Challenges in reducing group B. streptococcus disease in African settings [^06b11a73]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in high-income settings and is associated with high rates of neonatal mortality and morbidity. There is now increasing evidence to suggest that there is a high GBS disease burden in resource-limited countries, and it is therefore critically important to identify suitable and practical preventive strategies. In Europe and North America, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) has led to a dramatic reduction of early-onset GBS disease. However, the methods for identifying pregnant women who should receive IAP and how to reduce late-onset GBS disease are not without controversy and are challenging for most sub-Saharan African countries. GBS vaccines are approaching phase III trials but are still under development. This review aims to explore the current evidence related to strategies for reducing invasive GBS disease in an African setting, the development of a GBS vaccine and whether preventative measures against GBS disease can be practically implemented.

### Perinatal infections due to group B streptococci [^232a5b4b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Group B streptococci (GBS) emerged dramatically in the 1970s as the leading cause of neonatal infection and as an important cause of maternal uterine infection. We review the epidemiology, diagnosis, and therapy of GBS perinatal infection. In 1996, the first national consensus guidelines were released. Since then, there has been a 70% reduction in early-onset neonatal GBS infection, but no decrease in late-onset neonatal GBS disease. In 2002, new national guidelines were released recommending 1) solely a screen-based prevention strategy, 2) a new algorithm for patients with penicillin allergy, and 3) more specific practices in certain clinical scenarios. Yet many clinical issues remain, including implementation of new diagnostic techniques, management of preterm rupture of membranes, use of alternative antibiotic approaches, improvement of compliance, prevention of low birth weight infants, emergence of resistant organisms, and vaccine development.

Prenatal culture-based screening timing and rationale state that studies suggest cultures predict colonization when collected within 5 weeks of birth and that predictive ability decreases significantly (P < .01) when the culture-to-birth interval is longer than 5 weeks; the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now recommends performing universal GBS screening between 36 0/7 and 37 6/7 weeks of gestation because the use of antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended as a default for women with unknown GBS screening test results who give birth before 37 0/7 weeks of gestation and because this timing provides a 5-week window for valid culture results that include births that occur up to the gestational age of at least 41 0/7 weeks; in the United States, 1.9% of women give birth between 35 0/7 and 35 6/7 weeks of gestation versus 6.7% who give birth at 41 0/7 weeks of gestation or more; in clinical situations in which a pregnant woman at term does not give birth within this 5-week screening accuracy window, and whose original GBS screening culture was negative, repeat GBS screening is reasonable and may help guide management beyond 41 0/7 weeks of gestation.

Preterm PROM — group B streptococcus (GBS) screening and intrapartum prophylaxis — Revised guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend women with preterm PROM to be screened for GBS on admission. If the patient completes the full 7-day course of latency antibiotics and remains without evidence of infection or labor, intrapartum GBS prophylaxis should then be managed by the results of the baseline GBS test at the time of preterm PROM. If the patient remains pregnant 5 or more weeks after a negative baseline GBS test, then GBS screening should be repeated; a positive baseline test does not have to be repeated and the patient should receive GBS prophylaxis.

Maternal group B streptococcus (GBS) colonization and obstetric risk factors — In the absence of any intervention, an estimated 1%–2% of infants born to colonized mothers develop early-onset GBS infections, and approximately 10%–30% of pregnant women are colonized with GBS in the vagina or rectum. In a predictor report, women with gestation < 37 weeks, membrane rupture of > 12 hours, or intrapartum temperature > 99.5°F (> 37.5°C) had 6.5 times the risk for having an infant with early-onset GBS disease compared with women who had none of these risk factors. Among women with negative prenatal screening cultures who had one of these risk factors the incidence was 0.9 cases per 1,000 births compared with women colonized prenatally but with none of the risk factors where the incidence was 5.1 cases per 1,000 births.

### Prevention of group B streptococcal early-onset disease in newborns: ACOG committee opinion, number 797 [^acccb109]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Group B streptococcus (GBS) prophylaxis — antibiotic selection and penicillin allergy management: Intravenous penicillin remains the agent of choice for intrapartum prophylaxis, with intravenous ampicillin as an acceptable alternative, and first-generation cephalosporins (cefazolin) are recommended for penicillin allergy with low risk of anaphylaxis or uncertain severity; for women with a high risk of anaphylaxis, clindamycin is the recommended alternative only if the GBS isolate is known to be susceptible, penicillin allergy testing is safe during pregnancy and can be beneficial for all women reporting allergy and expansion of its use is encouraged, and laboratory requisitions should indicate clearly the presence of penicillin allergy; for high-risk penicillin allergy with clindamycin-nonsusceptible isolates, intravenous vancomycin remains the only validated option and the dosage should be weight- and renal-based (20 mg/kg intravenously every 8 hours, with a maximum of 2 g per single dose.)

### Academic detailing and adherence to guidelines for group B streptococci prenatal screening: a randomized controlled trial [^2fbeb037]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) recommend universal prenatal screening for Group B Streptococcus (GBS) to identify candidates for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent early onset neonatal GBS infection. Interventions to promote physician adherence to these guidelines are imperative. This study examined the effectiveness of academic detailing (AD) of obstetricians, compared with CPG mailshot and no intervention, on the screening of pregnant women for GBS.

Methods

A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted in the medical cooperative of Porto Alegre, Brazil. All obstetricians who assisted in a delivery covered by private health insurance managed by the cooperative in the 3 months preceding the study (n = 241) were invited to participate. The obstetricians were randomized to three groups: direct mail (DM, n = 76), AD (n = 76) and control (C, n = 89, no intervention). Those in the DM group were sent guidelines on GBS. The AD group received the guidelines and an educational visit detailing the guidelines, which was conducted by a trained physician. Data on obstetrician age, gender, time since graduation, whether patients received GBS screening during pregnancy, and obstetricians who requested screening were collected for all participant obstetricians for 3 months before and after the intervention, using database from the private health insurance information system.

Results

Three months post-intervention, the data showed that the proportion of pregnant women screened for GBS was higher in the AD group (25.4%) than in the DM (15.9%) and C (17.7%) groups (P = 0.023). Similar results emerged when the three groups were taken as a cluster (pregnant women and their obstetricians), but the difference was not statistically significant (Poisson regression, P = 0.108). Additionally, when vaginal deliveries were analyzed separately, the proportion screened was higher in the AD group (75%) than in the DM group (41.9%) and the C group (30.4%) (chi-square, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

The results suggest that AD increased the prevalence of GBS screening in pregnant women in this population.

### Diminishing racial disparities in early-onset neonatal group B streptococcal disease – United States, 2000–2003 [^e5d01aa1]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2004). Low credibility.

Increased use of intrapartum antibiotics to prevent perinatal group B streptococcal (GBS) disease during the 1990s led to substantial declines in the incidence of GBS disease in newborns. Despite this success, at the end of the 1990s, early-onset GBS disease (in infants aged < 7 days) continued to be a leading infectious cause of neonatal mortality in the United States, and black infants remained at higher risk than white infants. In 2002, CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) revised guidelines for prevention of early-onset GBS disease to recommend late prenatal screening of all pregnant women and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) for GBS carriers. These guidelines were expected to result in further declines in early-onset disease. This report updates early-onset incidence trends since 1999 analyzed by using population-based, multistate data from the Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs)/Emerging Infections Program Network. The results of the analysis indicated that 1) after a plateau in early-onset disease incidence during 1999–2002, rates declined 34% in 2003 and 2) although racial disparities in incidence persist, rates for blacks now approach the 2010 national health objective of 0.5 cases per 1,000 live births. Continued implementation of screening and prophylaxis guidelines by clinicians and public health practitioners should lead to further declines in racial disparities.

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease – revised guidelines from CDC, 2010 [^60b81f69]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Neonatal management after intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis — well-appearing infants of any gestational age whose mother received adequate intrapartum GBS prophylaxis (≥ 4 hours of penicillin, ampicillin, or cefazolin before delivery) should be observed for ≥ 48 hours, and no routine diagnostic testing is recommended (BIII), and such infants can be discharged home as early as 24 hours after delivery if other discharge criteria and home observation supports are met (CIII). For well-appearing infants born to mothers who had an indication for GBS prophylaxis but received no or inadequate prophylaxis, if the infant is ≥ 37 weeks and 0 days' gestational age and the duration of membrane rupture before delivery was < 18 hours, then observe for ≥ 48 hours with no routine diagnostic testing (BIII), but if either < 37 weeks and 0 days' gestational age or the duration of membrane rupture before delivery was ≥ 18 hours, then perform a limited evaluation and observation for ≥ 48 hours (BIII). The definition of adequate intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is clarified as 4 hours of IV penicillin, ampicillin, or cefazolin before delivery (AII), and all other agents or durations are considered inadequate for purposes of neonatal management; well-appearing infants with a gestational age of 35–36 weeks whose mothers received adequate intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis do not routinely require diagnostic evaluations (CIII).

### Management of infants at risk for group B streptococcal disease [^9b5c106f]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Categorical risk assessment for group B streptococcal (GBS) early-onset disease (EOD) — In this approach, maternal intrapartum temperature ≥ 38.0°C is used as a surrogate for intraamniotic infection, and penicillin G, ampicillin, or cefazolin ≥ 4 hours before delivery is considered adequate GBS intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP), whereas other antibiotics or treatment durations < 4 hours are considered inadequate. Risk among newborns recommended for empirical treatment is highly variable by gestational age, duration of rupture of membranes, and timing/content of intrapartum antibiotics, and categorical management will result in empirical treatment of many relatively low-risk newborn infants.

### Prevention of group B streptococcal early-onset disease in newborns: ACOG committee opinion, number 797 [^8e8ebf74]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Conclusion and future directions — Universal prenatal, culture-based screening for maternal GBS colonization plus intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis together currently constitutes the most effective strategy for reducing perinatal morbidity and mortality secondary to GBS, and this regimen has been associated with a significant decrease in the incidence of GBS EOD without adverse effects in women or newborns. Intrapartum GBS screening using NAAT has high sensitivity and specificity, but many tests need several hours of enrichment, limiting rapid result utility; if NAAT is used as a primary antepartum method, susceptibility testing against antibiotics other than penicillin needs to be incorporated into the testing schema.

Planned cesarean birth — GBS prophylaxis: Intrapartum prophylaxis that is specific for GBS is not recommended for women undergoing a planned cesarean birth in the absence of labor and rupture of membranes, regardless of the gestational age, even among women who are GBS positive. Multistate surveillance reveals that GBS EOD occurs at a very low rate in this situation, but this does not change the recommendation that women undergoing cesarean birth (regardless of colonization status) be administered one dose of prophylactic antibiotics before the incision to reduce the risk of postoperative infection. Women planning cesarean birth should nonetheless undergo prenatal GBS culture at 36 0/7–37 6/7 weeks of gestation.

### Early-onset and late-onset neonatal group B streptococcal disease – United States, 1996–2004 [^21587495]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2005). Low credibility.

In 2002, CDC, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued revised guidelines for prevention of perinatal invasive group B streptococcal (GBS) disease. These guidelines recommend universal screening of pregnant women for rectovaginal GBS colonization at 35–37 weeks' gestation and administering intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis to carriers. To assess the impact of the guidelines on multistate trends in neonatal GBS disease incidence, CDC analyzed data from the Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs) system from 1996–2004. This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which determined that incidence of GBS disease in infants aged 0–6 days (i.e., early-onset disease) in 2004 had decreased by 31% from 2000–2001, the period immediately before universal screening was implemented. Incidence of GBS disease in infants aged 7–89 days (i.e., late-onset disease) remained unchanged during the 9-year period reviewed. Continued monitoring is needed to assess the impact of the 2002 guidelines on early-onset disease and the long-term effect of widespread intrapartum use of antimicrobial agents on neonatal GBS disease.

### Safety and immunogenicity of a second dose of an investigational maternal trivalent group B. streptococcus vaccine in nonpregnant women 4–6 years after a first dose: results from a phase 2 trial [^293448f2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of sepsis and meningitis in newborns and young infants, with an incidence of 0.49/1000 live births. Each year, more than 300 000 infants younger than 3 months are estimated to develop invasive GBS disease worldwide, resulting in 90 000 infant deaths. Furthermore, an estimated 1%–4% of stillbirths are associated with GBS, and there is evidence of a possible link with preterm births. GBS can be transmitted vertically from the mother's rectovaginal tract to the fetus during pregnancy or parturition, making maternal colonization a major risk factor for infant GBS disease. An estimated 11%–35% of pregnant women are colonized with GBS (totaling 21.7 million women).

Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) in GBS-colonized pregnant women has substantially reduced the incidence of early-onset disease (onset during the first 7 days of life). However, IAP has not reduced the rate of late-onset disease (onset between 7 and 90 days), does not prevent GBS-associated preterm or stillbirths, and its implementation is logistically challenging in low- and middle-income countries. An effective prophylactic vaccine administered during pregnancy could complement IAP. For several GBS serotypes, an inverse relation has been shown between antibody levels against the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) in pregnant women and the risk of invasive GBS disease in their infants. This led to the use of serotype-specific GBS CPS for vaccine development. An investigational trivalent vaccine that contains CPS from GBS serotypes Ia, Ib, and III, which together cause > 85% of infant invasive GBS disease, conjugated to the CRM 197 carrier protein (nontoxic mutant of diphtheria toxin) was well tolerated and immunogenic in nonpregnant and pregnant women. Studies have also shown that anti-CPS antibodies induced by maternal immunization with this vaccine were transferred transplacentally to infants and persisted through a minimum of 3 months of age.

The World Health Organization has articulated a preference for a single-dose maternal regimen, while acknowledging that a 2-dose regimen may need to be considered and that additional doses in subsequent pregnancies should be investigated. The current study (an extension of a previous trivalent GBS vaccine trial in nonpregnant women) was conducted to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a second dose of the trivalent GBS vaccine administered 4–6 years after the initial dose.

Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis agents — The efficacy of both penicillin and ampicillin as intravenously administered intrapartum agents for prevention of early-onset neonatal GBS disease was demonstrated in clinical trials, and beta-lactam antibiotics for GBS prophylaxis administered for ≥ 4 hours before delivery have been found to be highly effective at preventing vertical transmission of GBS and early-onset GBS disease. One clinical trial found that penicillin and ampicillin administered intravenously intrapartum were associated equally with the presence of ampicillin-resistant gram-negative organisms on postpartum vaginal-perineal culture.

Threatened preterm delivery (PTD) key components — Women admitted with signs and symptoms of preterm labor (before 37 weeks and 0 days' gestation) should be managed according to the algorithm; women with rupture of membranes at < 37 weeks and 0 days' gestation should be managed by a separate algorithm. At admission, women with signs and symptoms of labor or with rupture of membranes at < 37 weeks and 0 days' gestation should be screened for GBS colonization unless a vaginal-rectal GBS screen was performed within the preceding 5 weeks (AII). Women with signs and symptoms of preterm labor who have unknown GBS colonization status at admission or a positive GBS screen within the preceding 5 weeks should receive GBS prophylaxis at hospital admission (AII).

### Intrapartum antibiotic chemoprophylaxis policies for the prevention of group B streptococcal disease worldwide: systematic review [^29e76645]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Intrapartum antibiotic chemoprophylaxis (IAP) prevents most early-onset group B streptococcal (GBS) disease. However, there is no description of how IAP is used around the world. This article is the sixth in a series estimating the burden of GBS disease. Here we aimed to review GBS screening policies and IAP implementation worldwide.

Methods

We identified data through (1) systematic literature reviews (PubMed/Medline, Embase, Literature in the Health Sciences in Latin America and the Caribbean [LILACS], World Health Organization library database [WHOLIS], and Scopus) and unpublished data from professional societies and (2) an online survey and searches of policies from medical societies and professionals. We included data on whether an IAP policy was in use, and if so whether it was based on microbiological or clinical risk factors and how these were applied, as well as the estimated coverage (percentage of women receiving IAP where indicated).

Results

We received policy information from 95 of 195 (49%) countries. Of these, 60 of 95 (63%) had an IAP policy; 35 of 60 (58%) used microbiological screening, 25 of 60 (42%) used clinical risk factors. Two of 15 (13%) low-income, 4 of 16 (25%) lower-middle-income, 14 of 20 (70%) upper-middle-income, and 40 of 44 (91%) high-income countries had any IAP policy. The remaining 35 of 95 (37%) had no national policy (25/33 from low-income and lower-middle-income countries). Coverage varied considerably; for microbiological screening, median coverage was 80% (range, 20%-95%); for clinical risk factor-based screening, coverage was 29% (range, 10%-50%). Although there were differences in the microbiological screening methods employed, the individual clinical risk factors used were similar.

Conclusions

There is considerable heterogeneity in IAP screening policies and coverage worldwide. Alternative global strategies, such as maternal vaccination, are needed to enhance the scope of global prevention of GBS disease.

Guidelines recommend intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) for parturient women who have a screen positive for group B Streptococcus (GBS). Clindamycin should be used for IAP only if the maternal GBS isolate is susceptible. We report a case of clindamycin-resistant GBS disease in a newborn infant whose mother received clindamycin IAP, and we review clindamycin susceptibility testing.

### A time to save [^755c698e]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS), characterized by Lancefield in 1933, was not recognized as a human pathogen until the early 1970s when it emerged and replaced Escherichia coli as the most common cause of sepsis and meningitis among neonates and young infants. This article briefly gives a personnel account of the discovery of clinical syndromes of GBS distinguished by age at onset, vertical mode of transmission for early-onset disease, meningeal tropism for GBS capsular (CPS) type III strains, and protective CPS epitopes. It also reviews the difficult evolution of the now routine program for antenatal GBS culture screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, development of the first GBS candidate vaccines, clinical trials documenting the immunogenicity and safety of CPS tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccines, ongoing need to prevent morbidity and mortality in neonates and young infants, and critical need for commercial vaccines for routine use in pregnant women.

ABCs Effect on Other Prevention-Related Policies and Practices

ABCs and a precursor surveillance system for GBS were used to define the need for guidelines for providing antimicrobial drugs to pregnant women during delivery to prevent early-onset GBS in their newborns; such guidelines were published in 1992 and 1996. Without evidence as to which strategy was better, the 1996 guidelines recommended that health care providers could use either a screening or risk-based approach to decide which women should receive prophylaxis during delivery. An ABCs-based cohort study that sampled from a population of ≈600,000 live-born infants at 8 sites demonstrated the value of screening over the risk-based approach. Specifically, universal prenatal screening of pregnant women for vaginal/rectal colonization with GBS and providing antimicrobial drugs during delivery to those who were colonized was ≈50% more effective at preventing early onset GBS than providing prophylaxis to pregnant women on the basis of certain risk factors. This finding led to issuance of new guidelines in 2002 and revised guidelines in 2010, which resulted in further reductions in disease. Since the early 1990s, ABCs has documented a > 80% decline in the incidence of early-onset GBS infection and prevention of an estimated 70,000 cases of early-onset GBS infection (Figure 3).

Guidelines for the prevention of invasive GAS infections were also informed by ABCs surveillance and special studies. An ABCs study found an increased risk for severe GAS infection among household contacts of index patients. These data, coupled with data that were collected from routine surveillance on the frequency of GAS infection in postpartum women and postsurgical patients provided the foundation for the development of CDC policy guidance in households and health care settings. ABCs surveillance data on the risk for GAS infections among long-term care facility patients also helped inform prevention and control strategies for those settings.
