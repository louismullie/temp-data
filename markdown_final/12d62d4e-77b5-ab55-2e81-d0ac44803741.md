## Question

A right circular cone has for its base a circle having the same radius as a given sphere.
The volume of the cone is one-half that of the sphere. The ratio of the altitude of the cone to the radius of its base is:
(A) [1/1]   (B) [1/2]   (C) [2/3]   (D) [2/1]   (E) √[5/4]

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the ratio of the altitude of a right circular cone to the radius of its base, given that the cone's base radius equals the radius of a sphere and that the cone's volume is one-half the sphere's volume. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the volume formulas for a cone and a sphere. Then, I should set up the equation that enforces the half-volume condition. Next, I will solve for the ratio of altitude to base radius. Finally, I will verify the arithmetic and match the result to the provided options.

> Let me first confirm the formulas. The volume of a right circular cone is one-third pi times the square of the base radius times the height, so V_cone = (1/3)πr²h, where r is the base radius and h is the altitude. The volume of a sphere is four-thirds pi times the cube of the radius, so V_sphere = (4/3)πr³, and in this problem the sphere's radius is the same as the cone's base radius, which I will also call r for simplicity [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the condition before I proceed. The problem states the cone's volume is one-half the sphere's volume, so I should write (1/3)πr²h = (1/2) × (4/3)πr³. I need to ensure I keep the one-half multiplier on the sphere side to avoid a mistake here, and yes, that's correct as stated [^notfound].

> Next, I should simplify the equation to solve for h/r. I can divide both sides by π and multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate constants, which gives r²h = 2r³. Then dividing both sides by r² yields h = 2r, so the ratio h/r equals 2. Hold on, I should double-check that the algebra is clean: (1/3)πr²h = (2/3)πr³ simplifies to h = 2r, confirming the ratio is 2:1 [^notfound].

> I will now examine the answer choices to match the result. The options are 1/1, 1/2, 2/3, 2/1, and √(5/4). My derived ratio is 2/1, which corresponds to option D. Let me reconsider whether any of the other options could be misinterpretations; none of them equal 2, so D is the unique match [^notfound].

> Final answer: D. 2/1.

The ratio of the altitude of the cone to the radius of its base is **2:1**. Here's why: let the radius be (r) and the altitude be (h). The sphere's volume is ([4/3]πr³), and the cone's volume is ([1/3]πr²h). Given the cone's volume is half the sphere's, we have ([1/3]πr²h = [1/2] × [4/3]πr³). Simplifying yields (h = 2r), so the ratio is **2:1**.

---

## Step-by-step solution

Let (r) be the radius of the sphere and the base of the cone, and let (h) be the altitude of the cone.

- **Volume of the sphere**: (V_sphere = [4/3]πr³).
- **Volume of the cone**: (V_cone = [1/3]πr²h).

Given that the cone's volume is half the sphere's volume:

[1/3]πr²h = [1/2] × [4/3]πr³

Simplify the equation:

[1/3]πr²h = [2/3]πr³

Divide both sides by ([1/3]πr²):

h = 2r

Therefore, the ratio of the altitude of the cone to the radius of its base is **2:1**.

The correct answer is **(D) ([2/1])**.

Mammography

Breast volume by mammography was measured based on two formulas (see below). The first equation considers the breast as a half-elliptic shape and accounts for the compression force of the breast (Fig. 2 a). The height (h) and width (w) of the base of the breast were measured in a medio-lateral-oblique view of the mammography. The compression during the mammography was encountered in the formula as 'c', which is expressed as the compression in millimetres. The second measurement considers the breast to best resemble a circular cone (Fig. 2 b). The height of the breast was expressed as 'h', and the width of the base of the breast was expressed as ' r '. In literature, available different mammography views (i.e. cranio-caudal, medio-lateral-oblique or a combination of the two) are used for this second formula.

### Low cost satellite constellations for nearly continuous global coverage [^c30b0f38]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The minimum elevation angle is defined as the minimum allowable angle between the horizon and any viewable spacecraft at a ground point. The intent of this angle is to account for terrain obstructions, such as buildings and mountains. If the Earth were a perfect sphere, without any features, then a minimum elevation angle ofwould be sufficient (ignoring atmospheric effects). However, these assumptions do not hold, and thus it is common in constellation analysis to use a positive minimum elevation angle to account for most types of terrain. In practice, it is common to require minimum elevation angles of 5–10°. This is sufficient for most ground points, but is not applicable in all cases: consider an observer in a city with tall skyscrapers nearby, or an observer at the base of Mount Everest. The observed minimum elevation angle provides another measure of the quality of coverage for the constellations.

Figure 1 c, d shows the minimum elevation angle observed across the 3,000 day simulation of the 24- and 48-h constellations. For the 48-h constellation, most of the Earth has a satellite at an elevation angle > at all times; only the outage regions experience lower elevation angles. A vehicle at higher altitude has geometric access to a larger portion of the globe than the equivalent vehicle at lower altitude. One can see this demonstrated in the context of a commercial airline flight: at take-off one can see far less of the surrounding area than when at cruise altitude. This geometric effect extends to elevation angle as well: a satellite at higher altitude has, at any acceptable elevation angle, a larger field of view than a satellite at lower altitude. Thus, the lower altitude 24-h constellation (Fig. 1 c) has the larger areas that experience elevation angles <.

### Structural dynamics of DNA strand break sensing by PARP-1 at a single-molecule level [^28e2592f]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

We select conformations whose simulated efficiencies are within an error of ΔE = 0.05 compared to the experimental result. This accounts for both the error in the isotropic Förster Radius (ΔR iso = 2 Å translates to ΔE = 0.04 in the simulations, see also section "Determination of the isotropic Förster radius") and the error of the measurement derived from the uncertainties in the correction factors (ΔE = 0.03, see section "Burst selection and quantification of burst-wise parameters").

Every linear dsDNA molecule has a unique axis. We are interested in the angle between the axes of the 5′- and 3′-stems. As a convention, the direction of their axes is defined from the nick to the respective loop. We define the axis of each DNA stem as the longest axis determined from a principal component analysis, considering all atoms belonging to the respective stem, but omitting the four bases of the tetraloop and the base pair next to the loop. All structures are aligned with respect to the 3′-stem, such that we can represent every selected conformation as a unit vector/orientation (representing the 5′-stem) in a spherical coordinate system. This allows us to compute the angle between the axes of the two stems for every conformation. We obtain histograms of these angles where we re-weight the relative frequency in the equally spaced bins according to the differing surface of the ring on the unit sphere. For the computation of mean angles and standard deviations, we considered two axially symmetric scenarios: the orientations lie in a spherical cone or in an open spherical sector (the symmetric difference of two cones with the same mean axis). In the view along the mean axis, they represent a circle and an annulus, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 21). In the case of a spherical cone, we have a single mean axis which is computed by the normalized sum over all axes. The standard deviation is retrieved from the corrected histogram. If the orientations lie within an open spherical sector, we do not have one unique mean orientation, but it is axially degenerate, i.e. it is on a lateral surface of a cone. However, the mean polar angle between the stems is still uniquely defined, if we assume that the open spherical sector is directed along the 3'-axis. Thus, both the mean angle and the standard deviation are computed by the corrected histogram.

### Capillary trapping of various nanomaterials on additively manufactured scaffolds for 3D micro-/ nanofabrication [^ae94e311]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Estimation of the trapped solution volumes by a microscaffolds

Given that the shape of the solution trapped by a microscaffolds closely resembles a frustum of a cone, the volume of the trapped solution can be estimated to Eq. (1):where r and R represent the radii of the smaller and larger bases of the frustum, respectively, and h is its height. In this context, considering the dimensions of the microscaffolds (a cube measuring 282 µm × 282 µm × 282 µm), h is 282 µm. The radius r is approximately half the length of the diagonal of the upper square base, which is around 200 µm. The constant π is approximated as 3.14. The value of R changes with the increasing IPA/H 2 O ratio. It can be determined by measuring the area of the circular lower base using Fiji software, as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 7.

Estimation of the thickness of the assembled Au NP layer

The cross-section SEM image of a Au NP-assembled beam was first acquired after the FIB treatment. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 15, a clear interfacial contract between the assembled Au NP layer and the inner polymer scaffold was observed due to the huge difference in the conductivity of Au and polymer beam. The thickness of the assembled Au NP layer is determined by averaging thickness data extracted from different positions of the beam using the software of Fiji.

Estimation of the density of the fabricated structures

To obtain the density of nanomaterial-assembled microstructures, a cube-shaped microscaffolds assembled with Au NPs after 600 immersion/retraction cycles is taken as an example. The thickness of the assembled Au NP layer is ≈0.32 μm. The density of IPS polymer is 1.19 g cm −3, and the density of Au is 19.32 g cm −3. The volumes of a pure IPS cube-shaped microscaffold, an Au NP-assembled microscaffolds, and the assembled Au NP layer can be calculated from the cube model and measurement, and the density of the assembled cube can thus be estimated as:

Magnetic manipulation of the microrobots

A permanent NdFeB cube magnet, measuring 12 mm × 12 mm, is affixed to a rotating motor to facilitate the actuation of magnetic fullerene-like microrobots. The magnetic field strength generated by this setup is ≈35 mT.

### Elliptical ejecta of asteroid dimorphos is due to its surface curvature [^fb5f11f7]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

DART-driven impact ejecta cone geometry

While the elliptical cone geometry likely results from many factors, Dimorphos's high curvature in its north-south direction is the major contributor. At the time of impact, DART's solar panels faced the Dimorphos north-south direction at azimuthal angles of ϕ = − 2°, 178°, and the spacecraft geometry likely created an elliptical crater excavation, causing complex ejecta cone geometry. Also, these solar panels hit two approximately-six-meter-sized boulders at the impact site, Bodhran (ϕ of about 0°) and Atabaque (ϕ of about 145°). Recent work suggests that the ejection angle would become shallow in the direction where a boulder exists. However, given that the ejecta cone encloses almost half of Dimorphos's body at T + 175 s, the crater likely grows large enough that the contribution of the spacecraft's geometry to the ejecta evolution is no longer significant. Earlier experimental work suggested the crater growth recovers the ejection steepness when the excavation extent exceeds the boulder size. Because the excavation range is tens of meters (Fig. 3 c) at this time, the influence on the ejecta cone geometry of both the spacecraft's solar panels (each < 10 m) and the pre-existing meter-sized boulders is minimal. Given the elliptical cone, the ejecta plume does not directly cross Didymos, in contrast to the earlier suggestion that the ejecta might directly hit the asteroid based on the circular ejecta cone assumption.

### BIDCell: biologically-informed self-supervised learning for segmentation of subcellular spatial transcriptomics data [^fd824c9d]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

- Sphericity = where R I represents the radius of the inscribing circle, and R C represents the radius of the circumscribing circle.

Sphericity measures the rate at which an object approaches the shape of a sphere while accounting for the largest local irregularity of the cell by comparing the ratio of the radius largest circle that fits inside the cell (inscribing circle) to the radius of the smallest circle that contains the whole cell (circumscribing circle). The value is 1 for a sphere and decreases as the cell becomes less spherical.

- Compactness = where A represents the area, and P cell represents the cell perimeter.

Compactness measures the ratio of the area of an object to the area of a circle with the same perimeter. Compactness uses the perimeter of the cell thus it considers local irregularities in the cell perimeter. A circle will have a value of 1, and the less smooth or more irregular the perimeter of a cell, the smaller the value will be. For most cells the numerical values for compactness and circularity are expected to be similar. Identifying which cells have large differences between these metrics can identify cells with highly irregular perimeters which may be of interest for downstream analysis and quality control for segmentation.

- Convexity = where P convex represents the convex perimeter and P cell represents the cell perimeter.

Convexity measures the ratio of the convex perimeter of a cell to its perimeter. The value will be 1 for a circle and decrease the more irregular the perimeter of a cell becomes, similar to compactness.

- Eccentricity = where L minor represents the length of the minor axis and L major represents the length of the major axis.

Eccentricity (or ellipticity) measures the ratio of the major axis to the minor axis of a cell. The major axis is the longest possible line that can be drawn between the inner boundary of a cell without intersecting its boundary. The minor axis is the longest possible line can be drawn within the inner boundary of a cell while while also being perpendicular to the major axis. This gives a value of 1 for a circle and decreases the more flat the cell becomes.

### Can randall's plug composed of calcium oxalate form via the free particle mechanism? [^111d4b67]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Kidney

Robertson model of the kidney is used in the following calculations. This model describes the ascending Henle loop as a circular truncated cone with average length L HL of 1.2 × 10 −2 m and internal radius r LH increasing from 1.12 × 10 −5 to 1.20 × 10 −5 m, the following distal tubule as a cone with a length L D of 6 × 10 −3 m and internal radius r DL decreasing from 1.2 × 10 −5 to 1 × 10 −5 m, and the collecting duct (CD) as a cone with a length L CD of 2.7 × 10 −2 m and internal radius r CD increasing from 1 × 10 −5 to 4 × 10 −5 m at its opening at the papilla. The number of CDs per kidney is 320 and the number of the nephrons per kidney is 1.31 × 10 6. Thus 4094 nephrons are attached to each CD in this model.

Urine

Liquid passing the ascending Henle loop and distal tubule is approximately ten times more diluted than the final urine leaving the collecting duct; that is the volume of liquid passing though the Henle loop and distal tubule is ten times the volume of urine produced. A volume of 1.5 × 10 −3 m 3 is considered to be an average diuresis per day of adults. The volume of urine produced between the morning and evening is two to four times that at night. The minimum night production of urine is thus 0.30 × 10 −3 m 3 per 8 h by two kidneys and this value was used in calculations.

The density and dynamic viscosity of the liquid (i.e. ten-fold diluted urine) in the nephron used for calculations were taken as values for water at 37 °C, i.e. the density ρ = 994 kg m −3 and the dynamic viscosity μ = 6.91 × 10 −4 kg m −1 s −1. The density of urine in the CD is 1015 kg m −3 at 37 °C and the kinematic viscosity at 37 °C is ν = 0.829 × 10 −6 m 2 s −1. The dynamic viscosity of urine is μ = ν x ρ = 8.41 × 10 −4 kg m −1 s −1.

### Mammalian skull dimensions and the golden ratio (φ) [^a30714c9]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

In a wide variety and increasing number of biological systems, Φ has emerged as an underpinning of optimized structure or function. The reason for this remains unclear, but this ratio somehow relates to structural or functional efficiency. The Golden Ratio has been studied most thoroughly in phyllotaxy, the arrangement of leaves along a branch or branches along a trunk in plants. In soft plants and trees, the spiral arrangement of branches or leaves maximizes the exposure of each leaf to sunlight and water. These spiral arrangements — which can also be identified in the scales of pinecones, the seeds of sunflowers, the hexagonal scales on pineapples, and the arrangements of petals on roses — follow mathematical principles based on the ratios of terms in the Fibonacci series and on angles determined by Φ. For instance, Bravais and Bravais in 1837and Church in 1904described that new leaves emerge from a stem in a spiral pattern in which the angles of the lines emerging from the stem along the axes of the leaves form an angle of 137.5 degrees, representing the "Golden Angle". When the 360 degrees of either a circle or a complete spiral are divided by Φ, the resulting angles are 222.5 and 137.5 degrees. The angle of 137.5° is known as the Golden Angle. Several other spiral structures in nature, such as the shell of the marine mollusk nautilus, the horns of rams, the tusks of elephants, and the shape of spiral galaxies (such as the Milky Way), exhibit the structure of a "logarithmic" or "equiangular" spiral. The logarithmic spiral has the unique property that it does not alter its shape as it grows and that the distance between its coils grows proportionally as the spiral expands. It is also called the equiangular spiral because any line drawn from the center or pole of the spiral to any point of the spiral generates the same angle. The logarithmic spiral is a Φ-derived structure that can be constructed using "nested" Golden Rectangles or Golden Triangles.

### Volumetric segmentation in the context of posterior fossa-related pathologies: a systematic review [^1676929f]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

CSF volume was also measured and defined as the space between the posterior fossa and hindbrain outlines. Volumes were measured by a radiologist via manual segmentation using 3D-Slicer software. Patients with hemifacial spasms were found to have greater crowdedness indices and lower CSF volumes. Lower crowdedness index was significantly associated with superior short-term outcomes, defined as the absence of twitching within 7 days of microvascular decompression. Long-term outcomes, determined by a follow-up period of at least 2 years, were not significantly associated with differences in the crowdedness index. In a separate study, Cheng et al. also examined posterior fossa crowdedness in the context of trigeminal neuralgia.

A radiologist manually segmented both the posterior fossa and the brain tissue within the fossa area, which included the fourth ventricle, to serve as the PFV and hindbrain volume respectively. The ratio of hindbrain volume to PFV served as the posterior fossa crowdedness index, which was found to be greater in patients with trigeminal neuralgia. Furthermore, both women and younger individuals were more likely to possess more crowded fossae. Test–retest reliability, calculated by having the same radiologist repeat the measurements one week later, was found to be high with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.83. Another study utilized manual segmentation to find the PFVs of patients with supratentorial tumors using the Fiji open-source software's region of interest manager to delineate boundaries. Linear measurement-based formulas were used to approximate the PFV. Researchers calculated the volume of the region by assuming the posterior fossa was an inverted cone truncated at the foramen magnum. The radius of the cone's base was half the distance from the dorsum sellae to the inion. The height of the truncated cone was the distance between the line segment of the seller to the inion and the line segment of the basion to the opisthion. Thales' theorem was used to calculate the height of the cone segment lying below the foramen magnum to ultimately determine the volume of the truncated cone. Researchers also assumed that the posterior fossa was an ellipsoid. Volume was equal to half of the product of the basion-tentorium apex distance, apex-inion distance, and transverse diameter. The transverse diameter was the sum of the total transverse slice thickness and interslice distance. Manual segmentation was far more accurate than either of these methods. The ellipsoid approximation possessed a higher agreement index than the inverted cone method and was deemed to be more concordant with the results of manual segmentation.

### How to steer active colloids up a vertical wall [^cb0d8bf0]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Detention time at a wall without gravity

Before interpreting our results, we have to understand how active particles accumulate at a wall in the absence of gravity and the influence of wall-particle interactions on this accumulation. To do this, we generalize arguments that have been laid out in the case of stericand hydrodynamic interactions. To simplify the argumentation, we neglect the translational diffusion, i.e. Pe s ≫ 1. In the absence of attractive interactions, an active particle is able to escape the wall as soon as the normal component of its propulsion force points away from the wall. Since its orientation evolves through rotational diffusion, a particle polarized towards the wall will have a long detention time, whereas a particle polarized tangentially to the wall will have a shorter detention time. Therefore, wall-aligning interactions actually reduce detention time because they bring the particles closer to the escape angle. By contrast, attractive interactions push the escape angle away from the wall and thus increase detention time. A combination of strong attractive and strong wall-aligning interactions traps the orientation parallel to the wall while pushing the escape angle away, and thus increases detention time. However, the respective magnitudes of wall-attraction and wall-alignment might affect detention time in a more nuanced way. Let us now explore how a force parallel to the wall affects these behaviours and how it explains our observation of an activity-induced adsorption layer. To do this, we use our ABP model to explore systematically the influence of the above-mentioned contributions, namely self-propulsion, direct wall adhesion, wall alignment, and the combination of these.

Adsorption layer height: passive adhesive versus active adhesive

From the density field, we obtain the density profiles ϕ wall (z) close to the wall (within the adsorption layer) and ϕ bulk (z) in the bulk, far away from the wall (see Methods). It is clear from Fig. 1 F that at a given altitude, the adsorption layer has an excess density as compared to the bulk and that the altitude corresponding to a certain density is much higher in the adsorption layer than far from the wall. The height difference between the adsorption layer and the bulk gets even larger as the density decreases. We now define the adsorption layer height Δ H as the difference in altitudes corresponding to a given density of ϕ = 0.08 in the adsorption layer and the bulk. Δ H is a global observable of the activity-induced phenomenon.

### The effect of realistic geometries on the susceptibility-weighted MR signal in white matter [^2d161ad5]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

METHODS

Microstructure Model

We modeled several geometries, including idealized cylinders with circular cross‐sections, elliptic cylinders with elliptical cross‐sections, and hyperrealistic geometries based on EM.

For a proof‐of‐principle examination of the role of shape, we performed field perturbations corresponding to a single axon with elliptical cross section and increasing eccentricities, 0, 0.66, 0.80, and 0.87, corresponding to minor‐to‐major axis ratios of 1, 4/3, 5/3, and 2, respectively. Changes to eccentricity were made without change to myelin or intra‐/extra‐axonal areas to conserve g‐ratio, which was set to 0.7 27. In circular axons, the g‐ratio is the ratio of the inner radius to the outer radius, while for noncircular axonswith intra‐axonal and total axonal areasand A t. The effect of rotation on the ellipse with respect to H is also examined (Fig. 3 e, f). Simulations were performed on a 500 × 500 array, spanning 3 × 3 μm 2, with H defined orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of the fiber.

Packed axons were generated on a 4454 × 4454 array, spanning 37 × 37 μm 2 by random close packing of circles (n = 1434). Circle/axon sizes followed a Gamma distribution (α = 5.7) about a mean radius of 0.46 μm to match EM data (n = 602 axons). The packing algorithm was developed in‐house and is described in the Supporting Information. Results of the packing are shown in Supporting Figure S1. The packed axons were also warped to create a second geometry of packed ellipses using an algorithm package, twirl1.m 28 (parameters: a = 1.5; b = 0.8; c = 2.0; d = 1/400). This warping transformation conserves the g‐ratio and fiber density (Fig. 4a, b).

### Geographic disparities in liver supply / demand ratio within fixed-distance and fixed-population circles [^c9362b62]. American Journal of Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Recent OPTN proposals to address geographic disparity in liver allocation have involved circular boundaries: the policy selected 12/17 allocated to 150-mile circles in addition to DSAs/regions, and the policy selected 12/18 allocated to 150-mile circles eliminating DSA/region boundaries. However, methods to reduce geographic disparity remain controversial, within the OPTN and the transplant community. To inform ongoing discussions, we studied center-level supply/demand ratios using SRTR data (07/2013–06/2017) for 27 334 transplanted deceased donor livers and 44 652 incident waitlist candidates. Supply was the number of donors from an allocation unit (DSA or circle), allocated proportionally (by waitlist size) to the centers drawing on these donors. We measured geographic disparity as variance in log-transformed supply/demand ratio, comparing allocation based on DSAs, fixed-distance circles (150- or 400-mile radius), and fixed-population (12- or 50-million) circles. The recently proposed 150-mile radius circles (variance = 0.11, P = 0.9) or 12-million-population circles (variance = 0.08, P = 0.1) did not reduce the geographic disparity compared to DSA-based allocation (variance = 0.11). However, geographic disparity decreased substantially to 0.02 in both larger fixed-distance (400-mile, P < .001) and larger fixed-population (50-million, P < .001) circles (P = 0.9 comparing fixed distance and fixed population). For allocation circles to reduce geographic disparities, they must be larger than a 150-mile radius; additionally, fixed-population circles are not superior to fixed-distance circles.

### Anatomical dimensions of the lumbar dural sac predict the sensory block level of continuous epidural analgesia during labor [^dc2995d0]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Measurement of the anatomical dimensions of the dural sac by ultrasound. A LF = ligamentum flavum, DDM = dorsal dura mater, VDM = ventral dura mater, ES = epidural space, DS = dural sac. B DSD = dural sac diameter, DSL = dural sac length

In the past, the lumbar dural sac was assumed to be cylindrical. In view of the fact that some scholars have found that the diameter of the dural sac is different in different intervertebral spaces, the formula for a circular truncated cone was applied to calculate the volume and surface area of the lumbar dural sac in our study. The volume of each dural sac was calculated according to the formula for the volume of a circular truncated cone: V = πh (R 2 + r 2 + Rr)/ 3. The surface area of each dural sac was calculated according to the formula for the surface area of a circular truncated cone: S = πRl + πrl, where the radius is half of the DSD, h is the DSL, and l is calculated from r and h by.

### Investigating the effects of simulated high altitude on colour discrimination [^9b3c5631]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

The FM-100 Hue test is a common test method for many high-altitude or laboratory studies, as it allows researchers to obtain the TES and a colour vision axis plot, which helps determine which colour discrimination ability is compromised. Besides this, there are less sensitive detection methods, such as Ishihara plates, which is not suitable for our study. Karakucuk et al used the FM-100 Hue test to investigate 16 high school students and found that error scores significantly increased at moderate altitudes(1060 m and 3000 m), with blue-yellow discrimination loss being more pronounced under high-altitude hypoxic conditions. Some studies have shown that colour discrimination ability decreases with increasing altitude, primarily manifesting as a loss along the tritan axis, which is more obvious at lower light levels and higher altitudes, particularly seen above 4000 m. A studyexplored variation in colour vision in 14 climbers with an average age of 52.4 ± 12.2 years during their ascent. It was found that colour vision varied with altitude, with the deutan axis (green) and protan axis (red) showing the least changes, while the tritan axis (blue) had moderate changes. At lower altitudes, the tritan axis changes were minor, but significant abnormalities appeared at 5400 m, which persisted even when the altitude decreased to 300 m, indicating that these changes were reversible but can last for some time. Similar results were confirmed in another study. In our experiment, statistical analysis of error scores for R-G and B-Y parts revealed that the B-Y error scores were significantly higher than the R-G error scores at high altitudes. These error scores varied with altitude, peaking at condition 7 (4500 m for 30 min) and remaining above baseline levels on return to ground level. This is consistent with previous findings. We hypothesise that the asymmetrical changes in B-Y thresholds under low-pressure hypoxia are due to the selective vulnerability of S-cone cells, which primarily receive short-wave signals (B-Y). Compared with L and M cones, S cones have lower abundance, higher metabolic demands, and are more susceptible to hypoxia, making them more prone to tritan axis losses. Understanding this is crucial for improving pilots' visual performance at high altitudes. For pilots flying at or above 3048 m, neglecting the effects of hypoxia and low pressure on colour discrimination could impair colour information processing, potentially leading to delays in task execution and increased error rates. In this study, we found that blue-yellow colour discrimination is particularly affected by high-altitude conditions. Therefore, we suggest prioritising red and green hues for high-altitude flight control interfaces to enhance visual information and improve pilot safety.

### Overcoming resolution attenuation during tilted cryo-EM data collection [^2376572a]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

A principal readout for directional resolution anisotropy is the 3D Fourier shell correlation (FSC) volume, a variation of the conventional 1D FSC curve. Restricting the conventional FSC to a cone provides a consistency measure along a defined viewing direction, and repeating this calculation for different directions generates a complete measure of directional resolution across Fourier space. Combining 1D conical FSC curves obtained from different angular directions yields a real 3D array termed the 3D FSC, which affords a quantitative assessment of the directional dependence of resolution for the reconstructed object. In addition to affecting directional resolution, non-uniform angular coverage also affects global resolution. In the presence of non-uniform angular coverage, there is a net increase in noise variance and a corresponding attenuation of the 1D FSC curve that is used to define global resolution. This attenuation can be estimated by a geometrical factor called the Sampling Compensation Factor (SCF), which derives its name from the effect of the geometry of the sampling (relative to a uniform projection distribution) on the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR), and by extension the FSC. As shown previously, the effect of the projection distribution completely decouples from other experimental issues of the collection. The SCF is defined to be the harmonic mean of the sampling, over a shell of Fourier space, divided by the usual mean, and therefore ranges from 0 to 1. It provides a quantitative metric for evaluating an orientation distribution. Using the standard model of image formation for cryo-EM (which is used in the literature for many things such as the FSC = 1/7 resolution criterion), we derived that the SCF governs how much the SSNR is decremented relative to a uniform distribution. The SCF for the uniform distribution evaluates to the maximum value, 1, whereas an orientation distribution defined by perfect side-like views, which is completely (albeit still inhomogeneously) sampled, has an SCF that evaluates to 0.81. Because the side-like case, characterized by an SCF of around 0.81, represents the minimal case wherein Fourier space is completely sampled, we use this value as the baseline for a good map throughout the work. When there are large inhomogeneities in the sampling, the SCF rapidly decrements towards zero. Cases characterized by top-like distributions, which typically arise from preferentially oriented protein samples that are prevalent among experimental cryo-EM datasets, are frequently attenuated by a factor of as much as ten, in comparison to the uniform distribution (i.e. their SCFs are approaching 0.1, and even lower). In practice, reconstructions from samples characterized by such orientation distributions are not only attenuated in global resolution, but also characterized by severe anisotropy. Collectively, non-uniform sampling will affect directional resolution anisotropy, as measured by the 3D FSC, and will also attenuate global resolution, as measured by the SCF.

### Descent trajectory reconstruction and landing site positioning of chang' E-4 on the lunar farside [^ee06b86c]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Results

Descent trajectory from LCAM images

The sequence images obtained by the LCAM in vertical attitude after the attitude adjusting phase of CE-4 were used for the reconstruction of the landing trajectory in this study.

According to the reconstructed trajectory, CE-4 adopted a vertical descent approach to gradually approach the landing zone after the attitude adjusting phase with an altitude of 5635 m and a velocity of ~85 m/s. During the period of descending to an altitude of 4130 m above the lunar surface, the trajectory moved 77 m to the north and crossed a crater with a diameter of approximately 200 m. CE-4 reached over area A, as indicated in Fig. 1, with a velocity of ~78 m/s. Over area A, CE-4 decreased from 4130 m from the lunar surface to 1495 m, the velocity decreased to ~51 m/s, and the trajectory was adjusted from the northeast; there are some craters with diameters of ~70–100 m to the northwest, where is more flat (Fig. 1d, e). Then, the trajectory moved 244 m to the northwest from the altitude of 1495 m to 99 m and the velocity decreased to 0 m/s. CE-4 reached over area B in Fig. 1 and entered the hover and hazard-avoidance phase.

### An improved method for susceptibility and radius quantification of cylindrical objects from MRI [^d4132567]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

A new method is developed to measure the magnetic susceptibilities and radii of small cylinder-like objects at arbitrary orientations accurately. This method for most biological substances only requires a standard gradient echo sequence with one or two echo times, depending on the orientation of an object relative to the main magnetic field. For objects oriented at the magic angle, however, this method is not applicable. As a byproduct of this method, the cross-sectional area as well as signals inside and outside the object can be determined. The uncertainty of each measurement is estimated from the error propagation method. Partial volume, dephasing, and phase aliasing effects are naturally included in the equations of this method. A number of simulations, phantom, and pilot in-vivo human studies are carried out to validate the theory. When the maximal phase value at the boundary of a given cylindrical object is larger than 3 radians, and the phase inside the object is more than 1 radian, the susceptibility can be accurately quantified within 15%. The radius of the object can be determined to subpixel accuracy. This is the case when the signal-to-noise ratio inside the object is about 6:1 or higher and the radius of the object is about one pixel or larger. These conditions are realistic when considering medullary and pial veins for example.

### Larmor frequency shift from magnetized cylinders with arbitrary orientation distribution [^02791c69]. NMR in Biomedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

A, The frequency obtained by averaging withinincluding the whole magnetic microstructure. B, The volume outsidehas been coarse grained. C, The magnetic microstructure has been nulled within, and the frequency is calculated at the point. The frequency is induced by an external field. The mesoscopic region is tested as a cube, sphere and cylinder.

3.1.3 Simulation (b). The voxel‐averaged Larmor frequency in a sample with varying microstructure

The purpose of the next simulation was to validate Equation (21) describing the MRI‐measured Larmor frequency when the sample consists of a slowly varying magnetic microstructure, and quantify the error we obtain when (b1) we filter the measured Larmor frequency (as described in Equation 8), (b2) neglect the sampling PSF (as explained in Appendix A.2) and finally (b3) partition the magnetic microstructure in order to compute the macroscopic contribution (cf. Equation 57 in Appendix A.2) to the measured Larmor frequency.

Figure 5 illustrates the sample used to test the error from these three points. We constructed a sample consisting of 27 cubes, denoted, stacked(blue square in Figure 5A). Each cube had side length(see Figure 5) and contained a configuration of cylinders with a randomly chosen axially symmetric orientation dispersion and volume fraction(i.e. different for each cube). Susceptibility variations were introduced by randomly choosing a normalized microscopic susceptibilityfor each cube (in reality, but as we only consider field ratios the absolute magnitude is irrelevant). The sample was further partitioned into smaller cubeswith center points denotedand with side length, i.e. one‐third of the larger cubes(indicated by the orange square in Figure 5A). This construction ensured a sample with a more slowly varying microstructure across, as seen at, since the abrupt edges between the cubesare far away. Thus, every large cubewith a distinct magnetic microstructure contained 27 smaller cubes, and so the entire sample was partitioned into 729 cubesstacked.

### Achromatic vector vortex beams from a glass cone [^d2576495]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

The reflection of light is governed by the laws first described by Augustin-Jean Fresnel: on internal reflection, light acquires a phase shift, which depends on its polarization direction with respect to the plane of incidence. For a conical reflector, the cylindrical symmetry is echoed in an angular variation of this phase shift, allowing us to create light modes with phase and polarization singularities. Here we observe the phase and polarization profiles of light that is back reflected from a solid glass cone and, in the case of circular input light, discover that not only does the beam contain orbital angular momentum but can trivially be converted to a radially polarized beam. Importantly, the Fresnel coefficients are reasonably stable across the visible spectrum, which we demonstrate by measuring white light polarization profiles. This discovery provides a highly cost-effective technique for the generation of broadband orbital angular momentum and radially polarized beams.

### A study of 3D radial density adapted trajectories for sodium imaging [^d960d5a3]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Sodium imaging typically employs ultrashort echo time radial, density adapted and cones trajectories to capture the rapidly decaying short T2 signal. The present study considers the parameter choices involved in the use of these trajectories in terms of their impact on the resolution and signal to noise ratio. Many parameters have a strong effect on these image properties, particularly the number of spokes which impacts voxel size. The present article develops an understanding of the trade-offs involved and how to choose optimal (or at least reasonable) parameter values. This has a practical role in designing clinical protocols for imaging sodium.

### SimpleITK image-analysis notebooks: a collaborative environment for education and reproducible research [^d32a21d5]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Fiducial Localization

In our second notebook example, we partially reproduce the work described in, spherical fiducial localization in cone-beam CT. We implement the method used to establish a reference localization of the markers in the volumetric data. In addition to the edge-based localization used in the original work, we also present an intensity-based localization approach using the Otsu threshold selection method.

Both approaches start with the user interactively selecting a box-shaped region of interest which bounds the fiducial, using theGUI component. With the edge-based approach, we localize the edges in the ROI using the Canny edge detector and then estimate the optimal sphere which fits the edges using a least-squares formulation. The notebook snippet shown in Fig. 8 describes this formulation and its implementation using SimpleITK and the SciPy library. With the thresholding-based approach, once the fiducial is segmented we use SimpleITK'scomponent to obtain its location as the centroid of the segmented blob and its radius as the radius of the sphere which has the same volume as the segmented blob.

Figure 6 presents the distribution of gas and tissue volumes along the sternum-vertebral axis, which corresponds to an average superimposed pressure of 2.6 ± 0.5 cmH 2 O (see Figure 7 for the sternum-vertebral behavior of the superimposed pressure and the gas/tissue ratio).

### Altitude-related illness [^dc216ef0]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Altitude-related illness occurs as a result of inadequate acclimatization. The mainstay of prevention is a slow, graded ascent profile which gives the body time to respond to a low-oxygen environment. The diagnosis of these conditions is often difficult in resource-limited environments, so history and a physical exam are key in identifying patients who will require descent and evacuation. Treatment modalities such as supplemental oxygen, portable hyperbaric chambers, and medications, are all temporizing measures until the patient can be safely evacuated to a lower elevation.

Suggested approach to AMS/high‑altitude cerebral edema (HACE) prevention — risk‑based planning: because acclimatization and physiological responses vary, clinicians must recognize that recommendations, while generally effective, do not guarantee successful AMS/HACE prevention; the approach should consider the individual risk profile. As formal predictive models have limitations, we recommend a less formal approach that takes into account an individual's prior experiences at high altitude and ascent profile. The most conservative approach is to define risk based on the highest column with a check mark, and a history of AMS or a lack of prior problems does not necessarily predict future risk when ascent rates or target elevations differ.

Acute altitude travel above 3000 m — recommended ascent strategy: With travel above 3000 m, individuals should not increase the sleeping elevation by more than 500 m/d and should include a rest day every 3 to 4 d; when larger single-day gains are unavoidable, acclimatization days should be strongly considered before and/or after these gains so that the overall ascent rate averaged over the trip falls below the 500 m/d threshold.

### Binary-state scanning probe microscopy for parallel imaging [^10f266fa]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

In this sense, to minimize the irreversible deformation, we controlled the stress by modulating the elastomer stiffness and the volume of the metal film. Thus, we varied the base/curing agent ratios and Au film thickness of the tips. We compressed 14-μm-high metal-coated elastomer tips to half their height (7 μm) and measured the height of the recovered tips (Supplementary Fig. 8). The smaller base/curing agent ratio (stiffer) and thinner thickness of the Au film (less volume) led to more reversible deformation of the tip (Fig. 3e). Next, we directly related this reversible deformation with the imaging capability. We prepared two tips: tip-1 with a 5:1 PDMS ratio/50-nm Au (bottom left, Fig. 3e) and tip-2 with a 30:1 PDMS ratio/100-nm Au (top right, Fig. 3e). After one cycle of compression-relaxation, tip-1 (Fig. 3f) exhibited more elastic behaviour than tip-2 (Fig. 3g), which matches well with the FEM. For the line profiles, indeed, tip-2 exhibited artifacts near the feature edge, while tip-1 sharply imaged the feature (Fig. 3h). For 4-μm-diameter circles (Supplementary Fig. 9), the blunt tip (tip-2) hardly distinguished the circles because the size of the features (4 μm) was smaller than the tip diameter (~10 μm) (Fig. 3j); yet, the sharp tip (tip-1) clearly resolved the topography of the features (Fig. 3i). However, we note that excessive stiffness for the PDMS and thickness for the Au film could hamper the mechanical stability (Supplementary Fig. 10). We experimentally found that a tip with a 10:1 base/curing agent ratio and a 50-nm-thick gold film was optimal for measurement.

### The open-ocean missing backscattering is in the structural complexity of particles [^778198de]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The coated-sphere model reproduces in-situ b bp -to- c p ratios

The b bp -to- c p ratio approximates, when the light absorption by particles is negligible (see Methods), to the ratio between b bp and total scattering (i.e. backscattering ratio), which measures the efficiency with which light is backscattered by particles. The b bp -to- c p ratios for a coated sphere can be 40 times higher than for homogeneous spheres for particles with diameters between 1 and 12 µm, and 8 times for submicron particles (Fig. 7a). Estimated ratios using the coated-sphere model reproduced the ratios measured in situ. For the samples used to parameterise and validate the coated-sphere model, the modelled median value was 1.27 ± 0.09% (N = 125). This modelled value was consistent with those derived from our (1.27 ± 0.30%, N = 125; Fig. 7b) and other field optical measurements, though with a standard deviation significantly smaller than observed in situ. This agreement between model results and experimental observations further highlights that, at the very least, a coated-sphere model is needed to reproduce oceanic b bp.

Eleven variables were utilized to train the models, as outlined in Table 1, and were identical to those used for the CLMI.X. The variables were collected from the Galilei CLMI.X report and included the magnitudes of the CLMI and the zonal averages of the steepest region on both axial and tangential curvature maps for both anterior and posterior surfaces, the average value of the posterior elevation in the highest region above the best-fit sphere, the average value of the corneal thickness in the thinnest region, and the difference of corneal thickness between the thinnest region and the diametrically opposite region.

### Defined chromosome structure in the genome-reduced bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae [^20d8852c]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

3D reconstruction of TEM imaging and cell volume

Mycoplasma cells were scraped into fresh growth medium at 50-fold the concentration of the original culture. The cell suspension was put on a 3 × 3 mm piece of glass and left at 37 °C for 15 min. The cells on the glass were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS containing 75 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.3) and 68 mM NaCl for 3 min at RT, rinsed with 0.2 mL PBS once and then thoroughly washed in water. The fixed cells were frozen at a liquid nitrogen temperature using CryoPress (Valiant Instruments, St Louis, MO), deep-etched, rotary-shadowed by platinum at an angle of 30°, and backed with carbon in a jet freezing device vacuum (JFDV) freeze-etching machine (JEOL Ltd, Akishima, Japan). Replicas were floated from the glass by slowly immersing the surface into full-strength hydrofluoric acid, cleaned with commercial bleach, rinsed in water, and picked up onto Formvar-coated 400-mesh copper grids as described. Series of replica images were taken by tilting the sample stage over 30° to both sides in 5° intervals, using a transmission electron microscope (JEM1010, JEOL) at 80 kV.

TEM images tilted with angles −30, −25, −20, −15, −10, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 were registered by cross-correlation with Matlab and rotated to ensure a vertical rotation axis. The outline of the cell in each image was determined by thresholding using Fiji, followed by manual removal of background contamination and filling of gaps inside the bacteria. From these binarized images the sample area could be extracted by counting pixels within the cell area. The volume of the cell was then calculated by assuming each cell is rotationally symmetric along its long axis (Supplementary Movie 3). The cell was segmented into cylinders and cones along this axis, and the volume was computed as the sum of both the cylinder and cone volumes as follows:

where V cyl is the volume of a cylinder of height h and radius r, and V cone is the volume of a cone of height h and radius r.

To reduce the error caused by inaccuracies in manual image editing and/or a lack of rotational symmetry, the final volume was calculated as the average of the volumes determined for individual images.

### Distributed spirals: a new class of three-dimensional k-space trajectories [^5f354c75]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

This work presents a new class of three-dimensional spiral based-trajectories for sampling magnetic resonance data. The distributed spirals trajectory efficiently traverses a cylinder or sphere or intermediate shape in k-space. The trajectory is shown to be nearly as efficient as a conventional stack of spirals trajectory in terms of scan time and signal-to-noise ratio, while reducing coherent aliasing in all three spatial directions and reducing Gibbs ringing due to the nature of collecting data from a sphere in k-space. The trajectory uses a single two-dimensional spiral waveform with the addition of a single orthogonal waveform which is scaled with each repetition, making it relatively easy to implement. Blurring from off-resonance only occurs in two dimensions due to the temporal nature of the sampling.

### Methodological considerations in quantification of oncological FDG PET studies [^23224999]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2010). Low credibility.

In an ROI definition study of response assessment of lung cancer comparing ROI manual, ROI max, ROI circle:15 mm, ROI 75% and ROI 50% it is mentioned that ROIs 50% in lesions with low uptake are often discarded on post-chemotherapy scans because of inclusion of non-tumour tissue. Nevertheless, an excellent test-retest reproducibility of the volume of ROI 50% on 2 consecutive days is reported (ICC = 0.99). The fixed volume-based ROI (ROI circle:15 mm) shows best reproducibility with respect to SUV mean (ICC = 0.95), but the reproducibility of ROI 50% is also very high (ICC = 0.91).

Due to the partial volume effect (PVE), the isocontour level for proper whole-lesion delineation is lesion size dependent. Previously, in phantom measurements the exponential relation between lesion volume and threshold (percentage of maximum value) was determined for five different contrast levels and used on metastatic lung lesions yielding highly correlated ROI and CT volumes (correlation coefficient: 0.999). A more sophisticated approach was promoted later in which a 3-D sphere was convolved with a symmetric trivariate Gaussian point spread function. This equation for background-subtracted relative threshold level (RTL) as a function of tumour radius and image resolution is independent of the tumour to background ratio and is used iteratively on PET data until the measured PET volume and threshold match. In patients the technique seems feasible and similar dimensions are achieved as pathological examination of liver metastases.

In conclusion, a number of methods for definition of the region of interest are described in the literature. The maximum voxel value is preferable in data with limited noise, does not require specialized algorithms and does not suffer from interobserver variability. A threshold-based ROI can provide reproducible quantification of glucose metabolism with better accuracy in noisy images. The NEDPAS guidelines recommend the use of an ROI 41%(B+max), but to increase the (background-corrected) threshold when no meaningful tumour volume definitions are provided in lesions with a low signal to background ratio. They stress that the maximal voxel value should always be noted.

### Evaluation of linear growth at higher altitudes [^80364950]. JAMA Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Do children residing at higher altitudes have systematically different linear growth trajectories?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study including 964 299 children aged 0 to 59 months, those residing at higher altitudes were, on average, born at a shorter length and remained on a lower growth trajectory than children residing at lower altitudes. This altitude-mediated growth difference remained statistically and biologically significant after controlling for potential confounding factors or when the sample was restricted to children living in ideal home environments.

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that specific attention and health care guidance are needed for the management of pregnancies and early child development in high-altitude settings; altitude-specific adjustments to 2006 World Health Organization growth standards are not recommended.

### Spatial variation of resolution and noise in multi-detector row spiral CT [^2da34d4b]. Academic Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

The authors performed this study to evaluate an approach for measuring the variations of three-dimensional spatial resolution and image noise throughout a field of view imaged with multi-detector row spiral computed tomographic (CT) scanners.

Materials and Methods

The authors designed a phantom (diameter, 320 mm) that contained 37 metallic spheres (diameter, approximately 0.8 mm) positioned between two disks made of a material with attenuation being that of water. One sphere was located at the isocenter of the phantom, and the rest were evenly spaced in three concentric rings with diameters of 100, 200, and 300 mm, respectively. The phantom was imaged with two widely used multi-detector row CT scanners by using a standard protocol and four variations of that protocol. Because a recently developed theory holds that image resolution should be proportional to the square root of the trace of the covariance matrix of a point spread function, the authors developed a software package to segment high-attenuation spheres from the CT image volume and compute point spread functions from blurred images of the spheres. Three-dimensional spatial resolution and image noise were calculated as a function of radial distance within the field of view.

Results

Resolution and noise were quantified in the resultant CT image volumes and found to be nonisotropic, with worse resolution and less noise occurring at the periphery of the field of view.

Conclusion

The method enabled measurement of variations in spatial resolution and of their distribution on images obtained with multi-detector row CT scanners. These findings may contribute to the development of an improved algorithm for image reconstruction.

### Sparsity-based ankylography for recovering 3D molecular structures from single-shot 2D scattered light intensity [^166fcba3]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Methods

Mathematical formulation

Our mathematical problem amounts to construction of a 3D sparse signal from the Fourier magnitude on the Ewald's sphere.

Of course, when the majority of the information is lost, precise reconstruction is not possible, unless we have, or may assume, some additional information about the sought signal. In fact, the problem is even more difficult as the measurements contain noise. We assume that the scattered electro-magmatic field can be approximated adequately (hereafter, this relation is denoted by ≅) by means of known generating functions describing spheres U j (r) of radius R j. In other words, we want to reconstruct a 3D optical image assuming that it is comprised of a small known number of (different) spheres of known radii, as described in the Results section. Every kind of sphere U j (r) (identified by its radius R j) corresponds to a different atomic element (j, in this case), where the elements are known, and also how many atoms are there of each element. We emphasize that the reconstruction is done on a 3D grid, while the spheres themselves do not need to reside on any grid at all: they reflect the actual structure of the molecule which does not necessarily reside on a known grid.

### Heterogeneous circles for liver allocation [^594d8fe7]. Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

In February 2020, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network replaced donor service area-based allocation of livers with acuity circles, a system based on three homogeneous circles around each donor hospital. This system has been criticized for neglecting to consider varying population density and proximity to coast and national borders.

Approach and Results

Using Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data from July 2013 to June 2017, we designed heterogeneous circles to reduce both circle size and variation in liver supply/demand ratios across transplant centers. We weighted liver demand by Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)/Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease (PELD) because higher MELD/PELD candidates are more likely to be transplanted. Transplant centers in the West had the largest circles; transplant centers in the Midwest and South had the smallest circles. Supply/demand ratios ranged from 0.471 to 0.655 livers per MELD-weighted incident candidate. Our heterogeneous circles had lower variation in supply/demand ratios than homogeneous circles of any radius between 150 and 1,000 nautical miles (nm). Homogeneous circles of 500 nm, the largest circle used in the acuity circles allocation system, had a variance in supply/demand ratios 16 times higher than our heterogeneous circles (0.0156 vs. 0.0009) and a range of supply/demand ratios 2.3 times higher than our heterogeneous circles (0.421 vs. 0.184). Our heterogeneous circles had a median (interquartile range) radius of only 326 (275–470) nm but reduced disparities in supply/demand ratios significantly by accounting for population density, national borders, and geographic variation of supply and demand.

Conclusions

Large homogeneous circles create logistical burdens on transplant centers that do not need them, whereas small homogeneous circles increase geographic disparity. Using carefully designed heterogeneous circles can reduce geographic disparity in liver supply/demand ratios compared with homogeneous circles of radius ranging from 150 to 1,000 nm.

Individuals ascending faster than recommended rates may consider continuing preventive medication for 2 to 4 d after arrival at the target altitude, but there are no data to support this approach, and in the absence of AMS/HACE symptoms preventive medications should be stopped when descent is initiated.

Procedures for 3D reconstruction

As a result of electron channelling in the atomic columns, the exit wave function consists of sharp peaks superimposed on a constant background. For crystalline materials, basically, the exit wave function can be analysed column-by-column. The procedure of 3D reconstruction can be subdivided into several steps as follows: (1) determination of the true 'z' height (focus) of the exit surface of a column from an image plane with the maximum propagation intensity (MPI) criterion by wave propagation along 'defocus circles' as shown in Fig. 1; (2) refining the 'z' height using the Big-Bang scheme; (3) correcting the focus of each column wave by back propagation, that is, propagating the red dot to the blue dot (focus-corrected wave, FCW), which is located on the 'mass circle' as shown in Fig. 1; and (4) extracting the wave values in the 'valleys' between the atomic columns (background or valley wave).

(5) The phase of the exit wave of a column can suffer from a phase shift caused by the mean inner potential of the crystal and by atom vibrations, which results in a phase offset that causes an error in the determination of the column mass. This can be corrected using peak to valley ratios by dividing its complex peak value with the complex value of its neighbouring valley wave for every column. The phase of this normalized wave θ ' can then be used as input to determine the column mass.

(6) Fitting a mass circle to the normalized FCW (blue dots). The centre of the mass circle is displayed as a red cross in Fig. 1.

(7) Measuring the phase of the vacuum wave from the centre of the mass circle. Usually, the vacuum wave is very close to (1,0) as indicated as a green dot. The phase of the vacuum wave is used as a reference for zero mass.

(8) Measuring the phase of the normalized FCW (blue dot) from the centre of mass circle. The column mass is given by the phase angle θ ' between the normalized FCW and the vacuum wave. See Fig. 1.

(9) The column mass in units of the number of atoms can be deduced by dividing the θ ' by a standard phase change θ per one atom (column 2 and 3 in Table 1). The value of the phase change θ per atom (molecule) is sensitive to the electron dose rate and will be described in Methods.

Method for measuring the muscle cone inner volume (Fig. 3)

Method for determining the standard measurement position

We used the "tangential coronal position" as the standard measurement position. First, on the axial image of the orbit with the optic nerve displayed (Fig. 3 A), we adjusted the sagittal axis to overlap with the optic nerve long axis to obtain the reference sagittal position (Fig. 3 B). Second, on the reference sagittal image, we adjusted the coronal axis to be tangential to the position where the optic nerve exited the eyeball to obtain the "tangential coronal position" for measurement (Fig. 3 C).

Fig. 3
Method for measuring the muscle cone inner volume. On the a the line pointed to by the arrow is the sagittal axis. On the b the line pointed to by the arrow is the coronal axis. On the c the area of the ellipse pointed to by the arrow is the muscle cone bottom area (S), and the length of the line segment pointed to by the arrow is the muscle cone height (h)

Method for calculating the muscle cone inner volume

Because the muscle cone anatomy was similar to an elliptical cone, we used the standard elliptical vertebral body volume formula (V = Sh/3, V: vertebral body volume, S: cone base area, h: vertebral height) to calculate the muscle cone inner volume.

First, on the "tangential coronal position", using the elliptical area measurement tool, with the optic nerve as the measurement center, we manually outlined and adjusted the elliptical edge to be tangential to the inner edges of the four extraocular muscles. The resulting elliptical area was the muscle cone bottom area (S) (Fig. 3 C). Then, on the reference transection with the optic nerve displayed, we used the line measurement tool to measure the distance from the beginning of the intraorbital segment of the optic nerve to the beginning of the optic canal. The resulting distance was the muscle cone height (h) (Fig. 3 D). Three skilled radiologists (Li Feng, Huamin Tang and Wei Lin) independently completed the measurement of each data and obtained the mean. They were masked and double blind.

Co-ignimbrite plume radius as function of MFR. Cross denotes values estimated from the 3D simulations and the line the empirical relationship given bywithand. Note that the model simulates a dusty-gas mixture, whereas the pyroclastic flows from such super-eruptions can be formed of concentrated dispersions, which depend on imperfect coupling between gas and particles

Here, we focus on the dependence of maximum plume height with MFR (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 for the dynamics of umbrella cloud). The result shows that from 10 9 to 10 10 kg/s the maximum plume heights remain similar and are between 40 and 60 km. Co-ignimbrite plumes appear steadier than Plinian columns, which show a more oscillatory behaviour (see Supplementary Movies 1–5). The maximum column height and highest mass fraction in the umbrella region is reached for MFR around the critical value, i.e. 10 9.5 kg/s. Remarkably, the Neutral Buoyancy Level (NBL) remains at ~20 km for all the simulations with MFRs above the critical MFR (see Table 2).

Fig. 3
Characteristic plume heights as a function of the MFR. Red bars represent the height over the whole plume (H t). Blue squares represent the altitude of maximum level of radial spreading of the umbrella cloud (H MSL). Green bars represent the altitude of NBL (H NBL). The characteristic heights from the BPT model are shown as dashed and solid curves. In this diagram, the total heights are compared with the heights where the upward velocity becomes zero in the BPT calculations, whereas the MSLs and NBLs are compared with the NBL calculated by the BPT model (see also Table 2). Values on the curves are the effective entrainment coefficients that explain the 3D results. In the calculations of co-ignimbrite ash clouds (the MFR > 10 10 kg/s) using the BPT model, the initial temperature and mass fraction of the entrained air were estimated so that the initial density is equal to the atmospheric density near the ground (see Table 3). According to this mass fraction, the effective MFR at the ground can be estimated. The initial radii were calculated using the scaling law reported in Fig. 2

### Health and sustainability of glaciers in high mountain Asia [^09450147]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Ice flux and flux divergence

We calculate the ice flux vector q at each cell according to Eq. (2), where h is the ice thickness (m) andis the annual ice surface velocity vector (m a −1).represents the column-average ice velocity, with the constantrepresenting the relative importance of basal motion and vertical ice shear deformation (Supplementary Fig. 1). We modelfor each glacier individually. For this, we use a Monte Carlo analysis to estimate the depth-integrated velocity at a point assuming simple shear with an assumed ratio of ice motion attributable to basal slidingand a thickness estimate. For a given ice thickness and basal sliding ratio, we calculate the velocity at each depth following, then determine. We perform this calculation for 10,000 sets of randomly drawn values of ice thickness, flow rate factor n, and basal sliding for each glacier. For the ice thickness distributions we use the distribution of ice thickness values produced for that glacier by. For n we note thatis appropriate for many glacier modeling situationsand use a Gaussian distribution with (= 3, = 0.067). For the portion of flow attributable to sliding, this is dependent on both ice rheology and basal state. Neither basal sliding nor ice internal thermal profiles are well constrained for glaciers in HMA, but authors have variously assumed or determined temperate, cold, and polythermal glaciers across the region –, demonstrating variable thermal regimes and basal conditions across High Asia. We acknowledge that (1) many small, high-altitude glaciers are likely to be cold-bedded, but (2) there is increasing evidence that the lower-elevation tongues are polythermal with temperate beds. In addition, although there are many large proglacial lakes in the region which are known to affect terminus ice velocities, it is not likely that an extensive portion of glacier ice approaches flotation. Nonetheless, without widespread knowledge of the importance of basal sliding across HMA, we assume a uniform distribution across [0,1] for our basal sliding factors. In addition to providing an estimate of, this Monte Carlo approach allows us to estimate its uncertainty.

The flux divergencerepresents the vertical component of ice velocity at the glacier surface, which leads to submergence in areas of divergent flow and emergence in areas of convergent flow. We calculateon a pixel basis using a centered-difference scheme based on the divergence of(Eq. 3, Supplementary Fig. 1).

### High altitude retinopathy in an emergency physician working at everest base camp: a case report [^5625ec32]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

High altitude travel can lead to high altitude retinopathy (HAR), characterized by retinal vascular dilatation, edema, and hemorrhage, particularly in young, physically active individuals with poor acclimatization. Although it is usually asymptomatic unless it affects the macula of the eye, it sometimes may lead to permanent vision loss. This report discusses a 31-year-old Belgian male at Everest Base Camp who developed scotoma in his right eye at 5300m. Ophthalmoscopic evaluation revealed cotton wool spots in the eye and a macular bleed in the right eye, raising the suspicion of HAR. There are no signs and symptoms suggesting acute mountain sickness or high altitude cerebral edema. After halting his ascent and descending, the patient's condition gradually improved, with scotoma persisting for up to 8 wk before fully resolving without surgical intervention. This case highlights the critical need for early recognition and treatment of HAR to prevent permanent visual impairment.

### Sphere of arbitrarily polarized exceptional points with a single planar metasurface [^1d03c06b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Topological properties of arbitrary EP

We previously showed that an EP-induced reflection zero enables us to accumulate a topological phase covering the fullrange by encircling the EP within a rationally chosen two-dimensional parameter space. In the following, we demonstrate that relying on the topological phase accumulated while encircling an EP exhibiting arbitrarily polarized eigenstate (linearly, circularly, and elliptically polarized cases correspond to the first, second, and third column in Fig. 2, respectively), we can manipulate the phase of light on a single polarization channel for any arbitrary polarization with a single metasurface by varying incidence conditions. To observe the EP complex-square-root dependency of the eigenvalue surfaces, we plot the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues in the two-dimensional parameter space of, corresponding to the rotation angles of the two metallic nanorods. These two parameters are expected to control the co- and cross-polarization ratio. By sweeping them in the vicinity of the parameters corresponding to the EP with linearly polarized eigenstates, the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of the reflection matrix present two intersecting Riemann surfaces, which coalesce at the EP (See Supplementary Figs. S4 and S5). Furthermore, at the intersecting point, the reflection coefficient ofcomponent is zero (singularity), as shown in Fig. 3a, consistent with the EP nature of this coalescence point. As we previously pointed out, we obtain a phase winding around the EP singularity that realizes a fullphase coverage, of interest for the design of polarization-converting metasurfaces. It should be noted that due to its topological nature, the accumulated phase always coversregardless of the trajectory followed in parameter space, as long as the loop encircles the conversion zero in reflection. EP-induced topological phase can thus be employed for hologram construction by choosing four unit-cell designs sufficiently far away enough from the zero point to have higher efficiency, corresponding to four different rotation angles around the singularity center (indicated by the black triangles in Fig. 3a). EPs with circularly polarized coalesced eigenstates are also realized, as presented in the second column of Fig. 3, where we obtain similar degeneracy of eigenvalues and an equivalent topological phase pattern (Fig. 3b). For completeness, the last column shows an example of EP with elliptically polarized coalesced eigenstates, characterized by. The topological phase still shows the 2winding, as shown in Fig. 3c. It is worth mentioning that, for a fixed geometry, other arbitrarily polarized topological phases can also be realized under different incident conditions. In contrast, the other anti-diagonal channel of the reflection matrix reveals no topological phase, as illustrated in Fig. 3d–f, corresponding to the EPs showing linear, circular, and elliptical polarization, respectively. Overall, this demonstrates that the topological phase accompanying an EP in a two-dimensional parameter space can be designed to act on any arbitrary polarization state and, thus, allows to modulate the wavefront of any polarization. With the detailed four structures around each EP summarized in Fig. 3g (black triangles in Fig. 3a–f), a 2phase variation can be covered and used for wavefront manipulation. The corresponding amplitudes are shown in Fig. 3h. Building on this design versatility and exploiting the 2phase acquired by beams of adequate polarization when encircling EPs with coalesced eigenstate of the same polarization, we can fabricate a single metasurface simultaneously displaying EPs for three different polarizations (linear, circular, and elliptical). In the following section, we illustrate this by spectrally and spatially monitoring the occurrence of zeros in one anti-diagonal Jones matrix component, while the other components are nonzero. In the last section, we combine the full capabilities of our approach to produce one and the same meta-holograms generated thanks to the 2ET phase for three different polarizations (illustration shown in Fig. 3i).

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of acute altitude illness: 2024 update [^7d23d91f]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Staged ascent and preacclimatization — Two studies showed that spending 6 to 7 d at moderate altitude (~2200–3000 m) prior to proceeding to higher altitude decreases the risk of AMS and blunts physiologic responses before ascent to 4300 m. A more recent study has shown that a 2-d stay at 3000 m is also effective at preventing AMS upon further ascent to 4300 m. For preacclimatization, short-term exposures (eg, 15–60 min or a few hours a few times prior to ascent) are less likely to aid acclimatization, whereas longer exposures (eg, > 8 h daily for > 7 d) are more likely to yield benefit, and hypobaric hypoxia is more effective than normobaric hypoxia.

H/CL ratio is not recommended if there is absence of myocardial uptake on SPECT; if the visual grade is 2 or 3, diagnosis is confirmed and H/CL ratio assessment is not necessary; when visual grade is discordant or equivocal, H/CL ratio may be helpful to classify equivocal visual grade 1 versus 2 as positive or negative.

### The effects of environmental and compositional manipulations on the longevity of tessari-made foam for sclerotherapy [^5a987925]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Tessari-made foam sclerotherapy is performed around the world in a variety of clinics differing in methods, equipment, temperatures, and altitudes. We investigated how the following factors affected the foam's longevity: silicone vs nonsilicone syringes, volume of foam made, ratio of gas to sclerosant, use of air vs 50:50 mixture of carbon dioxide and oxygen, temperature, altitude, and 10 consecutive reuses of the syringes.

Methods

Sclerosant foam was made by the Tessari double-syringe technique. To calculate the longevity, the time was taken for half of the original volume of sclerosant to settle. Half-lives were compared with use of silicone and silicone-free syringes to make the foam. We investigated how the volume (5 mL vs 2 mL) and different ratios affected the foam by observing the half-life of 4:1, 3.5:1, and 3:1 ratios of gas to sclerosant. Air and a 50:50 mixture of carbon dioxide and oxygen were both used as the gas in changing the ratio and volume to see which produced better foam. These experiments were conducted at room (23.9°C) and refrigerator (3°C) temperatures with a constant pressure. The different ratio, volume, and silicone vs nonsilicone syringe experiments were all repeated at 9314, 7460, 4575, and 2326 feet above sea level in addition to the baseline experiment, which took place at 236 feet above sea level. To test how consecutive uses of syringes affected the foam, we made consecutive batches of foam reusing each pair of syringes 10 times; this was repeated five times with silicone syringes and twice with nonsilicone syringes.

Results

Switching to nonsilicone syringes can increase longevity by 70%. A larger volume of foam and a 3:1 ratio produced longer half-lives at all temperatures and altitudes. The lower (3°C) temperature increased the longevity of foam in all instances, as did the use of air. A high altitude (low pressure) had a detrimental effect on the foam's longevity. Ten consecutive syringe uses had no significant impact on the foam's half-life (silicone syringe mean between first five and last five uses, P = 0.95).

Conclusions

The optimum conditions for making foam are nonsilicone syringes, larger volumes, a 3:1 air to sclerosant ratio, and low temperatures. Silicone syringes can be reused until friction becomes a burden. Temperature has a bigger effect than altitude on longevity of the foam. Making foam in larger volumes would allow the foam to last longer. To compensate for high altitudes (low pressures), decreasing the temperature will increase the foam's longevity.

End‐Diastolic NRC Measurement

Still images of the mid‐ventricle were analyzed by 2 investigators (B.L.L. and V.S.V.) masked to the clinical status of the subject, and the mean of the measurements from these 2 investigators was used. The intra‐observer and inter‐observer variability of diastolic NRC was < 10%. The normalized radius of curvature (NRC) of the left ventricle at end‐diastole was measured using the operator‐independent method described by Dong et al 22 (Figure 1), briefly:
Images were exported into ImageJ/Fiji (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA);
Using the "Septal Radius Calculator" plug‐in, LV area (A) was measured at end‐diastole by tracing the endocardial border (with the papillary muscles included);
The "idealized" radius (r i) was then automatically calculated from A, using the equation for the area of a circle;
The endocardial borders of the septum were then traced for the left ventricle, and right ventricle between the RV insertion points, to calculate the septal radius of curvature (r); and
NRC was calculated as the ratio of septal and idealized radii, r / r i.

### Minimum electric-field gradient coil design: theoretical limits and practical guidelines [^075005b9]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Regions A and B are geometrically symmetric about the z = 0 plane, with minimum energy solutions (assuming no E‐field constraint) yielding z‐symmetric field solutions and zero B 0 concomitant fields. Hence, the open diamond starting point (representing the minimum energy solution with no E‐field constraints) for the solid and dashed curves (in both black and green cases) coincide. The symmetry is broken by the addition of a patient model with an E‐field constraint.

The knee in the curves marks the point where magnetic energy, current density, and winding complexity increase rapidly as E max is driven to lower values. These complexities render unrealizable or impractical any gradient designs on the vertical portions of the curves to the left of the knee. Examination of winding patterns indicates that solutions that exhibit energy increases > 25% (or even less depending on coil type) above the global minimum energy become unrealizable (eg, demonstrating two or more "eyes" per half coil [four or more total eyes for an x or y coil] in the fingerprint wire patterns).

The red and purple dotted curves in Figure 2 represent two practical cases in which the primary coil currents are restricted to a single inner surface near the patient and the shield coil currents to an outer cylinder, while at the same time adding torque and eddy current constraints. Line segments acd of Figure 1 represent a primary winding surface consisting of a cone and a cylinder, whereas line segment ab represents its cylindrical shield winding; this yields designs similar to those proposed by previous literature 8, 22 and results in the red dotted curves in Figure 2. A second case is defined by restricting primary currents to the cylinder represented by line segment cd and shield currents to the cylinder ab; this yields designs similar to those proposed by previous literature 28 and produces the purple dotted curves in Figure 2. For both configurations, the eddy current surface is a 1‐m‐long, 620‐mm‐diameter cylinder, centered about the gradient isocenter and placed outside the shield winding of the gradient coil. The time = 0 eddy current error is constrained to a peak deviation less than 0.1% of the ideal gradient field on the surface of a 20‐cm‐diameter volume, corresponding to 100 µT for a 1 T/m step change in gradient strength. The torque constraint is set to zero for a uniform z‐directed B 0 main magnetic field. There is no net force for a perfectly uniform main B 0 field in all calculations.

### An analytic expression for the ultimate intrinsic SNR in a uniform sphere [^7f107f6a]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The ultimate intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio (UISNR) is normally calculated using electrodynamic simulations with a complete basis of modes. Here, we provide an exact solution for the UISNR at the center of a dielectric sphere and assess how accurately this solution approximates UISNR away from the center.

Methods

We performed a mode analysis to determine which modes contribute to central UISNR - ζ(r→0). We then derived an analytic expression to calculate ζ(r→0) and analyzed its dependence on main magnetic field strength, sample geometry, and electrical properties. We validated the proposed solution against an established method based on dyadic Green's function simulations.

Results

Only one divergence-free mode contributes to ζ(r→0). The UISNR given by the exact solution matched the full simulation results for various parameter settings, whereas calculation speed was approximately 1000 times faster. We showed that the analytic expression can approximate the UISNR with < 5% error at positions as much as 10–20% of the radius away from the center.

Conclusion

The proposed formula enables rapid and direct calculation of UISNR in the central region of a sphere. The resulting UISNR value may be used, for example, as an absolute reference to assess the performance of head coils with spherical phantoms.

### Unique and universal dew-repellency of nanocones [^24bfde51]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Fig. 1
Families of samples.

a Schematic illustrating the geometry transition from nanopillar, to truncated cone and finally, to sharp cone. b – d Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and schematics corresponding to the three families of nanocones. For all surfaces, the cones with height h, pitch p, apex angle β and sharpness Σ = 1/ β are arranged on a dense hexagonal array and coated by a hydrophobic layer. b. A is a reference sample made of nanopillars with diameter l = 30 nm. H1 is the smallest nanoconical texture, H2 and H3 are homothetic (constant h / p), with a size ratio of 1.1 and 2.1, respectively. c E1, E2, E3 and E4 are of equal pitch p = 110 nm and gradually extruded from E1 with h = 144 nm by a factor of 1.7, 2.0 and 2.9, respectively. Families H and E intersect: H3 and E2 are the same material. d T1, T2, T3 and T4 have the same pitch but are truncated, with various top diameters l.

We first evidence the unique microwetting properties of sharp nanocones after observing condensed droplets by environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM). Then, we focus on dew-repellency and quantitatively discuss its universality in a wide window of geometries. Truncated cones, however, behave differently and we show that their significant adhesion to microdrops does not prevent successful antifogging, owing to an efficient droplet ejection after triple, quadruple and fivefold coalescences.

Hypoxic tents — use for acclimatization or summit success should not be relied upon: we recommend that hypoxic tents should not be relied upon for facilitating acclimatization, preventing AMS, or increasing the odds of summit success (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Although benefits may theoretically accrue with long hypoxic exposures (> 8 h/d) for > 3 wk prior to planned high altitude travel, such exposures have not been studied.

### Geology of the inSight landing site on mars [^ea7ae233]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Surface rock abundance is typically measured using rock size-frequency distributions in which rock diameter of all rocks larger than a given size are measured over an area. The size-frequency distributions are typically plotted as the cumulative fractional area and/or cumulative number of rocks (normalized by area) versus rock diameter in log-log plots (Fig. 10).

Rock edges are digitized as polygonal outlines in orthorectified and oblique images using ArcMap. A convex hull is then calculated for each digitized rock for which there is topography derived from stereoscopic coverage, providing a minimum axis and maximum axis for each rock in map space for orthorectified images (measured in meters) or pixel space for oblique images (measured as pixels). For orthoimages, such as the workspace mosaic, these axes represent the horizontal length and width of rocks. For oblique images, further processing is necessary to calculate the two oblique axes in meters. To convert oblique measurements from pixels to meters, two axes may be calculated as the product of the distance from the camera (in meters), the camera's angular resolution of 0.8 milliradians/pixel, and the number of pixels for each axis calculated from convex hulls. Distance is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in (x, y, z) coordinates between each rock's center as extracted from a stereo correlation map and the location of the camera derived from IDA telemetry and lander orientation. Minimum and maximum axes are averaged to yield the mean diameter for each rock. The cumulative fractional area (CFA) and cumulative number of the rocks are integrated over the count area as functions of diameter.

### Evaluation of linear growth at higher altitudes [^0b9b241e]. JAMA Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

The country-level population data disaggregated by altitude were based on data from the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN), Columbia University. We used nationally representative and publicly available cross-sectional DHS survey data from 59 low- and middle-income countries. We used all available DHS surveys that collected anthropometric measures for children younger than 5 years and restricted the analysis to surveys that recorded the altitude of the survey cluster or the global positioning system coordinates of the cluster that permitted us to obtain the altitude from external sources. A cluster was equivalent to a village in rural areas or a neighborhood in urban areas. Linear growth (faltering) was expressed in HAZ that measures the distance in height to the median child in the 2006 WHO growth standard. For convenience, we used the term HAZ to refer to both length for age (< 24 months) and height for age (≥ 24 months). Children with biologically implausible height measures (HAZ < −6 or HAZ > 6) were excluded from the analysis. A total of 964 299 height records (51% boys, 49% girls) from 96 552 clusters from 133 surveys administered in 59 countries were used (eTable 1 in the Supplement). The clusters' altitudes ranged from −372 to 5951 m above sea level.

### New insights into changes in ocular structural parameters in simulated hypobaric hypoxia [^7d36f2dd]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

A low-pressure hypoxic environment at a high altitude affects the ocular structure and refractive parameters in the eyes, which manifest as ocular axis elongation, increased central corneal thickness, and lens thickness. These alterations can affect visual acuity and thus a pilot's ability to carry out information acquisition and decision-making while driving. This study presents the first comprehensive data set on refractive parameters at varying degrees of hypoxia under acute hypoxic conditions and will provide a reference basis for the design of safe aircraft.

### Shape analysis, a field in need of careful validation [^3754a883]. Human Brain Mapping (2014). Low credibility.

In the last two decades, the statistical analysis of shape has become an actively studied field and finds applications in a wide range of areas. In addition to algorithmic development, many researchers have distributed end-user orientated toolboxes, which further enable the utilization of the algorithms in an "off the shelf" fashion. However, there is little work on the evaluation and validation of these techniques, which poses a rather serious challenge when interpreting their results. To address this lack of validation, we design a validation framework and then use it to test some of the most widely used toolboxes. Our initial results show inconsistencies and disagreement among four different methods. We believe this type of analysis to be critical not only for the community of algorithm designers but also perhaps more importantly to researchers who use these tools without knowing the algorithm details and seek objective criteria for tool selection.

### Florbetaben f 18 (Neuraceq) [^1337f748]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

A positive scan establishes the presence of moderate to frequent amyloid beta neuritic plaques. Neuropathological examination has shown that moderate to frequent amyloid beta neuritic plaques are present in patients with AD but may also be present in patients with other types of neurologic conditions as well as older people with normal cognition.

Examples of positive and negative scans for each of the four brain regions are illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Axial view of negative (top row) and positive (bottom row) Neuraceq PET scans

Cerebellum: A contrast between the white matter (arrows) and gray matter is seen in both negative and positive scans. Extracerebral signal intensity in the scalp and posterior sagittal sinus (arrowhead) can be seen. Lateral temporal lobes: Spiculated or "mountainous" appearance of the white matter (arrows) is seen in the negative scan, and the signal does not reach the outer rim of the brain (dashed line) due to lower signal intensity in the gray matter. The positive scan shows a "plumped", smooth appearance of the outer border of the brain parenchyma (dashed line) due to signal intensity in the gray matter. Frontal Lobes: Spiculated appearance of the white matter in the frontal lobes (arrows) is seen in the negative scan. The positive scan shows "plumped", smooth appearance in these regions due to the increased gray matter signal intensity (dashed line). Posterior cingulate/precuneus: Regions adjacent and posterior to the splenium (arrow) appear as a hypo-intense "hole" (circle) in the negative scan, whereas this hole is "filled-up" (circle) in the positive scan. Parietal lobes: In the negative scan, the midline between the parietal lobes can be easily identified (long arrow); white matter has a spiculated appearance (short arrow) with low signal near the outer rim of the brain (dashed line). In the positive scan, the midline between the parietal lobes is much thinner. The cortical areas are "filled-up" and are smooth in appearance as signal intensity extends to the outer rim of the brain.

Quantitative Analysis

Quantification of amyloid beta neuritic plaque levels (e.g. Centiloid scale or standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR)) can be used in conjunction with visual assessment and performed with FDA-authorized software indicated for quantification of brain amyloid beta PET scans. Refer to the drug manufacturer's training materials for qualitative and quantitative assessment and software manufacturers' documentation for software operation.

### Unique and universal dew-repellency of nanocones [^d3ad11bf]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The adhesion of water to its substrate is quantified by the contact-angle hysteresis, which we measure by slowly dispensing millimetre-size drops (Supplementary Table 1). On the one hand, hysteresis is ca. 10° on samples H and E, a small value compared to the contact angles — the hallmark of repellent materials. All samples H and E have sharp structures favouring a poor wetting, except E4 whose rounded and continuous top prevents contact lines from pinning, thereby providing wetting properties similar to sharper cones. On the other hand, hysteresis roughly triples to ca. 30° on nanopillars and truncated cones. We attribute this to the discontinuous edges at the top of these structures, which pins the contact line during receding motion. These differences can be amplified for microdrops: water condensing within nanopillars can remain trapped inside the vertical texture, which reinforces pinning and immobilises droplets. In contrast, water was assumed to spontaneously leave the core of dense nanocones: in such an asymmetric landscape, the nucleus lowers its surface energy by rising-up the structure to sit atop the cones, in the so-called Cassie state. The expulsion of water nuclei from the conical texture is especially difficult to monitor directly, due to both the size (of order p) of the nuclei and the short time (nanoseconds) anticipated for their displacement over the nanoscale height h. However, this scenario implies differences in the morphology of microdroplets growing on nanocones compared to those on nanopillars, and thus in their mobility — a property of paramount importance for antifogging.

### Evaluation of linear growth at higher altitudes [^33c14d25]. JAMA Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Limitations

While gathering experimental evidence on this topic is unfeasible, we attempted to account for the role of confounding factors by using multivariable regression, assessing the association between altitude and immediate causes of undernutrition, and restricting the sample to children residing in ideal home environments. Yet, we cannot guarantee that the estimated altitude growth deficit is not explained, at least partly, by an unobservable confounding factor. Another limitation of our study is that, despite using data from multiple countries, the number of children that fulfilled the criteria for ideal home environment at higher altitudes was relatively small.

High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) pharmacotherapy — nifedipine has supportive evidence from a single, nonrandomized, unblinded study using 10 mg of the short-acting version followed by 20 mg slow-release every 6 h when oxygen or descent was not available; the initial loading dose is no longer employed because of concerns about provoking systemic hypotension, and hypotension may develop with the extended-release preparation in intravascular volume depletion. A prospective, cross-sectional study found that adding nifedipine (30 mg sustained release every 12 h) to descent, oxygen, and rest offered no additional benefit in time to resolution of hypoxemia and radiographic opacities or hospital length of stay. Recommendation: Nifedipine should be used for HAPE treatment when descent is impossible or delayed and reliable access to supplemental oxygen or portable hyperbaric therapy is unavailable (Recommendation Grade: 1C).

### The individual response to training and competition at altitude [^8a9e24d9]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Figure 3
Minute ventilation in normoxia (filled circles) and hypoxia (open circles) at different levels of exercise in non-flow limited (left panel) and flow limited (right panel) groups. Values are means ± SE. *Significantly different from normoxia at the same percentage of maximal oxygen uptake, p ≤ 0.05. Reprinted with permission from Elsevier.

It should be noted that in the endurance athlete population, our data consistently show that expiratory flow limitation during heavy exercise is not usually caused by a constrained maximal flow volume envelope. Rather, flow limited athletes typically have a stronger ventilatory response to exercise than non-flow limited athletes. For example, our data show that during maximal exercise VE/VO 2 and end tidal PO 2 are consistently higher and end tidal PCO 2 lower in flow limited versus non-flow limited athletes, which is counter to what is typically seen in individuals who are flow limited due to disease or ageing. Owing to the strong ventilatory response to exercise, we often refer to athletes with expiratory flow limitation as 'flow maximizers' rather than flow limited. By comparison, non-flow limited athletes often have substantial ventilatory reserve during heavy exercise in hypoxia, but still do not increase VE further to defend the fall in SaO 2. Why this is the case is not clear, but it may have to do with the metabolic cost associated with ventilation and potential negative factors associated with high amounts of respiratory muscle work.

Our analyses reveal that a range of yield strength-density pairs can reproduce the observed tsunami run-up heights at Ios, Sikinos, and northern Santorini (Fig. 6a, Supplementary Figs. S1 – S25). Given the deposit density range defined by the pumice sample analysis (1250–1500 kg/m³), it is possible to reproduce the tsunami observations with simulations using a yield strength between 5000 and 20,000 Pa, which is the same value range used in previous VolcFlow simulations of Anak Krakatauand Ritter Island. At Perissa and Kamari, the important observation of sea retreat is reproduced, but run-up heights are underestimated (blue dashed line in Fig. 6d–h).

Tsunami simulations of the 1650 flank deformation.

In addition, we simulated an explosion-induced tsunami, which requires an estimate of the peak wave amplitude, previously assumed to be in the range of 150–240 m, to be able to reconstruct tsunami observations at Santorini. However, considering the crater rim lies in an average water depth of only 135 m, the initial wave height by the explosion is unlikely to have exceeded this. Our simulations of an explosion-induced tsunami with a peak wave height of 150 m can neither reproduce the wave height observed at southern Ios and Sikinos nor the reported initial sea retreat at Kamari and Perissa (green dotted line in Fig. 6d–h).

### Weight illusions explained by efficient coding based on correlated natural statistics [^cf36308b]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Summary data and fits.

Black arrows and circles plot mean relative bias (arrows) and within-participant SD (circle diameters) of human observers (n = 30) in estimating mass, based on reported weight ratios in a task comparing pairs of lifted objects of equal weight and different volume. Red circles and arrows show corresponding mean predictions for the fitted efficient coding model with log-normal prior distribution (blue contours plot the prior density based on median fitted parameters). Row labels A–D indicate objects of the four different tested volumes (illustrated in Fig. 3 C).

Red circles and arrows show mean predicted variability and bias, respectively, for the fitted efficient coding model (maximum likelihood parameters, median values: prior intercept, c m = 2.40; prior slope, β = 0.306; prior s.d. s = 3.22; bias constant, c b = 0.0123; s.d. constant, c σ = 0.0102; individual participant parameters shown in Fig. S1 A; equivalent parameters for empirical sample shown in Fig. 1 A for comparison: c m = 1.10, β = 0.483, s = 0.361).

Figure 3 A (black circles) plots the mean estimated weight ratios for individual pairs of lifted objects from which the empirical estimates in Fig. 2 are calculated, along with predictions of the fitted efficient coding model (red lines). Despite each lifted pair having equal mass, the object of smaller volume was, on average, estimated as heavier (weight ratio > 1) for every pair of objects in each mass condition, demonstrating the SWI. The strength of the SWI decreased as the ratio of the volumes decreased (left to right within each panel), and increased on average as mass of the objects increased (left-hand to right-hand panels). Each of these patterns was quantitatively reproduced by the efficient coding model (red lines), based on the non-linear relationship between mass, volume and prior probability depicted in Fig. 2 (blue contours).

### Inverse altitude effect disputes the theoretical foundation of stable isotope paleoaltimetry [^1a9cfee8]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

HYSPLIT back trajectory and moisture source diagnosed methods

The Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model (HYSPLIT) was used to calculate air parcel trajectories. The 240 h back trajectories with 6 h intervals for air parcels at different atmospheric levels (i.e. 825 hPa, 750 hPa, 681 hPa, 618 hPa and 510 hPa) relative to mean-sea-level were determined using ERA-Interim reanalysiswith a resolution of 1° × 1°. The HYSPLIT model outputs, including the altitude, latitude, longitude, and specific humidity along the air parcel trajectories, were used for moisture source analysis for each target region. We applied a Lagrangian diagnostic to identify moisture sources. Note in this study, we use the term moisture source as a relatively broad concept, which includes both the moisture source region and the moisture transport pathway. The changes in the specific humidity (q shum) of an air parcel along a trajectory are generally the net result of precipitation and evaporation. An increase of q shum for any 6 h interval, i.e. Δ q shum = q shum (T) ‒ q shum (T-6) > 0 (T = 0 h for start point), indicates that external moisture enters into the air parcel and a moisture uptake event occurs. The location (height, latitude, longitude) at T h is then determined as a moisture source region for the air parcel and Δ q shum is the initial moisture contribution at the location. When precipitation occurs after the moisture uptake event, moisture contributions from earlier moisture source regions to the target region will decrease proportionally. In this study, we divided the moisture source into eight separate levels to analyze the moisture transport pathway, i.e. 1000 hPa, 900 hPa, 825 hPa, 750 hPa, 700 hPa, 600 hPa, 500 hPa, and 400 hPa, based on the altitude data from the HYSPLIT outputs to better understand the dominant moisture transport pathway to the target region. This study focuses on δD in water vapor rather than precipitation, so we present data for all trajectories regardless of whether they produced precipitation within 6 h of the endpoint.

Altitude illness risk and prevention — among East Africa mountain climbers, the most common risk is altitude illness; travelers climbing with a guide service "should check that guides are trained to recognize and are equipped to treat altitude sickness". Altitude illness occurs when the body fails to adjust to elevated height levels, usually at 3,048 m (10,000 ft) or higher, with symptoms including shortness of breath, fatigue, vomiting, rapid heart rate, dizziness, nausea, or headache. In recent studies of Mt. Kilimanjaro, prevalence rates of acute mountain sickness (AMS) were 75%–77% during 4- and 5-day ascents; people using acetazolamide were much less likely to develop AMS on 5-day ascents, but 40% still reported AMS symptoms. For travelers planning to ascend to elevations > 8,000 ft, "be sure to discuss the signs and symptoms of altitude illness and provide guidance on its prevention and treatment".

### A collimated, high-speed outflow from the dying star V hydrae [^1073f7b4]. Nature (2003). Excellent credibility.

Stars with masses in the range 1–8 solar masses (M(\circ)) live ordinary lives for approximately 10(9)-10(10) years, but die extraordinary deaths. First, during their death throes as asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars they eject, over 10(4)-10(5) years, half or more of their mass in slowly expanding, spherical winds, and then, in a short (a few 100–1,000 years) and poorly understood phase, they are transformed into aspherical planetary nebula. Recent studies support the idea that high-speed, jet-like flows play a crucial role in this transformation. Evidence for such outflows is indirect, however; this phase is so short that few nearby stars are likely to be caught in the act. Here we report the discovery of a newly launched, high-speed jet-like outflow in the nearby AGB star, V Hydrae. We have detected both proper motions and ongoing evolution in the jet. These results support a model in which the jet is driven by an accretion disk around an unseen, compact companion. We also find a central, dense equatorial disk-like structure which may enable and/or enhance the formation of the accretion disk.

Results

All subjects successfully reached the simulated altitude of 4500 m and completed the experiment without the need for oxygen supplementation. Among the 16 subjects, the majority reported feelings of light-headedness and mild excitement as the height increased. However, their blood pressure, heart rate and blood oxygen saturation levels remained within the normal range, and no subjects reported any significant discomfort (online supplemental table 1).

The AL of the majority of subjects demonstrated a statistically significant upward trend with increasing altitude. Table 1 and figure 2A demonstrate that the AL of the eyes of all subjects increasing from 24.06 ± 0.19 mm at altitude 1 to 24.09 ± 0.19 mm at altitude 4500 m. Subsequently, with the reduction in altitude, the AL exhibited a gradual decline towards its initial state. Specifically (figure 2B), with the exception of the AL between altitude 3500 m and back to ground level, and between altitude 4000 m and back to ground level, which demonstrated no statistically significant difference, the AL exhibited a statistically significant increase across the remaining altitude pairs (p < 0.05).

Measured values of AL, CCT and LT at different altitudes (x ® ± s)

As illustrated in table 1 and figure 2C, the CCT exhibited fluctuating thickening with increasing altitude and rolling thinning with decreasing altitude. The CCT thickness at ground level was 545.500 ± 5.999 µm, while at altitude 4000 m, it was 547.688 ± 6.208 µm. As illustrated in figure 2D, the CCTs at altitudes 3500 m, 4000 m, 4500 m and back to ground level were found to be statistically significantly thicker than those at the initial state (p < 0.05). Among the CCT values, a notable difference was observed between ground level and altitude 4000 m, as well as between ground level and back to ground level (p < 0.01) (figure 2C).

Medication dosing for altitude illness — recommended dosages (Table 1): Acetazolamide for AMS and HACE prevention is oral at 125 mg every 12 h, with pediatric prophylaxis 1.25 mg·kg−1 every 12 h (maximum 125 mg per dose); AMS treatment is 250 mg every 12 h, with pediatric treatment 2.5 mg·kg−1 every 12 h (maximum: 250 mg per dose). Dexamethasone for AMS/HACE prevention and treatment (oral, IV, IM) includes prophylaxis 2 mg every 6 h or 4 mg every 12 h; AMS treatment 4 mg every 6 h; HACE treatment 8 mg once then 4 mg every 6 h; pediatric dosing 0.15 mg·kg−1·dose−1 every 6 h (maximum: 4 mg per dose), and pediatrics should not be used for prophylaxis. Ibuprofen for high altitude headache (HAH) treatment is 600 mg every 8 h. Nifedipine for HAPE prevention or treatment is 30 mg ER version every 12 h or 20 mg ER version every 8 h. Tadalafil for HAPE prevention is 10 mg every 12 h, and sildenafil for HAPE prevention is 50 mg every 8 h. For individuals ascending to and remaining at a given elevation after arrival, acetazolamide prophylaxis should be continued for 2 d when adhering to the recommended ascent rate and 2 to 4 d when ascending faster than recommended rates, with discontinuation once descent is initiated; for HAPE prophylaxis with phosphodiesterase inhibitors, continue for 4 d when adhering to the recommended ascent rate and 4 to 7 d when ascending faster, with discontinuation once descent is initiated.

### Larmor frequency shift from magnetized cylinders with arbitrary orientation distribution [^c5b14197]. NMR in Biomedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

4.2 Simulation (b). The voxel‐averaged Larmor frequency in a sample with varying microstructure

Figure 9 shows the mean ratio, along with the SD, for different ratioswhen estimating the MRI Larmor frequency through a mesoscopic (Equation 20) and a macroscopic (Equation 57) contribution. This was done based on 10 samples for each. The green curve shows the full model with voxel‐averaged dipole field, Equation (21). For these particular samples, our model under‐ or overestimated the ground truth field with an SD less than around 3–8% once the voxel size was around 31–35 times the average radius of the cylinders. The red curves shows the full model but with the elementary field, Equation (2), for calculating the macroscopic contribution. We found that it overestimated the MRI Larmor frequency, around 20–30% with SD around 40–50%. Blue indicates neglecting both the mesoscopic contribution and using the elementary field, and hence resembles the QSM calculation. It equally over‐ and underestimates the Larmor frequency around 25% both with an SD up to 100%.

4.1 Simulation (a). The size of

Figure 7 shows the ratio of model and ground truth Larmor frequency for different sizes of the mesoscopic region and volume fraction for a bundle of uniformly positioned parallel rectangular rods. For a small mesoscopic cavity, the relative error from replacing the nearby microstructure with a homogeneous medium with the same average susceptibility is high. As the mesoscopic cavity increases, the actual positions of the cylinders become less important, and the ratio can be seen to converge to 1. The SD is clearly lowest for high volume fraction due to a larger number of involved rods. Additionally, it is clear that the coarse‐grained Larmor frequency can be decomposed using any cavity shape for.

FIGURE 7
Simulation (a): The mean error (circles) and standard deviation (colored bands) of the estimated Larmor frequency is shown as a function of the size of the mesoscopic regioncompared with the width of the rods. The error can be seen to converge to below 5% whenis around 10for all three cavity geometries. This underscores that the shape of the mesoscopic region is irrelevant; only size matters.

Figure 8 shows that the mean squared difference(cf. Figure 4A and 4B) and mean center field(cf. Figure 4C) converge towards zero, no matter the cavity shape and dimensionality, with the convergence rate corresponding to the sum, i.e. Here, is the structural disorder exponent andthe dimensionality. In Appendix C we derive this scaling relation.

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) — AMS: Two reports have demonstrated the feasibility of administering CPAP to treat AMS, but logistical challenges in field settings include access to power and device weight and bulk, and because of lack of data, no recommendation can be made regarding use of CPAP for AMS treatment.

Acute mountain sickness prophylaxis — dexamethasone has evidence for AMS prevention, with recommended adult doses of 2 mg every 6 h or 4 mg every 12 h; high doses (4 mg every 6 h) may be considered only in very high-risk situations such as personnel airlifted to altitudes > 3500 m with immediate physical activity; tapering is not required if use is limited to 5 to 7 d, prolonged use carries a risk of adrenal suppression, and dexamethasone is not recommended for AMS prevention in children; We recommend that dexamethasone be used as an alternative to acetazolamide for adult travelers at moderate or high risk of AMS. Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of acute altitude illness: 2024 update [^c7c84731]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) treatment — Nifedipine showed utility in a single, nonrandomized, unblinded study using 10 mg of the short-acting version followed by 20 mg slow release every 6 h when oxygen or descent was not available; the initial short-acting loading dose is no longer employed due to concerns about systemic hypotension, and hypotension may develop with extended release in intravascular volume depletion. In a prospective, cross-sectional study at lower elevation, adding nifedipine (30 mg sustained release every 12 h) to descent, oxygen, and rest offered no additional benefit in time to resolution of hypoxemia, radiographic opacities, or hospital length of stay. We recommend that nifedipine be used for HAPE treatment only when descent is impossible or delayed and reliable access to supplemental oxygen or portable hyperbaric therapy is unavailable. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

Right ventricular (RV) linear measurements — quantitation is critical and reduces interreader variability versus visual assessment, and RV dimensions are best estimated from an RV-focused apical four-chamber view obtained with either lateral or medial transducer orientation; in the RV-focused view, a diameter > 41 mm at the base and > 35 mm at the midlevel indicates RV dilatation.

Results

Mass and focus circles for 3D reconstruction

The exit wave Ψ e (r, z), at a particular image plane, can be expressed analytically as:

where t is the mass thickness of the sample, Ψ(r,0) is the incident wave, Φ 1s (r) is the 1s eigenstate of the projected electrostatic potential of the atom column with eigenenergy E. α is a constant and Δ f is the focus difference given by the distance of the image plane to the exact exit surface defined by the last atom in a column. The exit wave is complex and can be represented in an Argand plot. Figure 1a shows the Argand plot of pixels from the centre of atom columns. It is clear that the two factors (e − i Et −1) and (1−e − iα Δ f) from equation describe two circles called 'mass (Et) circle' (black circle) and 'defocus (α Δ f) circle' (red circles), respectively. It is seen that information about the column mass and its local focus are orthogonal. If the sensitivity of a microscope suffices to isolate the contrast contribution from scattering at single atoms, the 'mass' values will be discrete and their regular spacing will give an ultimate mass calibration. Similarly, discrete focus values must be detected if the spatial resolution in beam direction is smaller than the periodic distance between successive atoms in a column.

### The landing of the NEAR-shoemaker spacecraft on asteroid 433 eros [^63cbb7ae]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

The NEAR-Shoemaker spacecraft was designed to provide a comprehensive characterization of the S-type asteroid 433 Eros (refs 1,2,3), an irregularly shaped body with approximate dimensions of 34 x 13 x 13 km. Following the completion of its year-long investigation, the mission was terminated with a controlled descent to its surface, in order to provide extremely high resolution images. Here we report the results of the descent on 12 February 2001, during which 70 images were obtained. The landing area is marked by a paucity of small craters and an abundance of 'ejecta blocks'. The properties and distribution of ejecta blocks are discussed in a companion paper. The last sequence of images reveals a transition from the blocky surface to a smooth area, which we interpret as a 'pond'. Properties of the 'ponds' are discussed in a second companion paper. The closest image, from an altitude of 129 m, shows the interior of a 100-m-diameter crater at 1-cm resolution.

### High-dimensional one-shot optical field compressive sensing of structured light [^818ca56a]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Detailed studies show that the measured polarization phase differencechanges from 190° for the 2.26 rad/fs frequency component (834 nm wavelength) to 172° for the 2.48 rad/fs one (760 nm wavelength) (Fig. 2c red), consistent with calculations based on the half-wave plate refractive index provided by the supplier (Fig. 2c blue). Thus, the chromatic dispersion of the incident half-wave plate introduces wavelength–polarization coupling of a supposed linearly polarized light, illustrating the high-dimensional resolving power of the proposed scheme. In the time domain, the polarization state at each time slice is averaged over the entire spectral bandwidth, showing little variation.

We then use quarter-wave plates to generate light fields with right-rotating circular and left-rotating elliptical polarization, and Fig. 2d and e show their 3D spatiotemporal polarization states (white arrows) and intensities (color maps). For the elliptical polarization case, the white arrows form ellipses rotating along the left-hand direction, and their long axes are 20° to the-direction, consistent with the design. Moreover, the light chirality in each case is unambiguously determined, justifying the genuine 3D one-shot polarization resolving capability for arbitrary light, instead of simple specialized cases such as linear polarization –.

### Computer aided quantification for retinal lesions in patients with moderate and severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy: a retrospective cohort study [^260417bb]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Results

After threshold segmentation and labeling, the numbers and areas of each exudate were automatically obtained for further analysis (Figure 3), after statistical analysis, the exudates/disk ratio in the severe group (3.2 ± 1.1) increased than that of the moderate group (1.8 ± 1.1) (P < 0.05).

After Otsu segmentation (Figure 4 a), the binary values were inverted to make blood vessels and microaneurysms as white structures (Figure 4 b). The original image was subtracted by the image after erosion (2-pixel disk structure element) and further dilation (1-pixel disk structure element) was performed to obtain microaneurysms (Figure 4 c).

For Hough detection, the highest peaks are corresponded to a particular radius in the accumulator data (Figure 5 a). If the height of the peaks is equal compared to the number of edge pixels for a circle with the particular radius, the coordinates of the peaks does probably correspond to the center of such a circle (Figure 5 b). In this study, we identified the number of microaneurysms automatically and overlapped the results in segmented retinal images (Figure 5 c).

High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) prevention — dexamethasone: In the study referenced, dexamethasone (8 mg every 12 h) also prevented HAPE in susceptible individuals, though the mechanism is unclear and experience is limited. We recommend that dexamethasone can be used for HAPE prevention in known susceptible individuals who are not candidates for nifedipine and tadalafil; Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.
