## Question

What kind of ultrasound do I do for an IUD placement?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what kind of ultrasound to use for IUD placement. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether ultrasound is routinely indicated during insertion or only for confirmation afterward. Then, I should verify which ultrasound approach is preferred when guidance is used: transabdominal versus transvaginal. Next, I will consider special scenarios like postpartum or difficult anatomy where guidance might be more helpful. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-aligned recommendation and clarify when 2D versus 3D imaging adds value.

> Let me first confirm the standard of care. Routine ultrasound guidance during routine IUD insertion is not required; professional guidance emphasizes bimanual examination and cervical inspection to assess uterine size and position, with ultrasound reserved for confirmation when placement is uncertain or when strings are not visible, rather than as a universal intra-procedural adjunct [^114XFvx4] [^114H2Ccw].

> Wait, let me verify the role of ultrasound during the procedure itself. When ultrasound is used for real-time guidance during insertion, the evidence base supports transabdominal ultrasound as the typical approach because it allows the operator to visualize the uterus and guide the inserter toward the fundus without disrupting the sterile field, and randomized data show reduced pain, shorter procedure time, and fewer complications with transabdominal ultrasound guidance compared with non-guided insertion, although this requires equipment and trained assistance [^114v6kVz].

> Hold on, I should distinguish this from post-insertion confirmation. For verifying final position, transvaginal ultrasound is preferred because it provides higher-resolution imaging of the endometrial cavity and can precisely confirm fundal placement and detect malposition such as low-lying or embedded devices; this is the standard modality for post-insertion checks and for troubleshooting when strings are not visible or when symptoms arise [^115jsYcc] [^111L55WK].

> I need to check special scenarios where intra-procedural ultrasound is more compelling. In immediate postpartum settings, where the uterus is large and soft and expulsion risk is higher, ultrasound guidance can facilitate accurate fundal placement and may reduce expulsion in some contexts, though expulsion rates remain higher than interval placements and evidence is mixed; professional societies allow insertion with or without ultrasound, using clinical judgment, and emphasize counseling on expulsion signs and follow-up [^111yMc92] [^117DCGu7].

> Let me consider difficult anatomy or failed insertions. In patients with distorted uterine cavities, retroversion, or prior expulsion, ultrasound guidance can improve success and reduce trauma; similarly, in nulliparous patients with tight cervices or when initial attempts fail, ultrasound can aid navigation and reduce repeated instrumentation, though this remains selective rather than routine [^113temPA].

> Next, I should review 2D versus 3D imaging. For routine placement and confirmation, 2D transvaginal ultrasound suffices to verify fundal position and detect common malpositions; 3D ultrasound adds value when 2D visualization is limited or when detailed mapping of the IUD relative to the internal os or myometrial embedment is needed, and it improves conspicuity of some devices, but it is not required for standard care [^115Z9eBL] [^112Q7ioj].

> I should double-check the practical synthesis. For routine IUD insertion, do not routinely use ultrasound during the procedure; rely on bimanual examination and cervical inspection, and consider transabdominal ultrasound guidance selectively for difficult insertions, teaching settings, or postpartum placements. Always confirm final position with transvaginal ultrasound when placement is uncertain, strings are not visible, or symptoms occur, as this is the most accurate modality for verification and complication assessment [^114XFvx4] [^114v6kVz] [^115jsYcc] [^112Pp6Sf].

---

For IUD placement, **transabdominal ultrasound is the primary modality** for real-time guidance during insertion because it provides a global view of the uterus and allows the provider to guide the IUD to the fundus without disrupting the sterile field [^114v6kVz] [^111nkAJC]. Transvaginal ultrasound is used when **transabdominal views are inadequate** (e.g. obesity, retroverted uterus) or for detailed confirmation of final position, especially if strings are not visible or malposition is suspected [^115jsYcc] [^114H2Ccw]. Routine ultrasound is not required for all insertions, but it is recommended in challenging anatomy, postpartum settings, or when initial placement is uncertain [^113NRLX3] [^113temPA].

---

## Indications for ultrasound guidance during IUD placement

Ultrasound guidance is **not universally required** for IUD insertion; however, it is beneficial in specific clinical scenarios, including:

- **Difficult anatomy**: Retroverted or retroflexed uterus, uterine anomalies, or fibroids distorting the cavity [^114VV2YZ].

- **Postpartum placement**: Higher expulsion risk and uterine changes warrant ultrasound to confirm fundal placement [^116mYBqC] [^117DCGu7].

- **Failed or difficult insertion**: Previous failed attempts or uncertainty about uterine depth or direction [^114CdzSW].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Obesity, nulliparity, or prior IUD expulsion [^115weKMg] [^115DViok].

---

## Types of ultrasound used for IUD placement

Two main ultrasound approaches are used for IUD placement: **transabdominal ultrasound** and **transvaginal ultrasound**.

| **Attribute** | **Transabdominal ultrasound** | **Transvaginal ultrasound** |
|-|-|-|
| Technique | External probe on the abdomen; bladder distension improves visualization | Internal probe in the vagina; closer to uterus for higher-resolution images |
| Advantages | - Noninvasive <br/> - Comfortable <br/> - Sterile field preserved <br/> - Real-time guidance during insertion [^114v6kVz] [^111nkAJC] | - Superior resolution <br/> - Detailed assessment of IUD position <br/> - Useful when transabdominal views are inadequate [^115jsYcc] [^115Z9eBL] |
| Limitations | - Lower resolution <br/> - Obesity or bowel gas can limit views <br/> - Operator-dependent [^notfound] | - Invasive <br/> - May cause discomfort <br/> - Risk of infection (minimal) <br/> - Requires patient cooperation [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting ultrasound guidance

Recent studies and meta-analyses show that **ultrasound guidance during IUD insertion** offers several advantages:

- **Reduced pain**: Significant reduction in pain scores during insertion (mean difference -1.91 on VAS) [^114v6kVz].

- **Shorter procedure time**: Decreased insertion time by approximately 1.35 minutes [^114v6kVz] [^111nkAJC].

- **Improved accuracy**: Higher rates of successful placement and ideal positioning [^113Dby27].

- **Fewer complications**: Lower rates of malposition, expulsion, and perforation [^114v6kVz].

---

## Limitations and considerations

Despite its benefits, ultrasound guidance has some **limitations**:

- **Resource availability**: Requires trained personnel and equipment, which may not be available in all settings [^113temPA].

- **Operator dependence**: Accuracy and effectiveness depend on operator skill and experience [^notfound].

- **Patient factors**: Obesity, bowel gas, and patient discomfort can limit image quality and procedure success [^notfound].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) emphasize the importance of **individualized decision-making** regarding ultrasound use during IUD placement. Routine ultrasound is not mandated, but it is recommended in specific clinical scenarios, such as difficult anatomy, postpartum placement, or failed insertion attempts [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Routine ultrasound**: Not required for all IUD insertions.

- **Transabdominal ultrasound**: Preferred for real-time guidance during insertion due to noninvasiveness and preservation of sterile field [^notfound].

- **Transvaginal ultrasound**: Use when transabdominal views are inadequate or for detailed confirmation of IUD position [^notfound].

- **Clinical judgment**: Use ultrasound guidance in challenging anatomies, postpartum settings, or when initial placement is uncertain [^113NRLX3].

---

Transabdominal ultrasound is the **primary modality** for IUD placement guidance, with transvaginal ultrasound reserved for specific clinical scenarios. Ultrasound guidance improves accuracy, reduces pain, and shortens procedure time, but its use should be tailored to patient characteristics and clinical context.

### Does ultrasound guidance provide pain relief during intrauterine contraceptive device insertion? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114v6kVz]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate ultrasound guidance effect in pain relief during intrauterine device (IUD) insertion.

Methods

Four different databases were searched from inception till June 2022. We selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared transabdominal ultrasound guidance versus traditional non-guided IUD insertion among women undergoing IUD placement for contraception. We used Revman software during performing our meta-analysis. Our primary outcome was the pain score during IUD insertion as evaluated by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Our secondary outcomes were the procedure insertion time, satisfaction, and incidences of complications and misplaced IUDs.

Results

Seven RCTs were retrieved with a total number of 1267 patients. There was a significant reduction in the VAS pain score during IUD insertion among the ultrasound-guided group (MD = -1.91, 95% CI [-3.08, -0.73], P = 0.001). The procedure insertion time was significantly shorter within the ultrasound guidance group compared with the control group (MD = -1.35, 95% CI [-1.81, -0.88], P < .001). Moreover, more women were significantly satisfied with the procedure among the ultrasound-guided group (P < .001). In addition, ultrasound-guided IUD insertion was linked to significant decline in incidences of complications and misplaced IUDs.

Conclusion

Ultrasound guidance can be used as a modified technique during IUD insertion as it decreases pain, procedure time, and rates of complications and misplaced IUDs with better patient satisfaction.

### Ultrasound assessment of the intrauterine device [^115jsYcc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

As the use of intrauterine devices (IUDs) has expanded in the United States, both as a highly effective form of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) and as a tool for effective management of other gynecologic conditions, effective imaging of IUDs has become increasingly important. Ultrasound is a cost-effective, accurate, safe, and accessible imaging solution for the assessment of IUDs. This article explores the role of ultrasound in evaluation of IUDs as well as the literature regarding ultrasound guidance for device placement. It also examines the evaluation and management of IUDs with a concurrent intrauterine pregnancy.

### Society of Family Planning guidelines: postplacental insertion of intrauterine devices [^113NRLX3]. Contraception (2018). Medium credibility.

Postplacental intrauterine device (IUD) insertion — ultrasound during insertion: Recent reports note expulsion rates of 19–24% when ultrasound is used during postplacental insertion after vaginal delivery versus 27–37% when ultrasound use is not reported, but there are no studies directly testing whether ultrasound reduces expulsions and there is not sufficient evidence to support routine use; therefore, it is reasonable to perform insertions with or without ultrasound guidance, and if there is concern about fundal placement clinical judgment may be used to employ ultrasound when available, while lack of ultrasound guidance should not prohibit provision after vaginal delivery.

### Ultrasound guidance can reduce IUD insertion time [^111nkAJC]. Annals of Family Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

We investigated whether ultrasound (US)-guided intrauterine device (IUD) insertion reduces procedure time and pain compared to conventional methods. A quasi-randomized prospective study at a Federally Qualified Teaching Health Center enrolled a total of 50 IUD insertion cases. In the US-guided group (n = 25), IUD insertion was performed under transabdominal US guidance without uterine sounding and bimanual examination. In the conventional group (n = 22), insertion was followed by bimanual examination and uterine sounding. The procedure time was significantly shorter in the US-guided group (P = 0.033), while pain scores were not different between the groups (P = 0.161). Transabdominal US guidance during IUD insertion may enhance procedural efficiency and serve as a valuable tool in teaching health centers.

### A proposed classification for intrauterine device position: the tal-reeves classification [^115PyCNF]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2022). High credibility.

Imaging of IUDs is increasingly common both in clinical practice and in research. We need a common language to communicate the IUD position. In newer IUD efficacy studies, ultrasonography is used almost universally but with differing definitions of partial expulsion. The use of a classification system would provide a common language for communicating IUD position. We believe that the Tal-Reeves classification proposed here can fulfil that need. In the future, we hope that having a common language for reporting IUD position will facilitate research into the relationship between position and clinical outcomes.

### Society of Family Planning guidelines: postplacental insertion of intrauterine devices [^113dztmd]. Contraception (2018). Medium credibility.

Postplacental IUD ultrasound — follow-up and surveillance: Published data on malposition after postplacental IUD are limited; an observational study of 100 women with CuT380A found 44% malposition, a case-control study of 364 women found no association between malposition and placement at 6–9 weeks postpartum, and no pregnancies occurred among women with malpositioned copper or LNG-IUDs left in situ but pregnancy risk increased when malpositioned IUDs were removed without another highly effective method; one randomized study of an investigational LNG-IUD showed similar low pregnancy rates for intracervical versus intrauterine placement over 5 years, and while copper IUD effectiveness away from the fundus is a concern, no well-designed study has confirmed this, so based on the evidence we do not recommend routine ultrasound for surveillance after postplacental IUD insertion, and if incidental displacement is diagnosed on ultrasound, removal is not mandated but may be considered after counseling if immediate replacement or alternate highly effective contraception is feasible and desired.

### Ultrasound-guided compared with non-ultrasound-guided placement of immediate postpartum intrauterine contraceptive devices [^1132M425]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Immediate postpartum placement of intrauterine devices (IUDs) can help reduce unintended short-interval pregnancy; however, the rate of spontaneous device expulsion is increased. The objective of this study is to evaluate the risk of expulsion with ultrasound-guided placement of immediate postpartum IUDs. Retrospective review of all patients receiving immediate postpartum IUDs after vaginal delivery at Prisma Health Richland Hospital from 2018 to 2020 was performed. Outcomes were available for 78 patients in the ultrasound-guided cohort and for 226 in the control cohort. The expulsion rate was 15.4% (95% CI 8.2–25.3%) for the ultrasound-guided cohort and 14.2% (95% CI 9.9–19.4%) for the control cohort. Our data suggest that using ultrasonography to guide placement of IUDs immediately after vaginal delivery is not associated with the risk of expulsion.

### Can ultrasound predict IUD expulsion after medical abortion? [^115BhSZ6]. Contraception (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Our randomized trial compared early and delayed intrauterine device (IUD) insertion following medical abortion. In this planned substudy, we explore if endometrial thickness and initial IUD position were associated with IUD expulsion. We also describe IUD movement within the uterus during the 6 months after insertion.

Study Design

We recruited women undergoing medical abortion and choosing the copper IUD for contraception (n = 156). Participants were randomly assigned to early insertion 1 week after mifepristone or delayed insertion 4–6 weeks later. We measured endometrial thickness by transvaginal sonogram 1 week after abortion and IUD distance from the fundal aspect of the endometrial cavity three times: at insertion, 6–8 weeks later and at 6 months.

Results

We analyzed endometrial thickness in 113 women, baseline IUD position in 114 women and IUD movement in 65 women. Women who expelled IUDs (n = 15) had slightly thicker endometria (p = .007) and slightly lower baseline IUD positions (p = .03) than those who retained IUDs, but no clear cutoffs emerged in the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Retained IUDs commonly moved up and down throughout the 6 months (from 14 mm towards the fundus to 32 mm towards the cervix). Overall, retained IUDs moved a median of 2mm towards the cervix between insertion and exit (p < .0001).

Conclusions

After medical abortion, the risk of IUD expulsion increases with thicker endometria and lower baseline position. Since no clear cutoffs emerged in the analysis and expulsion remained uncommon even with thicker endometria, we do not recommend restricting IUD insertion based on ultrasound data.

Implication

Copper T IUDs often move within the uterus without expelling. Expulsion is uncommon, and we do not recommend restricting IUD insertion based on ultrasound data.

### Ultrasound location of intrauterine devices placed at cesarean section over the first year postpartum [^111VoWA8]. Contraception (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The primary objective was to measure IUD-fundus and IUD-myometrium distances by ultrasound of IUDs placed during cesarean section over the first year of use. The secondary objective was to determine if these distances are associated with risk of expulsion or removal for side effects.

Study Design

In this prospective observational study, we performed ultrasounds at six - ten weeks, three months and one year postpartum to measure the distance from the top of the device to the fundal serosa (IUD-fundus) and upper margin of the endometrial cavity (IUD-myometrium). We also assessed IUD expulsion or discontinuation for side effects at each visit.

Results

We enrolled 93 women who had copper (n = 77) or levonorgestrel (n = 16) IUDs placed at time of cesarean section. Two patients had complete expulsion, six had partial expulsion and nine requested removal for symptoms. Overall, median IUD-fundus measurements were 2.13 cm (IQR 1.87–2.55) at 6–10 weeks, 1.87 cm (IQR 1.53–2.23) at 3-months and 2.02 cm (IQR 1.67–2.40) at 1-year. Among copper IUD users, distances at six weeks and three months were similar in women who did or did not have expulsion or removal at one year however small numbers limit our ability to assess this relationship.

Conclusion

We describe the location on ultrasound of IUDs placed at the time of Cesarean section over the first year. We found similar IUD locations at six weeks and three months for participants who did or did not experience expulsion or removal by one year.

Implications

Position of intrauterine devices placed during cesarean section was similar for those who did or did not have expulsion or removal for symptoms in the first year after placement. These data may help in the design of future studies to determine if ultrasound measurement of IUDs predicts IUD complications.

### Does the type of intrauterine device affect conspicuity on 2D and 3D ultrasound? [^115Z9eBL]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of our study was to assess the conspicuity and position evaluation of intrauterine devices (IUDs) on 2D ultrasound and 3D ultrasound in nongravid patients.

Materials and Methods

Review of the ultrasound database for the period from July 2008 through June 2009 was performed for identification of patients with IUDs, of the type and position of the IUD, and of the patient's presenting symptoms. The conspicuity of the IUD on 2D sagittal and transverse planes and 3D coronal views was scored according to a 7-point scale. Data analysis was performed using the Student t test and the Pearson chi-square test.

Results

Of the 269 patients with IUDs who had undergone ultrasound during the study period, 180 patients had a copper IUD; 59, a levonorgestrel-releasing device; and three, a Lippes loop. Twenty-seven IUDs were excluded because they were not seen on ultrasound (n = 15) or the type of IUD was not identifiable (n = 12). Of the 239 IUDs identified, the conspicuity score for copper IUDs (mean score, 5.3 [SD, 1.4]) differed significantly from that for levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs (mean, 3.1 [1.0]) on 2D ultrasound (p < 0.001). The difference in the conspicuity score for copper IUDs (mean, 6.6 [0.95]) versus that for levonorgestrel-releasing devices (mean, 6.2 [0.92]) on 3D ultrasound was marginally significant (p = 0.05). One hundred seventy-six IUDs (74%) were properly positioned within the endometrial cavity and 60 (25%) were malpositioned; proper positioning of three IUDs (1%) could not be confirmed. The indications for sonographic evaluation were pain (111/239, 46%), missing strings (91/239, 38%), and bleeding (34/239, 14%). Of the patients who presented with bleeding, the IUD was malpositioned in 13 (38%).

Conclusion

The levonorgestrel-releasing IUD is significantly less conspicuous than the copper IUD on 2D imaging. Three-dimensional ultrasound enhances the conspicuity of both types of IUD.

### Monitoring with ultrasound imaging of intrauterine device (IUD) position placed immediately after giving birth… [^1158SVsc]. ClinicalTrials (2013). Low credibility.

However, the ultrasound appearance of these IUDs, placed immediately after birth and before uterine involution, may be different than those IUDs placed outside of the postpartum period. To our knowledge no other study has documented expected ultrasound appearance of IUDs placed in the immediate postpartum period. The specific aims of this study are to:

1. document normal appearance of IUDs on ultrasound after immediate postpartum placement;
2. document if this appearance changes over time; and 3. determine if location on ultrasound is associated with side effects or expulsion. The ultrasound will document the following: size and position of uterus, IUD-Myometrium distance, IUD-endometrium distance, IUD-fundus distance and position of IUD. When participants present for the scheduled ultrasound visits, they will be asked to return with the completed symptom diary as well, to assess bleeding and pain.

Study procedures At the routine 6 week postpartum visit for all patients, pelvic and speculum exam will be performed as per normal clinical routine, and visualization of IUD strings at the cervical os will be documented. If IUD strings are not visualized, an ultrasound will be performed by the clinical provider to confirm presence or absence of IUD within the uterus. A formal ultrasound to evaluate IUD position will be scheduled in the FPA gynecologic ultrasound unit or in the Gynecology clinic at EHC at the following time points: 6–10 weeks following placement, 3 months following placement, and 12 months following placement. The formal ultrasound will document the following: size and position of uterus, endometrial stripe thickness, IUD-Myometrium distance, IUD-endometrium distance, IUD-fundus distance and position of IUD.

If strings are not visible, or if the patient experiences symptoms concerning for expulsion, a transvaginal ultrasound will be performed. Once correct placement is confirmed by ultrasound, patients without visible strings generally have ultrasounds yearly to confirm placement. Based on this standard practice, patients with visible strings will have the ultrasound only for research purposes. Additionally, the three month ultrasound will be only for research purposes, even in those without visible strings. When participants present for the scheduled ultrasound visits, they will be asked to return with the completed symptom diary as well. Other: Immediate postpartum placement of IUD

### Predictors for discontinuation of intrauterine devices that underwent ultrasound-guided placement in a long-term follow-up cohort [^115DViok]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To investigate long-term outcomes of ultrasound-guided intrauterine device (IUD) insertion. The rate of and reasons for IUD discontinuation were reviewed, including the prevalence of uterine fibroids.

Methods

A retrospective cohort of patients who underwent transabdominal ultrasound (TAUS)-guided IUD insertion was reviewed. Information collected included age, body mass index, insertion date, indication for IUD use, indication for using TAUS guidance, and presence of uterine fibroids. The date of and reason for discontinuation were recorded.

Results

One hundred sixteen patients with successful TAUS-guided IUD placement were identified. Of these, 51 patients (43.97%) no longer had an IUD in place. An overall actual-to-expected use ratio was calculated to be 63.49%. The most common reason for IUD discontinuation was spontaneous expulsion (11.21%). The prevalence of fibroid uteri was 27.6% in our cohort. The actual-to-expected use ratio of those with a fibroid uterus was calculated to be 43.28%, which was significantly lower than that for a nonfibroid uterus (73.80%; P = 0.002). There were 27 of 104 patients with IUD use of less than 1year, and fibroids were present 44.4% of the time. Comparatively, of the 77 patients that had IUD continuation of greater than 1year, only 24.7% had fibroids (P = 0.022). The yearly continuation rates over 5years were 74.04%, 55.84%, 41.67%, 35.14%, and 32.0% respectively. Of the 18 patients who received TAUS-guided insertion for a previous IUD expulsion, 33.3% had another spontaneous expulsion.

Conclusions

Uterine fibroids and a previous expulsion appear to be the most likely predictors of IUD discontinuation, particularly within 1year after insertion.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^116Grmi4]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

IUD Strings Are Not Visible and Cannot Be Safely Retrieved

If ultrasonography is available, consider performing or referring for ultrasound examination to determine the location of the IUD. If the IUD cannot be located, it might have been expelled or have perforated the uterine wall.
If ultrasonography is not possible or the IUD is determined by ultrasound to be inside the uterus, advise the patient to seek care promptly if they have heavy bleeding, cramping, pain, abnormal vaginal discharge, or fever.

Comments and Evidence Summary. Removing the IUD improves the pregnancy outcome if the IUD strings are visible or the device can be retrieved safely from the cervical canal. Risks for spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery, and infection are substantial if the IUD is left in place.

Theoretically, the fetus might be affected by hormonal exposure from an LNG-IUD. However, whether this exposure increases the risk for fetal abnormalities is unknown.

A systematic review identified nine studies suggesting that women who did not remove their IUDs during pregnancy were at greater risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes (e.g. spontaneous abortion, septic abortion, preterm delivery, and chorioamnionitis) compared with women who had their IUDs removed or who did not have an IUD. Cu-IUD removal decreased risks but not to the baseline risk for pregnancies without an IUD. One case series examined LNG-IUDs. When the IUDs were not removed, eight out of 10 pregnancies ended in spontaneous abortions (Level of evidence: II-2, fair, direct).

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^116gJujL]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Intrauterine device (IUD) strings not visible and cannot be safely retrieved — evaluation and counseling include to consider ultrasonography to determine IUD location and recognize that an unlocated IUD might have been expelled or have perforated the uterine wall; if ultrasound is not possible or the IUD is intrauterine, advise prompt care for heavy bleeding, cramping, pain, abnormal vaginal discharge, or fever. Removing the IUD improves pregnancy outcome when strings are visible or retrieval from the cervical canal is safe, and risks for spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery, and infection are substantial if the IUD is left in place. A systematic review identified nine studies showing greater risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes when the IUD is not removed; Cu‑IUD removal decreased risks but not to baseline, and in one LNG‑IUD case series, when IUDs were not removed eight out of 10 pregnancies ended in spontaneous abortions; effects of theoretical hormonal exposure on fetal abnormalities are unknown.

### Incidence and risk factors for a malpositioned intrauterine device detected on three-dimensional ultrasound within eight weeks of placement [^115weKMg]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To estimate the incidence of intrauterine device (IUD) malpositioning detected on three-dimensional (3D) transvaginal ultrasound within 8weeks of placement and identify risk factors for malpositioning.

Methods

Retrospective study of women who had an IUD placed at a large obstetrics and gynecology practice from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2020. All patients underwent two-dimensional ultrasound at the time of insertion and routine three-dimensional ultrasound within 8weeks. Baseline characteristics and potential risk factors were compared between women with correctly positioned and malpositioned IUDs. Odds ratios were calculated by logistic regression to identify risk factors independently associated with malpositioning.

Results

A total of 763 IUD placements were included, and 127 malpositioned IUDs were identified representing an overall rate of malpositioning of 16.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 14.0–19.3) with 8.8% (95% CI 6.8–10.8) requiring removal. Patients with malpositioned IUD had higher rates of morbid obesity (13.4% versus 3.8%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.46, 95% CI 1.10–5.50), prior uterine window or rupture (9.0% versus 2.2%, aOR 2.78, 95% CI 1.06–7.30), copper IUD placement (64.2% versus 47.4%, aOR 1.99, 95% CI 1.31–3.03), and symptoms such as bleeding or pain at follow-up (35.8% versus 20.1%, aOR 2.58, 95% CI 1.67–3.98). Parity, breastfeeding, difficult insertion, and uterine size and positioning were not significant.

Conclusions

The incidence of malpositioned IUD within 8weeks of placement on 3D ultrasound is 16.6%, with 8.8% requiring removal. Significant risk factors for malpositioning include morbid obesity, prior uterine window or rupture, and copper IUD placement. These findings support the importance of routine follow-up 3D ultrasound after seemingly successful IUD placement.

### A proposed classification for intrauterine device position: the tal-reeves classification [^1155ob2m]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

We propose a simple, feasible and practical classification that uses the position of the IUD in relation to the internal os rather than the fundus. Modern ultrasound imaging enables visualisation of the location of the IUD in relationship to the cervical os as well as extension into the myometrium. The goal of the Tal-Reeves classification system is to allow standardisation of reporting of IUD location both for clinical use and research for evaluation of new IUD designs. The system proposed is based on the concept that defining 'normal position' is less important than defining what is abnormal.

This system does not include IUD position within the abdomen or other unusual positions which are, fortunately, much less common. Although these IUD locations are well known, over 130 person-years of observation with the T380S we did not find any cases that could not be described using this system, indicating the relative infrequency that other positions are observed. Importantly, those rare IUD positions can be accurately described based on other anatomic landmarks. Adding those positions to the proposed system is unlikely to be useful.

We believe that the proposed system parsimoniously balances precision with simplicity. Although one could contemplate measuring the distance that the IUD lies above or below the internal os, the distance is only relevant for a particular uterus. For example, an IUD 4 cm below the internal os could be in position B (inside the cervix) for a patient with a 5 cm cervix, or for a patient with a 3 cm cervix, the IUD could be in position C, extending outside the external os.

On ultrasound imaging, the relationship of the bottom of the IUD and the internal os is easily identified by anyone experienced in sonography (figure 3). The difference between classification A and B is defined simply by that relationship. If it is above the internal os it is A (A bove), and if it is below, it is B (B elow). If it is seen through the cervix (you can 'C' it) it is C, and if it is not seen at all it is D (D isappeared). We observed excellent correlation between hysterosalpingography and ultrasonography findings, suggesting that the classification can be made based on ultrasound imaging alone.

### Comparison between the traditional non-guided and a novel ultrasound-guided technique for office fitting of intrauterine contraceptive devices [^113Dby27]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate a novel method for in-office fitting of intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCDs) by comparing it to the traditional non-guided technique.

Methods

A prospective cohort study comparing the application of intrauterine contraceptives was conducted between January 1, 2013 and January 31, 2015 at a university contraception clinic, in Alexandria, Egypt. Patients aged 20-45years who were parous, had previously undergone vaginal or abdominal deliveries, and were requesting device insertion were included. Patients were randomly assigned to have devices fitted using the non-guided approach, with vaginal ultrasonography to plan and confirm device placement, or by the abdominal ultrasonography-guided technique. The primary outcomes were successful IUCD insertion and ideal device position 1week after insertion. Participants, counselors, and data analysts were masked to treatment assignments.

Results

Analyses included 40 patients in each treatment arm. Successful fitting was achieved in 32 (80%) patients in the non-guided arm and 39 (98%) patients in the ultrasonography-guided arm (P = 0.04). Ideal placement was achieved in 38 (95%) patients in the ultrasonography-guided arm compared with 27 (68%) patients in the non-guided arm (P = 0.02).

Conclusion

Ultrasonography-guided IUCD insertion demonstrated improved success and fitting accuracy in comparison with a traditional, non-guided approach. ANZCTR trial ID: ACTRN12615000526572.

### Sonographic appearances of Chinese intrauterine devices [^113KRqeV]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this presentation is to familiarize physicians about the different types of intrauterine devices (IUDs) used in China.

Methods

The characteristic features and the sonographic appearances of the different types of IUDs commonly used in China are described.

Results

The stainless steel ring is the most commonly used IUD in China. However, various different types of copper-bearing IUDs are gaining popularity. Most Chinese IUDs do not have an attached thread and are more difficult to remove than the IUDs commonly used in North America. Also, most Chinese IUDs have a distinct sonographic appearance; therefore, sonography can play an important role when assessing a woman who has a retained Chinese IUD or has a complication associated with the IUD.

Conclusions

Knowledge about the different types of Chinese IUDs will enable physicians to provide optimal care to their patients.

### A proposed classification for intrauterine device position: the tal-reeves classification [^112myN4q]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2022). High credibility.

Similarly, extension of the arms of an IUD into the myometrium (commonly referred to as 'embedment') has been associated with pain and bleeding. Thus it is important to capture intramural extension of IUD arms in a classification of IUD position. Currently, this imaging feature is not routinely used as part of the imaging description of the position of IUDs.

We developed this classification system over the course of a randomised study of two copper IUDs. In one arm of this study, we performed transvaginal ultrasonography and hysterosalpingography before and after each insertion of 99 copper T-shaped IUDs (T380S). At 3-month intervals over the first year, we performed transvaginal ultrasonography and, if ultrasonography was not clearly normal, we also performed hysterosalpingography. During the course of the study we observed a substantial number of participants with partial expulsion and intramural extension of the arms, leading to the development of this classification system. However, as this classification system developed through discussion over the course of the study, we did not classify IUD position prospectively to allow correlation with symptoms.

### The shadow of the intrauterine device [^111oBKdE]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

An intrauterine device (IUD) is a highly effective and prevalent form of birth control with a low failure rate. It is not without complications, including irregular bleeding and pelvic pain, perforation, expulsion, and pregnancy. Investigation of the symptomatic patient and routine follow-up of asymptomatic women with IUDs include transvaginal ultrasonography to rule out IUD malposition and other complications. Three-dimensional ultrasonography (3DUS) has been shown to have added value in imaging the pelvic organs, including the uterus. However, even with 3DUS, the operator may encounter difficulty in imaging the IUD in its entirety, because of variability in both echogenicity and exact location.

Methods

More than 30 women undergoing IUD placement evaluation, including routine examinations and cases of suspected pregnancy, irregular bleeding, infection, and pelvic pain, were evaluated with 3DUS and volume contrast imaging in the C plane (VCI-C), which visualized acoustic shadows of the IUDs, facilitating identification of the intrauterine position and type of the device.

Results

Four examples are presented from women undergoing evaluation of IUD placement in whom 2-dimensional ultrasonography failed to visualize the device satisfactorily. Volume contrast imaging in the C plane allowed visualization of the acoustic shadows of the IUDs, thereby providing more exact imaging of the type of device as well as aiding in locating the IUD. In a woman with irregular bleeding, a bicornuate uterus with pregnancy in 1 horn and a bowed T-type IUD in the contralateral horn were diagnosed with VCI-C.

Conclusions

We conclude from these shadow images that VCI-C is a useful modality in cases of difficult visualization of the IUD; VCI-C visualization of the acoustic shadow of the IUD may provide an adjunctive approach.

### Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a new low-dose copper and nitinol intrauterine device: phase 2 data to 36 months [^115mJVMh]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

The study sponsor trained and certified each of the investigators, limited to two per site, in insertion technique. Placement occurred any cycle day consistent with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Placement technique employed tenaculum placement, sounding, and prescribed placement of the study IUD as directed by the study sponsor (Sebela Pharmaceuticals, Inc). All site investigators performing IUD placements received one-on-one training and direct observation by a single expert in use of the IUD inserter. Site clinical investigators used cervical dilation and pain medication at their discretion and confirmed IUD placement by transvaginal ultrasound scan immediately after placement. Site principal investigators made management decisions based on ultrasound findings independently or in conjunction with a central ultrasound reader if needed. If the initial placement attempt failed, a second attempt could be performed within 7 days. Participants reported baseline bleeding information. A research assistant assessed pain at IUD placement using a 5-point Likert scale (no pain, some pain, painful, moderately painful, and very painful). Investigators rated IUD ease of placement as very easy, easy, neither easy or hard, hard, or very hard.

### Risks of uterine perforation and expulsion associated with intrauterine devices [^114mLDYy]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

The information presented here can assist the clinician in counseling patients about individual risks during preprocedure counseling and facilitate shared decision making. Timing of IUD placement and methods to reduce the risk of uterine perforation can be considered. Ultrasound guidance may be helpful for IUD placement in postpartum and breastfeeding individuals but has not been evaluated nor demonstrated to mitigate risk; additional studies are needed to make evidence-based recommendations. Health care professional experience is an important factor that may moderate outcomes; we controlled for health care professional experience in these analyses. Patients should be counseled about signs that may suggest potential perforation (eg, pelvic pain, severe cramps, strings unable to be palpated). Under conditions in which IUD expulsion rates are relatively higher (immediate postpartum IUD placement, heavy menstrual bleeding), having a low threshold for scheduling a follow-up visit to ensure the IUD is in place may also be considered. To prevent unplanned pregnancies with unrecognized expulsion, patients should be counseled about the risk of IUD expulsion and informed of signs of expulsion (eg, device felt in the vagina, change in cramping or bleeding pattern, strings unable to be palpated) and the need for IUD replacement or alternate form of contraception in the event of an expulsion. Health care professionals and patients should weigh the elevated risks in the postpartum period against known contraceptive benefits and the convenience of early insertion.

Strengths of the findings from APEX-IUD include the largest and most demographically diverse cohort with more than 1 year of follow-up reported to date, minimal missing data, and control for more than 20 confounding factors. Some limitations are noted, however. Given the use of retrospective data and the observational design, there was no protocol-specified plan for the timing of follow-up; the timing of IUD-related perforation and IUD expulsion reflect the dates of diagnosis and not necessarily the time of the outcomes themselves, and some perforation and expulsion outcomes were recognized only at the time of IUD removal. In particular, outcomes for patients who are undergoing an IUD insertion within 1 year postpartum may be subject to surveillance bias, because perforation or expulsion outcomes may have been recognized because of more frequent contact with health care professionals during this time. The study data were subject to potential misclassification of the outcomes and risk factors, unmeasured confounding, and loss to follow-up. There were relatively small numbers in the 0-to-3-day postpartum group, diminishing the precision of estimates.

### Pain management for in-office uterine and cervical procedures: ACOG clinical consensus no. 9 [^113temPA]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

Intrauterine device (IUD) insertion — analgesic and adjunct options: Local anesthetic agents, specifically lidocaine, are supported for pain management with IUD insertion and are favored over other interventions such as misoprostol; studies show increased pain and adverse effects with misoprostol. Preprocedural nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not effective for reducing pain at the time of insertion, though small studies comparing 50 mg oral tramadol with 550 mg oral naproxen are conflicting, and oral NSAIDs such as ibuprofen may reduce postprocedural pain. Evidence is insufficient to recommend inhaled nitrous oxide (N2O) for insertion pain, although recipients reported greater likelihood of recommending IUD placement. Nonpharmacologic data are limited; compared with blind insertion, ultrasound guidance was effective at reducing pain scores, procedure time, and complications with better patient satisfaction but requires equipment and skilled assistance, and a small randomized trial of acupuncture before insertion demonstrated lower postprocedure pain. Evidence on preprocedural anxiolytics is lacking, and additional research is needed on intravenous sedation. Data are lacking for pain-mitigation recommendations for IUD removal.

### A pilot clinical trial of ultrasound-guided postplacental insertion of a levonorgestrel intrauterine device [^112esmgF]. Contraception (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Postplacental intrauterine device (IUD) insertion is a safe, convenient and effective option for postpartum contraception. Few studies involve ultrasound-guided insertion, and none involve the levonorgestrel IUD or take place in the United States.

Study Design

The study was conducted to assess the safety and feasibility of ultrasound-guided postplacental insertion of the levonorgestrel IUD following vaginal delivery in a U.S. residency program. Levonorgestrel IUDs were inserted under ultrasound guidance within 10 min of placental delivery by hand or using ring forceps. Subjects were examined at 4 and 10 weeks postpartum for evidence of expulsion or infection.

Results

Thirty-four subjects were enrolled and 20 received an IUD. Follow-up data are available for 19 subjects over the 10-week follow-up period; 16 subjects returned for the 4-week follow-up, and 14 returned at 10 weeks. Two additional subjects could be contacted by telephone only. At 4 and 10 weeks postpartum, no subjects had evidence of infection. There were two expulsions (2/19, 10.5%) by 10 weeks postpartum. None of the subjects examined had a partial expulsion (intracervical location of the IUD).

Conclusions

In this pilot study, ultrasound-guided postplacental insertion of the levonorgestrel IUD was feasible and not associated with infection. The risk of expulsion was acceptable. Ultrasound-guided postplacental insertion of the levonorgestrel IUD may be an alternative to delayed insertion but warrants further study.

### Missing IUD and utilization of fluoroscopy for management: a case report [^111KaECz]. Contraception (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

A missing intrauterine device (IUD) poses challenges in diagnosis and treatment. Extrauterine placement of IUDs may cause difficulty in localization. We report a case where use of fluoroscopy just prior to laparoscopic intervention to remove the missing IUD was beneficial.

Case

This case report involves a 35-year-old woman who was diagnosed with a missing thread 2 years after insertion of a levonorgestrel IUD (Mirena). Initial diagnostic workup consisting of abdominal X-ray, an ultrasound and diagnostic laparoscopy failed to localize the IUD. We performed an office pelvic ultrasound which confirmed that an IUD was present but could not specifically localize the IUD in the pelvic or abdominal cavity. Hence, we utilized fluoroscopy just prior to laparoscopy to localize and remove the missing device and allow its removal.

Conclusion

Various imaging modalities aid in detecting a missing IUD, but proper selection of fluoroscopy helped to localize extrauterine placement of an IUD device. We suggest that utilization of this imaging method just prior to laparoscopy may be of value in selected cases.

### Utilisation, effectiveness, and safety of immediate postpartum intrauterine device insertion: a systematic literature review [^117DCGu7]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2023). High credibility.

Our findings suggest that increasing time from PPIUD insertion is associated with a decrease in PPIUD prevalence, although long-term follow-up data were limited. Nonetheless, reported pregnancies across studies were very low. A limitation to the effectiveness information is the sparse availability of published data out to 18 months. Whether an IUD was not in place due to expulsion or voluntarily removal was inconsistently reported. In lower-income countries, the most common reason for IUD removal was inclination to other methods. The occurrence of IUD expulsions varied widely across studies; however, the timing of expulsions was consistently primarily in the early postpartum period. In one trial, the mean time to expulsion was 12.6 days. In another trial, all expulsions occurred by 3 months post-insertion. In a prospective cohort study, median time to expulsion was 4.1 weeks. Another observational prospective study found that 86% of expulsions occurred within 6 weeks. In one study, 88% of women with expulsions requested re-insertion.

A limitation in some studies was conducting follow-up appointments via the phone, and, in some cases, ultrasounds were not routinely offered unless there were symptoms indicative of expulsion or misplacement. Consequently, continuation of IUD use over time may not be accurately reported, and expulsions may be under-recognised and under-recorded. A Cochrane review of RCTs did not find evidence supporting a significant difference in expulsion rates based on timing of insertion. Likewise, in a recent SLR and meta-analysis including observational and interventional studies, there was no significant difference in expulsions between IUDs placed from > 10 min to < 72 hours versus > 4 weeks post-delivery, although IUD placement ≤ 10 min was associated with a significantly increased risk of expulsion versus > 4 weeks. A recent estimate suggested immediate insertion would prevent an additional 88 UIPs per 1000 women over 2 years compared with routine placement. Thus, the benefit of earlier insertion likely outweighs a potential small increased expulsion risk. Additional evidence points to a variety of factors that may affect expulsion risk, including the device type, delivery mode, age, parity, and provider experience.

### Failed IUD insertions in community practice: an under-recognized problem? [^114CdzSW]. Contraception (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The data analysis was conducted to describe the rate of unsuccessful copper T380A intrauterine device (IUD) insertions among women using the IUD for emergency contraception (EC) at community family planning clinics in Utah.

Methods

These data were obtained from a prospective observational trial of women choosing the copper T380A IUD for EC. Insertions were performed by nurse practitioners at two family planning clinics in order to generalize findings to the type of service setting most likely to employ this intervention. Adjuvant measures to facilitate difficult IUD insertions (cervical anesthesia, dilation, pain medication, and use of ultrasound guidance) were not utilized. The effect of parity on IUD insertion success was determined using exact logistic regression models adjusted for individual practitioner failure rates.

Results

Six providers performed 197 IUD insertion attempts. These providers had a mean of 14.1 years of experience (range 1–27, S.D. ± 12.5). Among nulliparous women, 27 of 138 (19.6%) IUD insertions were unsuccessful. In parous women, 8 of 59 IUD insertions were unsuccessful (13.6%). The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) showed that IUD insertion failure was more likely in nulliparous women compared to parous women (aOR = 2.31, 95% CI 0.90–6.52, p = .09).

Conclusion

The high rate of unsuccessful IUD insertions reported here, particularly for nulliparous women, suggests that the true insertion failure rate of providers who are not employing additional tools for difficult insertions may be much higher than reported in clinical trials. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this is a common problem and, if so, to assess if the use of adjuvant measures will reduce the number of unsuccessful IUD insertions.

### Immediate versus delayed insertion of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device following dilation and evacuation: a randomized controlled trial [^115ZVaDv]. Contraception (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The study was conducted to compare 6-month usage of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (LNG-IUD) when placed immediately or 3 to 6 weeks after dilation and evacuation (D&E) procedure.

Study Design

We enrolled women undergoing D&E at 15 to 23 weeks of gestation. After completion of the D&E, subjects without contraindications to immediate IUD insertion were randomized to immediate or delayed (3 to 6 weeks later) LNG-IUD insertion. Subjects in the immediate group had the LNG-IUD placed using ultrasound guidance. All subjects returned at 3 to 6 weeks and 8 to 10 weeks after D&E and were contacted by phone at 6 months.

Results

Of the 93 subjects enrolled, 88 were randomized. All 44 subjects (100%) randomized to immediate insertion had successful IUD placement, while only 20 (45.5%) of the 44 subjects randomized to delayed insertion returned for IUD placement, all of which were successful [difference 54.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 39.8%-69.3%]. Seventeen (38.6%) participants in each group were lost to follow-up. Of subjects contacted at the 6-month follow-up phone call, 23 of 27 women (85.2%) and 17 of 27 women (62.9%) were utilizing the LNG-IUD in the immediate and delayed groups, respectively (difference 22.2%, 95% CI -0.4% to 44.8%). Intrauterine device expulsion occurred in three subjects (6.8%) and one subject (5.0%) in whom the IUD was placed in the immediate and delayed groups, respectively (p = 1.0). No significant adverse events occurred.

Conclusion

Significantly more participants had the LNG-IUD placed in the immediate insertion group compared with the delayed insertion group. Given the low risk of complications, immediate post-D&E insertion of the LNG-IUD should be offered, especially for populations that may have difficulty returning for follow-up.

### Continuation rates of two different-sized copper intrauterine devices among nulliparous women: interim 12-month results of a single-blind, randomised, multicentre trial [^1175ZxUo]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

We recruited healthy participants seeking contraception who were aged 16–40 years, non-pregnant, sexually active with a male partner, had regular menstrual cycles (21–35 days when not using hormones), and were willing to use only the study IUD for contraception. We limited parous enrollment to a maximum of 20%, to better evaluate the product in a nulliparous population. We excluded participants with the following characteristics: currently pregnant, intention to become pregnant within 37 months, known infertility of patient or partner, history of allergy or sensitivity to copper, use of injectable contraception in the last 9 months without two spontaneous menses, within 30 days of abortion/delivery, and medical contraindications. The full inclusion/exclusion criteria are listed in the online appendix.

At screening, we collected medical history, demographic data (age, parity, level of education, race/ethnicity, marital status), previous contraceptive use, and other data. In most situations, eligible participants enrolled (had IUD placement) at screening. Clinicians attempted IUD placement if the uterus sounded to at least 55mm; if placement was not successful after two attempts, the participant was discontinued.

Participants returned for clinic visits at 6 weeks and 3, 6 and 12 months; at 9 months, we collected key information from participants via phone. At clinic visits we conducted string checks to confirm IUD placement. Site staff entered data into the proprietary electronic data capture system, which ran background logic and consistency checks. Additional logic and consistency checks were performed with statistical software and queries were written to ensure accuracy of data. Verification of entered data was done to ensure data entry matched the source documents. The sponsor's study clinicians conducted blinded review of adverse events from all sites and provided standardized coding for regulatory purposes. Site clinicians performed ultrasonography for missing strings or if clinically indicated. Clinicians recorded a primary reason for IUD discontinuation and any additional contributing reasons for early removal. At clinic/phone visits, we asked participants: "How satisfied are you with the study device?" and "Would you recommend this IUD to others?" Participants also recorded responses to these questions on a diary at 6-days post-IUD placement.

Immediate postabortion intrauterine device (IUD) insertion — perforation risk and contraindications — has a very low absolute risk of perforation with no perforations reported in studies comparing immediate versus delayed insertion after abortion, ultrasound guidance may further minimize risk, and postabortion IUD insertion should be avoided in septic abortion (GRADE 1C); it is also reasonable to defer insertion after surgical complications such as uterine perforation, atony, or heavy bleeding, as these may be exacerbated, and ongoing atony or heavy bleeding may increase expulsion risk or necessitate IUD removal in the setting of reaspiration.

### Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a new low-dose copper and nitinol intrauterine device: phase 2 data to 36 months [^116SVrRH]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

We informed participants requesting IUD discontinuation of the need to use an alternative method of contraception for 2 weeks after removal and provided a package of progestin-only birth control pills if desired. We followed those requesting IUD removal for desire of pregnancy with monthly phone contact for 6 months. At the 52-week visit, an investigator assessed IUD placement by transvaginal ultrasound examination and offered participants continued use of the IUD until 3 years with end of 28-day cycle contacts and in-person follow-up every 6 months. Participants extending use beyond 1 year did not systematically collect diary data. Discontinuation visits occurred when participants desired discontinuation, or reported an expulsion or pregnancy. We defined expulsion as partial or complete, with the study device moving respectively part way into the vagina or all the way out of the body.

We chose the sample size to provide an estimate on pregnancy and adverse effects consistent with the goals of an FDA phase 2 study. The primary outcome measure was effectiveness, evaluated as the pregnancy rate at 12 months measured by the Pearl Index. We also assessed pregnancy rates by life-table analysis and assessed pregnancy rates by both methods annually up to 3 years. Secondary outcomes included rates of placement success, expulsion, discontinuation rates, reason for discontinuation, adverse events, serious adverse events, and bleeding and spotting patterns. A medical monitor conducted monthly reviews assessing safety concerns and pregnancies. Formation of a clinical events committee was planned if there was more than one pregnancy in the first 12 months of use among all participants. The evaluable for pregnancy population included those 18–35 years of age at enrollment, with at least one report of pregnancy status after enrollment, having at least one cycle with intercourse reported without use of any other contraceptive method, or became pregnant with the IUD in place.

Investigators at each study site assessed adverse event severity and their relationship to IUD use. We employed the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities in reporting adverse events in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. Statisticians conducted analyses using SAS 9.4.

### Safe and cost-effective ultrasound guided removal of retained intrauterine device: our experience [^115n9Toc]. Contraception (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and difference in cost of ultrasound guided removal of retained intrauterine device (IUD).

Study Design

A total of 23 women underwent ultrasound-guided retrieval of retained IUDs between January 2013 and March 2014. Transvaginal ultrasound was performed in all cases to assess the localization of the IUD. Under transabdominal ultrasound guidance, either the crochet type IUD hook (Gyneas, Goussainville, France) or Alligator forceps were used to grasp the IUD and remove it from the uterine cavity. The costs of the ultrasound guided procedure and the hysteroscopic removal of the IUD were compared.

Results

Twenty-three patients who failed IUD removal in the clinic were referred to our department for ultrasound-guided removal. All patients had an IUD present in the uterine cavity. Eleven patients had Paragard IUDs (48%), eight had Mirena IUDs (35%), three had Lippes loop (13%), and one had a ring IUD (4%). The patients' ages ranged from 20–56 years. The IUDs were in place for 8 months to 23 years. Of the 23 patients with retained IUDs, 19 were successfully removed (83%), and 4 underwent hysteroscopic removal of IUD. The IUD removal cost in the operating room on average was $3562 US dollars and the cost of ultrasound-guided removal was $465 US dollars.

Conclusions

Retained intrauterine devices with or without strings can often be safely removed in an office-based setting under ultrasound guidance at less cost than in the operating room, even in cases with embedded IUDs.

Implications

Our experience leads us to propose in-office IUD removal under ultrasound guidance as the first line in management of retained IUDs after failed removal by conventional practices. Ultrasound provides numerous advantages including direct visualization in a less invasive manner than hysteroscopy. Three-dimensional imaging can also be used for enhanced perspective.

### Levonorgestrel 52 mg intrauterine device placement without uterine sounding: a feasibility study [^111j5Uff]. Contraception (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate feasibility of levonorgestrel 52 mg intrauterine device (IUD) placement without uterine sounding.

Study Design

We performed a three-phase feasibility study from February 2023-May 2024. In phase one, participants had levonorgestrel 52 mg IUD placement with sounding. In the experimental phases, placement occurred without sounding and with (phase two) or without (phase three) concurrent transabdominal sonography and participants had 3-month follow-up. We defined feasibility as successful IUD placement without uterine sounding based on ultrasound confirmation. We measured total instrumentation time from the sound or inserter touching the cervix to inserter removal. Participants reported maximal pain experienced using a 100-mm Visual Analog Scale when the inserter was removed. We calculated a sample size of 30 per phase so that if there was one failed placement, the lower 95% confidence interval of the successful placement rate would be no less than 90.0%.

Results

Successful placement without sounding occurred in 30(100%) participants in phase two and 28(93.3%) in phase three. Median instrumentation was longest in phase one (49.5 [interquartile range (IQR) 42.3–55.0] seconds) compared to phases two (16.0 [IQR12.0–28.0] seconds, p < 0.0001) and three (25.0 [IQR 18.5–32.2] seconds, p < 0.0001). Participants' median placement pain was 21.0 (IQR 10.3–32.8) mm in phase one with no difference in phase two (25.5 [IQR 14.3–47.0] mm, p = 0.35), but was higher in phase three (36.0 [IQR 22.8, 61.0] mm, p = 0.01).

Conclusions

Levonorgestrel 52 mg IUD placement without sounding is feasible with concurrent sonography. Placement without sounding results in shorter instrumentation time but does not decrease maximum placement pain.

### Levonorgestrel intrauterine device placement in uterine anomalies: a case series [^114bJ1Ae]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Levonorgestrel intrauterine devices (IUDs) provide effective contraception and medical benefits. They are safe for even severely medically complex patients. The CDC Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) states that IUDs are category 4 for people with uterine cavity distortions; however, there are previous case reports of their successful use in this population.

Cases

We present 5 cases of IUD use in uterine anomalies utilizing ultrasound or hysteroscopy for intra-cavitary placement confirmation. With up to 4.5 years of follow-up, our expulsion rate is 40%. In those whose IUDs were expelled, the expulsion happened within 4 weeks of placement.

Conclusion

IUD use in uterine anomalies is possible and generally safe, but the expulsion rate is high. Early IUD expulsion within 4 weeks of placement could indicate an undiagnosed uterine anomaly.

Pregnancy assessment — pregnancy checklist diagnostic accuracy and IUD placement when pregnancy status is uncertain: A systematic review identified four analyses of data from three diagnostic accuracy studies comparing a pregnancy checklist with a concurrent urine pregnancy test; reported sensitivity was 55%–100% and specificity 39%–89%, and the negative predictive value was 99%–100%. For patients who want to begin using an intrauterine device (IUD) when the health care provider is uncertain whether the patient is pregnant, the patient should be provided with another contraceptive method until the provider is reasonably certain they are not pregnant and can place the IUD.

### Contraception with levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system versus copper intrauterine device: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116ht8HC]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Our analysis had several limitations. First, there were significant differences in the definitions and diagnoses of some outcomes. For instance, assuming "complete" expulsion of intrauterine devices may have overestimated expulsion rates. Second, combining all types of IUDs, including experimental ones, in the analysis might introduce confusion, potentially limiting the generalizability of the reported results for IUDs. Additionally, there was limited research comparing LNG-IUDs with 13.5 mg and 19.5 mg levonorgestrel doses to Cu-IUDs with different surface areas, making it difficult to explore the differences between low-dose LNG-IUDs and Cu-IUDs. This limited our ability to make conclusive statements on these aspects, and more high-quality studies are needed for a more comprehensive data synthesis in the future. Third, incomplete reporting in some studies, including device types, insertion times, and participant characteristics, hindered a thorough analysis of heterogeneity sources. Fourth, few studies reported non-termination side effects, potentially leading to underestimation. Fifth, we were unable to adjust for potential confounders that were inconsistently reported, such as provider training and experience, ultrasound use, and insertion techniques. Sixth, the limited number of included studies restricted our exploration of the highly heterogeneous results. Lastly, in our study, 60% of the included research had follow-up periods of one year or less, which is insufficient to comprehensively assess the long-term efficacy and safety of intrauterine devices (IUDs). Certain adverse reactions may only become apparent with prolonged use. Therefore, our findings provide limited evidence for comparing the long-term effects of these two types of IUDs, and we recommended cautious interpretation of these results in clinical practice. We emphasized the need for more long-term follow-up studies to thoroughly evaluate the efficacy and safety of both types of IUDs, thereby addressing the existing gaps in the current literature.

### Assessment of a simplified insertion technique for intrauterine devices [^113UbeUG]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To explore a simplified technique for intrauterine device (IUD) insertion.

Methods

The present prospective longitudinal study enrolled patients aged at least 18years presenting at the gynecology clinic of Stanford University for IUD insertion between June 1, 2013 and June 30, 2014. No pelvic examination or uterine sounding was performed prior to IUD insertion. Transvaginal ultrasonography was performed immediately after insertion and at 4-6weeks to confirm device placement. The primary outcome was successful IUD placement.

Results

The study enrolled 50 patients. IUD insertion was completed successfully without any cervical manipulation in 40 (80%) participants. Sounding was not needed for any procedures. A cervical dilator was required to locate the internal os for 10 (20%) patients. The mean distance between IUDs and the endometrial verge immediately following insertion was 2.9mm. IUD insertion was rated "difficult" by the physician performing the procedure in 3 (6%) patients. No perforations were recorded. IUD expulsion occurred in 3 (6%) patients; menorrhagia was the indication for IUD insertion in two of these patients.

Conclusion

IUD insertion without prior pelvic examination and sounding was feasible; this technique could reduce the need for instrument use during insertion and, consequently, the pain associated with insertion.

### Imaging of intrauterine contraceptive devices [^1147ikWe]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUDs) are reemerging as common methods of birth control in the United States. Imaging, especially sonography, has an important role in their evaluation. This review illustrates the normal and abnormal imaging appearances of IUDs.

Methods

We describe and illustrate the appearance of different types of IUDs on different imaging modalities as well as radiologically relevant complications associated with IUDs.

Results

On sonography, the IUD should be visualized as centrally located within the endometrial cavity, with the crossbar (if present) in the fundal portion of the endometrial cavity. Some older patients have IUDs in place that are no longer commonly used, such as the Lippes Loop (Ortho Pharmaceutical, Raritan, NJ) and Saf-T-Coil (Julius Schmid Laboratories, Little Falls, NJ), which have a pathognomonic appearance. Newer IUDs, such as the early version of the Mirena IUD (Leiras Oy, Turku, Finland), may be difficult to visualize on sonography. Patients from China frequently have a ring-shaped IUD. Sonography is important in assessing the complications of IUDs, including a low position, associated infection, myometrial migration, uterine perforation, intrauterine or extrauterine pregnancy associated with the IUD, and retention and fragmentation of the IUD. If an IUD is known to be present but not visualized sonographically, plain radiography is helpful in assessing the location. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are not typically used to assess IUDs, but the appearances of IUDs should be recognized with these modalities.

Conclusions

Imaging, specifically sonography, has a crucial role in the evaluation and management of IUDs and associated complications.

### Factors associated with low-lying intrauterine devices: a cross-sectional ultrasound study in a cohort of African-American women [^1127RSZD]. Contraception (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The object of this study is to examine factors and symptoms associated with low-lying IUDs as defined by ultrasound.

Study Design

This is a cross-sectional sub-study of participants in the Study of Environment, Life-style, and Fibroids (SELF). SELF participants had screening ultrasounds for fibroids at study enrollment; those with an IUD in place are included in this sub-study. Low-lying IUDs were identified and localized. Logistic regression was used to identify factors and symptoms associated with low-lying IUDs.

Results

Among 168 women with IUDs at ultrasound, 28 (17%) had a low-lying IUD. Having a low-lying IUD was associated with low education level (≤ high school: aOR 3.1 95% CI 1.14–8.55) and with increased BMI (p = .002). Women with a low-lying IUD were more likely to report a "big problem" with dysmenorrhea (the highest option of the Likert scale) as compared to women with a normally-positioned IUD (OR 3.2 95% CI 1.07–9.54).

Conclusion

Our study found that women with a low-lying IUD are more likely to be of lower education and higher BMI, and to report more dysmenorrhea.

Implications

Women who are obese may benefit from additional counseling and closer follow-up after IUD placement. Future research is warranted to investigate IUD placement and possible IUD migration among women who are obese.

### Contraindications to IUD and IUS use [^111n3moG]. Contraception (2007). Low credibility.

Contraindications to IUD or IUS use can be found on product labeling, in the guidelines of various specialty groups and in recommendations from peer-reviewed articles. Overly restrictive contraindications block access to this top-tier method for many women who would be candidates based on current scientific evidence. Assuming that a condition should be listed as a contraindication only if the risk of IUD/IUS use by a woman with that condition exceeds her risk with pregnancy, the list of contraindications is reduced to pregnancy, active uterine infection, malignancy in the uterus or cervix, an inability to place or retain the device, unexplained abnormal bleeding and adverse reaction to product ingredients.

### Levonorgestrel (mirena) [^111L55WK]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Important information to consider during or after insertion

If you suspect that Mirena is not in the correct position, check placement (for example, using transvaginal ultrasound). Remove Mirena if it is not positioned completely within the uterus. Do not reinsert a removed Mirena.
If there is clinical concern, exceptional pain or bleeding during or after insertion, take appropriate steps (such as physical examination and ultrasound) immediately to exclude perforation.

2.3 Patient Follow-up

Reexamine and evaluate patients 4 to 6 weeks after insertion and once a year thereafter, or more frequently if clinically indicated.

### Exploring the role of 3D transabdominal pelvic ultrasound: a pictorial review [^113zUu1T]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Transabdominal pelvic ultrasound plays a pivotal role in the evaluation of pediatric gynecologic pathology, such as Müllerian anomalies and intrauterine device (IUD) malposition. The diagnostic value of this examination can be significantly increased by adding three-dimensional (3D) images, which offer true coronal reconstructions and enhance anatomic detail. Increasing the yield of the examination has the potential to spare the patient discomfort, time, and/or cost. This pictorial essay explores the applications of this widely available, but underutilized, tool while providing embryologic context and pathologic background for some of the most consequential diagnoses radiologists must recognize.

### Malpositioned intrauterine contraceptive devices: risk factors, outcomes, and future pregnancies [^115X4EB4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess possible risk factors, management, and outcomes for women with malpositioned intrauterine contraception devices (IUDs).

Methods

This retrospective case-control study compared 182 women with malpositioned IUDs shown by ultrasonography at a single institution from 2003 to 2008 with 182 women with properly positioned IUDs. We evaluated whether insertion at 6–9 weeks postpartum, postabortion placement, breastfeeding, type of IUD, pregnancy history, leiomyomas, suspected adenomyosis, and indication for placement were associated with malpositioning. Our study had 70–99% power to detect whether postpartum placement was associated with an odds ratio (OR) of 2–3.

Results

Malpositioned devices were noted on 10.4% of ultrasonography scans among women with IUDs having pelvic ultrasonography for any indication. Most malpositioned devices (73.1%) were noted to be in the lower uterine segment or cervix. Insertion of IUDs at 6–9 weeks postpartum was not associated with malpositioning (OR 1.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81–2.63). Among other possible risk factors examined, suspected adenomyosis was associated with IUD malpositioning (OR 3.04, 95% CI 1.08–8.52), whereas prior vaginal delivery (OR 0.53 95% CI 0.32–0.87) and private insurance (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.24–0.59) were protective. Approximately two-thirds (66.5%) of malpositioned devices were removed by health care providers. There were more pregnancies within 2 years among those in the case group than those in the control group (19.2% compared with 10.5%, P = 0.046). All pregnancies were the result of IUD expulsion or removal, and none occurred with a malpositioned IUD known to be in situ.

Conclusion

Malpositioning of IUDs does not appear to be associated with insertion at 6–9 weeks postpartum. Women with malpositioned IUDs are more likely to become pregnant because of IUD removal without initiation of another highly effective contraceptive method.

### Committee opinion No 672: clinical challenges of long-acting reversible contraceptive methods [^113mzSLg]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Intrauterine devices — management of nonvisualized intrauterine device (IUD) strings includes cytobrush sweep, pregnancy exclusion, and imaging with an explicit algorithm. An endocervical cytobrush sometimes can retrieve strings by simply sweeping them from the cervical canal, and in one study, 1.2% of women whose IUD strings could not be visualized had confirmed expulsion. When IUD strings are not visualized, pregnancy should be excluded and a backup method of contraception and emergency oral contraceptives (if appropriate) should be recommended until the IUD is confirmed to be properly located in the endometrial cavity; if correct intrauterine location is confirmed by ultrasonography, the IUD can be relied on for contraception. The flowchart specifies: "Strings visualized after sweeping cervical canal with cytobrush" leads to routine care, while if not, "Rule out pregnancy; offer EC [emergency contraception], if indicated; use backup method until IUD confirmed in uterus" and "Obtain pelvic ultrasonography". If "IUD visualized in uterus", provide "Routine care" with "No further confirmatory ultrasonographies needed"; if not, "Obtain X-ray of abdomen and pelvis (costal margin to symphysis)". If "IUD not visualized on X-ray:" then "Diagnosis: IUD expelled" and "Contraception counseling"; if "IUD visualized on X-ray:" then "Proceed with laparoscopic removal" and "Consider replacement under direct laparoscopic guidance, if the patient desires".

### Transvaginal ultrasonographic assessment of the expulsion rate of intrauterine devices inserted in the immediate postpartum period: a pilot study [^115rfZ59]. Contraception (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the expulsion rates of intrauterine devices (IUDs) inserted in the immediate postpartum after vaginal birth and cesarean section.

Methods

Nineteen patients who had a vaginal birth and 19 patients who had a cesarean section at Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, Brazil, were selected for copper T 380A IUD insertion. With the aim of detecting clinically unnoticed dislodged devices, ultrasound examinations were performed at 1 month and between 3 and 12 months after delivery. The IUDs were considered completely expelled when found outside the endometrial cavity (e.g., in the cervical canal) or outside the uterus (in the vagina).

Results

Expulsion rates were statistically different between the two groups: after a vaginal birth, 50% (ultrasound only) + 27.8% (clinical examination); and post-cesarean section, 0% (p < .001; OR 5.75, 95% CI 2.36–14.01).

Conclusion

Considering that the contraceptive efficacy of IUDs is associated with their intrauterine location, the high expulsion rates seen when they are inserted immediately after vaginal delivery contraindicate their use in this setting. The use of IUDs immediately after a cesarean section is still a reasonable alternative because its expulsion rate was zero. Ultrasound assessment of IUD positioning performed better than clinical examination, which failed to detect expulsion after postpartum insertion in 75% of the cases (9 from 12 cases).

### Uterine structural abnormality and intrauterine device malposition: analysis of ultrasonographic and demographic variables of 517 patients [^114VV2YZ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Intrauterine devices are currently one of the leading forms of reversible contraception in the world. However, in approximately 10–25% of women, intrauterine devices can become malpositioned, leading to consequences including pain, bleeding, as well as possible decreased contraceptive efficacy.

Objective

We sought to determine whether certain reproductive and uterine characteristics are associated with an increased risk of intrauterine device malposition. We hypothesized that anatomical characteristics such as the presence of any uterine anomalies, particularly congenital anomalies and fibroids that may lead to cavitary distortion, would be associated with a higher incidence of intrauterine device malposition.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a retrospective case-control study in an academic medical center. All patients presenting for scheduled ultrasound appointments for gynecologic indication between June 2004 and February 2016 were included (1,253 ultrasound reports identified). Of these, 236 demonstrated malpositioned intrauterine devices. With a control group of 281 patients with normal intrauterine device location, a total of 517 patients were included in the study. Transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasounds were performed followed by 3-dimensional rendering (as per our institution's protocol for patients with intrauterine devices) using Voluson 730 and Voluson E8 ultrasound machines. Demographic and reproductive characteristics, indication for ultrasound, intrauterine device, and uterine characteristics were all extrapolated from the electronic medical record. χ² Tests were performed for categorical variables. Generalized linear models for Poisson distributed variables, and multiple logistic regression were used to ascertain significant independent predictors of IUD malposition. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals and effect sizes were calculated, and P < .05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

In this study, we found a cumulative IUD malposition rate of 19%. In patients with malpositioned intrauterine devices, there was increased incidence of retroflexed uterine positions (7.6% vs 1.8%, P = 0.001), and all uterine anomalies (this includes septate and bicornuate uteri and fibroids, 31.9% vs 23.5%, P = 0.02) compared with controls. The anterior midline uterine position was more commonly noted in controls (28.5% vs 11%, P < .001). A higher total number of fibroids was noted in the malpositioned group (3.7 vs 1.8, P = 0.01); however, fibroid size was not statistically significant. In particular, there was an increased incidence of submucosal fibroids in women with malpositioned intrauterine devices (P = 0.01). Multivariable logistic regression revealed that anterior midline position (odds ratio [OR], 0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.20–0.57) and absence of uterine anomalies (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38–0.93) were factors associated with a lower risk of IUD malposition; whereas vaginal bleeding (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.38–3.67), pain (OR, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.84–4.44), or missing IUD strings at time of presentation (OR, 3.58; 95% CI, 1.88–6.82) were associated with an increased risk of malposition.

Conclusion

Retroflexed uterine positions and all uterine malformations are associated with higher incidence of malpositioned intrauterine devices. Presence of increased number of fibroids and specifically submucosal fibroids showed a positive association with intrauterine device malposition, as did symptoms of bleeding, pain, and missing IUD strings at time of presentation. These findings pertain to women presenting for gynecologic ultrasound evaluation and may not be generalizable to all women with IUDs.

### Three-dimensional volume imaging in gynecology [^112Q7ioj]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

3D ultrasound imaging of the female pelvis is one of the most important recent advances in diagnostic imaging. Volume acquisitions can provide a large number of images of the pelvic organs simultaneously and in any plane or orientation desired. The coronal plane of the uterus is only visible when reconstructed from a volume and is key to imaging the uterus for indications such as uterine anomalies, IUD positioning, locations of fibroids and polyps, or early pregnancies. 3D ultrasonography has huge potential for evaluating infertile patients, performing difficult procedures under guidance, and studying patients with abnormal uterine bleeding, hydrosalpinges, and cancer.

### Importance of the delivery-to-insertion interval in immediate postpartum intrauterine device insertion: a secondary analysis [^1126A9A3]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the delivery-to-insertion interval for copper postpartum intrauterine devices (PPIUDs).

Methods

Secondary analysis of two related studies at five academic sites in India from March 2015 to July 2016. IUDs were inserted within 48 hours of vaginal delivery. Women (n = 560) were grouped by whether they underwent postplacental (≤ 10 minutes) or immediate (> 10 minutes) insertion. Outcomes were complete expulsion at the 6-8-week follow-up (primary), and IUD-to-fundus distance, as assessed by postinsertion ultrasound (secondary).

Results

Overall, 93 (16.6%) women received a postplacental PPIUD and 467 (83.4%) received an immediate PPIUD. Complete expulsion at follow-up was 3.2% (n = 3) in the postplacental and 7.5% (n = 35) in the immediate postpartum group (P = 0.176; difference in proportions, 4.3%; 95% confidence interval, -2.0 to 8.1). Distance from the fundus did not differ between the two groups (P = 0.107); high fundal placement (≤ 10 mm from the internal endometrial verge) was achieved for most women.

Conclusion

The present data challenge previous guidance on the timing of PPIUD insertion. The 10-minute insertion window is a barrier to uptake and should be reassessed for inclusion in service delivery guidelines. A flexible interval would accommodate the multiple post-delivery tasks of providers and increase access to PPIUD.

### Postplacental placement of intrauterine devices: a randomized clinical trial [^115jmUZ7]. Contraception (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the expulsion rate of the TCu380A intrauterine device (IUD) or levonorgestrel (LNG) 52 mg intrauterine system (IUS) up to 90 days after postplacental placement (10 min after delivery of the placenta).

Study Design

Randomized trial (1:1) of women aged 18–43 years and ≥ 37 weeks pregnant enrolled during early or prodromal labor at the University of Campinas, Brazil. Follow-up was scheduled at 42 and 90 days after device placement. We confirmed the IUD or IUS location using ultrasonography. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess variables associated with expulsion.

Results

We enrolled 140 women, and assigned 70 to the TCu380A IUD and 70 to the IUS groups. By the 90-day follow-up visit, 22/60 women (36.7%) in the TCu380A IUD group had expelled the device, as had 12/60 women in the IUS group (20%). Thirty-three of the 34 expulsions had occurred by the 42-day visit. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the expulsion odds ratio ([OR]; 95% confidence interval [CI]) was higher after vaginal delivery than after Cesarean delivery (OR 5.60; 95% CI 2.08–15.10; P < 0.00) and higher among women with one (OR 4.38; 95% CI 1.33–14.43; P 0.00) or three or more deliveries (including the present one) (OR 6.08; 95% CI 1.78–20.77; P 0.00) than those with two deliveries.

Conclusions

Postplacental TCu380A IUD placement had a higher expulsion rate than the IUS, and the expulsion rate was higher among women who had a vaginal delivery than those who had a Cesarean delivery. Most of the expulsions occurred within 42 days.

Implications

Policy makers should increase the availability of both the TCu380A and the LNG intrauterine devices for the immediate postpartum period, even though the expulsion rate is higher than that after interval placement.

### Continuation rates of two different-sized copper intrauterine devices among nulliparous women: interim 12-month results of a single-blind, randomised, multicentre trial [^116o6Eji]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Increased bleeding and pelvic pain are side effects that affect some copper intrauterine device (IUD) users, with first-year removal rates of 5% to 15% for these reasons. Nulliparous users have twice the rate of removal due to bleeding and pain compared to parous users. Disproportionately high removal rates for side effects may be due to numerous factors, including size and shape of the product and incompatibility with the dimensions of the uterine cavity. Numerous organizations support IUD use for nulliparous women and/or adolescents because the benefits far outweigh any serious health risks.

Nulliparous women typically have smaller uteri than parous women. A systematic review of endometrial cavity dimensions (mean fundal width x mean cavity length) measured mechanically reported 25.1mm x 33.7mm (nulliparous) versus 34.9mm x 38.6mm (parous); imaging measurements were 28.2mm x 37.0mm (nulliparous) versus 32.1mm x 44.3mm (parous). Using 3-dimensional ultrasound, Wildemeersch et al.estimated that the mean fundal uterine width of nulliparous women was 21.6mm, with 75% of measurements falling between 18mm and 24.8mm. IUD embedment is associated with narrow uterine cavities.

### The width of the uterine cavity is narrower in patients with an embedded intrauterine device (IUD) compared to a normally positioned IUD [^115SqYL3]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine whether women with intrauterine devices (IUDs) embedded in the myometrium or cervix have a narrower fundal transverse endometrial diameter as seen on 3-dimensional (3D) sonography compared to women whose IUDs are in a normal location.

Methods

A sonographer blinded to the study hypothesis retrospectively evaluated the 3D images and reconstructed coronal views of the uterine cavity in 172 consecutive women who had an IUD in the uterus. The width of the endometrial cavity at the fundus of the uterus was measured transversely on the rendered coronal sonogram using the calipers on a picture archiving and communications system. The measurements obtained from women who had nonembedded IUDs were compared to those with embedded IUDs.

Results

Measurement of the width of the endometrial cavity at the fundus was successfully performed in 132 patients with nonembedded IUDs and 29 with embedded IUDs. The mean ± SD values of the fundal uterine cavity for the nonembedded and embedded IUDs were 32 ± 1.0 and 25 ± 0.8 mm, respectively (P = 0.0003).

Conclusions

Patients with embedded IUDs have a smaller fundal endometrial cavity diameter compared to those with normally placed IUDs as documented using 3D rendering of the uterus. Whether preprocedural 3D sonography for women who are IUD candidates would be useful deserves further study.

PROCEDURE‐BASED OPTIONS

Uterine aspiration for first trimester pregnancy termination is typically performed in an outpatient clinic setting with the use of local anesthesia and/or sedation and has an efficacy of > 99%. Potential benefits of uterine aspiration include immediate efficacy, brief duration of procedure time, and more predictable vaginal bleeding. Second trimester procedural termination is usually accomplished by dilation and evacuation, in which the fetus and products of conception are grasped with forceps and removed from the uterus, frequently under direct ultrasound guidance. In contrast to aspiration termination, dilation and evacuation requires preparation of the cervix before the procedure to avoid traumatic laceration. In 2019, second trimester termination comprised 6.7% of terminations; only 0.9% occurred after 20 weeks of gestation. Increasing gestational age is associated with increased risk of complications. Multiple prior cesarean births is the most significant risk factor for hemorrhage with or without placenta accreta spectrum. Dilation and evacuation may be performed with the patient under local anesthesia, moderate sedation, or general anesthesia, depending on patient preferences, service availability, and comorbidities. If the patient desires, a postprocedural IUD, Nexplanon placement, or tubal sterilization can be performed immediately following termination of pregnancy to provide reliable contraception going forward.

### Association of the timing of postpartum intrauterine device insertion and breastfeeding with risks of intrauterine device expulsion [^114fzqsJ]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Future research could evaluate risk factors for partial vs complete expulsions, the association of preinsertion counseling with recognition of potential expulsions and corresponding IUD failure rates, and whether ultrasound verification of IUD position in the uterus after insertion is associated with expulsion risk. While women who accept immediate postpartum IUD placement report high satisfaction rates, information on women's preferences and satisfaction associated with different timing of postpartum placement would also be helpful to understand the benefit-risk profile.

Strengths and Limitations

Key strengths of the study include its large size and demographically diverse cohort of women across US regions. Use of linked mother-infant records enabled identification of study exposures, and EHRs allowed more accurate identification of the outcomes. The retrospectively collected data analyzed in the study reflect US clinical practice, minimizing the selection and recall biases that can occur with prospective studies with long intervals between data-collection interviews.

This study has limitations. Misclassification of exposures and the study outcome is possible, particularly for breastfeeding in the early postpartum period, when women might be lactating regardless of their decision to breastfeed. The study did not collect information on lactational amenorrhea, which may be associated with expulsion risk. The study period spanned the use of both ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes, but no difference in the proportions of expulsions was identified between these two time periods. Complete and partial expulsions were combined in the analyses, and we did not stratify the analysis by mode of delivery. The date of IUD expulsion reflects the date it came to medical attention, not necessarily the time of the expulsion. Ascertainment bias is possible: women with immediate postpartum insertions may have been exposed to more routine follow-up in the immediate postpartum time periods, whereas for later postpartum insertions, IUD expulsions might be underestimated due to a lack of timely clinical encounters and expulsions not being recognized. There is the potential for unmeasured confounding. Some variables have a high rate of missingness (eg, in the postpartum cohort, parity [15%] and cesarean delivery any time before IUD insertion [12%]). APEX-IUD data on postpartum timing did not differentiate postplacental insertions (ie, ≤ 10 minutes after delivery) with insertions at later time points on the day of delivery, although the clinical importance of this distinction has been questionedand may not be relevant. The study cohort was identified from 4 health care systems; thus, the results may not be generalizable to an uninsured population.

The intrauterine device (IUD) is among the most effective forms of birth control available, with important advantages over other methods of contraception. The most striking adverse event associated with IUD use is uterine perforation and migration of the device. Contrary to what one might assume, perforation is often silent and the wayward device is either detected after further sequellae or found incidentally by imaging. The radiologist should be aware of the natural course, presentations, diagnostic evaluation and treatment (if any) for this misplaced foreign body.

### A proposed classification for intrauterine device position: the tal-reeves classification [^115VFGK6]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2022). High credibility.

Background

The lack of a common system for classification of intrauterine device (IUD) position is problematic. In one study, where IUD position was determined by expert opinion alone, increased IUD removal resulted in more pregnancies, while no pregnancies occurred among those with a 'mal-positioned' IUD with no specific criteria used. In practice, physicians often see patients with IUDs located in different areas of the uterus and the position changes over time. After initial placement, some IUDs are found higher in the uterus while others are found lower. Aside from the multiple locations of the IUD in the uterus, unilateral or bilateral 'embedment' or penetration of the IUD's arms into the myometrium is also common. Patients using IUDs often present symptoms relating to the device including pain, menstrual cramps and bleeding. The symptoms may be related to the position of the IUD in the uterus and the amount of arm embedment into the myometrium, but without a system for classification of position, it is not possible to conduct adequate clinical research on the relationship between position and symptoms.

Terminology for describing IUD location has not been standardised. IUD position has been studied in terms of relationship to the uterine fundus. However, in clinical practice, the distance from the uterine fundus is irrelevant. The distance from the fundus depends on the size of uterine cavity rather than migration. If the uterine cavity is large and the IUD is within the uterine cavity, the distance from the fundus has no known clinical value. In contrast, in a small nulliparous uterus, an IUD which is 2 cm from the fundus may extend into the cervix. Furthermore, symptoms do not correlate with the distance between the IUD and uterine fundus and the distance to the fundal-most portion of endometrial cavity. Not surprisingly, the position of the IUD changes during the menstrual cycle. Movement within the uterine cavity is normal, but, as an intrauterine contraceptive, the IUD should not be located below the internal cervical os, the anatomic landmark defining the start of the uterine cavity. Using distance from the fundus, the location of the IUD relative to the internal cervical os is not captured.

Bimanual examination and cervical inspection: Bimanual examination and cervical inspection are necessary before IUD placement to assess uterine size and position and to detect any cervical or uterine abnormalities that might indicate infection or otherwise prevent IUD placement.

STIs: Patients should be routinely screened for chlamydial and gonococcal infections according to national screening guidelines. The CDC Sexually Transmitted Infections Treatment Guidelines provide information on screening eligibility, timing, and frequency of screening and on screening for persons with risk factors. If STI screening guidelines have been followed, most patients do not need additional STI screening at the time of IUD placement, and placement should not be delayed. If a patient with risk factors for STIs has not been screened for gonorrhea and chlamydia according to CDC STI treatment guidelines, screening may be performed at the time of IUD placement, and placement should not be delayed. Patients with current purulent cervicitis or chlamydial infection or gonococcal infection should not undergo IUD placement (U.S. MEC 4). A systematic review identified two studies that demonstrated no differences in PID rates among women who screened positive for gonorrhea or chlamydia and underwent concurrent IUD placement compared with women who screened positive and initiated other contraceptive methods. Indirect evidence demonstrates women who undergo same-day STI screening and IUD placement have similar PID rates compared with women who have delayed IUD placement. Women who undergo same-day STI screening and IUD placement have low incidence rates of PID. Algorithms for predicting PID among women with risk factors for STIs have poor predictive value. Risk for PID among women with risk factors for STIs is low (,–). Although women with STIs at the time of IUD placement have a higher risk for PID, the overall rate of PID among all IUD users is low.

### Risk factors for intrauterine device embedment in postmenopausal women: an analysis of 731 participants undergoing hysteroscopy [^115XVPqD]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are the most widely used reversible method of contraception. The use of IUD by 41% of women (approximately 141 million) in China drives the high IUD prevalence worldwide. Between 1982 and 1990, an average of approximately 10 million women nationwide had an IUD placed each year because of China's one-child fertility policy. Recent studies have suggested that IUD use has continued to increase, with more than half of women of reproductive age using an IUD over the past 30 years. However, approximately one fourth of women older than 45 years have not yet had their IUD removed, largely because they are unaware of when an IUD should be removed and have insufficient health education to improve the on-time removal of IUD at menopause.

Ultrasonography is crucial for determining the IUD position and assessing its complications. The correct position of the IUD is at the uterine fundus, with the arms completely extended toward the uterine cornua and the vertical stem in the uterine cavity. Intrauterine device embedment is defined as the myometrial penetration of the IUD without serosal extension.

Copper IUDs, which are nonhormone devices used by young women, have high continuation rates, provide reliable protection for 10 to 12 years, and allow the rapid restoration of fertility after removal. Furthermore, after extensive myomectomy or any other procedures that could cause intrauterine adhesions, the use of an IUD is an effective way to prevent adhesions and restore the anatomy of the uterine cavity. Levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs are gaining popularity as a method of contraception; they can treat heavy menstrual bleeding, endometriosis-related discomfort, endometrial hyperplasia, and malignancy. - Thus, IUDs are an appealing contraceptive option for women.

Diagnostic procedures, including bimanual pelvic examinations, ultrasonography, dilation and curettage, and/or laparoscopy, are commonly performed in women with IUD-related disorders. Hysteroscopy with or without anesthesia is reportedly a feasible method of retrieving or repositioning an IUD, especially in cases in which the strings are not visible or fragmented pieces are located within the uterine cavity or cervical canal. - The visual dimensions offered by hysteroscopy improve diagnostic accuracy and minimize the limitations associated with other diagnostic procedures, such as blind curettage and hysterosalpingography (HSG).

### Ultrasound assessment of the essure contraceptive devices: is three-dimensional ultrasound really needed? [^116Erj4M]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To evaluate the feasibility of 3-dimensional ultrasound (3DUS) for sonographic localization of Essure microinserts, comparing it with 2-dimensional ultrasound (2DUS) insofar as time to visualize the inserts and accuracy in determining their localization.

Design

Prospective study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).

Setting

University clinic.

Patients

Twenty-seven consecutive women undergoing hysteroscopic Essure device placement.

Interventions

Essure microinserts were inserted in the outpatient hysteroscopy clinic following the manufacturer's recommendations, leaving from 3 to 8 loops of the inserts in the uterine cavity. In all patients, 2DUS and 3DUS were performed 3 months after the procedure. 2DUS was performed first; the device(s) were located, and their position was recorded. Then 3DUS scans were acquired, trying when possible to have both devices at least at a 45-degree angle with the insonation beam for optimal rendering on 3DUS. The OmniView method with volume contrast imaging was used to show the relationships of the microinserts within the uterine cavity when possible. To define the position of the Essure device in relation to the uterus and the salpinges, we used the classification developed by Legendre and colleagues. After sonographic evaluation all women underwent hysterosalpingography to assess the success of sterilization.

Measurements and Main Results

Hysteroscopic insertion was successful in all patients, with 2 Essure devices placed in 25 patients and 1 device in 2 patients (due to previous salpingectomy performed because of ectopic pregnancy), for a total of 52 devices. One spontaneous late (within 3 months) expulsion of the device occurred; the device had migrated almost completely into the uterine cavity. At 3-month follow-up, all 51 correctly placed devices were easily observed at 2DUS (mean [SD] duration of the procedure, 2.25 [0.8] minutes). At 3DUS in 51 cases, the device was in perfect position (1+2+3) in 21 (41.2%), in position 2+3 in 14 (27.4%), and in position +3 in 16 (31.4%). Both microinserts were observed on 3DUS reconstructed images in 31 of 35 (88.6%) 1+2+3 and 2+3 cases. However, in the 16 cases in which the devices were in position +3 (salpinx only), a single 3D sweep failed to demonstrate both devices in 10 of 16 cases (62.5%), due to substantially different angles of orientation of the inserts. This was because if 1 of the 2 devices was placed at a < 30-degree angle with the insonation beam, its identification along the uterine wall was questionable because of concurrent hyperechogenicity of the bowel loops and poor visualization. Time for performance of 3DUS was 14.4 [4.8] minutes. Hysterosalpingography was performed in all patients, and confirmed tubal occlusion in all but 1 case.

Conclusions

On the basis of a limited number of patients, 2DUS is more time-efficient and equivalent to 3DUS in locating Essure contraceptive microinserts. These results should be considered when planning sonographic follow-up of patients with Essure devices.

Perforation

Across 41 studies reporting on this outcome, perforations following PPIUD insertion were rare. Seven perforations were reported: three from real-world studies after copper IUD insertion, and four in an RCT using copper IUDs. The reported cases include perforations with delayed diagnoses, but details on the perforations were largely missing.

Higher-income countries

Across twelve studies from higher-income countries, two perforations were reported and both were diagnosed at 6 months post-PPIUD insertion. One of the affected women required laparoscopic removal; in the other, the copper IUD was found, by ultrasound, to be partially perforated through the anterior lower segment of the uterus following insertion.

Lower-income countries

Across 29 studies from lower-income countries, one of 736 patients from a retrospective study in India experienced a perforation diagnosed at the 6-week follow-up visit, with the device located in the abdominal cavity. In one RCT from Pakistan using copper IUDs, it was reported that three (2%) of 76 women who underwent vaginal delivery had perforation, and one of 75 (0.7%) women who underwent caesarean section had perforation

Nonfundal location of IUD — management varies by device position and patient symptoms; the most common locations are the cervix and lower uterine segment. An IUD located within the cervix is partially expelled and, given the increased risk of complete expulsion, the IUD should be removed (and replaced if the patient desires). For an asymptomatic woman with the IUD above the internal os, removal is more likely to lead to pregnancy than retention, and retention of a low-lying IUD is associated with lower pregnancy rates than removal. Most downwardly displaced IUDs above the internal os are not ultimately expelled, many nonfundal IUDs shortly after insertion move to a fundal position within 3 months, and expectant management is a reasonable option with shared decision making; the greatest risk of pregnancy may be the unnecessary removal of a nonfundal IUD.

Methods

The SLR methodology followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidance. Embase, MEDLINE, and Cochrane CDSR and CENTRAL were searched for English language publications indexed from 1 January 2010 to October 2021 meeting protocol-defined eligibility criteria (search strategy in online supplemental table 1). Bibliographies of relevant SLRs were hand-searched for additional citations.

Articles were included if they met predefined PICOS (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes and Study) criteria:

Population: Females undergoing PPIUD placement
Intervention/comparator: No limits
Outcomes: IUD utilisation and/or safety within 12 months Efficacy/effectiveness (UIPs within 18 months)
Study design: Interventional or observational studies

Abstracts and full-text publications were independently screened by two investigators (KK, EGE), with discrepancies adjudicated by a third investigator (BAM). Data were extracted by one researcher and validated by a second researcher. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) endorses a best practice for immediate PPIUD as placement 'in the delivery room, within 10 min of placental delivery in vaginal and caesarean births, when possible', and the WHO advises insertion at < 48 hours or > 4 weeks. In an effort to capture all peri-delivery, in-hospital, IUD insertions we a priori defined PPIUD as that occurring up to 72 hours following delivery, while in hospital; studies describing IUD insertion as 'immediate' but without a specific timeframe reported were also included.

Results were qualitatively summarised within country income strata, based on 2021 World Bank classifications. Groups were defined on a gross national income per capita basis using the World Bank Atlas method in 2019 US$ (per person in 1 year (2019): low income: ≤ $1035; lower-middle income: $1036–$4045; upper-middle income: $4046–$12 535; high income: > $12 536). Two income groups were defined: 'lower income' for low- and lower-middle-income countries and 'higher income' for upper-middle and high-income countries.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendations: contraceptive care in the context of pandemic response [^113NempZ]. Contraception (2022). High credibility.

In-person contraceptive services during the pandemic — visits requiring in-person care: Telemedicine is not suitable for all contraceptive services. Schedule patients who desire an intrauterine device (IUD) or contraceptive implant for an in-person visit without delay, including in the context of high community transmission rates if another method is not available or acceptable; expedite appointments for IUD insertion for emergency contraception, and offer IUD or implant placement immediately after abortion, management of early pregnancy loss, or vaginal or cesarean delivery to reduce the need for additional in-person visits. For most patients, LARC removal requires an in-person visit; some patients with IUDs can be counseled about attempts at self-removal but this is not always successful, and we do not recommend self-removal of contraceptive implants, noting only case reports with no data on safety or efficacy and a possible lack of aseptic technique leading to infection. Patients who report a positive pregnancy test and vaginal bleeding or pelvic pain should have an immediate in-person visit with pelvic exam and serum labs with pelvic ultrasound if indicated, and this also applies to any patient who is pregnant with an IUD in situ. For suspected IUD expulsion or non-palpable implant, for asymptomatic patients prescribe EC if indicated and counsel on a different contraceptive method until an in-person visit is possible; severe symptoms require an immediate visit, while mild symptoms that are not bothersome can be delayed if there is no concern for pregnancy and if a patient is willing to use an alternate method or accepts the risk of contraceptive failure. For DMPA-IM, counsel patients about the subcutaneous (SC) formulation; for those continuing DMPA-IM, injections can be delayed up to 15 weeks. For patients needing these services, consider hybrid visits in which counseling and informed consent occur virtually and only the procedure occurs in the clinic; this decreases face-to-face time and thus viral exposure.

### Continuation rates of two different-sized copper intrauterine devices among nulliparous women: interim 12-month results of a single-blind, randomised, multicentre trial [^111dcWq9]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

We found a statistically significant higher probability of partial IUD expulsion in the TCu380A group compared to the NT380-Mini. Given lack of blinding of providers, their discretion at doing ultrasounds, and the possibility that the TCu380A group might have had more ultrasounds (leading to surveillance bias in detecting partial expulsions), we examined the frequency of ultrasounds. We found both treatment groups had the same percentage of ultrasounds in the first year (3.55% of NT380-Mini participants and 3.70% of TCu380A participants, p -value 0.664, data not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that this affected our results. The higher expulsion rate in the TCu380A group supports the notion that the TCu380A may be incompatible with the uterine cavities of some nulliparous users. Increased frequency or intensity of uterine contractions with a larger product in situ, may push a product toward the lower uterine cavity. Though IUDs have been shown to move toward and away from the fundus over time, a product that becomes temporarily or permanently malpositioned might also produce unacceptable bleeding and pain side effects that lead to early removal. As described in the 1970 US patent for the TCu380A frame, "the device is of such a size that the crossbar of the "T" may exert some lateral pressure on the endometrial wall of the uterus. X-ray studies indicate that the ends of the crossbar will become slightly embedded in the endometrium suggesting a gentle anchoring phenomenon".
