## Question

A 22-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 25 minutes after an episode of violent jerky movements of his arms and legs. He has no recollection of the episode. The episode lasted for 3–4 minutes. His girlfriend reports that he has not been sleeping well over the past month. He is only oriented to place and person. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 99/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. A complete blood count as well as serum concentrations of glucose, electrolytes, and calcium are within the reference range. Urine toxicology screening is negative. An MRI of the brain shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A. Lorazepam
B. Tilt table test
C. Electroencephalography
D. Lamotrigine

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which next step in management is most appropriate for a 22-year-old man with a first generalized tonic-clonic–like event, normal labs and MRI, and a postictal confusional state, and to choose among lorazepam, tilt table testing, EEG, or lamotrigine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this presentation fits a seizure versus a mimic. Then, I should verify what the standard workup is after a first unprovoked seizure in an adult. Next, I will examine why the provided options do or do not align with guideline-based care. Finally, I will confirm the correct next step and briefly outline downstream management implications, including when to start antiseizure medication and how to handle psychogenic non-epileptic seizures if suspected [^111s6GHB] [^115bB59g].

> Let me first confirm the clinical picture. Violent jerky movements of all four limbs lasting 3–4 minutes with loss of awareness and subsequent amnesia, followed by a postictal confusional state, strongly suggests a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, and the absence of metabolic derangements or structural lesions on MRI supports an unprovoked first seizure rather than an acute symptomatic seizure, although I should keep in mind that sleep deprivation can lower seizure threshold and does not by itself prove epilepsy [^112hXtCC].

> Wait, let me verify the standard diagnostic workup after a first unprovoked seizure in an adult. Guidelines consistently recommend obtaining brain MRI to exclude structural causes and EEG to assess for epileptiform abnormalities that increase recurrence risk; routine labs are often low yield when the patient has returned to baseline, and toxicology is reasonable when history suggests exposure, as in this case where it was negative [^115NuwvD] [^111nUoyE] [^1118o3e1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment yet. I initially thought lorazepam might be the next step because benzodiazepines are first-line for status epilepticus, but I need to check the operational definition; status epilepticus is continuous seizure activity for at least 5 minutes or recurrent seizures without recovery between, and this patient's single 3–4 minute event with subsequent recovery does not meet that threshold, so lorazepam is not indicated as a next diagnostic or therapeutic step here [^111Deqs5] [^115R3Txa].

> Let me consider the other options carefully. Tilt table testing evaluates reflex syncope and autonomic dysfunction, which would not explain generalized convulsions and postictal confusion; syncope typically presents with brief loss of consciousness and rapid recovery without a prolonged postictal state, so tilt testing is not appropriate in this convulsive presentation [^113uvi7V]. Lamotrigine is an antiseizure medication used for maintenance therapy, but starting it now would be premature without confirming epileptiform activity or high recurrence risk features, and guidelines advise initiating chronic antiseizure therapy selectively after weighing risks and benefits, not immediately after a single unprovoked seizure without supportive findings [^115bB59g] [^111nUoyE].

> I should double-check the role of EEG here. EEG is the correct next test because it can detect interictal epileptiform abnormalities that increase recurrence risk and help differentiate epileptic seizures from psychogenic non-epileptic seizures when the diagnosis is uncertain; in fact, EEG is recommended in the evaluation of a first seizure in adults, and in cases of diagnostic uncertainty, prolonged video-EEG is the gold standard to distinguish epileptic from non-epileptic events [^115NuwvD] [^114zEhVR] [^111s6GHB].

> But wait, what if this were psychogenic non-epileptic seizures rather than epilepsy. Features such as asynchronous movements, closed eyes, side-to-side head movements, and prolonged unresponsiveness with preserved awareness can favor PNES, and misdiagnosis is common; however, without video-EEG correlation I should avoid labeling it PNES prematurely, and the safest, guideline-concordant next step remains EEG to clarify the diagnosis and guide management [^111s6GHB] [^115a5tbd].

> Next, I should review downstream decisions after EEG. If the EEG shows epileptiform abnormalities or if other high-risk features are present, initiation of antiseizure medication can be considered after counseling about risks and benefits; conversely, a normal EEG in a patient with a single unprovoked seizure favors observation without immediate chronic therapy, with clear safety counseling and follow-up, consistent with first-seizure management guidance [^115bB59g] [^115NuwvD].

> Final answer: The most appropriate next step is electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate for epileptiform abnormalities and to help differentiate epileptic seizures from mimics such as psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, aligning with standard adult first-seizure workup and avoiding unnecessary acute treatment or invasive testing in this stable patient [^115NuwvD] [^114zEhVR].

---

The most appropriate next step is **EEG** [^115NuwvD] to confirm the diagnosis of epilepsy and guide management. The patient's presentation is classic for a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, and with normal labs and MRI, EEG is the key test to detect interictal epileptiform activity and stratify recurrence risk [^111nUoyE]. Lorazepam is for acute seizure control, not diagnostic use; a tilt table test is for syncope, not seizures; and lamotrigine should not be started until epilepsy is confirmed and seizure type is defined [^113z3ut2].

---

## Clinical reasoning and differential diagnosis

The patient's violent jerky movements with loss of awareness and postictal confusion are most consistent with a **generalized tonic-clonic seizure** [^notfound]. The differential includes:

- **Syncope**: Typically brief, with rapid recovery and no postictal confusion.
- **Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES)**: Often prolonged, asynchronous, with eyes closed and preserved awareness.
- **Movement disorders**: Non-epileptic, without loss of awareness or postictal state.

Given the clinical features and normal initial workup, **epilepsy is the leading diagnosis**, but EEG is needed to confirm and characterize seizures [^115NuwvD].

---

## Role of EEG in epilepsy diagnosis

EEG is the **gold standard** for detecting interictal epileptiform activity, confirming epilepsy, and guiding therapy [^notfound]. It helps differentiate epileptic from non-epileptic events and informs recurrence risk and treatment decisions [^111nUoyE].

---

## Indications for EEG after a first seizure

Current guidelines recommend EEG after a first unprovoked seizure in adults to detect epileptiform activity and guide management [^115NuwvD]. EEG is especially important when:

- **MRI is normal**: To detect subtle cortical abnormalities or epileptiform activity.
- **Recurrence risk assessment**: EEG abnormalities increase recurrence risk and may influence treatment decisions [^111nUoyE].
- **Differentiation**: To distinguish epileptic seizures from PNES or other mimics [^111s6GHB].

---

## Why other options are not appropriate

- **Lorazepam**: Benzodiazepines are for acute seizure termination, not diagnostic use.
- **Tilt table test**: Used for syncope evaluation, not seizures.
- **Lamotrigine**: Antiseizure medication should not be started until epilepsy is confirmed and seizure type is defined [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the American Epilepsy Society (AES) recommend EEG after a first unprovoked seizure in adults to detect epileptiform activity and guide management [^114QGGjg]. EEG is a **standard part of the evaluation** and helps confirm the diagnosis and inform treatment decisions [^115NuwvD].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate next step is **EEG** [^115NuwvD] to confirm epilepsy, assess recurrence risk, and guide management. Lorazepam, tilt table testing, and lamotrigine are not appropriate next steps in this scenario.

Significant outcomes

In the context of the emergency treatment of acutely disturbed behaviour, the use of parenteral rather than oral medication reflected different target behaviours in men and women. Initiatives to reduce the need for, and therefore use of, rapid tranquilisation may be more successful if they are gender-specific, for example, targeting self-harm in women and violence towards others in men.
Where behavioural disturbance involves violence towards others, a combination of parenteral haloperidol and lorazepam is most often used rather than the combination of haloperidol and promethazine recommended in UK clinical guidelines. A head-to-head randomised clinical trial comparing these regimens is warranted.
The initial attempt to manage acutely disturbed behaviour with parenteral medication may fail to achieve a calming effect in up to one in four episodes. There is very limited evidence on which to base the choice of next-step pharmacological strategies.

Paroxysmal non-epileptic events (PNEs) refer to episodic changes in behaviour, sensation or consciousness that lead to unusual movements, which may resemble epileptic seizures, but are not, due to excessive neuronal firing in the cerebral cortex. A significant proportion of patients seen in epilepsy clinics do not actually have epilepsy. Therefore, it is paramount for clinicians to be able to recognise these transient non-epileptic events in order to avoid unnecessary antiepileptic treatments and to provide appropriate management as required. These PNEs can be observed within the context of a neurological disorder such as migraine or with no direct neurological basis such as simple tics. In this review, we have described common PNEs presenting in school-age children and adolescents alongside the clinical approach to differentiate them from epileptic seizures. PNEs occurring in infancy and younger children have been covered in our first review of this series.

Status epilepticus definition and classification — summary recommendations specify the diagnostic time threshold and categories. SE should be defined as 5 min or more of continuous clinical and/or electrographic seizure activity or recurrent seizure activity without recovery between seizures (strong recommendations, moderate quality). SE should be classified as either convulsive SE (convulsions that are associated with rhythmic jerking of the extremities) or non-convulsive SE (seizure activity seen on EEG without the clinical findings associated with convulsive SE) (strong recommendation, high quality).

The patient consulted his general practitioner who referred him to us concerning that the attacks may be epileptic seizures. Two months after the first attack, we reviewed him; his neurological examination between attacks was compatible with HD (see online supplementary video 1b) with no unexpected focal signs. Routine and sleep-deprived electroencephalograms (EEGs) and MR neuroimaging were normal.

We diagnosed probable psychogenic non-epileptic seizures according to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) criteriaon the basis of the presence of predisposing factors, compatible semiology assessed by an experienced neurologist in a video recording, exclusion of an explanatory medical cause and negative investigations, including interictal EEG. We informed him of the diagnosis and the risk factors that had contributed to its development, counselled on de-escalation techniques and gave citalopram for low mood and anxiety. The episodes ceased and 24 months later, he remains event-free.

### A practical approach to late-onset cerebellar ataxia: putting the disorder with lack of order into order [^115KQV1T]. Practical Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical management of cerebellar ataxia is challenging, mainly because ataxia is a symptom of many neurological diseases. Many types of ataxia disorders are genetic and some are extremely rare. Here, the authors suggest a diagnostic approach to ataxia developed around a case of sporadic, late-onset, slowly progressive ataxia. Clinical information such as age of onset, rate of progression, family history and certain non-cerebellar features can narrow the differential diagnosis. Brain MRI is almost obligatory and may reveal valuable diagnostic clues. Having ruled out structural lesions, the two other most common diagnoses are inflammatory and degenerative (including genetic) disorders. Although only a minority of underlying diseases are treatable, there are still many options for supportive care.

### Psychogenic nonepileptic "seizures" or "attacks"? It's not just semantics: attacks [^11355kgL]. Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Since the phrase "psychogenic nonepileptic seizures" has been the term of choice, it has become clear that the word "seizure" here creates confusion. Beyond theoretical arguments, the confusion it creates is detrimental to patients' and families' understanding of the diagnosis, which in turn has a negative impact on treatment.

### Guidelines for the evaluation and management of status epilepticus [^1122Utun]. Neurocritical Care (2012). Medium credibility.

Refractory status epilepticus (RSE) management — aggressive treatment should be continued in all situations until the physician determines therapy is successful or futile, prolonged therapy may be appropriate in young patients with a healthy pre‑morbid state, self‑limited disease processes, and absence of intracranial lesions suggesting a poor prognosis, there currently are no randomized trials or compelling evidence to support the routine use of novel interventions, practitioners should be aware of these options and consider their use based on the individual clinical situation, emerging therapies include ketamine and hypothermia but there are limited data on safety and effectiveness, and it is recommended to reserve these therapies for patients who do not respond to RSE AED treatment and consider transfer if not managed by an ICU team that specialize in the treatment of SE and/or cannot provide cEEG monitoring.

### Nonconvulsive status epilepticus: clinical features and diagnostic challenges [^113fC4ug]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

NCSE, once thought to be a rare disorder, should be considered in any patient presenting with an alteration in mental status of indeterminate cause. The psychiatrist needs to be aware of the different clinical characteristics of this disorder as well as similarities and differences from psychiatric disorders. A history of seizure is not necessary for the diagnosis, nor is motor activity necessarily associated with NCSE. An EEG is required to confirm the diagnosis and should be performed when possible, because early recognition and treatment may improve outcome. There is usually a good response to an intravenous benzodiazepine; when response has been delayed, other anticonvulsants have been used as adjuncts. The EEG is necessary to distinguish AS from CPS so that, when indicated, the proper long-term antiepileptic drug therapy can be started. Although NCSE has been described in the literature for many years, there is still a great need for carefully designed prospective studies to help define clear guidelines to assist in clinical and management decision making and, ultimately, to improve outcomes.

### Guidelines for the evaluation and management of status epilepticus [^116sweur]. Neurocritical Care (2012). Medium credibility.

Non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) — definition, phenotypes, and manifestations are described as seizure activity seen on electroencephalogram (EEG) without clinical findings associated with GCSE; two distinct phenotypes include the "wandering confused" patient presenting to the emergency department with a relatively good prognosis or chronic epileptic syndromes, and the acutely ill patient with severely impaired mental status with or without subtle motor movements such as rhythmic muscle twitches or tonic eye deviation in the setting of acute brain injury; for these guidelines the focus is on the acutely ill patient with impaired mental status, a type that frequently follows uncontrolled GCSE and is often encountered in the intensive care setting; the semiological spectrum is highly variable with negative symptoms including an increase in confusion, aphasia, lethargy, and staring, and positive symptoms including agitation/aggression, automatisms, blinking, crying, delirium, delusions, echolalia, facial twitching, laughter, nausea/vomiting, nystagmus/eye deviation, perseveration, psychosis, and tremulousness.

Treatment of refractory status epilepticus — "In most cases of SE, continuous EEG (cEEG) and/or clinical exam will determine the persistence of SE after both emergent initial and urgent control AED treatments have been given. In this case, the patient has RSE and it is recommended to immediately start additional agents". Because there is "no well defined period of observation that has been determined to be safe", the authors state "we recommend proceeding with additional treatment immediately, in combination with critical care treatment as described in Table 5".

### Evaluation of a first seizure [^115NuwvD]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Seizure is a common presentation in the emergency care setting, and new-onset epilepsy is the most common cause of unprovoked seizures. The patient history and physical examination should direct the type and timing of laboratory and imaging studies. No single sign, symptom, or test dearly differentiates a seizure from a nonseizure event (e.g., syncope, pseudoseizure). Electroencephalography is recommended for patients presenting with a first seizure, and neuroimaging is recommended for adults. Neuroimaging also should be performed in children with risk factors such as head trauma, focal neurologic deficits, or a history of malignancy. Magnetic resonance imaging is preferred over computed tomography except when acute intracranial bleeding is suspected. The most common laboratory findings associated with a seizure are abnormal sodium and glucose levels. Patients with a normal neurologic examination, normal test results, and no structural brain disease do not require hospitalization or antiepileptic medications. Treatment with antiepileptic medications reduces the one- to two-year risk of recurrent seizures but does not reduce the long-term risk of recurrence and does not affect remission rates. Regardless of etiology, a seizure diagnosis severely limits a patient's driving privileges, although laws vary by state.

Pediatric considerations — magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): MRI often requires sedation in young children due to exam length, noise, and motion artifact, particularly those less than 5-years of age; when feasible consider a "feed and sleep" technique in infants and use child-life specialists to attempt imaging without sedation. Continuous presence of qualified personnel is advised because of the long tunnel, limited access, and need for MRI-safe resuscitation equipment, and ECG leads and other monitoring equipment must be MRI compatible.

Objective

This article is the second part of a two-part series on MRI safety. In this article, part 2, the topic of screening patients for MRI procedures is addressed.

Conclusion

To prevent incidents and accidents associated with MRI, it is necessary to regularly revisit the safety topics that directly impact patient management especially with respect to the subjects that are "new", those that should be reassessed because of recent changes, topics that deserve emphasis because of controversy or confusion, and information that should be considered in light of new findings.

### Practice parameter: evaluating a first nonfebrile seizure in children: report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology, the Child Neurology Society, and the American Epilepsy Society [^112UN4DC]. Neurology (2000). Medium credibility.

First nonfebrile seizure in children — immediate evaluation emphasizes history and examination over routine tests. After stabilization, a physician must determine if a seizure has occurred and whether it is the first episode, and the determination is typically based on a detailed history provided by a reliable observer. A careful history and thorough physical examination may allow a diagnosis without need for other tests, and in many children they will provide adequate information regarding probable cause or the need for other tests including neuroimaging. No single clinical symptom can reliably discriminate between a seizure and a nonepileptic event, and studies of serum prolactin or creatine kinase levels indicate neither test is sufficiently reliable to be routinely useful. Unprovoked seizures occur in the absence of precipitating factors and their etiology may be cryptogenic, remote symptomatic, or idiopathic.

### A suggested approach to the etiologic evaluation of status epilepticus in children: what to seek after the usual causes have been ruled out [^116guCo7]. Journal of Child Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Status epilepticus represents a true neurologic emergency that requires immediate treatment to stop seizure activity and prompt diagnostic evaluation to recognize potentially treatable causes. Although an etiology may be detected in many cases, in a significant number of patients the cause is not established by the usual laboratory or neuroimaging studies. We performed an extensive literature review of all unusual and often overlooked causes of status epilepticus in children, in an attempt to provide physicians with practical information on the diagnostic approach to patients, particularly those with refractory status epilepticus, for whom an etiology can not be detected by routine diagnostic protocols.

### A practical approach to the diagnosis of spinal cord lesions [^112enyXP]. Practical Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Every neurologist will be familiar with the patient with atypical spinal cord disease and the challenges of taking the diagnosis forward. This is predominantly because of the limited range of possible clinical and investigation findings making most individual features non-specific. The difficulty in obtaining a tissue diagnosis further contributes and patients are often treated empirically based on local prevalence and potential for reversibility. This article focuses on improving the diagnosis of adult non-traumatic, non-compressive spinal cord disorders. It is structured to start with the clinical presentation in order to be of practical use to the clinician. We aim, by combining the onset phenotype with the subsequent course, along with imaging and laboratory features, to improve the diagnostic process.

Transplantation-associated altered mentation and encephalopathy (TAME) — recommended evaluations and interventions for early and late TAME include testing for infection, organ dysfunction, electrolyte abnormalities, and central nervous system pathology, along with careful medication review and assessment for urinary retention, constipation, dehydration, and sleep disruption; specific workup includes head CT scan, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and lumbar puncture depending on the extent of immunosuppression or risk for CNS malignancy; for infection, obtain blood and urine cultures, chest X-ray and/or chest CT, a workup for viral reactivation (depends on extent of immunosuppression), and lumbar puncture for bacterial, fungal, viral including HHV-6, toxoplasmosis, and broad microbial PCR (depending on the extent of immunosuppression); for uncontrolled pain, assess for nonverbal findings and evaluate response to scheduled acetaminophen with or without scheduled low-dose opioids if uncontrolled pain is a consideration; for elimination problems, perform bladder scan/postvoid residual to evaluate for urinary retention and monitor frequency and quality of bowel movements to assess for constipation; medication-focused steps are to partner with pharmacist and nursing to review use and response to medications for symptom management, deprescribe all nonessential agents, evaluate the use of as needed medications and where possible minimize anticholinergic medications, assess benzodiazepine and opioid use/needs and consider alternatives (eg, topical lidocaine or diclofenac, or acetaminophen), check levels of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and sirolimus as appropriate, and have the pharmacy team review the full medication list for drug-drug interactions, total anticholinergic burden, other agents that can impact cognition, and use of potentially inappropriate medications; for sleep disturbance, attempt to provide undisturbed sleep for at least 4–6 hours, open window blinds and provide cognitive stimulation during daytime hours, mobilize patient/up to chair 3 times daily with meals, and avoid sedative-hypnotics; include liver function testing and renal function testing.

### The American Academy of Neurology's top five choosing wisely recommendations [^117UJXDW]. Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Headache evaluation — EEG (electroencephalography) has considerably lower sensitivity than neuroimaging with CT or MRI for structural causes of headache, and performing EEGs in patients with headache increases cost without adding benefit; a normal EEG in a patient with headache with features suggesting the presence of a structural abnormality may provide a false sense of security and delay performance of neuroimaging, and incidental EEG abnormalities in a primary headache disorder may prompt additional unnecessary procedures or treatments.

### Massive neurocysticercosis in a ten-year-old girl: a case report [^113VvCiS]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
MRI findings of intracranial lesions at baseline and follow-up assessments. Axial T2-weighted (A) and T1-weighted (B) magnetic resonance images before antiparasitic treatment showed massive cystic lesions with the so-called "hole-with-dot" appearance, indicating viable cysticercus with eccentric scolex, which has been regarded as pathognomonic characteristic of neurocysticercosis. C: Contrast-enhanced MRI image of the eyes of the patient which also showed some intracranial lesions before antiparasitic treatment. D: Brain axial T2-weighted MRI image two months after antiparasitic treatment demonstrated resolution of most intracranial cystic lesions. E: Brain CT scan six months after antiparasitic therapy showed very few residual calcifications

Corticosteroids and mannitol were administered to decrease brain edema and inflammation. Albendazole (15 mg/kg/d for 10 days) was given to the patient, and her symptoms were relieved. However, headache re-emerged after the treatment was over for one month, accompanied by an episode of seizure and intermittent arm and leg shaking movements. The shaking movements lasted several minutes to half an hour each time without impaired awareness, and happened mainly in the morning with an interval of several days. Repeated brain MRI showed no significant change of these intracranial lesions. Then supportive management including corticosteroids and mannitol and retreatment of albendazole (15 mg/kg/d) for 10 days were given to the patient. Oral prednisone was continued after these treatments. Headache and shaking movements of limbs were relieved. About three weeks after the end of these treatments, headache and an episode of seizure recurred. Considering that the patients did not respond very well to the therapeutic regimen of albendazol alone, albendazol (15 mg/kg/d) in combination with praziquantel (50 mg/kg/d) was administered for 14 days. Oral prednisone was given at the same time and in additional two weeks after the antiparasitic therapy. The patient's symptoms were all relieved. Repeated imaging two months after antiparasitic treatment showed that most cystic lesions had resolved (Fig. 1 D). The patient recovered well within the 4-year follow-up. The good therapeutic response to the antiparasitic medication also supported our diagnosis in this patient.

### Efficient diagnosis leads to better care: streamlining epilepsy diagnosis pathways [^114QGGjg]. Epilepsy Currents (2024). Medium credibility.

Considering these findings, I want to highlight the crucial role of the standardized MRI protocol for epilepsy diagnosis proposed by The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE), which offers a uniform and high-quality approach across different care contexts and countries. The ILAE advocates for the Harmonized Neuroimaging of Epilepsy Structural Sequences (HARNESS-MRI) protocol, which specifies isotropic, millimetric 3D T1 and FLAIR images, and high-resolution 2D submillimetric T2 images, available on most MR scanners, making this protocol widely applicable, irrespective of the clinical setting. Furthermore, the task force endorses artificial intelligence aid automated lesion detection techniques to enhance MRI diagnostic precision. While technological advancements indicate scientific progress, the reality of healthcare delivery presents broader challenges. Immediate access to advanced testing (LT-EEG and MRI) and neurology specialists for all cases of first-time seizures in the emergency room may not be feasible in most current healthcare facilities. However, ensuring rapid access to specialists and streamlining subsequent timely diagnostic evaluations outside emergency rooms could represent a practical alternative. Incorporating EEG telemetry and telemedicine technologies could further expedite the process. These innovations enable fast-track LT-EEG monitoring in the patient's own environment, remote consultations with specialists, removal of transportation barriers, and shifting tests to outpatient units, relieving pressure on emergency departments. Moreover, they may empower patients, fostering engagement and adherence to diagnostic and treatment plans.

It is crucial to have specific and up-to-date guidelines that encompass the latest evidence and recommendations to ensure optimal management of patients with seizures. There is evidence suggesting risks of seizure recurrence after the first unprovoked seizure, including an EEG with epileptiform abnormalities (Level A), a significant brain-imaging abnormality (Level B), prior brain insult, and nocturnal seizures. Previously, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the American Epilepsy Society (AES) issued a practice guideline for adults in 2007, which has since been retired. However, constrained by available evidence at the time, this guideline left substantial room for individual provider discretion. Its primary recommendation was to consider EEG and CT or MRI in the diagnostic process. Similarly, a guideline for children experiencing their first nonfebrile seizure advised EEG for all cases and brain imaging only for specific circumstances. The specific types of tests were not included in the guideline (rEEG vs LT-EEG and CT vs MRI). The lack of updated guidelines could lead to discrepancies in clinical practices among healthcare providers, potentially compromising the consistency and quality of care.

First nonfebrile seizure in children — neuroimaging guidance states that "There is insufficient evidence to support a recommendation at the level of standard or guideline for the use of routine neuroimaging, i.e., imaging performed for routine reasons having at issue as the sole indication, after a first nonfebrile seizure in children". "However, neuroimaging may be indicated under some circumstances either as an emergent or nonurgent procedure". "The purpose of performing an emergent neuroimaging study in the context of a child's first seizure is to detect a serious condition that may require immediate intervention", and "The purpose of performing a nonurgent neuroimaging study, which can be deferred to the next several days or later, is to detect abnormalities that may affect prognosis and therefore have an impact on long-term treatment and management". Recommendations specify: "If a neuroimaging study is obtained, MRI is the preferred modality". (Guideline) "Emergent neuroimaging should be performed in a child of any age who exhibits a postictal focal deficit (Todd's paresis) not quickly resolving, or who has not returned to baseline within several hours after the seizure". (Option) "Nonurgent imaging studies with MRI should be seriously considered in any child with a significant cognitive or motor impairment of unknown etiology, unexplained abnormalities on neurologic examination, a seizure of partial (focal) onset with or without secondary generalization, an EEG that does not represent a benign partial epilepsy of childhood or primary generalized epilepsy, or in children under 1 year of age".

### Involuntary rhythmic leg movements time-locked with the respiratory cycle [^1161UJTe]. Pediatric Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Involuntary rhythmic leg movements in childhood is an uncommon condition, the generators of which remain unknown. We report on a male 3 years of age with distinct features providing important clues concerning the location of one of these generators. At the age of 7 months, the previously healthy young male started with low frequency, rhythmic, and continuous (both during wakefulness and sleep) flexion/extension movements of the lower limbs. Movements interfered significantly with gait acquisition, and, despite normal cognitive development, he was able to walk only at age 2 years, 4 months. The neurologic examination revealed the absence of automatic stepping in the neonatal period, but was otherwise normal. A polygraphic electroencephalogram/electromyogram (EEG/EMG) recording, at the age of 2 years, 9 months, revealed rhythmic and synchronous legs with EMG activity at 0.5 Hz. A more complete polygraphic recording at the age of 3 years, 10 months, showed a lower frequency (0.35 Hz) for the movements, which were time-locked with the respiratory cycle. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed an increased T(2) signal in the upper medulla-lower pons regions. The generator of the rhythmic legs movements is postulated to be the respiratory center, connecting with the reticulospinal projecting neurons through an aberrant pathway.

This information on mortality risk should be a call for action for neurologists and epilepsy specialists to make the diagnosis, institute treatment, and follow-up patients with PNES. Although we have a lot to learn about the pathophysiology, presentation, and best therapy for this condition, the reward for taking this task will be no less than the one we get from adequately treating our PWE: fewer or no seizures, appropriate medications with fewer side effects, better treated comorbidities, improvement in quality of life, and reduced mortality: what more could we ask for?

### Recurrent episodes of falls and amnestic confusional States as diagnostic challenge in the elderly [^116VQpYF]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

New-onset paroxysmal events in patients over 60 years of age are often diagnostically challenging owing to atypical presentation. Recurrent falls and transient states of confusion are especially common in the elderly population, yet their causes often remain undiagnosed due to concomitant cognitive deficits and motor impairments. We present an elderly patient with newly occurring 'blackouts' without obvious triggers and transient states of confusion for which he was amnestic. All neurological exams including brain MRI scan and routine electroencephalography (EEG) were normal. Long-term ECG monitoring using an event recorder captured an asystole during a habitual episode, leading to the diagnosis of syncope and pacemaker implantation. A subsequent video EEG monitoring performed due to ongoing unexplained confusional states revealed both bradycardia and long-lasting confusional states to be caused by unrecognised temporal lobe seizures. Ictal video EEG monitoring may play a crucial role in establishing a diagnosis of atypical temporal lobe seizures in the elderly.

### Psychogenic seizures: a review and description of pitfalls in their acute diagnosis and management in the emergency department [^111s6GHB]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with psychogenic (nonepileptic) seizures (PS) are frequently encountered by clinicians in the emergency medicine setting. Despite the tendency for these patients to seek frequent medical attention, the time between onset of symptoms and diagnosis is often more than 7 years. The cause of PS is multifactorial, but most patients are thought to have an underlying dissociative condition. The diagnostic evaluation in the emergency department is challenging and relies heavily on clinical suspicion, based on historical and physical features. Laboratory testing and therapeutic maneuvers are of limited utility; prolonged video electroencephalography is the diagnostic gold standard. Once the diagnosis has been secured, the mainstay of treatment involves addressing the underlying psychological distress.

### Why can seizures remain intractable? Clinical vignettes from the life experience of a pediatric epileptologist [^1125LKo1]. Journal of Child Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Most childhood seizures can be controlled by the appropriate antiepileptic drugs. When seizures remain intractable in a normally developing child with an intact neurologic examination, it is usually possible to identify a clear reason, and the physician, like a detective, needs to investigate and reveal it. In this article we will describe cases that were encountered during a lifetime at a pediatric epilepsy clinic, which will illustrate the different reasons seizures remain intractable in patients who do not have structural abnormalities or resistant epileptic syndromes.

### Lessons from the video-EEG telemetry unit [^114zEhVR]. Practical Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Epilepsy is a clinical diagnosis, based primarily on patient and witness histories. Where there is diagnostic uncertainty or when epilepsy surgery is being considered, long-term video-EEG monitoring in a telemetry unit remains the gold standard investigation for diagnostic clarification or presurgical localisation. We present six illustrative cases, highlighting important points that emerged during video-EEG review including potential pitfalls in video-EEG interpretation, and how the investigation helped with diagnosis and subsequent management. The diagnostic process strongly emphasises seizure semiology, more so than EEG.

### Nonconvulsive status epilepticus: a review for emergency clinicians [^116kTj6V]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Status epilepticus is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is divided into convulsive status epilepticus and nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE).

Objective

This review provides a focused evaluation of NCSE for emergency clinicians.

Discussion

NCSE is a form of status epilepticus presenting with prolonged seizure activity. This disease is underdiagnosed, as it presents with nonspecific signs and symptoms, most commonly change in mental status without overt convulsive motor activity. Causes include epilepsy, cerebral pathology or injury, any systemic insult such as infection, and drugs or toxins. Mortality is primarily related to the underlying condition. Patients most commonly present with altered mental status, but other signs and symptoms include abnormal ocular movements and automatisms such as lip smacking or subtle motor twitches in the face or extremities. The diagnosis is divided into electrographic and electroclinical, and although electroencephalogram (EEG) is recommended for definitive diagnosis, emergency clinicians should consider this disease in patients with prolonged postictal state after a seizure with no improvement in mental status, altered mental status with acute cerebral pathology (e.g., stroke, hypoxic brain injury), and unexplained altered mental status. Assessment includes laboratory evaluation and neuroimaging with EEG. Management includes treating life-threatening conditions, including compromise of the airway, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and hypo- or hyperthermia, followed by rapid cessation of the seizure activity with benzodiazepines and other antiseizure medications.

Conclusions

An understanding of the presentation and management of NCSE can assist emergency clinicians in the care of these patients.

### All that shakes is not status epilepticus [^115a5tbd]. Epilepsy Currents (2021). Medium credibility.

What can we do though to mitigate these repercussions? First, we need to raise awareness in first responders and ED healthcare providers and instill in them the possibility of PNES when they encounter a shaking patient. In simple words, "all that shakes is not status epilepticus". Second, we need to educate them on the value of careful semiological analysis at the bedside that includes key phenomenological features (e.g. closed eyes, side-to-side head movements, asynchronous limb movements, rotation in bed, opisthotonus, and fluctuating course). In an era where smart phones provide instant access to video recordings and telemedicine is rapidly occupying a bigger share of medical practice worldwide, acquiring an expert opinion by a neurologist in a SE scenario similar to acute stroke codes should not be a far-fetched goal. The use of quickly applicable probability scoresto differentiate PNES from epileptic seizures (ES) based on pre-existing characteristics may further assist in decision making and facilitate the creation of medical-alert tags in the electronic records of patients with recurrent admissions. Where available, the application of rapidly applied by untrained personnel limited EEG recordings that can be wirelessly transmitted or automatically interpreted through reliable algorithms may add further value to avoid unnecessary initiation or escalation of treatment. Postictal laboratory biomarkers such as prolactin, creatine kinase, and leukocytosis that tend to be normal in PNES could be used as an adjunct, though their collection and elevation is often delayed. Most importantly, patients with PNES should be diagnosed promptly and treated appropriately in the outpatient setting, so that this diagnostic dilemma does not cross the ED doors. On the research realm, the misclassification of patients provides an impetus for redesigning future SE trials, but also focusing on this subset of patients with pPNES, with a goal to proactively distinguish them from the overall population with PNES, to highlight those more vulnerable to iatrogenic harm, and to identify their optimal treatment plan.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: when is a seizure not a seizure? Part 1, the younger child [^1131XSaT]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2016). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal non-epileptic events (PNEs) are common, and occur in all age groups ranging from neonates to young adults. The key to diagnosis in the majority is a detailed history and careful observation. However, a few can pose diagnostic challenges for the paediatrician to differentiate them from epileptic seizures. PNEs are usually recurrent, stereotyped and some of them tend to repeatedly occur within the same context. Although the vast majority have a benign nature, they can be a source of parental anxiety, unnecessary investigations and even potentially harmful treatments. In this review, we have described the common PNEs occurring in infants and preschool children. This will be followed by a second review for older children and adolescents. We have provided a practical diagnostic approach by dividing these events into three broad categories: PNEs associated with altered consciousness, PNEs not associated with apparently altered consciousness and sleep-related PNEs.

Neurology — lower-risk BRUE: neuroimaging. The guideline states "Clinicians Should Not Obtain Neuroimaging (Computed Tomography, MRI, or Ultrasonography) To Detect Neurologic Disorders in Infants Presenting With a Lower-Risk BRUE (Grade C, Moderate Recommendation)". Historical ALTE data report the long-term risk of neurologic disorders ranging "from 3% to 11%". In 243 ALTE patients, central nervous system (CNS) imaging "contributed to a neurologic diagnosis in 3% to 7% of patients". In a cohort of 471 patients, the sensitivity and positive-predictive value of abnormal CNS imaging for subsequent development of epilepsy was "6.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.2%–32%) and 25% (95% CI: 0.6%–81%), respectively". The "available evidence suggests minimal utility of CNS imaging" in lower-risk patients, and the authors note their recommendations are "not based on any prospective studies and only on a single retrospective study".

### Non-convulsive status epilepticus: mimics and chameleons [^111DJB6s]. Practical Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is an enigmatic condition with protean manifestations. It often goes unrecognised, leading to delays in its diagnosis and treatment. The principal reason for such delay is the failure to consider and request an electroencephalogram (EEG), although occasional presentations have no scalp or surface electroencephalographic correlate. In certain settings with limited EEG availability, particularly out-of-hours, clinicians should consider treating without an EEG. Patients need a careful risk-benefit analysis to assess the risks of neuronal damage and harm versus the risks of adverse effects from various intensities of therapeutic intervention. Specialists in EEG, intensive care or epilepsy are invaluable in the management of patients with possible NCSE.

### Pick your poison but Pick It wisely: choosing a second-line medication for the management of status epilepticus [^113s2dux]. Epilepsy Currents (2020). Medium credibility.

Of the approximately 50% of patients who did not show improvement with the initial medication trial, 70% received additional ASM and 25% showed clinical seizure cessation but not improvement in responsiveness raising the possibility of NCSE. In the absence of electroencephalography (EEG) to rule out NCSE, the authors were wise to include improved awareness and responsiveness to the efficacy outcome target. However, descriptions of improvement in mental status were broad and subjective. The standard of care for the diagnosis and monitoring of treatment of NCSE is long-term EEG, but having immediate access to EEG is difficult in the ER environment. Emerging technologies are looking to bridge this gap and allow immediate access to EEG in settings where it was not previously available. Electroencephalography also helps in the diagnosis of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures and SE which is a frequent cause of poor response to first- and second-line therapy. Making the diagnosis of PNES in the acute setting prevents unnecessary interventions and iatrogenic complications.

Abstract

An 18-year-old woman with a history of focal epilepsy presents with increasingly frequent seizures, encephalopathy, multiple laboratory abnormalities, and hypothermia. During her hospital course, her symptoms waxed and waned. Multiple etiologies of her symptoms were considered, but the spontaneous resolution of her symptoms and an abnormal MRI of the brain revealed the final diagnosis.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic management of a first unprovoked seizure in children and adolescents with a focus on the revised diagnostic criteria for epilepsy [^112mZVWB]. Journal of Child Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

By definition, unprovoked seizures are not precipitated by an identifiable factor, such as fever or trauma. A thorough history and physical examination are essential to caring for pediatric patients with a potential first unprovoked seizure. Differential diagnosis, EEG, neuroimaging, laboratory tests, and initiation of treatment will be reviewed. Treatment is typically initiated after 2 unprovoked seizures, or after 1 seizure in select patients with distinct epilepsy syndromes. Recent expansion of the definition of epilepsy by the ILAE allows for the diagnosis of epilepsy to be made after the first seizure if the clinical presentation and supporting diagnostic studies suggest a greater than 60% chance of a second seizure. This review summarizes the current literature on the diagnostic and therapeutic management of first unprovoked seizure in children and adolescents while taking into consideration the revised diagnostic criteria of epilepsy.

### Functional seizures and their mimics: a retrospective service review of cases from a tertiary video telemetry database [^1147dbuE]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

In another case, a single individual (5%) was thought to have paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) and not FS as originally diagnosed. In support of PKD were the events dystonic nature and triggered by movement. The patient was commenced on carbamazepine and a paroxysmal central nervous system gene panel was sent. A conclusive outcome of this case is not available due to pending investigation results and follow-up visits. However, the case emphasises the challenges in differentiating 'organic', or 'psychogenic', paroxysmal movement disorders from FS.

In another single case (5%), a patient was referred to our service with a suspected FS diagnosis and reported multiple events of a single semiology characterised by a marked symptoms of dizziness and dissociation before the seizure, with subsequent collapse to the floor and reduced responsiveness. These had been previously labelled as functional in nature with a previous normal MRI and interictal routine EEG. VTEEG subsequently revealed that the patient had shown dual pathology of both FS and ES arising from the right temporal lobe. Before the FS, the patient reported a feeling of going in and out of their body before falling to the floor in a controlled way and remaining unresponsive and still for several minutes. During the ES, the patient reported a similar experience prior to their seizures before developing a loss of awareness, oral automatisms and fidgety movements of the right hand, all associated with epileptiform discharges. Interestingly, although distinctly different semiologies were witnessed to separate these events on VTEEG, the patient's subjective experience of the two seizures was the same, leading them to believe they only had a single type of seizure.

Finally, one case (5%) of generalised epilepsy was misdiagnosed as suspected FS because seizures remained completely refractory to increasing doses of ASMs.

### All that shakes is not status epilepticus [^1155Ecpo]. Epilepsy Currents (2021). Medium credibility.

These limitations notwithstanding, this study highlights that pPNES are frequently encountered in the emergent setting and that they are commonly misdiagnosed and mismanaged. PNES status, arbitrarily defined as > 30 minutes duration, has been described in up to 78% of patients with PNES, and it is commonly recurrent. There are no robust data that these patients are demographically and phenomenologically different than those with short-lasting PNES, aside for an earlier and more dramatic presentationand a higher tendency to self-harm.PNES status is typically an escalation of a pre-existing diagnosis of PNES and tends to be semiologically alike. To complicate matters more, 12% of them have comorbid epilepsy, akin to the overall population with PNES. Adverse effects can occur in the acute setting as part of unnecessary interventions (e.g. lumbar punctures, placement of central lines, intubation, and drug administration). That results in unnecessary hospitalizations, some of which include an ICU stay, with substantial somatic, psychological, and financial repercussions to the patients, their families, and the health system, in terms of resource allocations.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 3 (GRACE-3): acute dizziness and vertigo in the emergency department [^117Q7pJT]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

GRACE-3 — summary of evidence for s-EVS in adults: The key differential diagnosis in s-EVS is between TIA (central) and vestibular migraine (benign central) or Ménière disease (peripheral). Over the past 15 years, the definition of a TIA has shifted from a time-based concept in which symptoms resolve in less than 24 h to a tissue-based concept, and since MRI is not usually done in the ED in the first hours of care, clinicians should understand this context. Patients with s-EVS are asymptomatic between episodes, and in vestibular migraine 24% reported a duration of episodes between 4 h and 3 days. The systematic reviews found limited direct evidence for diagnostic accuracy of some history elements and neuroimaging (MRI) in s-EVS, and direct evidence suggests routine neuroimaging in unselected s-EVS patients is unlikely to be cost-effective; focused history-taking is supported, including attention to whether episodes occur over a shorter period of time (< 6 months).

### Multidisciplinary consensus guideline for the diagnosis and management of spontaneous intracranial hypotension [^117QoboL]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Q5. What first-line investigation(s) should be performed in patients with suspected SIH?

Ideally, MRI of the brain with intravenous contrast and MRI whole spine should be performed as first-line investigations. If not possible to achieve both at the same time, MRI of the brain with contrast should be performed as the first-line investigation.

MRI of the brain with contrast is essential to look for imaging signs that confirm the diagnosis of SIH (see figure 2). MRI of the whole spine is not always necessary for the diagnosis and is unlikely to locate the site of the CSF leak, but it can be helpful to identify the presence of findings that may direct subsequent invasive myelography.

Figure 2
Typical MRI findings of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH). (A) Sagittal T1 image showing enlargement of the pituitary, decreased mamillopontine distance, sagging of the brainstem and cerebellar tonsillar descent. (B) Axial T1 postcontrast image showing diffuse smooth dural thickening and pachymeningeal contrast enhancement. (C) Coronal T2 image showing distension of the dural venous sinuses. (D) Sagittal T2 image showing extensive ventral spinal longitudinal epidural collection (SLEC) extending from the upper cervical to thoracic regions. (E) Axial T2 image showing ventral SLEC.

If MRI is unavailable or if it is contraindicated, CT of the brain may show some of the findings supportive of the diagnosis.

Lumbar puncture should not routinely be performed for the sole purpose of confirming the diagnosis of SIH. If lumbar puncture is being performed for other reasons, such as to exclude alternative diagnoses, a CSF opening pressure should be measured at the time.

MRI of the brain protocol should include:

T2 weighted (any plane) at 4–5 mm thickness or isotropic volume.
Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (axial or coronal) at 4–5 mm thickness or isotropic volume.
T2✱-weighted gradient echo (GRE) or susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) (axial) at 2–5 mm thickness.
Precontrast and postcontrast 3D isotropic volumetric T1-weighted acquisitions OR T1-weighted spin echo at 4–5 mm thickness in the sagittal and one other plane.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with seizures [^1118o3e1]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Adult patients with a first-time seizure who have returned to baseline — laboratory evaluation is primarily guided by history and physical examination, and the literature suggests that laboratory testing is of very low yield in patients with a new-onset seizure who have returned to baseline. The history and physical examination will predict the majority of patients who will have a laboratory abnormality, and patients with altered mental status, fever, or a new local neurologic deficit require more extensive evaluation. Glucose abnormalities and hyponatremia are the most frequent abnormalities identified and are usually predicted by the history and physical examination. In 1 prospective study of 163 patients, 1 unexpected case of hypoglycemia was discovered, and in a prospective study of 136 patients, Turnbull et al found 4 cases of hypoglycemia and 4 cases of hyperglycemia. Two of the cases of hypoglycemia were not suspected on the basis of the history and physical examination. The diagnosis of an alcohol withdrawal seizure should be a diagnosis of exclusion, especially in patients presenting with a first-time seizure.

(B) Anterior temporal cysts in a patient with neonatal VWM. (C) Hydrocephalus with ventriculomegaly in a patient with neonatal presentation. (D) Severe atrophy due to loss of cerebral white matter, leading to ventriculomegaly. (E) Extensive diffusion restriction in the cerebral white matter and internal capsule, with high signal on the DWI and low signal on the ADC maps. Only the frontal deep white matter that is mildly rarefied on T2 FLAIR imaging has an increased diffusion. ADC = apparent diffusion coefficient; DWI = diffusion-weighted imaging; FLAIR = fluid-attenuated inversion recovery; VWM = vanishing white matter.

Prediction of Disease Course

Full agreement was reached on disease course prediction. Key predictors include age at onset and genotype, of which age at onset is the strongest predictor. Typically, earlier onset is associated with faster disease progression. A previous natural history study showed that, especially for onset before the age of 4 years, earlier onset was associated with faster disease progression. It is important to note that other factors co-determine the disease course, such as the presence of ISR stressors. With longer disease duration, the occurrence of such factors becomes more likely, contributing to increasing disease variability. It was noted that these stressors constitute a risk of triggering an episode of acute decline, but that such an episode does not always follow. Prediction by genotype is hampered by disease variability, also between siblings, and by the lack of comprehensive information in the case of novel variants, which frequently occur.

### Management of status epilepticus | AAFP… [^111aqEud]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Definition, Classification, and Epidemiology DEFINITION A decade ago, the EFA convened a working group to define status epilepticus. 4 They described this condition as two or more sequential seizures without full recovery of consciousness between seizures, or more than 30 minutes of continuous seizure activity. 4 This definition is generally accepted, although some investigators consider shorter durations of seizure activity to constitute status epilepticus. Practically speaking, any person who exhibits persistent seizure activity or who does not regain consciousness for five minutes or more after a witnessed seizure should be considered to have status epilepticus. EPIDEMIOLOGY Status epilepticus of partial onset accounts for the majority of episodes. The rate of mortality from status epilepticus was 22 percent in the Richmond study. Physicians first should assess the patient's airway and oxygenation.

If the airway is clear and intubation is not immediately required, blood pressure and pulse should be checked and oxygen administered. In patients with a history of seizures, an attempt should be made to determine whether medications have been taken recently. A screening neurologic examination should be performed to check for signs of a focal intracranial lesion. 20 used EEG to diagnose status epilepticus in 37 percent of patients with altered consciousness whose diagnosis was unclear on the basis of clinical criteria. A surprising number of patients had no clinical signs of status epilepticus, and EEG was necessary to establish the diagnosis. EEG also can help to confirm that an episode of status epilepticus has ended, particularly when questions arise about the possibility of recurrent episodes of more subtle seizures. In another study. 21 investigators monitored patients for at least 24 hours after clinical signs of status epilepticus had ended.

They found that nearly one half of their patients continued to demonstrate electro-graphic seizures that often had no clinical correlation. The investigators concluded that EEG monitoring after presumed control of status epilepticus is essential for optimal management. Patients with status epilepticus who fail to recover rapidly and completely should be monitored with EEG for at least 24 hours after an episode to ensure that recurrent seizures are not missed. Monitoring also is advised if periodic discharges appear in the EEG of a patient with altered consciousness who has not had obvious seizures. Periodic discharges in these patients suggest the possibility of preceding status epilepticus, and careful monitoring may clarify the etiology of the discharges and allow the detection of recurrent status epilepticus.
