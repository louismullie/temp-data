## Question

difference between multiple myeloma and plasma cell leukemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differences between multiple myeloma (MM) and plasma cell leukemia (PCL), including definitions, epidemiology, clinical features, prognostic thresholds, biology, and treatment implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic criteria that define MM versus PCL. Then, I should verify epidemiology and precursor states. Next, I will compare clinical and laboratory phenotypes. After that, I need to check the prognostic impact of circulating plasma cell (CPC) thresholds and reconcile historical versus revised cutoffs. Then, I will examine biologic and genomic distinctions. I should confirm recommended diagnostic workup elements that detect PCL accurately. Finally, I will review divergent treatment paradigms and synthesize the key differentiators that drive management choices [^112gdyVW] [^112m26NW] [^111EKXf2].

> Let me first confirm core definitions to avoid any drift. MM is a clonal plasma cell malignancy primarily resident in bone marrow; diagnosis requires at least 10% clonal marrow plasma cells or a biopsy-proven plasmacytoma plus myeloma-defining events, including CRAB and SLiM biomarkers, which permits treatment before overt end-organ damage in high-risk biomarker-defined disease, and I should double-check that I use the updated SLiM-CRAB framework correctly [^112gdyVW]. Hold on, I should verify the modern PCL definition too; the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) revised primary PCL to be defined by morphology with at least 5% CPCs on peripheral smear in patients who otherwise meet criteria for symptomatic MM, superseding the historical 20% and/or ≥ 2 × 10⁹/L absolute count threshold because 5–19% CPCs carry similarly dismal outcomes, and I need to emphasize that secondary PCL denotes leukemic transformation from relapsed/refractory MM [^112m26NW] [^1123eaA1] [^111EKXf2].

> I need to review epidemiology to set context. MM is common in older adults and is almost invariably preceded by precursor states MGUS and smoldering MM, and I should confirm typical age and progression rates before I ascribe risk stratification implications [^1117XxkV]. In contrast, PCL is rare, constituting roughly 1–2% of plasma cell dyscrasias, with primary PCL historically more frequent than secondary PCL, although the latter appears to be rising with modern MM therapy; importantly, PCL tends to present at a younger median age and with more aggressive biology, and I should note this when thinking about therapeutic intensity [^1133wmqH] [^117BrZ4V].

> Next, I will examine clinical and laboratory phenotypes, but wait, let me verify which features are truly enriched in PCL versus MM. PCL more commonly presents with extramedullary disease, higher tumor lysis potential, severe cytopenias including thrombocytopenia, hypercalcemia, elevated LDH and β2-microglobulin, and worse renal impairment, while paradoxically having fewer classic lytic bone lesions despite higher proliferative burden, and I should ensure I keep marrow reserve issues in mind for early supportive care planning [^112wmqas] [^112mp5NE] [^116p9DDJ].

> I should now confirm the prognostic role of circulating plasma cell thresholds. Historically, ≥ 20% CPCs or ≥ 2 × 10⁹/L defined PCL, but multiple datasets show that ≥ 5% CPCs by morphology portend outcomes comparable to classic PCL; median overall survival around 1.1–1.4 years in the modern era for ≥ 5% CPCs compared with over 5 years in standard MM confirms why IMWG lowered the threshold, and I need to keep that mortality delta in perspective during initial triage [^111EKXf2] [^1179XTfq] [^112m26NW]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought 6–14 months was only a historical figure for classic PCL; in fact, survival remains approximately 13 months in some series even with novel agents, aligning with the revised threshold's rationale, so the correction strengthens the case for earlier recognition and intensified treatment [^111EKXf2].

> But wait, what if we use more sensitive detection methods than morphology; I need to check the emerging data on circulating tumor plasma cells by next-generation flow. Prospective analyses suggest that ≥ 2% circulating tumor plasma cells (CTCs) identify an ultra–high-risk "PCL-like MM" subset with markedly inferior progression-free and overall survival, which complements but does not replace the IMWG morphology-based ≥ 5% diagnostic definition of PCL; this nuance matters for risk-adapted therapy in MM and for early referral to clinical trials [^116Sg5Jd] [^115mYQoA] [^112m26NW].

> I will now examine biologic and genetic distinctions that underpin the clinical divergence. Compared with MM, PCL shows universal or near-universal 1q gains and a higher frequency of chromosomal losses, notably 13q and 16q, alongside more frequent IGH translocations such as t(11;14) and t(14;16), and I should double-check these patterns since they influence therapeutic options like BCL2 inhibition in t(11;14) disease [^113m8gDu]. Transcriptomic work reveals that even when sharing high-risk lesions like 17p deletion, PCL clusters apart from MM with thousands of differentially expressed genes and isoforms, including dysregulation of spliceosomal machinery, suggesting fundamental differences in RNA processing and microenvironment independence via altered adhesion and chemokine signaling, which I need to remember when anticipating extramedullary spread and chemoresistance [^111PB65A] [^112wmqas].

> I should confirm survival disparities in contemporary cohorts and reconcile any apparent inconsistencies. While retrospective series of patients with ≥ 5% CPCs demonstrate median OS near 1–1.5 years, some modern single-center cohorts that include intensively treated extramedullary disease and PCL report somewhat longer survival for primary PCL, around two years, whereas secondary PCL remains catastrophic, underscoring that biology and line of therapy modulate outcomes; this variability does not negate the ultra–high-risk classification but highlights the urgency of rapid cytoreduction and consolidation [^111EKXf2] [^117WpnPd].

> Next, I should review diagnostic workup elements to ensure we do not miss PCL at presentation. Careful peripheral smear review by experienced morphology is essential, with at least 100–200 nucleated cells assessed to detect CPCs at or above the 5% threshold, and I need to exclude reactive plasmacytosis by establishing clonality via flow cytometry when needed [^112mp5NE] [^1133wmqH]. Concurrently, comprehensive MM staging with laboratory markers, serum free light chains, and whole-body imaging with PET-CT, whole-body MRI, or low-dose whole-body CT is recommended to define disease burden and extramedullary sites, which impacts both risk assignment and initial therapy selection [^117EXSGP] [^112gdyVW] [^115fREST].

> Let me think about standard MM treatment to anchor the contrast. For newly diagnosed transplant-eligible MM, triplet induction such as bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone followed by high-dose melphalan and autologous transplant with maintenance is standard, whereas transplant-ineligible patients often receive triplet or anti-CD38–based regimens like DRd or D-VMP, and I should confirm conditioning as high-dose melphalan 200 mg/m² when feasible [^112gdyVW] [^111CHJP9].

> Now, I should verify how PCL management diverges given its biology. PCL requires immediate, intensive induction that rapidly debulks — typically proteasome inhibitor–based triplets or quadruplets incorporating an IMiD and often an anti-CD38 antibody — prompt early consolidation with ASCT, consideration of tandem ASCT or carefully selected allogeneic transplant in fit patients, and maintenance or clinical trial enrollment recognizing short remission durations; I need to stress that delays worsen outcomes and that cytotoxic chemotherapy may be layered in select cases with explosive disease or extramedullary involvement [^112wmqas] [^113791cz] [^115P1uHQ] [^114MFSrw].

> Hold on, I should also confirm risk-adapted options that exploit genetics and disease distribution. In t(11;14) myeloma and PCL, BCL2 inhibition with venetoclax has activity and may be incorporated in later lines or trials, and for extensive extramedullary disease or ambiguous bone involvement, FDG PET/CT helps guide local and systemic strategies; similarly, advanced immunotherapies such as BCMA-targeting CAR T cells or bispecific antibodies may be prioritized in refractory settings where available [^113fGecn] [^1149tEJ3].

> To synthesize, MM is a primarily marrow-resident, microenvironment-dependent plasma cell malignancy with median survival exceeding five years in many contemporary cohorts, whereas PCL is defined by at least 5% CPCs on smear, reflecting microenvironment independence, high genomic instability, extensive extramedullary tropism, and dramatically inferior survival that mandates intensified, time-sensitive therapy; I should double-check that this conceptual split stays anchored to the revised IMWG definition and the cytogenetic-transcriptomic differences that justify management divergence [^112m26NW] [^113m8gDu] [^111PB65A] [^111EKXf2].

Multiple myeloma (MM) and plasma cell leukemia (PCL) are both plasma cell malignancies; PCL is defined by **≥ 5% circulating plasma cells** [^1123eaA1] in peripheral blood [^112m26NW], while MM is primarily bone marrow–based, with < 5% circulating plasma cells [^112B33nv]. PCL is **more aggressive** [^112wmqas], with frequent extramedullary involvement, higher rates of cytopenias, and a markedly poorer prognosis (median OS ~12–18 months) [^111EKXf2] than MM (median OS ~5–7 years) [^115ErVsj]. PCL requires **urgent, intensive therapy** [^1135dRqd], including proteasome inhibitor–based induction, early autologous stem cell transplantation [^113791cz], and consideration of allogeneic transplantation or novel immunotherapies [^112MMB1D] [^113fGecn]; in contrast, MM is managed with standard triplet/quadruplet regimens [^112gdyVW] and autologous transplantation in eligible patients [^111CHJP9].

| **Feature** | **Multiple myeloma (MM)** | **Plasma cell leukemia (PCL)** |
|-|-|-|
| Diagnostic criteria | Bone marrow plasma cells ≥ 10% or biopsy-proven plasmacytoma [^112gdyVW], with < 5% circulating plasma cells [^112B33nv] | ≥ 5% circulating plasma cells in peripheral blood [^1123eaA1] [^112m26NW] |
| Clinical presentation | - Bone pain [^117BrZ4V] <br/> - Anemia [^112gdyVW] <br/> - Hypercalcemia [^114T5mNA] <br/> - Renal impairment [^117EXSGP] <br/> - Bone lesions [^1149tEJ3] | - Aggressive course [^112wmqas] <br/> - Cytopenias [^111EKXf2] <br/> - Extramedullary involvement [^117WpnPd] <br/> - Hepatosplenomegaly [^112wmqas] <br/> - Lymphadenopathy [^112wmqas] <br/> - CNS involvement [^1135dRqd] |
| Laboratory findings | - Monoclonal protein [^114T5mNA] <br/> - Anemia [^112gdyVW] <br/> - Hypercalcemia [^117BrZ4V] <br/> - Renal impairment [^117EXSGP] | - High circulating plasma cells [^1123eaA1] <br/> - Severe cytopenias [^111EKXf2] <br/> - Elevated LDH [^112wmqas] <br/> - Hypercalcemia [^112wmqas] <br/> - Renal impairment [^1135dRqd] |
| Prognosis | Median OS is approximately 5–7 years [^111EKXf2] [^115ErVsj] | Median OS is approximately 12–18 months [^111EKXf2] [^1135dRqd] [^112m26NW] |
| Treatment | Standard regimens (e.g. VRd, DRd) and autologous stem cell transplantation are used [^112gdyVW] [^113Tjnvx] | - Urgent intensive therapy [^113791cz] <br/> - Proteasome inhibitor–based induction [^1135dRqd] <br/> - Early autologous stem cell transplantation [^114EsGxC] <br/> - Consider allogeneic transplantation or novel immunotherapies [^112MMB1D] [^113fGecn] |

---

In summary, the key distinction is the presence of **≥ 5% circulating plasma cells** [^1123eaA1] in PCL, which underlies its **aggressive course**, poorer prognosis [^112m26NW], and need for **more intensive therapy** compared with MM.

### Revised diagnostic criteria for plasma cell leukemia: Results of a Mayo Clinic study with comparison of outcomes to multiple myeloma [^111EKXf2]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Overall survival in patients with detectable circulating plasma cells (CPCs) was analyzed. The overall survival of these patients at diagnosis was stratified by three categories: < 5%, 5–19%, and ≥ 20% CPCs on peripheral blood smear (Figure 1a), as well as by < 5% and ≥ 5% CPCs on peripheral blood smear (Figure 1b).

- **Comparison with multiple myeloma (MM)**: Figure 2 illustrates the overall survival of patients with ≥ 5% CPCs (n = 122, median OS: 1.1 years [0.8–1.4]) compared to a cohort of MM patients diagnosed between 1971 and 2016, who had no detectable CPCs at diagnosis (n = 9724, median OS: 4.4 years [4.3–4.5], p < 0.001). In the era of novel therapies post-1 January 2001, survival of patients with ≥ 5% CPCs (n = 62, median OS: 1.4 years [0.8–2.5]) remained poorer compared to MM patients (n = 5345, median OS: 5.7 years [5.5–6.0], p < 0.001) [Figure 3a].

- **Survival comparison with cytogenetic information**: We also compared the survival of patients with ≥ 5% CPCs (diagnosed from 2001 onwards) to MM patients diagnosed in the same era with available cytogenetic information (n = 1707). The median OS in those with ≥ 5% CPCs (n = 62, median OS: 1.4 years [0.8–2.5]) was significantly lower compared to patients with both standard-risk MM (n = 1326, median OS: 7.5 years [7.0–8.7]) and high-risk MM (n = 381, median OS: 4.3 years [3.5–4.9], p < 0.001) [Figure 3b].

### Primary plasma cell leukemia: Consensus definition by the International Myeloma Working Group according to peripheral blood plasma cell percentage [^1123eaA1]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Primary plasma cell leukemia (PCL) has a consistently ominous prognosis, even after progress in the last decades. PCL deserves prompt identification to initiate the most effective treatment for this ultra-high-risk disease. The aim of this position paper is to revisit the diagnosis of PCL based on the presence of circulating plasma cells in patients who otherwise meet diagnostic criteria for multiple myeloma.

- **Retrospective studies**: We identified two retrospective series addressing the number of circulating plasma cells in peripheral blood required to define PCL. The presence of ≥ 5% circulating plasma cells in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) had a similarly adverse prognostic impact as the previously defined PCL.

Therefore, PCL should be defined by the presence of 5% or more circulating plasma cells in peripheral blood smears in patients otherwise diagnosed with symptomatic multiple myeloma.

### Plasma cell leukemia: Definition, presentation, and treatment [^1135dRqd]. Current Oncology Reports (2019). Low credibility.

We discuss topics on the definition of plasma cell leukemia and the distinction between plasma cell leukemia and multiple myeloma. Moreover, we review the latest literature on how to treat plasma cell leukemia.

- **Recent findings**: Plasma cell leukemia is clinically and genetically distinct from multiple myeloma. It is defined by the observation in blood of more than 20% clonal plasma cells by differential count of the leucocytes or by counting more than 2×10⁹ per liter circulating clonal plasma cells. However, patients with lower levels of circulating plasma cells have the same adverse prognosis, which challenges the disease definition. Survival has improved after the implementation of high-dose chemotherapy with stem-cell support, bortezomib, and lenalidomide in the treatment; yet, the prognosis remains poor. The results of allo-transplants have been disappointing. The diagnostic criteria of plasma cell leukemia are currently discussed in the international myeloma community. Despite some improvement in survival, the prognosis remains adverse. New, more targeted treatment modalities, including immunotherapies, will hopefully improve the outcome in the near future.

### Prognostic impact of circulating plasma cells in patients with multiple myeloma: Implications for plasma cell leukemia definition [^112B33nv]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

As highlighted in the last consensus by IMWG, the diagnosis of PCL has been traditionally based on the presence of more than 20% circulating plasma cells (PCs) and/or an absolute count greater than 2 × 10⁹/L PCs. However, our study shows that lower peripheral blood PC counts, specifically those with ≥ 5% peripheral blood plasma cells, should be considered a diagnostic criterion of PCL, described as "PCL-like" myeloma or early PCL. This is due to their independent and strong prognostic impact. Prospective multicenter analyses, along with translational and correlative studies into the biology of these patients, are encouraged, as well as risk-oriented therapeutic strategies. Careful examination of peripheral blood by conventional microscopy should be conducted for all patients with multiple myeloma (MM) in daily clinical practice.

In conclusion, the presence of ≥ 5% circulating PCs by conventional cytology easily identifies a group of myeloma patients with a prognosis as poor as that of PCL, suggesting that the diagnosis of PCL needs to be revisited. If confirmed in other series, especially in prospective studies of uniformly treated patients, such individuals may benefit from a distinct and more intensified therapeutic approach.

### How I treat plasma cell leukemia [^112wmqas]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

Primary plasma cell leukemia (pPCL) is a rare and aggressive plasma cell proliferative disorder characterized by a very poor prognosis. This condition presents distinct biologic, clinical, and laboratory features. Compared with multiple myeloma, pPCL more frequently manifests with extramedullary involvement, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypercalcemia, elevated serum β(2)-microglobulin, and lactate dehydrogenase levels, as well as impaired renal function. Many genetic aberrations observed in newly diagnosed pPCL are typically found in advanced multiple myeloma. These cytogenetic abnormalities and mutations lead to increased proliferation, enhanced inhibition of apoptosis, escape from immune surveillance, and independence from the bone marrow microenvironment, with changes in the expression of adhesion molecules or chemokine receptors.

The outcome of pPCL has improved with the introduction of autologous stem cell transplantation and combination approaches with novel agents, including bortezomib and immunomodulatory drugs, such as lenalidomide. In this review, we provide an overview of currently available therapeutic options and recommend how these treatment modalities can best be used to improve outcomes for plasma cell leukemia patients.

### Prognostic impact of circulating plasma cells in patients with multiple myeloma: Implications for plasma cell leukemia definition [^1179XTfq]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

The presence of circulating plasma cells in patients with multiple myeloma is considered a marker for highly proliferative disease. In this study, the impact of circulating plasma cells assessed by cytology on survival of patients with multiple myeloma was analyzed. Wright-Giemsa stained peripheral blood smears of 482 patients with newly diagnosed myeloma or plasma cell leukemia were reviewed. Patients were classified into four categories according to the percentage of circulating plasma cells: 0%, 1–4%, 5–20%, and plasma cell leukemia, with the following frequencies: 382 (79.2%), 83 (17.2%), 12 (2.5%), and 5 (1.0%), respectively.

Median overall survival according to the circulating plasma cells group was 47, 50, 6, and 14 months, respectively. At multivariate analysis, the presence of 5 to 20% circulating plasma cells was associated with a worse overall survival (relative risk 4.9, 95% CI 2.6–9.3), independently of age, creatinine, the Durie-Salmon system stage, and the International Staging System (ISS) stage. Patients with ≥ 5% circulating plasma cells had lower platelet counts (median 86×10⁹/L vs. 214×10⁹/L, P < 0.0001) and higher bone marrow plasma cells (median 53% vs. 36%, P = 0.004). The presence of ≥ 5% circulating plasma cells in patients with multiple myeloma has a similar adverse prognostic impact as plasma cell leukemia.

### Differences in genetic changes between multiple myeloma and plasma cell leukemia demonstrated by comparative genomic hybridization [^113m8gDu]. Leukemia (2001). Low credibility.

To analyze the genomic differences between multiple myeloma (MM) and plasma cell leukemia (PCL), a total of 30 cases were studied using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). In five cases with a low proportion of plasma cells (PC) in bone marrow, an enrichment of PC was performed using immunomagnetic beads conjugated with the monoclonal antibody B-B4. CGH analysis identified DNA copy number changes in 24 out of the 25 MM patients (96%) and in all five PCL patients (100%); in the MM case without chromosomal imbalances, the immunomagnetic enrichment of PC had failed.

- **Changes in MM patients**: The most recurrent changes were gains at chromosomes 15q (48%), 11q (44%), 3q (40%), 9q (40%), and 1q (36%).

- **Changes in PCL patients**: All showed gains in 1q. Losses of chromosomal material were significantly more frequent in PCL than in MM patients (P = 0.03). Specifically, losses occurred on 13q in 80% of PCL vs 28% of MM, and on chromosome 16 in 80% vs 12%, respectively. Additionally, PCL patients exhibited losses of 2q and 6p that were not present in MM.

The CGH data show differences in chromosomal imbalances between MM and PCL.

### Distinct clonal identities of B-ALLs arising after lenalidomide therapy for multiple myeloma [^115DqiVQ]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant clonal expansion of plasma cells that exists on a spectrum with other plasma cell dyscrasias and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. It is the second most common hematologic malignancy and results in considerable morbidity and mortality due to its tendency to affect older patients.

Therapy for myeloma has rapidly evolved in the last two decades. Modern therapy involves a multimodal approach, often starting with a combination regimen of immune modulators, proteasome inhibitors, biologics, and/or corticosteroids. Eligible patients are typically offered high-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) due to its potential for prolonged remission. Long-term maintenance therapy with lenalidomide after HCT has been shown to improve survival. However, several studies have noted an increased frequency of secondary malignancies. For instance, one study reported a hazard ratio of 2.03 (P = 0.015) for a second primary hematologic malignancy in patients with MM treated with lenalidomide.

These secondary malignancies are described as clonally distinct from the primary tumor. In particular, B-ALL malignancies have demonstrated inferior outcomes relative to those developed in the absence of therapeutic pressure. As practice patterns have shifted, larger numbers of patients are receiving maintenance lenalidomide, leading to a corresponding increase in secondary malignancies, especially hematologic malignancies.

### Smoldering multiple myeloma current treatment algorithms [^1117XxkV]. Blood Cancer Journal (2022).

The diagnostic criteria, staging system, response criteria, and management of multiple myeloma (MM) have evolved significantly in the last decade. Almost all patients with MM evolve from a pre-malignant stage termed monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). MGUS is present in approximately 5% of the population above the age of 50 and progresses to MM or related malignancy at a rate of 1% per year. Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is an intermediate asymptomatic condition that lies between MGUS and MM along the spectrum of clonal plasma cell proliferative disorders. It is important from a clinical standpoint to distinguish SMM from MGUS because the risk of progression of SMM is ten times higher than MGUS in the first five years following diagnosis. SMM progresses to multiple myeloma at a rate of approximately 10% per year over the first five years following diagnosis, 3% per year over the next five years, and 1.5% per year thereafter. Recent data confirm that the highest risk of progression is in the first five years, with 2-, 5-, and 10-year risks of progression of 22%, 42%, and 64%, respectively. Thus, the type of follow-up and counseling are different for MGUS and SMM.

SMM is present in approximately 0.5% of the population above the age of 40 years and accounts for approximately 15% of all cases of newly diagnosed MM. It is distinguished from MGUS based on the M protein concentration and percentage of clonal BMPCs. Light chain SMM is a unique subtype of SMM in which there is monoclonal free light chain (FLC) excess with no expression of an intact immunoglobulin molecule.

### Multiple myeloma [^117BrZ4V]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2017). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma is a malignancy of terminally differentiated plasma cells, and patients typically present with bone marrow infiltration of clonal plasma cells and monoclonal protein in the serum and/or urine. The diagnosis of multiple myeloma is made when there is clear end-organ damage attributable to the plasma cell proliferative disorder or when findings suggest a high likelihood of their development. Distinguishing symptomatic multiple myeloma that requires treatment from the precursor stages of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and smouldering multiple myeloma is important, as observation is the standard for those conditions.

Much progress has been made over the past decade in the understanding of disease biology and individualized treatment approaches. Several new classes of drugs, such as proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs, have joined the traditional armamentarium (corticosteroids, alkylating agents, and anthracyclines) and, along with high-dose therapy and autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation, have led to deeper and more durable clinical responses. Indeed, an increasing proportion of patients are achieving lasting remissions, raising the possibility of a cure for this disease. Success will probably depend on using combinations of effective agents and treating patients in the early stages of the disease, such as patients with smouldering multiple myeloma.

### Primary plasma cell leukemia: Consensus definition by the International Myeloma Working Group according to peripheral blood plasma cell percentage [^111unxfK]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Primary plasma cell leukemia (PCL) has a consistently ominous prognosis, even after progress in the last decades. PCL deserves prompt identification to initiate the most effective treatment for this ultra-high-risk disease. The aim of this position paper is to revisit the diagnosis of PCL according to the presence of circulating plasma cells in patients otherwise meeting diagnostic criteria for multiple myeloma.

Two retrospective series were identified where the question arose about what number of circulating plasma cells in peripheral blood should be used for defining PCL. The presence of ≥ 5% circulating plasma cells in patients with multiple myeloma had a similar adverse prognostic impact as previously defined PCL. Therefore, PCL should be defined by the presence of 5% or more circulating plasma cells in peripheral blood smears in patients otherwise diagnosed with symptomatic multiple myeloma.

### More than 2% of circulating tumor plasma cells defines plasma cell leukemia-like multiple myeloma [^116Sg5Jd]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematologic malignancy characterized by the expansion and accumulation of clonal plasma cells (PCs) in the bone marrow (BM). However, tumor PCs are able to egress from the BM to the peripheral blood (PB), where they are responsible for dissemination and extramedullary disease. Due to recent technological advances, circulating tumor plasma cells (CTCs) can be detected in the majority of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) using highly sensitive techniques, such as next-generation flow cytometry (NGF).

Quantification of CTCs has been recently proposed as one of the most relevant prognostic factors in NDMM, making it an ideal novel parameter for risk stratification. Patients with NDMM may present with a variable number of CTCs, ranging from zero, which is associated with exceptionally favorable outcomes, to higher numbers of CTCs, which indicate adverse prognoses. Nevertheless, there are virtually no published data on the prognostic significance of CTCs in transplant-ineligible patients with NDMM.

As an extreme, on the other end of the spectrum, are patients with ≥ 20% of CTCs who are considered to be diagnosed with primary plasma cell leukemia (pPCL), a distinct and rare clinical entity with the most aggressive behavior. In 2021, the International Myeloma Working Group decreased this threshold to ≥ 5% of CTCs evaluated by morphology to better reflect the ultra-high-risk nature of these patients. Here, we hypothesized that we could define new criteria to identify patients with ultra-high-risk PCL-like MM.

### Primary plasma cell leukemia: Consensus definition by the International Myeloma Working Group according to peripheral blood plasma cell percentage [^114PFCNU]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Low credibility.

We have reviewed the literature, looking for validation of alternative cutoffs for the diagnosis of primary PCL in prospective or retrospective series of patients with MM. We could identify only two retrospective series where the question about the number of circulating plasma cells in peripheral blood should be used for defining PCL arose. The objective in both groups was to investigate if lower values (such as 5% or more plasma cells) have the same prognostic impact as the historical criteria.

In a previous report from China, the impact of the morphological examination was also assessed, even if the cutoff for the high-risk group/PCL was not consistent with the other reports. This study was excluded because it only stratified MM patients with vs. without circulating plasma cells using a cut-off of 2%, instead of 5% as in the other included papers. There are other experiences validating the lower cutoff of 5% with prognostic significance similar to classical PCL, but these were only presented at meetings.

The objective was to summarize the results of previously published data regarding the outcomes of patients with a lower circulating plasma cell threshold from both series, one from 5 university hospitals in Catalonia, Spain (100 patients), and the other from Mayo Clinic (176 patients), in order to support the new definition of PCL. These cases were compared to simultaneous and consecutive controls over the same period in the first series (382 patients) and historical controls in the second series (9724 patients), respectively. The Catalan series was published previously, serving as a comparative cohort.

### 2021 European Myeloma Network review and consensus statement on smoldering multiple myeloma: How to distinguish (and manage) Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde [^114WCbtp]. Haematologica (2021). Low credibility.

According to the updated International Myeloma Working Group criteria, smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is an asymptomatic plasma cell disorder characterized by an M-component greater than 3 g/dL, bone marrow plasma cell infiltration greater than 10% and less than 60%, and the absence of any myeloma-defining event. Active multiple myeloma is preceded by SMM, with a median time to progression of approximately five years. Cases of SMM range from the extremes of "monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance-like", in which patients never progress during their lifetimes, to "early multiple myeloma", where transformation into symptomatic disease, based on genomic evolution, may be rapid and devastating.

Such a "split personality" makes the prognosis and management of individual patients challenging, particularly with regard to the identification and possible early treatment of high-risk SMM. Outside of clinical trials, the conventional approach to SMM generally remains close observation until progression to active multiple myeloma. However, two prospective, randomized trials have recently demonstrated a significant clinical benefit in terms of time to progression, and of overall survival in one of the two studies, for some patients with higher-risk SMM treated with lenalidomide ± dexamethasone, raising the question of whether such an approach should be considered a new standard of care.

In this paper, experts from the European Myeloma Network describe biological and clinical knowledge on SMM, focusing on novel insights into its molecular pathogenesis and new prognostic scoring systems proposed to identify individuals at higher risk of progression.

### Imaging of multiple myeloma and related plasma cell dyscrasias [^116p9DDJ]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell malignancy of the bone marrow. MM has three components: diffuse marrow infiltration, focal bone lesions, and soft-tissue (extramedullary) disease. The hallmark biomarker in blood or urine is a monoclonal immunoglobulin, the monoclonal protein. Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is a similar disease with secretion of IgM. Staging is classically performed with the 1975 Durie-Salmon system, which includes conventional radiographs. Recently updated, the Durie-Salmon Plus staging system includes CT, MRI, and (18)F-FDG PET/CT.

The hallmark radiographic lesion of symptomatic MM is a well-demarcated, focal osteolytic bone lesion. The number of focal bone lesions correlates inversely with outcome. Extramedullary disease is typically an aggressive, poorly differentiated form of MM that confers inferior outcome, with a median survival of less than one year if present at diagnosis. Achievement of a complete response on (18)F-FDG PET before stem-cell transplantation correlates with a superior outcome.

### Monoclonal gammopathy of increasing significance: Time to screen [^115UdofE]. Haematologica (2023). High credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy (MG) is a frequently detected clonal B-cell or plasma-cell disorder. Importantly, every multiple myeloma (MM) case is preceded by MG. Although clinical algorithms now allow earlier treatment of patients with biomarkers of malignancy before MM-induced tissue damage (CRAB) occurs, most patients are still diagnosed late. It is important to revisit how MG should be managed in clinical practice and whether screening is required.

As the prevalence of MG and other medical co-morbidities both rise with increasing age, the degree of contribution of MG to disease states other than malignant progression is often unclear. This can lead to monitoring lapses and under-recognition of the organ dysfunction that can occur with monoclonal gammopathy of clinical significance (MGCS). Therefore, models of progression to MM and/or MGCS require further refinement.

While MG is currently detected incidentally, a case for screening has been made with ongoing studies in this area. Screening has the potential benefit of earlier detection and prevention of both MGCS and delayed MM presentations; however, important drawbacks include the psychosocial impact on individuals and resource burden on healthcare services. MG terminology should transition alongside our increasing understanding of the condition and genomic characterization that have already begun to revise the MG nomenclature.

The biology of MG has been poorly understood and is often inferred from the biology of MM, which is unhelpful. We review the literature and case for MG screening in this paper. In particular, we highlight a need for further research in this field.

### European myeloma network recommendations on tools for the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma: What to use and when [^114T5mNA]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

The classification and differential diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies are based on clinical, biological, and radiological criteria but remain challenging in certain cases. Multiple myeloma (MM) is the most common malignant gammopathy and is associated with a wide spectrum of signs and symptoms. In the past decade, the treatment options for patients with MM have increased considerably. Together with improved supportive care, these new regimens significantly prolong the survival of both younger and older patients.

The 2014 revision of the diagnostic criteria for MM allows the initiation of treatment in patients defined only by biomarkers, annotated as SLIM criteria [bone marrow (BM) infiltration > 60%, involved/uninvolved serum free light-chain (SFLC) ratio > 100, or > 1 focal lesion > 5 mm as determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)], without waiting for conventional CRAB criteria (hypercalcemia, renal impairment, anemia, bone disease) to occur. Both the SLIM biomarker and CRAB criteria are listed in Figure 1.

Given the recent evolution in diagnosis and response assessment, members of the European Myeloma Network (EMN) agreed to review and recommend diagnostic and response criteria to allow their discriminating use in daily practice and care of patients.

- **Differential diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis between monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, smoldering myeloma, and multiple myeloma is based on:
	1. Plasma cell infiltration in the bone marrow
	2. Presence of clinical symptoms

### Primary plasma cell leukemia: Consensus definition by the international myeloma working group according to peripheral blood plasma cell percentage [^112m26NW]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). High credibility.

- **Outcome according to circulating plasma cell morphology**: Median overall survival (OS) according to the circulating plasma cell groups (0%, 1–4%, 5–20%, more than 20%) was 47, 50, 6, and 14 months, respectively, in the Spanish group. In the US series, the median OS of the different groups (0%, 1–4%, 5–19%, and 20% or more) was 53, 17, 13, and 13 months. Thus, in the Catalan study, the presence of 1–4% circulating plasma cells (CPCs) does not influence OS (the same OS for patients without CPCs; 47 vs. 50 months), while in the US trial, there was a major impact (53 vs. 17 months); in fact, the OS of these patients was not very different from that of patients with > 5% CPCs (13 months). It is important to note that in the Catalan study, median follow-up was 28 months, which makes the median OS for patients with < 5% plasma cells an expected/projected measurement rather than an actual measurement. In the US study, the median follow-up was 6.8 years.

- **Stratification of outcomes**: In both series, due to the similarities in the outcomes observed for patients with 5% or more circulating plasma cells, the two groups were stratified. In the Catalan study, survival of those with ≥ 5% CPCs was significantly shorter when compared with a cohort of multiple myeloma (MM) patients who did not have circulating plasma cells at diagnosis or had 1–4% (1.1 vs. 4.4 years, RR 4; 95 CI: 2.1–7.3; p < 0.001). In the US series, also shorter survival was observed in the groups of patients with more than 5% CPCs (1.17 vs. 4.8 years; p < 0.001).

- **Cytogenetics and significance**: In the Catalan series, the significance was retained for those patients with 5–19% circulating plasma cells and treated with novel agents.

### Primary plasma cell leukemia: Consensus definition by the International Myeloma Working Group according to peripheral blood plasma cell percentage [^111U8zUV]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Low credibility.

- **Results**:

- **Patient characteristics**: As previously stated, there are two recent publications that have addressed this issue in Europe and the US.

Main results of the two clinical studies used for this position paper:

1. A series of 482 patients from Catalonia (Catalan Myeloma Group), Spain, between 2008 and 2013 with newly diagnosed MM or PCL was reported. Patients were classified into four categories according to the percentage of circulating plasma cells: 0% (382; 79.2%), 1–4% (83; 17.2%), 5–20% (12; 2.5%), and the conventional definition of PCL (more than 20%) (5; 1%). A total of 100 patients (20.7%) showed at least 1% of circulating plasma cells. Considering only these 100 patients for comparison with the Mayo Clinic series, the percentages of circulating plasma cells were as follows: 1–4% (83%), 5–20% (12%), and more than 20% (5%). The 382 patients without circulating plasma cells were used as controls.

2. More recently, Ravi et al. from the Mayo Clinic reviewed outcomes of 176 patients with MM who had circulating plasma cells at diagnosis between 1971 and 2006, to determine whether a lower threshold could be used to diagnose PCL. They classified the patients according to circulating plasma cell percentages.

### More than 2% of circulating tumor plasma cells defines plasma cell leukemia-like multiple myeloma [^115mYQoA]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Low credibility.

The optimal cutoff for identification of ultra-high-risk PCL-like multiple myeloma is 2% of CTCs. Kaplan-Meier curves for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for transplant-ineligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) (N = 395) and transplant-eligible patients (N = 185) with < 2% and 2%-20% of CTCs were analyzed. CTC refers to circulating tumor plasma cells, HR to hazard ratio, NDMM to newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, OS to overall survival, PCL to plasma cell leukemia, and PFS to progression-free survival.

Basic clinical characteristics and levels of CTCs for the transplant-ineligible cohort, including ISS stage, cytogenetic risk, LDH levels, sex, and median PFS, were measured. A significantly different distribution between multiple myeloma groups was noted according to Fisher's exact test. Here, CTC stands for circulating tumor plasma cells, ISS for International Staging System, LDH for lactate dehydrogenase, and PFS for progression-free survival.

We used Cox proportional hazard risk models to compare the prognostic power of CTCs with other routinely used prognostic markers such as ISS stage, LDH level, and high-risk cytogenetics. Our results suggest that CTCs are an independent prognostic biomarker in the multivariate analysis for both PFS (HR, 4.3; P < .001) and OS (HR, 3.1; p = 0.006).

- **Cutoff 2% of CTCs is applicable also in transplant-eligible patients**: We examined whether the 2% cutoff used in transplant-ineligible patients applies to transplant-eligible multiple myeloma (MM) using the Czech cohort of 185 NDMM cases, with median age at diagnosis.

### Multiple myeloma, version 3.2017, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115EkwpQ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2017). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is caused by the neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells. These neoplastic plasma cells proliferate and produce monoclonal immunoglobulin in the bone marrow, causing skeletal damage — a hallmark of multiple myeloma. Other MM-related complications include hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, and infections. The NCCN Multiple Myeloma Panel members have developed guidelines for the management of patients with various plasma cell dyscrasias, including solitary plasmacytoma, smoldering myeloma, multiple myeloma, systemic light chain amyloidosis, and Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. The recommendations specific to the diagnosis and treatment of patients with newly diagnosed MM are discussed in this article.

### Chromatin-based, in cis and in trans regulatory rewiring underpins distinct oncogenic transcriptomes in multiple myeloma [^1144V8rz]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Multiple myeloma is a genetically heterogeneous cancer of the bone marrow plasma cells (PC). Distinct myeloma transcriptome profiles are primarily driven by myeloma initiating events (MIE) and converge into a mutually exclusive overexpression of the CCND1 and CCND2 oncogenes. Here, with reference to their normal counterparts, we find that myeloma PC-enhanced chromatin accessibility combined with paired transcriptome profiling can classify MIE-defined genetic subgroups. Across and within different MM genetic subgroups, we ascribe regulation of genes and pathways critical for myeloma biology to unique or shared, developmentally activated, or de novo formed candidate enhancers. Such enhancers co-opt recruitment of existing transcription factors, which, although not transcriptionally deregulated per se, organize aberrant gene regulatory networks that help identify myeloma cell dependencies with prognostic impact. Finally, we identify and validate the critical super-enhancer that regulates ectopic expression of CCND2 in a subset of patients with MM and in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

### Gene expression profiles in myeloma: Ready for the real world [^112qyqJf]. Clinical Cancer Research (2016). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell malignancy characterized by molecular and clinical heterogeneity. The outcome of the disease has been dramatically improved with the advent of new drugs in the past few years. However, even with these increasing therapeutic options, important challenges remain. These include accurately evaluating patients' prognosis and predicting sensitivity to specific treatments and drug combinations.

Transcriptomic studies have played a significant role in deciphering the complexity of multiple myeloma by characterizing subgroups with different outcomes. Microarrays and, more recently, RNA sequencing enable the evaluation of the expression of coding and noncoding genes, alternate splicing events, mutations, and novel transcriptome modifiers. This provides new insights into myeloma biology, prognostication, and therapy.

In this review, we discuss the role and impact of gene expression profiling studies in myeloma.

### Transcriptome analysis reveals significant differences between primary plasma cell leukemia and multiple myeloma even when sharing a similar genetic background [^111PB65A]. Blood Cancer Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Primary plasma cell leukemia (pPCL) is a highly aggressive plasma cell dyscrasia characterized by short remissions and very poor survival. Although the 17p deletion is associated with poor outcomes and extramedullary disease in multiple myeloma (MM), its presence does not confer the degree of aggressiveness observed in pPCL. The comprehensive exploration of isoform expression and RNA splicing events may provide novel information about biological differences between the two diseases.

Transcriptomic studies were carried out in nine newly diagnosed pPCL and ten MM samples, all of which harbored the 17p deletion. Unsupervised cluster analysis clearly distinguished pPCL from MM samples. In total, 3,584 genes and 20,033 isoforms were found to be deregulated between pPCL and MM. There were 2,727 significantly deregulated isoforms of non-differentially expressed genes. Strangely enough, significant differences were observed in the expression of spliceosomal machinery components between pPCL and MM, in respect of the gene, isoform, and the alternative splicing events expression.

In summary, transcriptome analysis revealed significant differences in the relative abundance of isoforms between pPCL and MM, even when they both had the 17p deletion. The mRNA processing pathway, including RNA splicing machinery, emerged as one of the most remarkable mechanisms underlying the biological differences between the two entities.

### Plasma cell leukemia: Consensus statement on diagnostic requirements, response criteria and treatment recommendations by the International Myeloma Working Group [^113791cz]. Leukemia (2013). Low credibility.

Plasma cell leukemia (PCL) is a rare and aggressive variant of myeloma characterized by the presence of circulating plasma cells. It is classified as either primary PCL occurring at diagnosis or as secondary PCL in patients with relapsed/refractory myeloma. Primary PCL is a distinct clinicopathological entity with different cytogenetic and molecular findings. The clinical course is aggressive, featuring short remissions and survival duration. The diagnosis is based upon the percentage (≥ 20%) and absolute number (≥ 2 × 10⁹/l) of plasma cells in the peripheral blood.

Consensus recommendations advocate for re-examining these diagnostic thresholds, as well as setting criteria for response and progression. Induction therapy should begin promptly with high clinical activity to rapidly control the disease, minimizing the risk of early death. Intensive chemotherapy regimens and bortezomib-based regimens are recommended, followed by high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation if feasible. Allogeneic transplantation may be considered for younger patients. Prospective multicenter studies are necessary to provide revised definitions and a better understanding of the pathogenesis of PCL.

### European myeloma network recommendations on tools for the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma: What to use and when [^116yHvoc]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

These recommendations were developed by a panel of clinical experts on multiple myeloma (MM) based on evidence from published data through August 2017. Expert consensus was used to suggest recommendations where sufficient data were lacking. The final recommendations were classified based on the GRADE criteria, which incorporates the strength and quality of evidence (see online supplementary Table S1). Guidelines were prepared and circulated among all panel members following discussions at the 2017 EMN Trialist meeting in Baveno, Italy. The manuscript underwent three rounds of revision until the EMN experts reached consensus. In line with the guidelines of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, authorship was based on active contribution during discussion, writing, and revision of the guidelines.

### Primary plasma cell leukemia: Consensus definition by the International Myeloma Working Group according to peripheral blood plasma cell percentage [^112mp5NE]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Low credibility.

The correct and timely diagnosis of primary plasma cell leukemia (PCL) relies on the expertise of pathologists or hematologists to screen and recognize plasma cells in peripheral blood smears. It is critical they understand the clinical importance of a thorough morphological examination to exclude the presence of circulating plasma cells.

PCL is distinct within the range of malignant monoclonal gammopathies, characterized by a poor prognosis, the shortest overall survival (OS), and a high frequency of genetic abnormalities such as deletion 17p, hypodiploidy, and t(11;14). Some distinctive molecular and epigenetic characteristics are also observed. Classical clinical features include reduced bone marrow reserve, extramedullary involvement, and elevated LDH. These are more common than in patients with "standard" multiple myeloma (MM). Unfortunately, the short duration of response in primary PCL has been disappointing. Despite significant advancements in the use of immunomodulatory drugs, proteasome inhibitors, and both autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation, the poor prognosis remains unaltered.

In two analyzed series, morphological examination was crucial for identifying patients with clinical and prognostic features compatible with the natural history of primary PCL. Consistently across both articles, patients with 5% or more circulating plasma cells had significantly shorter OS than those with MM without circulating plasma cells. This significance was maintained in one of the studies during multivariate analysis.

### Primary plasma cell leukemia: Consensus definition by the International Myeloma Working Group according to peripheral blood plasma cell percentage [^112s4bPT]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Low credibility.

The consistently ominous prognosis, even after improvements in recent decades, warrants prompt identification of these patients to establish the most effective treatment for this ultra-high-risk disease. However, the percentage of plasma cells is a continuous variable, and the cutoff should be based on retrospectively evaluating studies that have analyzed the prognosis of these patients.

With all the above considerations, we believe that the diagnostic criteria for primary PCL should be revisited. What number of circulating plasma cells in peripheral blood should be used for defining PCL? There is no scientific rationale for establishing the appropriate number of circulating plasma cells in peripheral blood for defining PCL, and the percentage should be obtained from clinical evidence. Over the last few years, some retrospective studies have been conducted and published by different groups. The aim of this position paper is to revisit the diagnosis of primary PCL according to the presence of circulating plasma cells in patients otherwise meeting diagnostic criteria of symptomatic MM.

### Development and validation of a novel risk stratification algorithm for relapsed multiple myeloma [^115ErVsj]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignancy of plasma cells that accounts for approximately 10% of all haematological cancers. MM is associated with considerable heterogeneity in terms of patient characteristics, drivers of disease progression, prognosis, and treatment response. This heterogeneity is exemplified by the variations observed in life expectancy. The median overall survival (OS) for MM patients is in the range of 5–7 years. However, data suggest that 13% of patients die within 24 months of diagnosis, and findings from a European chart review suggested that 36% of patients with MM do not reach the second line of treatment. A tool that could accurately evaluate the overall risk of death and identify the drivers of disease severity would be of considerable value, especially at first relapse when patient and disease-related information is available.

### Revised diagnostic criteria for plasma cell leukemia: Results of a Mayo Clinic study with comparison of outcomes to multiple myeloma [^114BYkY1]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Plasma cell leukemia (PCL) is an uncommon but aggressive malignancy that accounts for 1–2% of all plasma cell dyscrasias. First described in the early 1900s, PCL has been defined as the presence of ≥ 20% circulating plasma cells (CPCs) on a conventional white blood cell differential count and an absolute plasma cell count of ≥ 2 × 10⁹/L in the peripheral blood. This definition includes both primary PCL (pPCL) — arising de novo in the absence of antecedent multiple myeloma (MM) — and secondary PCL (sPCL), which describes the leukemic transformation of MM. PCL is clinically and biologically distinct from MM, with a younger age at diagnosis, higher propensity to show visceral and extramedullary involvement, and unique biologic, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic characteristics.

The definition of PCL is too restrictive, requiring a very high level of CPCs to be detected on a conventional white blood cell differential count, and patients with MM who have detectable CPCs at a level below the 20% threshold may have similar outcomes to those with ≥ 20% CPCs. Indeed, in 2013, the International Myeloma Working Group called for studies to investigate the revision of the diagnostic criteria for PCL. Two such studies have since shown that MM patients with either ≥ 2% or ≥ 5% CPCs, as measured on a peripheral smear, have similar outcomes to patients with pPCL, suggesting that a lower threshold of CPCs be used to define PCL.

Based on these considerations, we sought to review our outcomes of MM patients with CPCs detectable on peripheral blood smears at diagnosis and attempt to determine…

We next identified specific markers that most distinguish myeloma plasma cells versus B-cell types (Fig. 1D, E; Supplementary Fig. 1C). Giving confidence in this analysis, many canonical markers were among the strongest hits, including BCMA, CD138/SDC1, and CD28 for plasma cells and CD19, CD22, and CD72 for B-ALL cells, respectively (Fig. 1E). Comparison of myeloma cells to the two B-lymphoblastoid cell lines also showed CD138/SDC1 and CD28 as characterizing myeloma cells, while CD19, CD22, and CD20 characterized late-stage B-cells. We were surprised to find the three proteins that most distinguished myeloma plasma cells from B-ALL, based on fold-change and p-value, were not canonical markers at all: gamma-glutamyl transferase 1 (GGT1), selectin-P ligand (SELPLG), and cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) (Fig. 1E). These proteins may carry previously unexplored relevance to myeloma or broader plasma cell biology.

In parallel with our surface proteomic data, we also obtained RNA-seq data for all analyzed cell lines. We overall found a moderate quantitative correlation (Pearson R = 0.54; p < 2.2e − 16) between the transcriptome and surface proteome of myeloma and B-ALL cells (Supplementary Fig. 1D), consistent with prior studies. We found a set of proteins, including CD99, GGT1, and TOR1AIP2, with transcript levels discordant with the surface protein, suggestive of possible post-transcriptional regulation (Supplementary Fig. 1D). Taken together, this initial profiling underscores the unique surface phenotype of malignant plasma cells and unexpected markers distinguishing them.

### Plasma cell myeloma and related neoplasms [^112TSjzj]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Session 1 of the 2009 Workshop of the Society for Hematopathology/European Association of Haematopathology, Cleveland, OH, focused on plasma cell neoplasms. This report summarizes the salient diagnostic, clinical, and genetic features of plasma cell myeloma (PCM) and related neoplasms. Based on the cases submitted to the workshop, we highlight common diagnostic issues and unusual manifestations of plasma cell neoplasms, such as t(11;14)+ PCM, plasma cell leukemia, and nonsecretory plasmacytoma, as well as plasmablastic transformation of PCM.

Additional issues repeatedly raised at the workshop included the differential diagnosis of extramedullary dissemination of PCM vs. primary extramedullary plasmacytoma and plasmablastic lymphoma; systemic plasma cell neoplasms in immunocompromised people; and Epstein-Barr virus-associated plasma cell neoplasms. Difficult cases with borderline features presented by submitters emphasized the necessity of integrating clinical, immunophenotypic, and genetic features for appropriate classification of these disorders.

### Role of F-FDG PET/CT in the diagnosis and management of multiple myeloma and other plasma cell disorders: A consensus statement by the International Myeloma Working Group [^1149tEJ3]. The Lancet Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

The International Myeloma Working Group consensus aimed to provide recommendations for the optimal use of 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18 F-FDG) PET/CT in patients with multiple myeloma and other plasma cell disorders, including smouldering multiple myeloma and solitary plasmacytoma. 18 F-FDG PET/CT can be considered a valuable tool for the work-up of patients with both newly diagnosed and relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma because it assesses bone damage with relatively high sensitivity and specificity and detects extramedullary sites of proliferating clonal plasma cells while providing important prognostic information. The use of 18 F-FDG PET/CT is mandatory to confirm a suspected diagnosis of solitary plasmacytoma, provided that whole-body MRI is unable to be performed, and to distinguish between smouldering and active multiple myeloma if whole-body X-ray (WBXR) is negative and whole-body MRI is unavailable. Based on the ability of 18 F-FDG PET/CT to distinguish between metabolically active and inactive disease, this technique is now the preferred functional imaging modality to evaluate and monitor the effect of therapy on myeloma-cell metabolism. Changes in FDG avidity can provide an earlier evaluation of response to therapy compared to MRI scans and can predict outcomes, particularly for patients who are eligible to receive autologous stem-cell transplantation. 18 F-FDG PET/CT can be coupled with sensitive bone marrow-based techniques to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) inside and outside the bone marrow, helping to identify those patients who are defined as…

Regarding the medical management of multiple myeloma, particularly in relation to relapsed/refractory disease and stem cell transplantation, the ASCO/CCO 2019 guidelines recommend offering autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) to transplant-eligible patients with relapsed multiple myeloma if they have not received it after primary induction therapy. Additionally, consider offering repeat stem cell transplantation to patients with relapsed multiple myeloma if the progression-free survival after the first transplant is greater than or equal to 18 months.

### A clinical perspective on plasma cell leukemia; current status and future directions [^1133wmqH]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Plasma cell leukemia (PCL) is the rarest yet most aggressive plasma cell disorder. PCL was originally defined by an absolute plasma cell (PC) count greater than 2 × 10^9/L in the peripheral blood (PB) and more than 20% circulating PCs. At present, only one of the original two requirements is used to define PCL according to the criteria by the World Health Organization and the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG). The definition of PCL is currently an area of controversy as recent studies suggest that the presence of ≥ 5% circulating abnormal PCs, but not meeting the 20% cutoff, have a similar adverse prognostic impact and poor survival as patients with > 20% abnormal PCs. Therefore, patients with PCs comprising ≥ 5% of the PB white cell differential count may be considered as having PCL and can be treated as such. Another limitation of the diagnostic definition of PCL is that it does not take into consideration plasma cell clonality, which can be characterized using multiparametric flow cytometry. Establishing the presence of a malignant clonal population is important, as reactive plasmacytosis can occur due to a variety of infections, neoplastic, or inflammatory conditions.

PCL is referred to as primary when the leukemic phase presents at diagnosis, or secondary when leukemic progression occurs in the context of preexisting multiple myeloma (MM). Historically, 60–70% of cases have been reported to be primary PCL (pPCL), whereas approximately 40% are secondary. In recent years, there has been an increase in the incidence of secondary PCL, likely related to more aggressive treatments for MM.

### European myeloma network recommendations on tools for the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma: What to use and when [^116izaxb]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

The European Myeloma Network has developed recommendations for diagnostic tools used in the assessment and monitoring of multiple myeloma.

- **Diagnostic tools**:
	- A defining feature of plasma cell (PC) disorders is the secretion of monoclonal immunoglobulins, often referred to as a monoclonal M-protein, which can be used as a diagnostic marker and for disease follow-up. Its heavy- and light-chain components can be identified by immunofixation and further quantified by serum protein electrophoresis and/or a serum free light-chain (SFLC) assay. With persistent disease and possible de-differentiation of myeloma cells, the capacity to produce M-proteins may decrease or be completely lost, a phenomenon known as "light-chain escape". In these patients, low M-protein levels, the presence of light chains only, or even a complete absence of M-proteins and light chains, may be misinterpreted as an ongoing or evolving response.

	- Of note, immunofixation is approximately ten-fold more sensitive than serum protein electrophoresis and is required at diagnosis to characterize the phenotype of the M-protein, and for confirming a complete response, which is defined as immunofixation-negative. Serum electrophoresis and immunofixation may not detect light-chain aberrations in patients with oligo-secretory disease, such as light-chain multiple myeloma (MM). Due to their low molecular weight, these SFLCs are rapidly cleared by the kidneys. In such cases, the monoclonal burden should be measured in a 24-hour urine collection or in the serum by an automated SFLC immunoassay, the latter having a higher sensitivity to detect and quantify the involved free light chains (Grade 1A).

### Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies for multiple myeloma [^1114AuwR]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is almost always an incurable malignancy of plasma cells, necessitating new approaches to treatment. T-cell therapies present a promising method for treating MM, with a mechanism of action distinct from standard MM treatments. Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are fusion proteins that incorporate antigen-recognition domains and T-cell signaling domains. T cells that are genetically engineered to express CARs can specifically recognize antigens.

The success of CAR-T cells (CAR-Ts) against leukemia and lymphoma has encouraged the development of CAR-T therapies for MM. Target antigens for CARs must be expressed on malignant cells, with minimal or no expression on normal cells. B-cell maturation antigen is one such antigen, expressed by both normal and malignant plasma cells. CAR-Ts targeting B-cell maturation antigen have shown significant antimyeloma activity in early clinical trials. Toxicities encountered in these trials, such as cytokine release syndrome, have been similar to those observed in CAR-T trials for leukemia.

Targeting the proposed CD19+ myeloma stem cells with anti-CD19 CAR-Ts is a novel approach to MM therapy. Other MM antigens, including CD138, CD38, signaling lymphocyte-activating molecule 7, and κ light chain, are currently under investigation as CAR targets. Given MM's genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, targeting more than one antigen might often be necessary for effective treatment with CAR-Ts. The integration of CAR-Ts with other myeloma therapies represents an important area of future research. Although CAR-T therapies for MM are at an early stage of development, they hold great promise for the future.

### Real-world data on prognosis and outcome of primary plasma cell leukemia in the era of novel agents: A multicenter national study by the Greek Myeloma Study Group [^114MFSrw]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Primary plasma cell leukemia (pPCL) is a distinct clinicopathological entity of plasma cell dyscrasias, accounting for about 60–70% of all plasma cell leukemia cases. Diagnosis of pPCL requires both 2 × 10³/μL peripheral blood clonal plasma cells and plasmacytosis accounting for more than 20% of the differential white cell count, though in some studies, meeting only one of these two diagnostic criteria was considered sufficient. The definition of pPCL is arbitrary, and a lower diagnostic threshold (i.e. 5% and/or > 0.5 × 10³/μL) has been recently proposed.

Primary PCL does not arise from pre-existing multiple myeloma (MM) but presents as de novo disease and is characterized by an aggressive clinical course. In the past, the only available treatment for patients with pPCL was conventional chemotherapy, which failed to control the disease, leading to dramatically poor outcomes. During the last decades, initially, autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and subsequently, novel therapies including immunomodulatory drugs and proteasome inhibitors (PIs), namely bortezomib, led to a slight improvement in pPCL patients' survival. The efficacy of bortezomib in pPCL has been demonstrated by our group and others in small retrospective series; however, this has been questioned in other studies.

Recently, a prospective phase 2 study has demonstrated that induction therapy with bortezomib-based combinations followed by ASCT led to high response rates and prolonged survival in patients with pPCL. Bortezomib-based therapies are currently recommended for the management of pPCL.

### Primary plasma cell leukemia: Consensus definition by the International Myeloma Working Group according to peripheral blood plasma cell percentage [^113n7Adj]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Low credibility.

There is an urgent need to prospectively investigate the molecular characteristics of primary plasma cell leukemia (PCL) further, to gain a better understanding of the genomic mechanisms as a basis to develop optimal, stratified treatment approaches. Recent trial designs have demonstrated that addressing both ultra-high-risk myeloma and PCL jointly can further overcome barriers to recruitment for these patient populations with high unmet need. We recommend removing PCL as routine exclusion criteria for multiple myeloma (MM) trials. Patients with this new definition of primary PCL should be included in clinical trials and reported as a high-risk feature, in order to not penalize the possibility of receiving new agents.

In any given patient, the presence of a few circulating plasma cells demonstrated by conventional morphology is still a marker for a highly proliferative and aggressive process. Lower levels (more than 1 or 2% plasma cells in peripheral blood) could define a higher risk MM with prognosis very close to PCL. Patients with an 'early' PCL may rapidly progress; these patients must be followed closely because they may develop PCL in a very short time. However, it has yet to be demonstrated that aggressively treating patients with lower circulating plasma cells than the previous definition of primary PCL will yield superior outcomes.

Additional methods to detect early primary PCL should be a high priority and warrant further studies. Thus, the use of slide-based immunofluorescence microscopy, multiparametric flow cytometry, and next-generation flow for plasma cell quantification in peripheral blood has been associated with…

### Treatment of multiple myeloma: ASCO and CCO joint clinical practice guideline [^1177J9Rh]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for multiple myeloma, more specifically with respect to stem cell transplantation, the ASCO/CCO 2019 guidelines recommend considering ample stem cell collection. This should be sufficient for more than one stem cell transplantation upfront due to concerns about the limited ability for future stem cell collection after prolonged treatment exposure.

### Primary plasma cell leukemia: Consensus definition by the International Myeloma Working Group according to peripheral blood plasma cell percentage [^1156qhy5]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Gathering all the available information and putting that into perspective, the impact of the presence of 5–20% plasma cells in peripheral blood in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) has a similarly ominous meaning as the presence of ≥ 20% circulating plasma cells. The proposal is to establish a new diagnostic definition of this devastating disease by the International Myeloma Working Group. This new definition, with morphological criteria using conventional staining techniques in peripheral blood, would increase up to three times the number of patients diagnosed with primary plasma cell leukemia (PCL). This strategy is available worldwide, irrespective of economic and technological resources. Finally, these patients, otherwise classified as symptomatic MM, should be enrolled early into trials using the newest immunotherapies and combined strategies available in an attempt to improve survival.

- **Consensus recommendation**: Primary PCL is defined by the presence of 5% or more circulating plasma cells in peripheral blood smears in patients otherwise diagnosed with symptomatic MM. Careful examination of peripheral blood by conventional microscopy should be done in all patients with MM. A minimum of 100–200 nucleated cells per smear should be systematically analyzed by an experienced pathologist/hematologist. Patients with this new definition should not be excluded from clinical trials.

### Comprehensive evaluation of disease characteristics and outcomes of patients with extramedullary multiple myeloma in the modern era [^117WpnPd]. Haematologica (2025). High credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) derives from the clonal proliferation of plasma cells, primarily residing in the bone marrow. However, MM cells can disseminate systemically, leading to osseous or soft tissue extramedullary disease (EMM) or plasma cell leukemia (PCL). The presence of EMM or PCL has historically been linked to poor prognosis and aggressive features.

In this study, we analyzed 201 patients with EMM treated at our institution between January 1, 2010, and November 30, 2023. Among these patients, 25 had primary PCL, 19 had secondary PCL, 89 were diagnosed with EMM at the time of MM diagnosis, 29 developed EMM after therapy, and 39 had solitary plasmacytoma (SP), with 20 progressing into MM.

Patients with EMM at the time of MM diagnosis or SP progressing to MM exhibited a median overall survival (OS) comparable to those with MM alone (7.5 years or not reached). However, the presence of EMM was associated with worse prognosis in specific groups: primary PCL (median OS: 26 months), secondary PCL (median OS: 1.6 months), and secondary EMM (median OS: 16 months).

Additional prognostic features included high R-ISS (Revised International Staging System), chromosomal abnormalities (1q+, 17p deletion, and 13q deletion), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase values at presentation. While the site of EMM did not correlate with inferior outcomes, osseous SP increased the risk of progression to overt MM.

In conclusion, the presence of EMM confers variable prognosis, emphasizing the need for more effective therapeutic strategies, particularly for patients with PCL or those developing EMM.

### The molecular make up of smoldering myeloma highlights the evolutionary pathways leading to multiple myeloma [^114aNBA7]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is an asymptomatic plasma cell disorder, distinguished from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) by a higher rate of progression to symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM). The nature of SMM as a discrete disease entity has been called into question because of the triphasic shape of the Kaplan–Meier curves associated with its progression to MM. These curves have been interpreted as being consistent with a low-risk group similar to MGUS, a high-risk group of "early myeloma" who progress quickly, and an intermediate-risk group the nature of which is uncertain.

The International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) re-defined SMM to account for several risk factors, including serum-free light chain (SFLC) ratio, bone marrow tumor burden, and bone lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to identify a high-risk group. A group with an 80% 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) was identified and was re-defined as MM. To enhance historical comparison, we use the term "early myeloma" (EM) to identify patients who fail to meet the criteria but would have been previously defined as SMM.

### Diagnostic thresholds for free light chains in multiple myeloma depend on the assay used [^115yWmgW]. Leukemia (2017). High credibility.

The identification of appropriate diagnostic thresholds for free light chains in multiple myeloma is contingent on the specific assay utilized. Various assays may yield different results, necessitating a clear understanding of their specific diagnostic ranges. Recent studies underscore the importance of harmonizing these thresholds to enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes. The article elaborates on the methodologies employed by different assays and highlights the variability in diagnostic thresholds resulting from these differences. It further emphasizes the significance of selecting appropriate assays to ensure consistency in diagnosis and subsequent patient management.

### Primary plasma cell leukemia and autologous stem cell transplantation [^114EsGxC]. Haematologica (2010). Low credibility.

Primary plasma cell leukemia is a rare disorder accounting for less than 5% of malignant plasma cell diseases and is associated with a poor prognosis compared to multiple myeloma, with a median survival of 8–12 months. While the results of conventional therapy are disappointing, autologous stem cell transplantation may improve survival.

- **Design and methods**: A retrospective analysis was undertaken by the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, examining 272 patients with plasma cell leukemia and 20,844 with multiple myeloma who underwent first autologous transplantation between 1980 and 2006. All patients were reported to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry using MED-A (limited data) or MED-B (extensive data) forms, and all were included regardless of the availability of complete data.

- **Results**: There was no difference in the type of graft or use of total body irradiation between patients with plasma cell leukemia and multiple myeloma. However, patients with plasma cell leukemia were transplanted earlier after diagnosis (6.0 versus 7.7 months, P = 0.000). They were more likely to enter complete remission after transplantation, although their overall survival (25.7 months, 95% confidence interval 19.5–31.9 months) was inferior to that of patients with multiple myeloma (62.3 months, 95% confidence interval 60.4–64.3 months) due to the short duration of their post-transplant response and increased non-relapse-related mortality (P = 0.000).

- **Conclusions**: This largest study ever reported on plasma cell leukemia suggests that autologous stem cell transplantation, although beneficial in achieving complete remission, is limited by the short duration of the post-transplant response and increased non-relapse-related mortality.

### Transcriptome analysis reveals significant differences between primary plasma cell leukemia and multiple myeloma even when sharing a similar genetic background [^115DuYiM]. Blood Cancer Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Plasma cell leukemia (PCL) is an uncommon and aggressive plasma cell dyscrasia, characterized by the presence of more than 20% of plasma cells (PCs) and an absolute number of ≥ 2 × 10⁹/L of PCs in peripheral blood. PCL is classified as primary (pPCL) when detected de novo in patients with no evidence of previous multiple myeloma (MM) or as secondary (sPCL) in patients with relapsed or refractory MM that progresses to a leukemic phase. Around 60% and 40% of PCLs are pPCL and sPCL, respectively. pPCL accounts for less than 3% of all malignant plasma cell disorders. Consequently, knowledge regarding the molecular basis of pPCL is quite limited by the small number of cases included in most series.

Various studies have reported that pPCL patients show different clinical and biological features from those of MM. pPCL is associated with a dismal prognosis, with median survival at about 10 months. Extramedullary plasmacytomas, renal failure, and massive bone marrow infiltration are more frequently observed in pPCL than in MM. Conversely, pPCL exhibits a lower prevalence of bone disease.

Cytogenetic studies have shown that pPCL features elevated genomic instability, especially with respect to karyotypic complexity, and a higher prevalence of 17p13 deletions and 1q gains. Of the translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IGH), t(11;14) and t(14;16) are more frequent in pPCL than in MM. In recent years, the development of high-throughput technologies has contributed to a more detailed understanding of molecular characteristics.

### Treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma: Recommendations from the International Myeloma Working Group [^1159KreE]. The Lancet Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for multiple myeloma, specifically in the context of relapsed or refractory disease, systemic therapy, the 2021 International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) guidelines recommend offering the following options as preferred regimens for the management of a first relapse not refractory to lenalidomide:

- **Daratumumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (DRd)**: A common treatment option to be considered for patients in this category.

- **Daratumumab, carfilzomib, and dexamethasone (KRd)**: Another recommended regimen under these guidelines.
