## Question

Most discussions of growth focus on the supply aspect of growth. Explain how unemployment due to lack of demand for goods can affect growth.

Answer Choices:
A. Unemployment triggers rapid technological advancement.
B. Unemployment encourages more investment in the economy.
C. Unemployment can depress growth by reducing investment and capital accumulation, slowing the introduction of new technology, and leading to a lack of skilled personnel.
D. Unemployment leads to an excess of skilled personnel.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how unemployment due to insufficient demand for goods affects economic growth, and which answer choice best explains that mechanism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the demand-side logic and why firms cut back when sales fall. Then, I should verify the direct effects on investment, capital accumulation, and technology adoption. Next, I will examine the human capital channel, including skill atrophy and labor market mismatch. After that, I should consider the feedback loop to aggregate demand and the multiplier. Finally, I will review the provided options and select the one that aligns with this causal chain, while double-checking for any plausible but incorrect alternatives.

> Let me first confirm the demand-side trigger. When households and firms reduce spending, firms face excess capacity and falling revenues, so they cut production and employment. This is a classic demand-deficient unemployment scenario, and it sets off a cascade of supply-side consequences even though the initial shock is on the demand side [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the investment channel. Lower sales and idle capacity reduce expected returns, so firms postpone or cancel capital expenditures, which slows capital accumulation and drags on potential output. This is precisely why recessions are associated with sharp declines in investment and why recovery often lags until demand revives [^notfound].

> I need to check the technology adoption piece. In slack conditions, firms have less incentive to upgrade or adopt new technologies because utilization is low and cash flows are constrained. This delays productivity-enhancing innovation diffusion, further weakening the supply-side contribution to growth during the downturn [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify the human capital effects. Prolonged unemployment erodes skills, reduces work experience, and can create persistent mismatch between worker capabilities and job requirements, which lowers labor productivity and the economy's effective supply of skilled labor even after demand recovers [^notfound].

> Let me consider the demand multiplier to ensure I'm not missing the feedback loop. Unemployed workers cut consumption, which deepens the demand shortfall, leading to more layoffs and further investment cuts. This vicious cycle amplifies the initial shock and prolongs the growth slowdown until policy or external forces break it [^notfound].

> I will now examine the options against this causal chain. Option A claims unemployment triggers rapid technological advancement, but that contradicts the evidence that firms delay tech adoption in downturns, so I should reject A. Option B suggests unemployment encourages more investment, which is backwards because investment falls when demand and capacity utilization drop, so B is incorrect. Option C maps cleanly to reduced investment, slower capital accumulation, delayed technology introduction, and a shortage of skilled personnel due to skill atrophy and mismatch, which matches the mechanism I've outlined. Option D asserts an excess of skilled personnel, but that misstates the problem; unemployment often coexists with skill shortages because the wrong skills are in surplus while the right skills are underutilized or lost, so D is misleading [^notfound].

> Conclusion: The correct answer is C, because demand-deficient unemployment depresses growth by cutting investment, slowing capital accumulation and technology diffusion, and degrading human capital through skill loss and mismatch, creating a self-reinforcing drag on output until demand recovers [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **C**. Unemployment due to insufficient demand reduces household income and consumption, which lowers business revenues and profits, leading firms to cut investment, delay new technology adoption, and reduce hiring. This creates a vicious cycle: less investment and innovation slow productivity growth, while prolonged joblessness erodes skills and discourages workforce participation, further depressing output. Options A and B are incorrect because unemployment does not stimulate investment or rapid technological advance; instead, it constrains them. Option D is misleading because unemployment often coexists with skill mismatches and underutilization, not a surplus of appropriately skilled workers.

## Mechanisms linking demand-deficient unemployment to reduced growth

### Reduced household income and consumption

Unemployment lowers household income, which **reduces consumption** — the largest component of aggregate demand. This decline in consumption reduces business revenues and profits, prompting firms to cut production, investment, and employment, thereby deepening the downturn [^notfound].

---

### Decline in business investment

Falling revenues and profits reduce expected returns, so firms **cut investment** in new capital, equipment, and infrastructure. This decline in investment reduces aggregate demand further and slows capital accumulation, limiting the economy's productive capacity and future growth potential [^notfound].

---

### Slowed technological advancement

Weak demand and reduced profits lead firms to **postpone or scale back R&D** and the adoption of new technologies. This delay in technological progress reduces productivity growth, a key driver of long-term economic growth [^notfound].

---

### Erosion of human capital

Prolonged unemployment causes skill atrophy, loss of work habits, and reduced motivation, while also discouraging workforce participation. This erosion of human capital **reduces labor productivity** and the economy's effective labor supply, further constraining growth [^notfound].

---

### Negative multiplier effects

The initial drop in consumption and investment triggers a **negative multiplier effect**: reduced spending leads to further job losses, lower incomes, and even less spending, amplifying the downturn and delaying recovery [^notfound].

---

## Empirical evidence supporting the link

Historical data consistently show that **demand-deficient unemployment** is associated with reduced investment, slower productivity growth, and prolonged economic stagnation. For example, during the Great Recession, unemployment surged while investment and productivity growth plummeted, contributing to a prolonged recovery. Similarly, recent analyses highlight that emission reductions during recessions reflect reduced economic activity rather than structural shifts toward greener production, underscoring how demand contractions suppress output and investment [^060b324f].

---

## Counterarguments and limitations

While supply-side factors (e.g. technological innovation, labor market flexibility) influence growth, **demand-side constraints** can dominate in the short to medium term. Persistent demand weakness can lead to hysteresis — long-term damage to potential output — making demand management crucial for sustaining growth.

---

## Policy implications

Addressing demand-deficient unemployment requires **activating fiscal and monetary policies** to boost aggregate demand, stimulate investment, and support employment. Public investment, targeted social spending, and supportive monetary conditions can mitigate the negative growth effects of unemployment and restore productive capacity [^notfound].

---

Unemployment due to insufficient demand depresses growth by **reducing consumption, investment, and productivity**, while eroding human capital. Option C accurately captures these dynamics, whereas options A, B, and D misrepresent the economic effects of unemployment.

Introduction

Evidence underscores the contribution of health investment to substantial improvement in life expectancy, quality of life, and economic growth through productivity of human capital., Economic downturns that followed the COVID-19 pandemic and worldwide concerns on fiscal and economic sustainability, has reignited the debate on the role of health investments in promoting economic growth and stability, and on the risk of fiscal retrenchment with austerity measures that lead to health budget cuts. As a result, there are renewed efforts to better articulate the mechanisms through which health investments yield economic gains and to quantify broader health and economic benefits of these investments.

Earlier studies have identified three mechanisms through which health investments yield economic benefits. First, health investments in cost-effective innovations help improve health outcomes and reduce direct healthcare costs in a health system., These savings can help ease financial pressures on health systems and be redirected to areas where they are most needed. Second, investments in health can help improve health and wellbeing of individuals and therewith reduce indirect costs. A healthier population is economically more productive, with a longer productive life and reduced absenteeism and presenteeism. Thus, health investments produce health capital and in consequence human capital. Third, an often-overlooked mechanism is the benefit of health investments on the broader economy by influencing supply and demand across various other economic sectors within the country. While the health sector is commonly associated with healthcare services, we broaden this perspective assessing the entire 'Health Economy' that includes three subsectors, namely: the Healthcare Economy (circumventing inpatient and outpatient care, doctors, and hospitals), Industrial Health Economy (pharma, medtech, research and development [R&D]), and Service and Support (health insurance, retail trade; Fig. 1).

Discussion

Can we sustain economic growth and at the same time reduce its environmental impacts to keep humanity within a "safe operating space?" This question, one of the most important for our collective future, still lacks a consensus answer. Our results can inform that debate in the following ways.

First, historical data chart our direction of travel. Continuing to expand output while reducing absolute emission levels requires that we drastically reduce the carbon intensity of the global economy (i.e. GHGe per unit of GDP), and, additionally, that rising economic activity (encouraged by these efficiency gains) does not result in a decrease in absolute emissions — thus avoiding the "rebound effect,." Does history suggest we are moving in that direction? During the first century and a half following the Industrial Revolution and its initial spread in the West, global economic output, resource use, and emissions were coupled and grew at roughly the same pace. This means that, at the global scale, technological change did not result in a significant fall in emissions per unit of GDP, except (partially) during the interwar years. Some countries were already experiencing instances of decoupling throughout the nineteenth century, although these were mostly explained by the slowing down of deforestation processes rather than by substantial emission-mitigating technological change. It was only after World War II that a more generalized pattern of relative decoupling emerged. New technologies and their global diffusion, as well as service-oriented structural change in advanced economies, substantially reduced the energy required per unit of output –. Furthermore, the transition from coal to oil and gas, and more recently towards renewable energy sources, reduced the GHG emitted per unit of energy, thus decoupling (to an extent) emissions from energy use.

Fig. 7
Construction of skill distribution from income data.

(left) Empirical income distribution and fitted log-normal distribution. (right) Skill distribution is based on the fitted income distribution, normalized to represent the total skill pool in the economy.

Their economic behavior, influenced by diverse income sources such as labor, investments, and social benefits, shapes their consumption, savings decisions, and overall liquid wealth (W i, t). Actively engaging in both labor and goods markets, households make strategic consumption choices based on price and availability and adjust market relationships in response to demand fulfillment. This adaptive behavior not only reflects their individual economic circumstances but also contributes to the broader market dynamics, affecting the supply-demand equilibrium in the consumer goods and labor markets. At each time step t, households make decisions: (1) the amount of goods to consume and their suppliers, (2) their employer. The consumption amount depends on their wealth level W i, t, interpreting W i, t as liquid wealth excluding assets like real estate (as in). The wealth level adjusts through various income sources, with labor incomedefined as:where w i, t is the wage for L i labor units provided, and U B t are unemployment benefits. Total wealth for consumption at t is, where L A i, t is the liquid asset level. Households choose goods based on price and availability, adjusting market relationships in response to demand fulfillment. In case of unmet demand, they buy from other producers until no supply remains, avoiding high involuntary savings due to market mismatches. After transactions, they know their true consumption leveland liquid assets L A i, t +1 for the next period. Households may break trade connections with unsatisfactory suppliers (probability ψ Q) or seek lower prices (probability ψ P), applying pressure on producers to meet demand and reduce prices. Again, they are only bounded rational. In our case, this means, instead of analytically solving their explicit inter-temporal choice problem, they approximate it by comparing a finite set of actions (i.e. they lack the ability to compute perfect optima). These households have consumption and investment preferences, based on their wealth levels and heterogeneous time preferences. Each household i inter-temporal optimization problem is defined as:where α i is the absolute propensity to consume, as a portion of wealth level W i, t.is the household's discount factor with j − t as index for current and future time steps, and U (⋅) is the utility function, given as. This optimization problem is constrained by:Here, Y i, t is the household's income level at time t, which can come from labor, capital, or government subsidies. C i, t is the consumption level and r t the real interest rate. In order to solve the optimization problem in equation (2), households form expectations of their future income- and wealth level and the interest rate. These expectations are formed using simple adaptive updating rules:whereis the expected value and ω is a weighting factor. Based on the optimization problem, heterogeneous time preferences, and adjusting changing expectations, households have heterogeneous saving rates on both the cross-sectional and inter-temporal levels. Furthermore, these savings are precautionary, meaning that savings are motivated by the desire to keep a stable consumption level in case of a negative income shock. As a result, aggregate behavior qualitatively matches empirical data for the marginal propensity to consume, as shown in Fig. S7.

The number of capital- and consumer good producers in the model is static, but individual firms can go bankrupt, and are then replaced by a new entrant. Firms with zero market share or negative assets are declared bankrupt and removed from the model. The replacing firms acquire a fraction of the average level of capital. Capital good producers may select a technology that is a fraction χ N E of the best available technologiesand, with χ N E ~ Beta(α 2, β 2), χ N E ∈ (0, 1). New consumer good producers can choose capital goods through the aforementioned brochure mechanism. In Fig. S15 we investigate the impacts of varying entry/exit conditions and observe high sensitivity to these choices.

The consumer market is designed to minimize unnecessary involuntary savings due to market mismatching. Households form preferences for known consumer goods producers based on price, with preferences inversely proportional to the square of the prices. A matrix of weights is generated to allocate household consumption budgets across producers. If demand exceeds supply, a producer can be replaced, and the process is repeated to optimize market matching.

Energy producer

The energy producer in our model is based largely on the work of ref. but we have added carbon and energy taxes to better simulate policy impacts on emissions. The markup rate determination has also been modified to account for additional market dynamics related to green energy transitions. The energy producer is a profit-maximizing monopolist which produces energy units to meet energy demand. Households do not directly buy energy, and thus only affected by energy prices through the prices of producers. Both consumer- and capital good producers require energy for their production process, but the supply for energy is never constrained. The number of units these producers require is equal to their average energy efficiency technology levels, and, times their total production levels. Based on the total energy demand, the energy producer can determine its profit function as (equation (10) Lamperti et al.):In this equation, is the energy price at time t, the total cost of producingunits of energy, the total replacement and expansion investments andthe R&D expenditures.

### Navigating independence: the short-term and long-term impacts of USAID dismantling on Somalia's humanitarian and development landscape [^f36c7b57]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

However, within this challenging scenario lies an undeniable opportunity, a forced but necessary catalyst for Somalia to fundamentally reimagine its development paradigm and prioritise greater self-reliance. While the immediate shock of reduced aid will be painful, it compels a critical examination of the long-term sustainability of aid dependence. For too long, Somalia's development trajectory has been shaped by external funding and agendas, potentially undermining local ownership and fostering a culture of reliance rather than self-determination. This stage demands a strategic shift towards building endogenous capacity and mobilising domestic resources.

The path to self-reliance is multifaceted and requires rigorous action across various fronts: 1) Strengthening domestic revenue generation is paramount. This necessitates comprehensive tax reforms (eg, broadening the tax base beyond import duties, improving compliance, potentially digitising collection), improvements in tax collection efficiency, and enhanced governance and transparency to build public trust and attract both domestic and foreign investment. 2) Diversifying Somalia's economy beyond traditional sectors like livestock and remittances is equally critical. Investing in sectors like renewable energy, technology, fisheries, and sustainable agriculture can create new livelihood opportunities and reduce vulnerability to external economic shocks. 3) Investing in human capital through education, skills training, and entrepreneurship is essential for building a productive and self-sufficient workforce. Prioritising quality education and vocational training aligned with the needs of a diversifying economy is crucial. 4) Good governance and accountability are the bedrock of sustainable development. Combating corruption, strengthening institutions and promoting transparency are essential for creating an enabling environment for economic growth, attracting investment and ensuring efficient resource allocation. 5) Engaging the Somali diaspora, a significant source of remittances and expertise, strategically is another vital avenue. This could involve creating secure investment approaches like diaspora bonds for infrastructure or establishing formal channels for skills transfer in critical sectors. 6) Exploring South-South cooperation with other developing nations that have successfully transitioned to greater self-reliance can provide valuable lessons and partnerships. 7) Empowering local civil society organisations and NGOs to play a leading role in development, fostering local ownership and accountability, is crucial for ensuring that development initiatives are truly responsive to Somali needs and priorities.

Beyond the formidable technical challenges involved, such a transition would need to meet the requirements of fairness. Not every country, and not every person, has contributed equally to climate change (Supplementary Fig. 3). Acknowledging the principle of "shared but differentiated responsibilities," each country's remaining fair share depends on historical cumulative emissions, and so efforts should also be diverse. Moreover, such a transition would need to take into account not just climate impacts, which are the only ones we examine in this study, but also other environmental impacts which can be equally harmful to human wellbeing.

Third, our results highlight emission reductions during economic recessions. Rather disturbingly, history tells us that emission reduction in the past owes at least as much (if not more) to recessions than to episodes of genuine green growth. Modern economic development and anthropogenic GHGe have been historically so closely intertwined that most fossil-fuel emission reduction has taken place during times of contraction rather than expansion of economic activity. Importantly, this does not imply that to save the planet we should hope for socio-economic crises: recessions reduce emissions primarily because of the conjunctural slowdown of economic activity, not because they make the structure of output or employment "greener." If they did, their impact on emissions would be sustained through time, and the data show otherwise. Instead, what the historical mirror suggests is that economic growth as we know it since industrialization is by default coupled with rising emissions. This does not entitle us to predict that the future will follow this pattern. But if genuine green growth becomes the new norm, it will enter the archives as a discontinuity in historical development.

### Carbon pricing drives critical transition to green growth [^2f5d6290]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of carbon pricing, specifically through a carbon tax, has been a subject of considerable debate, primarily due to apprehensions regarding its impact on economic growth, income distribution, and international competitiveness. However, emerging evidence suggests that these adverse effects can be substantially mitigated. A pivotal strategy in this regard is the efficient recycling of carbon tax revenues, coupled with the adoption of re-distributive measures, which can effectively cushion the impact on economic growth. The economic costs associated with carbon taxes are generally evaluated in terms of the change in future GDP relative to a baseline scenario devoid of such a tax. This evaluation often involves a dichotomy of economic models: the top-down models, which utilize aggregate economic data and underscore sectoral interactions, and the bottom-up models, which focus on technological solutions for energy efficiency and fuel substitution. Top-down models typically predict GDP loss under emissions stabilization, while bottom-up models suggest minimal or positive impacts on GDP growth from carbon taxes. The IPCC report echoes this, presenting a range of outcomes from net benefits (1.2%) to marginal losses (0.5%). The efficacy of carbon taxes hinges on factors like economic context and model assumptions. Notably, GDP doesn't fully represent welfare; a dip in GDP growth could coincide with welfare gains due to environmental benefits. The key lies in the effective use of carbon tax revenues and the responsiveness of economic agents. Properly recycled revenues could lead to positive economic growth effects, addressing initial concerns about carbon pricing.

### Unlocking global carbon reduction potential by embracing low-carbon lifestyles [^d19025ed]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In summary, low-carbon lifestyles can play a pivotal role in short and medium-term climate mitigation efforts by reducing energy demand and overall consumption. These actions offer a swift and effective means of curbing climate change and carry fewer environmental risks compared to the implementation of technology-based measures. Recent events like the COVID-19 pandemic and the global energy crisis triggered by the Russia-Ukraine conflict have demonstrated that rapid, widespread, and profound changes in lifestyles are possible with government and civil society coordination. However, we have to recognise that such lifestyle changes primarily through reducing household demand could lead to rebound effects due to re-spendings elsewhere. Policymakers should pay attention to mitigating such unintended consequences when designing carbon-saving policies. Additionally, achieving substantial, lasting emissions reductions requires both demand-side measures and supply-side technology solutions. They provide complementary solutions rather than one being superior to the other. Implementation of supply-side technologies faces technical challenges and may require significant timing and investment. In this case, demand-side solutions provide breathing space for the deployment of long-term technology-based reduction measures. Finally, while this study focuses on consumption-based mitigation, consumer choices are largely influenced by availability and accessibility. To achieve meaningful and widespread adoption of low-carbon lifestyles, policies must also address the production side, ensuring that sustainable options are both widely available and affordable.

### Impact of China's primary healthcare reforms on utilisation, payments and self-reported health: a quasi-experimental analysis of a middle-aged and older cohort 2011–2018 [^d856e551]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

The short-lived increases in primary care utilisation and lack of impacts on hospitalisations in this study suggest the PHC reforms have not addressed the continued hospital domination in the Chinese health system. Previous studies from China show that the frequency of primary care use has grown after the reform but still lagged behind hospital care. Hospitals continued to have an increasing share of patient visits after the reform, and hospitalisations were sometimes unnecessary or avoidable. This situation is likely to have not improved, hinted at by the limited impacts on hospitalisations found in this study. The short-lived increase in primary care utilisation highlighted in this study suggests the PHC sector was not powered for long-term growth or taking over the full responsibility of providing treatments for minor and chronic diseases. The growth of the PHC sector is challenged in several aspects. The proportion of government health expenditures allocated to PHC in China remains smaller and has grown slower than funds allocated to hospitals. Many PHC facilities are underequipped, experience shortages of essential medicines, and do not provide tests like X-rays, deterring people's visits to PHC facilities. There is also a shortage of PHC health professionals. The PHC workforce is often undertrained, poorly paid and with limited career opportunities, discouraging health professionals from working in the PHC. The shortage of funding, equipment and skilled workforce negatively affects the quality of care in PHC, making it less competitive than hospitals.

The lack of collaboration and coordination between the PHC and hospital sectors can also hinder a long-term transition towards a PHC-oriented health system. There were few incentives and cross-ministry effortsto encourage collaboration and integration between the PHC and hospital sectors. Quality-oriented performance measurements were also absent from the reform(eg, monitoring unnecessary hospital use) with hospitals neither accountable nor motivated to collaborate with PHC. There are fragmented financing mechanisms between PHC and hospital sectors, which were not addressed by the reforms. As hospitals are under pressure to generate revenue, they compete with PHC facilities for patients and human resources.

There are also unaddressed needs from the demand side that discourage the use of the PHC sector. For patients, inconvenient reimbursement processes, limited availability of health services and essential medicines, long travel timesand inconvenient transportationdiscourage the use of PHC facilities, and these underlying factors were not targeted during the reforms. Chinese citizens' continue to have a preference for hospital carestemming from low trust in the PHC sectorand perceived higher quality care in hospitals.

### Real world data on digital remote refraction in a healthy population of 14, 680 eyes [^161ac5ee]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Refractive errors are the leading cause of preventable visual impairment (VI) worldwide. For adults and children, myopia is the predominant refractive error. Although the prevalence of myopia varies significantly based on a number of factors such as location and age, it is estimated half of the world's population will have myopia by 2050. Moreover, in 2020 between 510 and 826 million people with presbyopia are reported to have VI simply due to not wearing adequate reading glasses, also expected to increase significantly in the future. Implications of VI are severe; over $205 billion is estimated in reduced productivity yearly due to refractive errors for mild, moderate, and severe VI. This is compounded by lagging academic and personal development, reduced quality of life, increased mortality, and depression. The biggest drivers for uncorrected refractive errors (URE) are population growth, environmental factors, and lack of access to health care. Ironically, the return on investment of visual aids is roughly 10-fold on a societal perspective and is among the most cost-effective interventions in health care. Yet, conventional in-office refractive error assessments require trained staff, specialized equipment, mydriatics, or all; whereby UREs remain a gobal public health problem due to a lack of access to eye care services, particularly in less developed regions of the world.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### What is a wellbeing economy, and what might its impact be on population health? [^2f2e5e84]. The Lancet: Public Health (2025). High credibility.

The current polycrisis (intersecting and mutually-reinforcing crises that are impacting our ecological, social, and economic systems) has foregrounded the need to transform economies to put them in service of people and planet, rather than design them in pursuit of ever more economic growth. This approach, termed a Wellbeing Economy, is the subject of considerable policy interest and could have substantial impacts on population health if widely implemented. We discuss different interpretations of similar terms for economic systems and how these interpretations imply incremental reforms to the dominant capitalist model, or a radical break in economic design. We detail routes to a Wellbeing Economy and suggest that more radical approaches hold greater potential to address the polycrisis and protect population health. We summarise how the implementation of a Wellbeing Economy could be a commensurate response to the polycrisis that might also yield substantial benefits for population health.

### Challenges and opportunities for high-quality battery production at scale [^cb4c603e]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Manufacturing performance

Ultimately, of course, a business cannot build and operate a multi-billion-dollar battery factory without a return on its investment. This return is determined by several cell production indicators, such as capital expenditures, operating expenses, yield, ramp-up time, utilization, throughput, profitability, and the occurrence rate of field failures. Here, we use the term "manufacturing performance" to broadly describe these performance metrics. Given the thin profit margins (often 2–3%)with which battery factories operate, quality concerns are often in tension with these manufacturing performance indicators. For instance, the decision of what to do with a batch of cells with marginal failures might be heavily debated between production and quality teams. Furthermore, an engineering team may require a couple of weeks to assess the risk of a potential quality issue, but a production team must often make decisions on daily or even hourly timescales to avoid inventory buildup or, worse, a line shutdown. However, allowing defective cells to escape the factory carries significant reputational risk for both the cell producer and OEM and may require substantial engineering resources to resolve in the future.

One underappreciated attribute of manufacturing performance is dynamicism, or the ability to respond to change. In an overly idealized view, a battery factory statically maintains fixed operational objectives. In reality, a factory must dynamically respond to a variety of internal (e.g. new equipment, new process learnings, new cell designs, business objectives) and external (e.g. improved or less expensive materials and components, new learnings from the field, market demand, policy incentives) factors. While too many simultaneous demands can threaten production stability, dynamicism is a key ingredient of manufacturing success.

Finally, we mention that the sustainability of battery production is becoming an increasingly important manufacturing performance metric. For instance, an estimated 30–65 kWh are consumed in the factory for every kWh of cells produced. Furthermore, scrap rates can range from < 5% to as high as 90% during ramp-up,; while recycling these scrap materials can improve the sustainability of battery production, better yet is to reduce the rate of scrap in the first place. Generally speaking, a strong emphasis on quality and quality control can be a powerful lever to minimize wasted material and energy during battery production.

### Emergency response in resource-constrained settings: a scoping review of prehospital trauma care in LMICs [^a14a4629]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Trauma is a leading cause of mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where effective prehospital care can significantly improve survival. However, the development of robust prehospital systems is hindered by systemic barriers, including fragmented services, inadequate resources, and undertrained personnel. This study aimed to systematically map the evidence on these challenges and the solutions being implemented to overcome them. We conducted a scoping review following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. A scoping search was conducted in PubMed, ScienceDirect, and EBSCO databases was performed to identify primary research studies focused on prehospital trauma care in LMICs. After screening, a total of 23 articles met the inclusion criteria. Data related to barriers and facilitators were extracted, charted, and synthesized using a thematic analysis approach. Four key themes of barriers were consistently identified across the 23 studies: deficits in provider training and continuous education; inadequate infrastructure, physical resources, and communication systems; fragmented governance and a lack of standardized clinical protocols; and significant sociocultural obstacles, including a lack of public awareness and fear of legal repercussions for providing aid. Conversely, effective facilitators centered on context-specific training for both lay and professional responders; community-based initiatives that empower local volunteers as first responders; the application of low-cost, appropriate technology for communication and dispatch; and the establishment of supportive policy and legal frameworks. Strengthening prehospital trauma care in LMICs requires a paradigm shift away from simply attempting to replicate resource-intensive models from high-income countries. The evidence synthesized in this review strongly suggests that the most effective and sustainable pathway lies in fostering context-specific, community-driven solutions. Investing in lay responder training and low-cost technological innovations, all supported by clear national governance, represents a powerful strategy to reduce the burden of preventable death and disability in these settings.

### Vulnerability of power distribution networks to local temperature changes induced by global climate change [^d725a271]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Fig. 2
The analysis diagram based on model integration for assessing the impact of climate change on electricity distribution services.

This analysis diagram is visualized using a centered flower-style plot that summarizes the hazard-vulnerability-response model. Hazard refers to the potential physical events or phenomena that could cause harm or disrupt the power distribution system. Vulnerability is the degree to which a power distribution system and its consumers are susceptible to the adverse impacts of climate change. Response refers to how the power distribution grid reacts to climate-induced hazards. Step 1: Modeling the hazard of the global climate change (GCC)-driven local temperature changes. Step 2: Scope the Environment for Assessment. The assessment begins by identifying the pure effect of climate change, isolated from other factors such as economic growth and energy transition. Step 3: Climate-Blackout Response Model. This step involves modeling the response of the grid to the interfered effects of temperature sensitivity of demand and climate change under various GCC scenarios, which can be analyzed by Temperature-Blackout Risk Response (TB3R). Step 4: Assessing and comparing the GCC's impact. Step 5: Analyze how the GCC-driven temperature change raises the blackout risk and design adaptation strategies. The analysis diagram captures the complex interactions between demand temperature sensitivity, grid topology, capacity, and climate change, providing some adaptations to address the vulnerabilities of electricity distribution grids to climate-related stresses.

### Lithium-ion battery recycling relieves the threat to material scarcity amid China's electric vehicle ambitions [^105e8c3e]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Two practical challenges should be considered while answering these questions. First, unclear recycling responsibilities and inadequate infrastructure lead to low battery collection rates. Informal market entities with poor technical capabilities compete to purchase scrapped batteries as the upstream materials price increases. Consequently, only 20% of scrapped LIBs flow into formal recycling channels, enlarging the gap between demand and supply of the critical material. Second, the uncertainty of a secondary supply of critical material stems from uncertainty in the technical evolution of batteries. Valuable cathode materials like nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) and lithium nickel cobalt aluminum (NCA) are favored in LIBs recycling, while EV manufacturing stakeholders, including giants like Tesla, are increasingly focused on lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries with the potential risk of soaring prices and unstable supply of critical materials. Therefore, the lack of long-term insights into battery technology evolution and recycling process could strain EV deployment efforts, creating resource constraints and supply chain vulnerability in the domestic battery industry. To address uncertainty, we devise a scenario-based strategy for LIB recycling (See Methods section for details of scenarios).

With reference to the environmental impacts, the recycling strategy portfolio for LIBs can help reduce the life-cycle carbon emission by partially offsetting the energy consumption and emissions from battery manufacturing and logistics. However, as emissions from battery manufacturing decrease due to the expected cleaner energy mix, the environmental gains from recycling could also diminish. To account for changes in energy sources, we consider a CN60 electricity mix and incorporate a scenario-based strategy into the life-cycle assessment (LCA), creating a dynamic model to reflect decreasing carbon intensity due to the renewable energy transition.

Economic feasibility is also crucial in determining whether battery recycling is an efficient and versatile industry pillar and must be evaluated across multiple dimensions. First, process-based cost evaluation, which decomposes the cost produced in the recycling process into discrete analysis units, reveals granular cost differences across various recycling technologies. Second, financial returns evolve over time owing to the economies of scale driven by technological progress and improved resource allocation. Third, considering the capital-intensive nature of LIB recycling, the optimized spatial configuration can reduce logistics costs, a factor that is often overlooked. To consider all these dimensions, we geographically optimize location-based cost factors and embed them within the process-based cost assessment, providing insight into how the spatiotemporal evolution of LIB recycling configuration affects the supply chain financial costs.

### Erosion of traditional employment: impact on health and economic well-being [^f9dd8ce3]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To describe growth of alternative and contingent employment and the impacts of these changes in State of California.

Methods

We administered surveys to random samples of population of the State in 1999–2000 and 2022–2023 to compare the frequency of kinds of work, working conditions, economic well-being, and health status in the two dyads of years.

Results

Between 1999–2000 and 2022–2023, decreasing fractions of the population of the State work full-time/full-year; report regular shifts, jobs with long tenures, and upward mobility in their careers; while increasing fractions report fair or poor health and financial strain.

Conclusion

Employment changes are associated with a worsening in the health status and economic well-being of the population of the State. Longitudinal follow-up of the same individuals would be necessary to establish a causal connection among these phenomena.

### Public health impacts of underemployment and unemployment in… [^c8a6b5a9]. stacks.cdc.gov (2021). Medium credibility.

Public Health Impacts of Underemployment and Unemployment in the United States: Exploring Perceptions, Gaps and Opportunities 2021/10/01. Details Personal Author: Description: Background: Unemployment, underemployment, and the quality of work are national occupational health risk factors that drive critical national problems; however, to date, there have been no systematic efforts to document the public health impact of this situation. Methods: An environmental scan was conducted to explore the root causes and health impacts of underemployment and unemployment and highlight multilevel perspectives and factors in the landscape of underemployment and unemployment. Methods: included a review of gray literature and research literature, followed by key informant interviews with nine organizational representatives in employment research and policy, workforce development, and industry to assess perceived needs and gaps in practice.

Results: Evidence highlights the complex nature of underemployment and unemployment, with multiple macro-level underlying drivers, including the changing nature of work, a dynamic labor market, inadequate enforcement of labor protection standards, declining unions, wage depression, and weak political will interacting with multiple social determinants of health. Empirical literature on unemployment and physical, mental, and psychological well-being, substance abuse, depression in young adults, and suicides is quite extensive; however, there are limited data on the impacts of underemployment on worker health and well-being. Additionally, organizations do not routinely consider health outcomes as they relate to their work in workforce or policy development. Discussion and Conclusions: Several gaps in data and research will need to be addressed in order to assess the full magnitude of the public health burden of underemployment and unemployment.

Public health needs to champion a research and practice agenda in partnership with multisector stakeholders to illuminate the role of employment quality and status in closing the gap on health inequities, and to integrate workforce health and well-being into labor and economic development agendas across government agencies and industry.

### Ageing affecting the americas? exploring the growth direction: the relationship between the elderly population and economic growth in the American context [^445af8a4]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Results and discussion

The study's primary purpose is to examine the causal relationship between the elderly population and economic growth utilising secondary data from a panel data set covering the period from 1961–2020. The research analysed 1,525 observations across 25 American countries.

Table A2 Appendix presents the summary of descriptive statistics. Results show that among the countries covered in this study, Guyana on the South American had the highest per capita GDP per capita growth rate, while Nicaragua on the North American continent had the lowest per capita GDP per capita growth rate. Specifically, Puerto Rico on the North American continent, shows the largest adult population growth, while Nicaragua on the North American continent, shows the lowest adult population growth.

Figure 1 illustrates the flow of per capita GDP growth rates from 1961 to 2021 in South American countries and Fig. 2 represents North American countries. In Fig. 1 (A), Suriname showed an increase in per capita GDP in 1966 compared to other countries. According to Fig. 1 A and B, Argentina and other South American countries, in particular, experienced an economic recession in 2001. In Fig. 1 (B), due to reasons such as stagnation, inflation and crisis, Brazil's economy declined compared to other countries during 1981–1992 and in 2016, all countries considered in this study underwent an economic recession. Figure 2 (A) shows that the economy has generally fluctuated, but in the Bahamas in 1981, the economy has undergone a major setback. According to Fig. 2 (A), several countries experienced an economic recession in 1981–1996.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Appropriate scope and caveats for cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs): The intention of CEAs is not to directly influence patient-level decision-making; instead, systematically applying CEAs at the health system level can promote efficient resource use and improve population health outcomes and would ideally be performed across the entire set of options rather than evaluating each intervention in a silo. CEAs can inform the prices of new health technologies entering the market, improving the affordability of and access to novel diagnostic and treatment strategies. Resource allocation is a complex process that, beyond efficiency, depends on political priorities, scalability and affordability of the proposed intervention, and its impact on health equity; this is particularly important in cardiovascular disease given that 1 in 3 US adults received care for a cardiovascular risk factor or condition in 2020. To improve health care efficiency, CEAs have to be updated over the intervention's life cycle and policymakers have to be willing to defund less-efficient programs; adding programs that are "cost-effective" without removing those that are no longer cost-effective continues to drive up health care spending without optimizing efficiency. This statement uses the term CEA for analytic frameworks with effectiveness outcomes that reflect patient or community preferences over health states (eg, quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) — scope and caveats emphasize that the intention of CEAs is not to directly influence patient-level decision-making, and systematically applying CEAs at the level of the health system can promote efficient use of resources and improve population health outcomes; they would ideally be performed across the entire set of options available to generate health, rather than evaluating each intervention in a silo, which can be challenging in the United States given the fragmented nature of our health care system. CEAs can inform the prices of new health technologies entering the market, thus improving the affordability of and access to novel diagnostic and treatment strategies, while resource allocation is a complex process based on several considerations in addition to the efficient use of resources, including political priorities, scalability and affordability of the proposed intervention, and its impact on health equity; these considerations are particularly important for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease given the large number of individuals affected — 1 in 3 US adults received care for a cardiovascular risk factor or condition in 2020 — and the substantial economic burden of cardiovascular disease. CEAs have to be updated over the intervention's life cycle as more cost and effectiveness data become available, and policymakers have to be willing to defund less-efficient programs already in place, because adding more programs and interventions that are "cost-effective" without removing interventions that are no longer cost-effective continues to drive up health care spending without optimizing efficiency.

### Amphetamine (dyanavel XR) [^4d150a5e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

9.1 Controlled Substance

DYANAVEL XR contains amphetamine, a Schedule II controlled substance.

9.2 Abuse

DYANAVEL XR has a high potential for abuse and misuse which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. DYANAVEL XR can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution.

Abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, to achieve a desired psychological or physiological effect. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a health care provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence.

Misuse and abuse of amphetamine may cause increased heart rate, respiratory rate, or blood pressure; sweating; dilated pupils; hyperactivity; restlessness; insomnia; decreased appetite; loss of coordination; tremors; flushed skin; vomiting; and/or abdominal pain. Anxiety, psychosis, hostility, aggression, and suicidal or homicidal ideation have also been observed with CNS stimulants abuse and/or misuse. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including DYANAVEL XR, can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)], and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection.

9.3 Dependence

Physical Dependence

DYANAVEL XR may produce physical dependence. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug.

Withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or dose reduction following prolonged use of CNS stimulants including DYANAVEL XR include dysphoric mood; depression; fatigue; vivid, unpleasant dreams; insomnia or hypersomnia; increased appetite; and psychomotor retardation or agitation.

Tolerance

DYANAVEL XR may produce tolerance. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose).

### The health economics of insulin therapy: how do we address the rising demands, costs, inequalities and barriers to achieving optimal outcomes [^c9436c5c]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The health economic value of insulin is usually expressed within a cost-effectiveness framework providing an estimated incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Insulin clinical trials adopt a treat-to-target design in which both intervention and control arms aim to achieve similar levels of glycaemic control thereby allowing a comparison of secondary safety outcomes such as hypoglycaemia and weight gain. While of use to inform clinicians about the new insulin's tolerability, it is of limited use for an economic evaluation. An insulin's true potential value requires an assessment of the relationship between the benefits of attaining individualised glycaemic goals versus the factors known to act as barriers to the initiation/intensification of insulin and that also contribute to poor adherence in clinical practice. Addressing the rising demands that diabetes will impose upon the healthcare system will require the simultaneous execution of multiple strategies that acknowledge population dynamics, healthcare delivery constraints, the role of innovation and funding requirements. Accounting for patient-specific characteristics to develop individualised plans and utilising technologies that address relevant barriers to care will require a whole-system perspective on healthcare value and an appreciation of the interconnectivity of stakeholder needs. Importantly, convenience and treatment satisfaction are often not considered valuable features of insulin therapy; not only do they have value, but they are essential to addressing rising demands. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: More people around the world are living with diabetes. This is because people are living longer, populations are getting older, and more people are developing the disease. Clinicians will have to prescribe insulin for more people. To make well-informed decisions about how to spend money on diabetes care, we need to understand how much therapies costs and how well they work. In healthcare, people often talk about "value for money". This means getting better results without spending more money, or saving money without making things worse. However, it's not always easy to figure out the value of new types of insulin. The way insulin is studied in clinical trials doesn't always relate well to how it works, and is used, in real-life clinical practice. Many studies don't look at all the things that matter, like how easy it is for people to use the insulin or how it affects their daily lives. When two types of insulin have comparable efficacy in terms of lowering blood sugar, other things - like side effects, how easy it is to use, and how well people stick to their treatment - become important drivers of value. These things are different for each person, may be left out of studies and may not considered to be important by decision makers. In this paper, we first discuss how the health economics of insulin has traditionally been studied, and look at the findings, advantages and disadvantages of these approaches. We also describe how tools like continuous glucose monitors (which track blood sugar all the time) can help people improve outcomes. We introduce what we call the "insulin value system". This looks at how the features of the insulin, the patient's circumstances, and the state of the healthcare system interact to determine the value of a new therapy. In the case of insulin therapies, traditional approaches to value assessment don't always capture the full picture. Our second goal is to talk about the big challenges in diabetes care, for which there are no easy solutions. More people are getting diabetes, and more money will be needed for treatment and disease management. We believe that to really help make a difference, we need to consider the whole healthcare system, how everything is connected, and not just focus on one part. We believe it's important to look at how people live and work, their personal circumstances and how they and the healthcare system interact when assessing the value of insulin. That way, we can better understand how new treatments can help both people and the wider healthcare system.

### Non-linear association of low birthweight with risk factors including women's BMI: evidence from an international comparison [^38fc90a2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

To further confirm the plausibility of the DID approach, we examined employment rate trends for treatment and control groups (Fig. 4). The observed patterns indicate that employment rates followed similar trends before 2008, supporting the assumption that any post-crisis divergence is attributable to the financial shock rather than pre-existing differences.

Fig. 4
Parallel trends in employment rates. Panel a: Employment rate trends for both groups. Panel b: Employment rate trend for the control group. Panel c: Employment rate trend for the treatment group. Observed employment rates for treatment and control groups before and after the 2008 financial crisis. Group1 (treatment) consists of the countries with real GDP growth rates in 2008 and 2009 in the bottom 50%, and Group 0 (control) represents all others

Columns (1) and (2) of Table 5 present the estimation results of Eq. (2). When R_LBW is regressed on the three variables AFTER, GROUP, and CROSS (= GROUP×AFTER), CROSS is significantly positive at the 1% level, indicating that countries hit harder by the financial crisis have a lower low-birthweight rate than those that were not (column 1). In column (2), when EMPLOYEE and EMPLOYEE 2 were added, CROSS was significantly positive at the 5% level.

Columns (3) and (4) present the estimation results of Eq. (4). Column (3) presents the results when only EMPLOYEE and EMPLOYEE 2 were included in CONTROL. Column (4) presents the results of the full specification of the control variable as in column (1) of Table 4. The coefficients of CROSS × EMPLOYEE and CROSS × EMPLOYEE 2 are significantly positive and negative, respectively, indicating that the impact of the financial crisis via EMPLOYEE significantly increased the low-birthweight rate but diminishingly.

Table 5
The estimates of Eqs. (2) and (4): DID analysis

Dependent variable is R_LBW. The estimation method used was a fixed effects model. GROUP was omitted because of collinearity, as it was a constant variable throughout time. CROSS is GROUP multiplied by AFTER. Robust standard errors are indicated in the parentheses. In all the columns, were not included to obtain significant results.

### Ageing affecting the americas? exploring the growth direction: the relationship between the elderly population and economic growth in the American context [^7f96792d]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and policy implications

While inherent differences exist between the countries in terms of a cumulative context, the study focused that the per capita GDP is, in fact, often being impacted by the growth of the ageing population. Henceforth, these considerations must be considered when developing further research strategies to identify the ageing population's impact on the countries' economic growth. Particularly with different political, cultural, and social issues on the ageing population in both North and South America – it won't be easy to fathom a sustainable solution to minimise the economic impact of the ageing population. Therefore, these mediator variables should also be considered for further studies when analysing the ageing population and their connected issues. Through such a comprehensive assessment of the economic impact of the ageing population, there can be more specific problem identification, which will be easier to diagnose and implement through systemic decision making. These factors can be brought into future studies; therefore, intensifying the current study's generalisability.

Granger causality test results for South American countries show that Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, and Peru have unidirectional causality, while the rest of the countries show no directionality. Granger causality test results for North American countries show that Costa Rica, Honduras, and Puerto Rico have unidirectional causality, while the rest of the countries show no directionality. Wavelet coherence analysis conclude that economic growth positively led the elderly population in North America during the late 21st century. Furthermore, economic growth had negatively led the elderly population in South America during this period.

The major policy implication in dealing with the ageing population in both North and South America is to consider the long-term impact of the ageing population and understand the need for talent outsourcing. When a country's dependency ratio rises, it may not be viable for the existing native population to fulfil the given production requirement. Therefore, this relates to the fact that the countries which are largely affected by this ratio outsource their talent from countries with a strong fertility rate. Thus, specifically, countries such as the US need to reconsider this strategy. The countries such as the Bahamas, Puerto Rico and Bahamas, with strong informal economies connected to the tourism industry, will face a much different future in managing their ageing population. Hence the policies is should be developed based on the context of that particular country.

### Bidirectional association between internet use and depressive symptoms among middle-aged and older adults in China: a cross-lagged model of proactive health behavior as the mediating role [^7b0bb110]. Depression and Anxiety (2025). Medium credibility.

Our results also showed that internet use not only directly influences depressive symptoms among middle-aged and older adults but also indirectly improves their mental health by enhancing their proactive health behavior. Previous research has found that internet may enhance the health and well-being of older adults or middle-aged adults through various pathways, such as helping them maintain close contact with friends and family members, increasing their levels of social support and social contact and social capital, promoting their social engagement, and increasing their social trust. The finding of this study enriches the research on how internet use benefits the health of middle-aged and older adults by revealing the potential mechanism from the perspective of health promotion. Internet is a pivotal tool for fostering "information dissemination," which is instrumental in reducing the cost of information spread and broadening users' channels of information. Internet use facilitates access to health information for older adults to acquire more health-related knowledge and improve their health production skills. According to the knowledge attitude practice (KAP) model, the acquisition and comprehension of knowledge leads to more positive attitudes, which in turn lead to better practices and behaviors. By disseminating relevant health-related information, internet aids older adults in recognizing the importance of healthy practices and enhancing their health awareness, catalyzing the "practice" of health behaviors among older adults. This finding further confirmed the critical point of Grossman's theory, which argues that health is an "investment commodity," to maintain an individual's health requires the exercise of subjective initiative and continuous "investment in health," which includes inputs such as the utilization of medical care, food, and behavior. As an essential investment in health, proactive health behavior practiced by individuals can promote the accumulation of health capital, improving middle-aged and older adults' health outcomes. Our findings revealed that proactive health behavior is an important pathway through which digital technology empowers the health of middle-aged and older adults, thus, providing more effective paths for promoting healthy aging. Achieving healthy aging not only relies on external forces to maintain the dignity and quality of life of older adults but also requires encouraging older adults to actively maintain their health through internal forces, such as health behavior.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Budget impact in economic evaluations — Budget impact refers to the effect of adopting the intervention on total health care expenditures, accounting for both increased spending due to intervention-related costs and downstream savings from improved health in the treated population, and high-quality evaluations typically report changes in intervention-related costs, the cost of cardiovascular care (for example, savings from averted major adverse cardiovascular events), and the cost of noncardiovascular care (for example, increased spending due to prolonged survival). The budget impact is directly proportional to the number of eligible patients who receive the intervention, with studies typically reporting the projected effect on health care spending if all eligible patients were to receive the drug, and because budget impact may inform strategies for adoption at a population level, this information may be included in the supporting text accompanying the economic value statement where available.

### Case studies: a guide for researchers, educators, and implementers [^c5906bfe]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Step 1: Prepare and explore

Browse the literature and if it looks promising, do a scoping review. Visit candidate case study sites and talk to people close to the action. Confirm that there is an issue to be explored, that a case study design is appropriate, and that you would be welcome to gather data in your chosen site(s). Identify someone on-site who agrees to be your gatekeeper.

Step 2: Formulate a research question

Clarify your purpose and how your research question addresses a gap in the existing knowledge base. Make your philosophical assumptions explicit (ie, decide, for the purposes of answering your research question, whether you are a positivist, post-positivist, constructivist, pragmatist, or other). Match your question and its philosophical underpinnings with an appropriate case study design and sampling strategy from the list in table 3. You may wish to align with a specific case study researcher and follow their recommended approach (box 1).

Step 3: Define your case

Develop a broad outline of what organisation(s), groups, activities, and timescales you will include, and refine this as your data emerge. The question "What is at stake [for front-line actors]?" can highlight the core issues, conflicts, or important consequences associated with the case and hence guide you in sharpening your unit of analysis. See the bounded system element in table 2.

Step 4: Consider potential data sources

These sources might include documents (eg, plans, protocols, letters, reports, minutes of meetings, complaints, archival records), informal interviews (eg, preliminary phone calls), semi-structured interviews, focus groups, ethnographic observation, technology walkthroughs, and capture of informal material (eg, jokes). Ethnography often generates more useful data than interviews. If you plan to use a highly structured method designed to develop and test theory (step 8), you may need to standardise your data collection across case study sites.

Step 5: Gain access and pilot data collection

Meet with people in your study site(s) (not just top management), build relationships, and involve these individuals in refining the data sources and collection methods. Take advice from front-line actors on how to manage sensitivities, meet ethical requirements (eg, confidentiality, duty of care), and capture the perspective of marginalised groups.

### The association between drug shortages and prices across 74 countries: uncovering global access inequities [^c72c3867]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this study of 25 global drug shortages across 74 countries, the majority of countries experienced extended clinically meaningful shortages, lasting a median of 10 quarters. This prolonged duration reflects the broad impact of shortages affecting multiple countries simultaneously, posing challenges different from regional country-specific shortages. Our study supports that drug shortages have global tendencies, with 84% of the shortage cases affecting most countries. Our result of variation in shortage severity and incidence highlights that shortages do not happen in all countries in the same manner, at the same timing or to the same extent — an important finding that highlights an opportunity to further understand differences between countries. We found that price was not a significant predictor of either shortage odds or intensity. Importantly, we observed an apparent inequity in the impact of shortages across countries, with countries with higher GDP per capita being associated with lower shortage odds and shortage intensity.

Overall, price was not a strongly significant predictor in either the main or sensitivity analyses, disproving the assumption that most drug shortages can be explained by the price of those medications. This is likely because manufacturers' supply decisions are driven by factors related to costs, profit and revenue, which are more closely influenced by market sizes, robust supply chains and regulatory conditions, with higher per-unit prices a determinant for market entry rather than for supply. This finding is consistent with a previous study, which modelled the supply chain and conducted scenario analysis using the US industry data. It found that solely increasing drug prices is ineffective as it fails to address the underlying issues of production capacity and inventory management, which are critical for alleviating drug shortages.

Notably, our analysis revealed that, within the same market, countries with a higher number of manufacturers were less likely to experience shortages. This finding aligns with the theory that more manufacturers could render supplies elastic, consequently reducing shortage risks.WHO has suggested that maintaining a viable pharmaceutical market may benefit from a supplier base of at least three independent manufacturers. Thus, collectively, our findings suggest the need to consider complementary policy approaches that increase the number of manufacturers beyond pricing. For example, the proposed Critical Medicines Act in the European Union seeks to strengthen drug supply chain resilience by supporting strategic projects to expand manufacturing capacities in the Union; requiring procurement criteria beyond price — such as supplier diversification; and exploring international partnerships to reduce reliance on single sources.

Explanation

Planning dosing strategies in EPDF trials can be complex depending on the research context, adaptive trial design features, and methods considered. EPDF trials are increasingly designed to seamlessly address multiple objectives that span multiple transition points of clinical research (e.g. dose escalation to [multiple] expansion cohort(s), phase I to II, single ascending dose to multiple ascending dose). The increasing complexity of trial design and dosing strategies can be challenging for readers to comprehend.

Hence, authors are encouraged to provide a graphical representation of the overall schema of the proposed trial, when possible, to show the timing of major reviews and decision points, highlighting any overlap between study cohorts and parts to help the reader interpret the logical stages of the process (see Example 2). When a trial consists of different parts, the trial design schema should show the timing and criteria of major transition or progression points (e.g. dose escalation to expansion, dose escalation to dose optimisation (particularly as outlined in projects like the FDA Optimus project, which focuses on selected tolerable doses to ensure they are active and tolerable), phase I to phase II, single ascending dose to multiple ascending dose, stage 1 to stage 2 with a formal interim analysis for futility/activity, monotherapy to combination regimen, or exploration of an alternative administration schedule or route).

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^68cfa501]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness thresholds — framework and updates explain that the 2014 ACC/AHA statement provided per–capita GDP–based thresholds such that an intervention with an ICER < $50 000 per QALY gained should be considered high value, $50 000 to < $150 000 (1-3x per capita GDP) per QALY gained should be considered intermediate value, and ≥ $150 000 per QALY gained should be considered low value. The World Health Organization's program suggested that costs less than 3 times the national annual GDP per capita per disability-adjusted life year averted should be considered cost-effective, whereas costs less than 1 times should be considered highly cost-effective; however, experts have argued this approach lacks theoretical justification, and World Health Organization experts now also advise against the use of per capita GDP-based cost effectiveness thresholds and instead suggest considering cost-effectiveness information alongside other contextual information in a transparent multicriterion decision process. The writing committee reviewed alternative approaches, including relying on US-based studies; for example, a health opportunity cost analysis estimated that at 2019 prices, for every $1000000 increase in health care expenditures 1860 persons were projected to become uninsured with 81 QALYs lost due to mortality and 15 QALYs lost due to morbidity, implying a cost-effectiveness threshold of $104 000 per QALY ($51 000 to $209 000 per QALY) in 2019 US dollars, and in the probabilistic analysis 40% of the simulations suggested the threshold was less than $100 000 per QALY.

Adventure travel personal health requirements state that travelers might need medical clearance to participate in a trip, and for travelers with chronic diseases, healthcare professionals should carefully consider medical clearance and provide prescriptions for regular medications. Screen travelers for conditions that can be exacerbated by environmental hazards or exertion and check for a history of anaphylaxis-level allergies, asthma, cardiac disease, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, diabetes, joint replacement, opioid-dependent pain, oxygen-dependent emphysema, recent surgery, sleep apnea, or stroke; any of these conditions could indicate that a traveler is at risk for adverse outcomes under physiological stressful conditions, and travelers with a previous history of environmental illness (e.g., altitude illness, anaphylaxis, frostbite, heat exhaustion, hypothermia) could be at risk for recurrence. Counsel travelers to carry electronic copies of their most recent electrocardiogram and chest x-ray, their medical and surgical history, and a medication list, and blood type may be useful to know for trips in extremely remote locations or long expeditions. Caution travelers who rely on battery-operated devices (e.g., continuous positive airway pressure machine, insulin pump) about the possibility of device failure or lack of electricity and discuss the need for a backup plan or the possibility that they should avoid adventure travel altogether; some people with chronic illnesses, especially those who are medically dependent on electronic devices, who have difficulty ambulating, or who are medically frail, likely are not good candidates for adventure travel. Adequate hydration, nutrition, and sleep could be in short supply, especially with increased demands due to exertion, terrain, and weather, so during the planning stages, travelers should pay attention to how they will obtain food, rest, and water on their journey.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^eb467017]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Environmental risk factors — cigarette smoking and COPD risk: Cigarette smoking is a key environmental risk factor for COPD, and cigarette smokers have a higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms and lung function abnormalities, a greater annual rate of decline in FEV1, and a greater COPD mortality rate than non-smokers. Most COPD studies have included patients with a cigarette exposure of a minimum of 10 pack-years, yet one study has suggested that even at reduced smoking exposure (< 10 pack-years) the 5-year risk of developing COPD is increased in middle-aged adults, with increased risk of severe exacerbation and early death. Nonetheless, fewer than 50% of heavy smokers develop COPD and it is estimated that half of all COPD cases worldwide are due to risk factors other than tobacco, and genetics modify the risk of COPD in smokers with additional influences including gender, social pressure, and socioeconomic status linked to birthweight that may impact lung growth and development.

### Prasugrel [^b398a874]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 General Risk of Bleeding

Thienopyridines, including prasugrel tablets, increase the risk of bleeding. With the dosing regimens used in TRITON-TIMI 38, TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) Major (clinically overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin ≥ 5 g/dL, or intracranial hemorrhage) and TIMI Minor (overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin of ≥ 3 g/dL but < 5 g/dL) bleeding events were more common on prasugrel tablets than on clopidogrel [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The bleeding risk is highest initially, as shown in Figure 1 (events through 450 days; inset shows events through 7 days).

Figure 1: Non-CABG-Related TIMI Major or Minor Bleeding Events.

Suspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone coronary angiography, PCI, CABG, or other surgical procedures even if the patient does not have overt signs of bleeding.

Do not use prasugrel tablets in patients with active bleeding, prior TIA or stroke [see Contraindications (4.1, 4.2)].

Other risk factors for bleeding are:

Age ≥ 75 years. Because of the risk of bleeding (including fatal bleeding) and uncertain effectiveness in patients ≥ 75 years of age, use of prasugrel tablets is generally not recommended in these patients, except in high-risk situations (patients with diabetes or history of myocardial infarction) where its effect appears to be greater and its use may be considered [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Trials (14)].
CABG or other surgical procedure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Body weight < 60 kg. Consider a lower (5 mg) maintenance dose [see Dosage and Administration (2), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].
Propensity to bleed (e.g., recent trauma, recent surgery, recent or recurrent gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, active peptic ulcer disease, severe hepatic impairment, or moderate to severe renal impairment) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7, 8.8)].
Medications that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., oral anticoagulants, chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], and fibrinolytic agents). Aspirin and heparin were commonly used in TRITON-TIMI 38 [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2, 7.4), and Clinical Studies (14)].

A multifaceted approach is needed to improve system-level access to care.➢ Although a number of procurement policies are utilized, providers in low and middle-income countries often struggle with inconsistent supply chains, leading to delays in care or less desirable management strategies.➢ Partnerships between governments, academic institutions, and nongovernmental agencies are needed to improve access to devices by providing funds for patients and creating regulatory bodies to ensure product quality and availability.➢ There should be a focus on local and regional manufacturing as well as job creation within low and middle-income countries to achieve sustainable access to orthopaedic devices.➢ High-quality research initiatives are needed to provide evidence-based solutions. This includes a focus on outcomes-based studies to determine best management practices within the low and middle-income countries' context and operations research to optimize systems for device procurement.

Unemployment, like smoking, is a health hazard not only for the unemployed person but also for his or her family members. In this short book Dr Smith, who is an assistant editor for the British Medical Journal, provides a thorough, easy-to-read review of what is known about the relationship between unemployment and health. The book consists of a revised and expanded series of articles that appeared in the British Medical Journal; the contents are heavily oriented toward Britain, and this will probably limit the book's appeal to an American audience. To document that unemployment harms health, the author has drawn on material from psychology, sociology, economics, history, literature, and journalism, as well as medicine.

### Supply-side and demand-side factors affecting allopathic primary care service delivery in low-income and middle-income country cities [^1a09ebac]. The Lancet: Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Most people in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) now live in cities, as opposed to rural areas where access to care and provider choice is limited. Urban health-care provision is organised on very different patterns to those of rural care. We synthesise global evidence to show that health-care clinics are plentiful and easily accessible in LMIC cities and that they are seldom overcrowded. The costs that patients incur when they seek care are highly variable and driven mostly by drugs and diagnostics. We show that citizens have agency, often bypassing cheaper facilities to access preferred providers. Primary care service delivery in cities is thus best characterised as a market with a diverse range of private and public providers, where patients make active choices based on price, quality, and access. However, this market does not deliver high-quality consultations on average and does not provide continuity or integration of services for preventive care or long-term conditions. Since prices play a key role in accessing care, the most vulnerable groups of the urban population often remain unprotected.

### Deflazacort [^3280d118]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Immunosuppression and Increased Risk of Infection

Corticosterosids, including deflazacort, suppress the immune system and increase the risk of infection with any pathogen, including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic pathogens. Corticosteroids can:

- Reduce resistance to new infections
- Exacerbate existing infections
- Increase the risk of disseminated infections
- Increase the risk of reactivation or exacerbation of latent infections
- Mask some signs of infections Corticosteroid-associated infections can be mild but can be severe, and at times fatal. The rate of infectious complications increases with increasing corticosteroid dosages. Monitor for the development of infection and consider deflazacort withdrawal or dosage reduction as needed. Tuberculosis If deflazacort is used to treat a condition in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, reactivation of tuberculosis may occur. Closely monitor such patients for reactivation. During prolonged deflazacort therapy, patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity should receive chemoprophylaxis. Varicella Zoster and Measles Viral Infections Varicella and measles can have a serious or even fatal course in non-immune patients taking corticosteroids, including deflazacort. In corticosteroid-treated patients who have not had these diseases or are non-immune, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure to varicella and measles.
- If an deflazacort-treated patient is exposed to varicella, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immunoglobulin may be indicated. If varicella develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.
- If an deflazacort-treated patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immunoglobulin may be indicated. Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation Hepatitis B virus reactivation can occur in patients who are hepatitis B carriers treated with immunosuppressive dosages of corticosteroids, including deflazacort. Reactivation can also occur infrequently in corticosteroid-treated patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection. Screen patients for hepatitis B infection before initiating immunosuppressive (e.g., prolonged) treatment with deflazacort. For patients who show evidence of hepatitis B infection, recommend consultation with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for hepatitis B antiviral therapy. Fungal Infections Corticosteroids, including deflazacort, may exacerbate systemic fungal infections; therefore, avoid deflazacort use in the presence of such infections unless deflazacort is needed to control drug reactions. For patients on chronic deflazacort therapy who develop systemic fungal infections, deflazacort withdrawal or dose reduction is recommended. Amebiasis Corticosteroids, including deflazacort, may activate latent amebiasis. Therefore, it is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating deflazacort in patients who have spent time in the tropics or patients with unexplained diarrhea. Strongyloides Infestation Corticosteroids, including deflazacort, should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid- induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gram-negative septicemia. Cerebral Malaria Avoid corticosteroids, including deflazacort, in patients with cerebral malaria.

### Evaluation and management of pediatric refractory constipation: recommendations from the NASPGHAN neurogastroenterology and motility committee [^c96bb05a]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric refractory constipation — transabdominal ultrasonography (TAU) has been primarily used to evaluate the transverse diameter of the rectum to diagnose constipation or fecal impaction; however, there are concerns about its lack of reproducibility and unsatisfactory correlation with clinical diagnosis of constipation, and a systematic review yielded insufficient evidence for a diagnostic association between clinical constipation symptoms and rectal diameter in children, although it has good agreement with detecting fecal impaction. TAU has a good agreement with DRE to evaluate for fecal impaction but should not be performed in place of DRE (Agreement: 8/8).

Regarding classification and risk stratification for age-related macular degeneration, more specifically with respect to risk factors (other factors), AAO 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that an increased waist/hip ratio for men is associated with an increased risk of both early and late AMD. Markers of inflammation, such as CRP, may be associated with a higher risk of AMD progression. Other possible factors with inconclusive findings include: hormonal status; sunlight exposure; alcohol use; vitamins B and D status. A Cochrane systematic review in 2016 concluded insufficient evidence to define a role of statins in AMD onset or progression.

### The multifaceted nature of lack of access to antibiotics: types of shortage and specific causes, consequences, and solutions [^aa0b6eef]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Maintaining access to a broad range of old and new antibiotics is increasingly difficult due to supply, market, and demand issues. Next to immediate negative consequences for individual patients and healthcare systems, antibiotic unavailability can accelerate resistance development due to unmotivated use of suboptimal broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Objectives

Although academics and policymakers agree that lack of access to antibiotics is a major public challenge, there are widely different situations of lack of access that are not always clearly identified. Therefore, this paper aims to clarify potential confusion by delving into four different types of lack of access, their specific causes, consequences, and potential solutions.

Sources

The paper builds on a narrative review of academic and policy literature about lack of access to antibiotics and potential solutions to address it.

Content

We discuss causes as well as economic and clinical consequences of four different types of antibiotic unavailability: short-term shortages, long-term shortages, deregistrations, and lack of registration. The discussion is supported by examples from Norway, Romania, and Ethiopia, three countries characterized by clearly different market sizes and ability to pay. Common causes for all types of lack access include unattractive markets, dependence on few suppliers and insufficient communication, whereas other causes are specific to one type (e.g. insufficient inventories cause short-term shortages or regulatory complexity hinders registration). Longer lack of access entails more serious clinical consequences and higher risk of resistance development, but may not correspondingly increase costs in the long-term if alternatives are identified.

Implications

It is essential to understand the type of unavailability at hand because no single solution can address all types. For instance, stockpiling addresses short-term shortages, but not long-term ones or deregistrations. However, supply chain transparency and pooled procurement are remedies that support other solutions and can cope with several types of lack of access.

### Mental health effects of unemployment and re-employment: a systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies [^bdafa5b6]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations of this review

Our review has several strengths. We followed systematic review guidelines, adhering to a preregistered protocol with predefined research questions, search strategy and inclusion criteria. Study selection and appraisal were based on prespecified criteria, with independent assessments and consensus meetings. We also follow the PRISMA 2020 guideline for reporting systematic reviews.

To enhance efficiency, we manually screened only 28% of records, using EPPI-Reviewer's priority screening tool, which effectively identifies relevant studies early in the process. The recall plot indicated that relevant study identification plateaued after 1000 screened records, with few additional relevant studies found thereafter, suggesting a low probability of missing relevant studies. Additionally, we implemented a rigorous stopping rule, requiring that no relevant records be identified in the last 600 screened before concluding manual screening. Given these safeguards, we consider the risk of missing important studies to be minimal.

However, some limitations apply. First, our search was restricted to 2012–2024, relying on Van der Noordt et al for studies from 1990 to 2012. Differences in search strategies and inclusion criteria between the two reviews may have affected comparability. However, both reviews followed systematic review guidelines, and we excluded studies from Van der Noordt et al that did not meet our inclusion criteria, ensuring consistency in the selection process. While narrow inclusion criteria improved comparability and enabled meta-analyses, they restricted conclusions to individuals currently in the workforce. Furthermore, the geographical distribution of the included studies should be noted: of the 38 studies, 21 were from Europe (eight from the UK), 10 from Australia, four from the USA and three from Asia. While findings likely generalise across diverse regions, the overrepresentation of UK and Australian studies may limit broader applicability. Regional differences warrant further investigation.

Finally, to assess certainty of evidence, we applied the GRADE approach, which is widely used but typically assigns an initial 'low' certainty to observational studies. This has prompted debate about its suitability in fields like occupational and environmental health, where randomised trials are rarely feasible. Alternative frameworks, such as the Navigation Guide, developed for environmental health sciences reliant on observational studies, begin with a 'moderate' rating for high-quality observational studiesand may offer a more appropriate framework in such contexts. While a full comparison is beyond our scope, we followed GRADE to ensure a transparent and systematic assessment, while acknowledging the relevance of ongoing discussion around grading methodologies.

### Unemployment-United States, 2006 and 2010… [^95bd2a3f]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

The association between unemployment and poor physical and mental health is well established. Unemployed persons tend to have higher annual illness rates, lack health insurance and access to health care, and have an increased risk for death. Several studies indicate that employment status influences a person's health; however, poor health also affects a person's ability to obtain and retain employment. Poor health predisposes persons to a more uncertain position in the labor market and increases the risk for unemployment. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment prevalence in the United States increased from 4. 7% in 2006 to
9. 4% in 2010, yielding an estimated 14. 5 million unemployed persons. Both the prevalence of unemployment and the health status of populations vary widely among and within communities by age, sex, and race/ethnicity.

In 2010, the unemployment prevalence both for males and females was twice as high in the black and Hispanic populations as in the white population. The disparities in unemployment prevalence extend across the country and have increased from January 2008 to December 2010. Because unemployment has historically been substantially higher in black and Hispanic populations during past decades and because unemployment has increased substantially from the start of the recession in December 2007, associations between unemployment and health and between unemployment and minority status need to be further studied. Methods To assess changes in unemployment rates by several population characteristics, CDC analyzed 2006 and 2010 data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The association between unemployment and self-reported health status, physical health, and mental health in 2010 also was examined.

The 2010 state-specific unemployment prevalences were calculated and shown on a U. S. map using statistical software; prevalences were shown for men and women, non-Hispanic blacks, and non-Hispanic whites. The same question from the BRFSS survey was used to assess employment status and unemployment status by asking participants whether they are currently 1) employed for wages; 2) self-employed; 3) out of work for > 1 year; 4) out of work for < 1 year; 5) a homemaker; 6) a student; 7) retired; or 8) unable to work. Data were analyzed to assess disparities in unemployment prevalence for 2006 and 2010. To examine the association between unemployment and health status, data for the following three health outcomes were collected from the 2010 BRFSS data set: 1) health status, 2) number of physically unhealthy days, and 3) number of mentally unhealthy days.

Results Unemployment prevalence increased from 2006 to 2010 for all adults aged 18–64 years, particularly among adults aged 25–44 years. In general, unemployment prevalence increased among both males and females; however, males reported higher unemployment prevalence than females in both 2006 and 2010, and this difference gradually increased to 2010. The highest unemployment prevalence among racial/ethnic groups was among non-Hispanic blacks, which was almost twofold that of non-Hispanic whites. The unemployment prevalence for American Indians/Alaska Natives increased substantially from 8. 8% in 2006 to
15. 8% in 2010. In both years, the unemployment prevalence among persons with no health insurance was approximately 4 times higher than that for persons with health insurance. The unemployment prevalence decreased as levels of education and income increased in both 2006 and 2010.

### A building-scale modeling framework for urban net-zero transitions in nanjing [^99c5e218]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Decarbonizing end-use sectors is fundamental to achieving carbon neutrality in buildings –. This process necessitates the incorporation of micro-level information such as building type, function, footprint area, and floor height for accurate identification and strategic planning. However, much of the existing research adopts a "top-down" approach to chart future decarbonization pathways for buildings, employing methods like input-output models – and computable general equilibrium models. While these "top-down" approaches are useful for studying the relationship between national economies and energy use, forecasting CO 2 emission trajectories, and informing policy development, they are inherently macro-level and lack the granularity needed to delineate specific pathways for achieving carbon neutrality at the building scale. On the other hand, "bottom-up" simulation methods such as the MARKAL/TIMES model, MESSAGE model, EFOM-ENV model, and LEAP model – have been employed to forecast future energy demand and CO 2 emissions across various sectors. Despite their detailed focus, these studies often fall short of integrating energy demand-side and supply-side factors to comprehensively analyze energy consumption and the associated CO 2 emissions(SI Table 1). As critically identified by Keirstead et al. while most building energy system studies (∼70%) incorporate endogenous demand-side parameters, supply-side factors remain systematically underrepresented. When occasionally included, they are typically reduced to static carbon intensity factors for rudimentary energy-to-emission conversions. Although Zhou et al.pioneered an integrated framework incorporating both demand-side and supply-side mitigation policies, their analysis remained constrained at the national level in China, without resolving critical spatial scales down to urban systems — let alone neighborhood or individual building levels that are essential for implementable decarbonization strategies. This gap underscores the need for a more holistic framework that bridges demand-side dynamics with supply-side considerations to achieve precise and actionable decarbonization strategies for buildings. In this paper, we develop a building-based emissions accounting approach at the city-scale that considers building type, function, footprint area, and floor height of individual buildings, and we integrate point source data from facility-level power plants to characterize the structure of the energy supply sector. In this way, the CO 2 emissions of Scope 1 and Scope 2 in the operational phase of the building are calculated.

### Health programme spillover effects on childhood vaccination in India: a difference-in-differences analysis of the zinc and oral rehydration salts programme using retrospective demographic health surveys data [^db16927b]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The expansion of vaccination programmes has been a major contributor to declining child mortality during the last century. However, stagnating or declining coverage rates threaten the progress achieved. Consequently, there is a growing interest in finding approaches that maintain and improve current vaccination rates. The current literature on the determinants of vaccination uptake has mainly examined supply and demand side factors focusing on vaccine-targeted interventions. Multicomponent programmes have also recently been shown to improve vaccination rates, as a part of broader improvement in children's and women's health. Public health interventions to address non-vaccine-related diseases also have the potential to specifically improve vaccination rates. Producing such evidence is important to identify alternative strategies for improving vaccination coverage and to estimate the returns on public health intervention investments.

In this study, we evaluate the effect of the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) zinc/Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) Programme on the child vaccination coverage rate in India. It was a vertical programme to solve a specific health issue (acute diarrhoea) by removing supply and demand side barriers. Positive spillovers from vertical programmes can materialise through horizontal programme aspects that strengthen health systems (eg, the development of surveillance systems and quality control).CHAI's horizontal programme aspects in India included improvements in general health services, for example, an increased training of Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) and mass media campaigns towards caregivers. Another explanation for health programme spillovers is changes in household behaviours. Previous studies have shown that childhood immunisation and antimalaria campaigns can have positive spillovers on birth weight and private health expenditures, respectively. This signals that as competing risks to child health diminish, households are likely to perceive a greater marginal benefit or return on investment in other preventive health measures, prioritising long-term well-being over immediate concerns that are partially solved.

The evidence on public health intervention spillovers is scarce, and there are no studies that explore how other programmes, not targeting immunisation, can influence immunisation coverage.

Health communication with refugees, immigrants, and migrants (RIM) communities — interpreter use best practices include to "Position yourself physically to speak directly to the patient, not the interpreter" and "Do not use medical jargon or acronyms." Additional instructions are to "Speak in a clear, normal voice" and "Speak in short simple sentences and pause to give the interpreter time to relay the message accurately," to "Minimize gestures to convey meaning" and "Ask only 1 question at a time, and make sure only 1 person is talking at a time." Further guidance is to "Allow your interpreter to ask for a clarification" when needed and to "Confirm understanding by asking the patient to repeat key information back to you." Practical logistics include that "For phone or video interpretation, it can be helpful to provide brief background information or context" and "If speaking over the phone, using a landline rather than a cellphone will ensure you have a stable connection for the entire appointment," plus "For longer appointments, check in with your interpreter to see if they need a break," and the caution "Do not say anything in the encounter that you do not intend for the patient to hear."

The change from baseline to Week 24 in the number of monthly SSEs (i.e., sexual intercourse, oral sex, masturbation, or genital stimulation by the partner). The SSEs were based on patient responses to the following questions: "Did you have a sexual event?" and "Was the sex satisfying for you?"
Studies 1 and 2 had a different sexual desire endpoint than Study 3:
In Studies 1 and 2, the sexual desire co-primary endpoint was the change from baseline to Week 24 in the calculated monthly sexual desire score and was based on patient responses to the question: "Indicate your most intense level of sexual desire." Every day, patients rated their sexual desire level from 0 (no desire) to 3 (strong desire) and recorded their response in an electronic Diary (eDiary). These responses were summed over a 28-day period to yield the calculated monthly sexual desire score, which ranged from 0 to 84.
In Study 3, the desire domain of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI Desire) was the sexual desire co-primary endpoint. The desire domain of the FSFI has two questions. The first question asks patients "Over the past 4 weeks, how often did you feel sexual desire or interest?", with responses ranging from 1 (almost never or never) to 5 (almost always or always). The second question asks patients "Over the past 4 weeks, how would you rate your level (degree) of sexual desire or interest?", with responses ranging from 1 (very low or none at all) to 5 (very high). The FSFI Desire score was calculated by adding the patient's responses to these two questions then multiplying that sum by 0.6. The FSFI Desire domain score ranged from 1.2 to 6.

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^4c3935f7]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for age-related macular degeneration, more specifically with respect to risk factors (general principles), AAO 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that the main unmodifiable risk factors for the development of advanced AMD are increasing age, Northern European ancestry, and genetic factors. Although a number of modifiable risk factors have been investigated, cigarette smoking is the main one that has been consistently identified in numerous studies. Importantly, it is essential to recognize that the associations found in observational studies that analyze risk factors should not be interpreted as cause and effect. Such associations may not necessarily translate into treatment recommendations, as multiple confounding variables may not be accounted for in the studies.

 Do not store the Pen with a Needle attached.
Follow the instructions in Section 2, Step 2D (Remove air from new Cartridge) to remove air bubbles from the Cartridge.
It is normal to see small air bubbles. It will not cause any harm or affect the dose.
What should I do if the screw does not move out when there is no Cartridge attached to the Pen?
The screw may not move out when you push the Injection Button unless there is a Cartridge in the Pen. This allows you to easily push the screw into the Pen Body when replacing a Cartridge.
After a Cartridge is attached, the screw will move out when the Injection Button is pushed.
What should I do if I cannot attach the Cartridge to the Pen Body?
Check that the Cartridge is not damaged or broken.
Carefully line up the Cartridge with the Pen Body and screw them together until secure. If the Cartridge and Pen cannot be screwed together, contact your healthcare provider.
Why is it hard to push the Injection Button when I try to inject the dose?
The Needle may be clogged. Try attaching a new Needle.
Pushing the Injection Button down quickly may make the Injection Button harder to push. Pushing the Injection Button more slowly may make it easier.
Using a larger Needle will make it easier to push the Injection Button during injection. Ask your healthcare provider which Needle is best for you.
The Injection Button may become harder to push if the inside of the Pen gets dirty with HUMATROPE, food, drink, or other materials.
What should I do if the dose knob does not go to zero (0) when I inject the dose?
This can happen if the HUMATROPE Cartridge does not have enough HUMATROPE left in it for the full dose.
At the end of the injection, the number in the dose window should be 0.00. If you see any number other than "0.00", this is the amount of HUMATROPE you did not receive. Write this number down and follow the steps below to get the rest of your dose.
To get the rest of your dose:
Remove the Needle and empty Cartridge from the Pen.
Insert a new Cartridge, attach a new Needle, and remove air from the new Cartridge (see Steps 2A through 2D).
Complete your dose by injecting only the amount you did not receive (see Step 3C).
If you still do not think you received your full dose, do not take another dose. Call Lilly at 1-800-545-5979 or your healthcare provider for assistance.
What should I do if I see HUMATROPE leaking from the Needle after I have finished the injection?
It is normal for a single drop to remain on the tip of the Needle after the injection is complete. If you see more than 1 drop:
The full dose may not have been delivered. Do not inject another dose. Talk with your healthcare provider for assistance.
To prevent this, for the next dose, firmly push and hold the Injection Button in and slowly count to 5 (see Section 3, Step 3C).
How can I tell when the injection is complete?
The injection is complete when:
You place your thumb on the injection Button, then slowly and firmly push the Injection Button until it stops moving.
Continue to hold the Injection Button for 5 seconds, then remove the Needle from the skin.
You will see 0.00 in the center of the dose window.
