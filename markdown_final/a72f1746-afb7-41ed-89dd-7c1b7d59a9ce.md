## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an overview of Crohn's disease and its management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease definition, epidemiology, and pathophysiology to anchor the clinical context. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach and the principle that symptoms do not equal inflammation. Next, I will review risk stratification and the treat-to-target framework. After that, I need to examine induction and maintenance therapies, including when to escalate and when to de-escalate. I will then consider special scenarios like fistulizing disease, strictures, and postoperative care. Finally, I should integrate monitoring, biomarkers, and imaging, and close with patient education and shared decision-making, ensuring each step aligns with contemporary guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the disease construct and epidemiology so I don't gloss over fundamentals. Crohn's disease is a chronic, relapsing, transmural inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus, with a progressive and destructive natural history and rising incidence worldwide, particularly in younger patients, which underscores the need for early, effective disease control to alter long-term outcomes [^115HaUgS] [^112aFzMU] [^115pRYVm].

> I need to check the pathophysiology to connect mechanism with therapeutic choices. The disease arises from a dysregulated innate and adaptive immune response in genetically susceptible hosts, shaped by environmental exposures and an altered gut microbiota, producing transmural inflammation that leads to complications such as strictures and fistulas over time, which is why anti-cytokine and anti-trafficking strategies are mechanistically rational [^115HaUgS] [^112aFzMU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnosis based on symptoms alone. I should confirm that diagnosis requires a multimodal approach integrating clinical features with objective evidence from endoscopy with biopsies, cross-sectional imaging, and biomarkers, because symptoms correlate poorly with mucosal inflammation and misclassification is common if we rely on symptoms alone [^115qk3rK] [^112XdgqW] [^114KBBGw].

> Next, I should review risk stratification because treatment intensity should match future risk, not just current symptoms. High-risk features include young age at diagnosis, ileal or ileocolonic disease, extensive anatomic involvement, deep ulcers, perianal or severe rectal disease, extraintestinal manifestations, and penetrating or stenosing phenotypes; only about 20–30% of patients have a truly indolent course, so most warrant proactive therapy to prevent bowel damage [^1125gDQu].

> I will now examine the treat-to-target paradigm, since this is the backbone of modern care. The goal is deep, durable remission defined by clinical remission plus endoscopic mucosal healing, with tight control using periodic biomarkers and objective reassessment; biomarker-guided strategies every 2–4 months with endoscopic confirmation at 6–12 months improve deep remission rates compared with symptom-only approaches, and STRIDE-II operationalizes individualized targets and timelines for escalation and de-escalation [^116F9wUw] [^112AobXu] [^113TDqTF] [^116JYjTi].

> Let me think about induction therapy and be careful not to overgeneralize. For mild, low-risk disease, budesonide or a short prednisone taper may be reasonable, but I should confirm that corticosteroids are not maintenance agents and that early immunomodulator or biologic therapy is favored in moderate-to-severe or high-risk disease; importantly, current guidelines advise against requiring failure of conventional therapy before initiating advanced therapy, favoring earlier biologics in appropriate patients [^111NWUCE] [^113a9eaz] [^114MCZf1].

> Wait, I should verify the role of antibiotics because it's easy to overuse them. Antibiotics are not effective primary therapy for luminal inflammatory Crohn's disease and should not be used as maintenance; they may have a limited role in selected scenarios like abscess control or perianal disease, but guideline-concordant anti-inflammatory therapy remains the cornerstone [^111sWj4C] [^112dJneA].

> Next, I should review maintenance strategies and the evidence for combination therapy. Thiopurines or methotrexate can maintain remission and reduce immunogenicity to anti-TNF agents, and combination anti-TNF plus thiopurine outperforms monotherapy in some contexts, though I need to balance this against malignancy risk signals and individualize decisions; anti-TNF agents are preferred for both induction and maintenance in moderate-to-severe disease, with vedolizumab and IL-12/23 or IL-23 inhibitors as alternatives based on phenotype and prior exposure [^111sWj4C] [^114nUUwj] [^111yvKRW] [^113JubWV].

> I should double-check escalation and de-escalation triggers so timing is precise. Escalation is indicated for persistent symptoms with objective inflammation, loss of response with subtherapeutic drug levels, or new complications, whereas de-escalation can be considered after 12–24 months of sustained deep remission with close monitoring for relapse; therapeutic drug monitoring helps distinguish mechanistic failure from pharmacokinetic issues [^116aq4AU] [^1154cWfE].

> Let me consider special scenarios starting with fistulizing disease, since this is a distinct phenotype. Anti-TNF therapy is first-line for induction and maintenance of fistula closure, ideally with seton drainage for abscesses and multidisciplinary care; I should confirm that continuing anti-TNF maintains response and that surgery is reserved for refractory or complex cases [^112xzpcc] [^113y65sE] [^114XXBZR].

> Now, stricturing disease requires careful phenotyping because inflammation and fibrosis demand different approaches. I need to ensure cross-sectional imaging is obtained to distinguish inflammatory from fibrostenotic strictures; active inflammation may respond to advanced medical therapy, whereas fibrostenotic, obstructive strictures often require endoscopic dilation or surgical resection or strictureplasty, with emerging consensus guiding definitions and management pathways [^111oGUto] [^113mmowo] [^115scyLF].

> Postoperative management is another area where I should verify recommendations. Prophylactic medical therapy reduces postoperative recurrence risk, and risk stratification should guide intensity; early endoscopic recurrence at 6–12 months predicts clinical recurrence and warrants escalation, so scheduled postoperative colonoscopy is prudent [^115scyLF] [^116ww5vk].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence and the role of biomarkers and imaging. CRP and fecal calprotectin every 2–4 months during active treatment with endoscopic or cross-sectional imaging at 6–12 months after initiation or adjustment improves alignment with deep remission; imaging also characterizes extent, activity, and complications, informing therapy selection and procedural planning [^116F9wUw] [^117ArENL] [^115HaUgS].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist despite therapy; I need to ensure I don't misattribute. Persistent symptoms require reassessment for active inflammation, infection such as C. difficile or CMV, medication adverse effects, or functional disorders like IBS; objective testing prevents overtreatment or undertreatment and is a prerequisite for accurate therapeutic decisions [^116aq4AU] [^114KBBGw].

> I should confirm that patient education and shared decision-making are embedded throughout. Patients often over- or underestimate disease severity, and aligning goals, risks, and monitoring plans improves adherence and outcomes; guidelines emphasize multidisciplinary care and individualized strategies that respect patient values and local resources [^112RmcMN] [^112hwEWY].

> In summary, I need to ensure the care pathway remains coherent: confirm diagnosis objectively, stratify risk to anticipate trajectory, adopt a treat-to-target approach with biomarker-guided tight control, select induction and maintenance therapies matched to risk and phenotype, escalate promptly when inflammation persists, and de-escalate cautiously after durable deep remission, all while integrating surgery when indicated and maintaining vigilant surveillance for complications and relapse [^113TDqTF] [^116F9wUw] [^116aq4AU].

Crohn's disease is a **chronic, relapsing inflammatory bowel disease** with transmural inflammation that can affect any part of the GI tract, most commonly the terminal ileum and colon [^115mXZVA]. It presents with abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and fatigue, and is diagnosed by a combination of clinical, endoscopic, histologic, and imaging findings [^115qk3rK] [^116gYeez]. Management is **individualized and treat-to-target** [^113TDqTF], aiming for clinical and endoscopic remission [^116aq4AU] using corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and biologics [^1167tgH4]; surgery is reserved for complications or refractory disease [^114Ho9J8]. Prognosis varies: about 20–30% have an indolent course, while most experience relapses and complications, including strictures, fistulas, and perianal disease [^1125gDQu] [^114XXBZR].

## Epidemiology and risk factors

- **Incidence and prevalence**: Crohn's disease is increasing globally, with higher rates in North America and Europe [^112aFzMU]; prevalence is ~0.3% in North America and ~0.2% in Europe [^notfound].
- **Age and sex**: Onset is typically 15–35 years, with a slight female predominance [^notfound].
- **Genetic predisposition**: NOD2/CARD15, IL23R, and ATG16L1 variants increase risk [^notfound].
- **Environmental factors**: Smoking doubles risk; diet, antibiotics, and hygiene hypotheses are implicated [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiology

Pathophysiology involves **transmural inflammation** with skip lesions, granulomas, and lymphocyte infiltration [^notfound]. Dysregulation of innate and adaptive immunity — including Th1/Th17 cytokines (TNF-α, IL-12, IL-23) — drives inflammation [^notfound]. Microbial dysbiosis with reduced diversity and increased pathogenic species contributes to disease activity [^notfound].

## Clinical presentation

- **Common symptoms**: Abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea, weight loss, fatigue, and fever [^115HaUgS].
- **Extraintestinal manifestations**: Arthritis, uveitis, erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, osteoporosis, and kidney stones [^notfound].
- **Complications**: Stricturing, penetrating disease, fistulas, abscesses, and perianal disease [^1125gDQu] [^114XXBZR].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis relies on a **multimodal approach** [^115qk3rK]:

| **Modality** | **Role in diagnosis** |
|-|-|
| Endoscopy | Gold standard; ileocolonoscopy with biopsies for histology [^115Ksekp] |
| Imaging | MR enterography or CT enterography for extent, strictures, fistulas [^1127wJeJ] |
| Biomarkers | CRP and fecal calprotectin for inflammation [^112AobXu] |

## Medical management

Management is **individualized and treat-to-target** [^113TDqTF], aiming for clinical and endoscopic remission [^116aq4AU]:

- **Induction therapy**: Corticosteroids (budesonide or prednisone) for acute flares; not for maintenance [^111NWUCE].
- **Maintenance therapy**: Immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate) and biologics (anti-TNF, anti-integrins, anti-IL-12/23) [^1167tgH4].
- **Advanced therapies**: Early biologics for high-risk patients; combination therapy for enhanced efficacy [^114MCZf1] [^111tuPEK].
- **Dietary therapy**: Exclusive enteral nutrition in pediatrics; limited adult data [^notfound].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for **complications or refractory disease** [^114Ho9J8]:

- **Indications**: Obstruction, perforation, abscess, fistulas, dysplasia, or cancer [^114Ho9J8].
- **Procedures**: Resection, strictureplasty, or diversion (ileostomy/colostomy) [^114Ho9J8].
- **Postoperative care**: Prophylactic medical therapy to prevent recurrence [^115scyLF].

---

## Prognosis and quality of life

- **Disease course**: Chronic, relapsing; ~20–30% have indolent disease, most have relapses and complications [^1125gDQu].
- **Complications**: Stricturing, penetrating disease, fistulas, abscesses, and perianal disease [^1125gDQu] [^114XXBZR].
- **Quality of life**: Significant impact; anxiety, depression, and fatigue are common [^1175a191].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

- **Novel biologics**: IL-23 inhibitors (e.g. risankizumab) show promise [^115ExKkw].
- **Small molecules**: JAK inhibitors (e.g. upadacitinib) are under study [^notfound].
- **Personalized medicine**: Biomarkers and genetic profiling to tailor therapy [^115xA3TJ].

### Crohn's disease [^115HaUgS]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract, with increasing incidence worldwide. Crohn's disease might result from a complex interplay between genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, and altered gut microbiota, leading to dysregulated innate and adaptive immune responses. The typical clinical scenario is a young patient presenting with abdominal pain, chronic diarrhoea, weight loss, and fatigue. Assessment of disease extent and of prognostic factors for complications is paramount to guide therapeutic decisions. Current strategies aim for deep and long-lasting remission, with the goal of preventing complications, such as surgery, and blocking disease progression. Central to these strategies is the introduction of early immunosuppression or combination therapy with biologicals in high-risk patients, combined with a tight and frequent control of inflammation, and adjustment of therapy on the basis of that assessment (treat to target strategy). The therapeutic armamentarium for Crohn's disease is expanding, and therefore the need to develop biomarkers that can predict response to therapies will become increasingly important for personalised medicine decisions in the near future. In this Seminar, we provide a physician-oriented overview of Crohn's disease in adults, ranging from epidemiology and cause to clinical diagnosis, natural history, patient stratification and clinical management, and ending with an overview of emerging therapies and future directions for research.

### Identifying patients with inflammatory bowel diseases at High vs low risk of complications [^1174iUNm]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

People with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis have varying presentations and clinical consequences of their disease. Patients commonly ask about their prognosis, and what this diagnosis means for them. They are asking their clinicians to predict the future. The importance of predicting the course of any disease is to guide patient expectations and to guide treatment decisions. In the past decade the strategy of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment has shifted to treat patients earlier in the course of their disease, before irreversible damage occurs. Treatment approaches for disease categorized as mild, moderate or severe has most often been based on a current assessment of symptoms or disease activity without including a longitudinal assessment of a patient's disease course including past disease complications and surgeries. While a patient's current disease activity most typically drives these treatment decisions, optimally, treatment decisions would be made accounting for past disease activity and complications and the predicted future disease course. When developing a treatment plan for an individual patient, the immediate goal is to treat the current disease activity for relief of symptoms, and the long-term goal is to prevent progression of their disease due to complications. Since not all patients will progress to a complicated disease course, it is important to be able to select the right patients for the right therapy. Therefore, developing methods of stratifying patients into low-risk versus high-risk of complications will be an important aspect of treating IBD now and in the future.

### Crohn's is not a 6-week disease: lifelong management of mild to moderate Crohn's disease [^111K34Fd]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease is an idiopathic, chronic inflammatory disorder of the digestive tract with heterogeneous clinical presentations. Crohn's is currently not a curable disease, and patients are faced with a lifetime of recurrent disease flare-ups and remissions. Management strategies for Crohn's must therefore be targeted toward lifelong management, taking into consideration not only the short-term but also the long-term aspects of the disease. With this in mind, here we review the classifications and natural history of Crohn's disease and discuss possible predictive factors for the disease evolution in a patient. Here we also evaluate the current preferable treatment practices, based on scientifically valid research and collective clinical experience, for the management of mild to moderate Crohn's disease.

### Optimal use of biologics in the management of Crohn's disease [^115DUFSm]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing and remitting disorder of the gastrointestinal tract with no known cure. The inflammation that drives the disease can lead to debilitating symptoms and a number of complications that may lead to surgery. The introduction of biologic therapy a decade ago has offered a new option for patients failing conventional therapy. Over time, biologic therapy has also led to the desire to achieve treatment goals beyond the control of symptoms. In order to achieve short-term and long-term goals with these new agents, it is important to review how these therapies may be optimized for the best results.

Patients with symptomatically active Crohn's disease — evaluation strategy and follow-up: "In patients with symptomatically active CD, the AGA suggests a biomarker-based assessment and treatment adjustment strategy, rather than relying on symptoms alone. (Conditional recommendation, moderate certainty in evidence)". Patients who prefer to avoid testing "may consider choosing interval symptom-based treatment adjustment when being treated for active symptoms". As implementation, "Interval biomarker assessment and treatment adjustment may be performed every 2–4 months in patients being treated for active symptoms", and after symptom resolution, "endoscopic (and/or radiologic) evaluation should be performed… typically 6–12 months after treatment initiation or adjustment", after which patients "may then transition to guidance for patients in symptomatic remission".

### A review of the therapeutic management of Crohn's disease [^111Wgbr3]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory, relapsing-remitting, and progressive gastrointestinal disorder with an often-negative impact on the physical, emotional, and psychological well-being. Over the past two decades, the medical compendium for the treatment of Crohn's disease has increased significantly, enabling treatment beyond symptoms. Indeed, early and timely use of effective medical therapy has been reflected by improved outcomes with reduction in surgery and ability to achieve clinical and endoscopic remission, reduce corticosteroid dependance, and prevent long-term complications in more patients. In this review, we discuss the key milestones in the medical management of Crohn's disease.

### Controversies in the management of anti-TNF therapy in patients with Crohn's disease: a Delphi consensus [^1154cWfE]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Consensus documents and clinical guidelines are primarily aimed to analyse the best available evidence in order to provide guidance in the treatment decision-making process. Usually, they are focused on the most relevant or common patient clinical profiles. Still, in daily practice, the treating physicians must deal with clinical scenarios that are not specifically covered by these documents.

This consensus document sought to provide guidance for managing patients with moderate-to-severe CD, including patient stratification for specific therapies or monitoring strategies, with special attention given to areas that still remain controversial. We are confident that this project likely complements the recommendations provided via national and international consensus documents and guidelines.

### A review of the therapeutic management of Crohn's disease [^113v2sst]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

CD is a chronic relapsing-remitting disease with a high morbidity rate. Its disease complexity can result in long-lasting physical, emotional, and psychological effects on patients. Over the past two decades, the medical compendium for the treatment of CD has expanded exponentially. Although surgery continues to play a pivotal role in achieving disease control for these patients with aggressive disease, novel mechanistic approaches and deeper insights with existing therapies hold real promise. The prospect of these intellectual efforts being rewarded through meaningful outcomes for individuals living with CD is now more realistic than ever before.

### Crohn's disease evaluation and treatment: clinical decision tool [^112f911M]. Gastroenterology (2014). Medium credibility.

Crohn's disease evaluation and treatment — clinical symptoms correlate poorly with the underlying inflammation, and the combination of symptom remission and endoscopic remission has been dubbed deep remission; instituting a change in therapy in symptomatic patients with objective evidence of inflammation and then reassessing the patient within 6 months to ensure that deep remission has occurred has been dubbed treat to target where the target is deep remission. Therapeutic drug monitoring is applied to help guide decision making in patients treated with biologic agents who lose response. The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute clinical support tool, "Identification, Assessment, And Initial Medical Treatment in Crohn's Disease", weaves these concepts together into a practical algorithm to help clinicians assess patients for active inflammation and the presence of complications and co-morbid conditions, risk stratify their patients, apply the therapies shown to be effective in the AGA Institute document, and ensure that patients' underlying inflammation is sufficiently treated. Both the AGA Institute and the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America have developed quality indicators for inflammatory bowel disease, and initial versions are focused on things that can be easily measured (eg, vaccinations, measuring bone density, and administering steroid sparing medications) and on demonstrating that it is possible to reduce practice variation. One could reasonably argue that these quality indicators need to be refocused on treating the underlying inflammation to resolution.

### Personalised medicine in Crohn's disease [^115xA3TJ]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Similar to many immune-mediated diseases, Crohn's disease follows a relapsing-remitting pattern, with a variable disease course and heterogeneous clinical outcomes. Frequency of flare-ups, development of complications, and response to treatment collectively determine the effect on a patient's quality of life, which can vary from minimal disruption to profound disability or death. Despite recent advances in the understanding of complex disease pathogenesis, including for Crohn's disease, management decisions are still typically made using a one-size-fits-all approach. Indeed, the inability to reliably predict clinical outcomes in a way that could guide future therapy represents a major unmet need. Recently, several important insights have been made into the biology underlying outcomes in Crohn's disease. In this Review, we will summarise these insights and discuss how greater understanding of these disease mechanisms can be used to develop clinically useful biomarkers, identify novel approaches to optimise disease control, and help deliver the goal of personalised medicine.

### Do not assume symptoms indicate failure of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy in Crohn's disease [^114diaaR]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

It is a challenge to monitor patients with Crohn's disease who remain symptomatic despite anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy. Clinicians must use a systematic approach for each patient and obtain objective evidence about disease activity and response to therapy. Alternate etiologies for symptoms should be sought and treated, if found. Active Crohn's disease despite therapy requires reassessment and adjustments to management plans.

### Management of Crohn's disease – a practical approach [^116Z89YS]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that affects up to 480,000 persons in the United States. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, malaise, and arthralgias, and cause considerable morbidity. Speculation about genetic, environmental, dietary, infectious, and immunologic etiologies has led to treatment modalities directed at each theoretic cause, but therapy guidelines are determined by the severity of disease. Use of salicylates and/or antibiotics can be effective in mild to moderate disease, while steroids are the accepted therapy for more severe active disease. Azathioprine and other immunosuppresant drugs can be used as adjunctive therapy for active Crohn's disease and may help to maintain remission. Infliximab, an antibody to human tumor necrosis factor alpha, has proved successful in the treatment of severe refractory disease and generally causes only mild side effects. Therapy for Crohn's disease must involve treating comorbid conditions to improve the quality of life of patients.

### Diagnosis and management of fistulizing Crohn's disease [^114XXBZR]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

The transmural inflammation characteristic of Crohn's disease predisposes patients to the formation of fistulas. Up to 50% of patients with Crohn's disease are affected by fistulas, which is a major problem given the considerable morbidity associated with this complication. Appropriate treatment of fistulas requires knowledge of specific pharmacological and surgical therapies. Treatment options depend on the severity of symptoms, fistula location, the number and complexity of fistula tracts, and the presence of rectal complications. Internal fistulas, such as ileoileal or ileocecal fistulas, are mostly asymptomatic and do not require intervention. By contrast, perianal fistulas can be painful and abscesses may develop that require surgical drainage with or without seton placement, transient ileostomy, or in severe cases, proctectomy. This Review describes the epidemiology and pathology of fistulizing Crohn's disease. Particular focus is given to external and perianal fistulas, for which treatment options are well established. Available therapeutic options, including novel therapies, are discussed. Wherever possible, practical and evidence-based treatment regimens for Crohn's disease-associated fistulas are provided.

### Crohn's disease evaluation and treatment: clinical decision tool [^116xtfd9]. Gastroenterology (2014). Medium credibility.

Crohn's disease — treatment for patients not in remission: For low risk patients, options include immunosuppressive therapy, assessing drug levels, and considering anti-TNF therapy. For moderate/high-risk patients, options include using anti-TNF monotherapy over no therapy or thiopurine monotherapy, and using anti-TNF + thiopurine over thiopurine monotherapy or anti-TNF monotherapy. The algorithm also includes assessment of inflammatory biomarkers and branches labeled inflammation present versus inflammation not present with actions to switch to a different drug class or to continue current drug class and dose with monitoring.

### Different perceptions on the diagnosis and treatment of Crohn's disease between patients and gastroenterologists: a multicenter retrospective study [^1175a191]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterized by unpredictable episodes of active disease alternating with periods of remission. – In moderate-to-severe cases, complications such as abscesses, strictures, and fistulas can necessitate hospitalization and surgical intervention. Although CD is less prevalent than other chronic conditions, its recurring symptoms significantly affect patients' physical, mental, and emotional well-being and overall quality of life (QoL). –

As treatment options become increasingly complex, careful consideration of the individualized benefits and risks associated with each therapy is essential. The "targeted therapy" approach has shifted treatment goals from merely controlling symptoms and improving QoL to interrupting disease progression, promoting mucosal healing, and maintaining long-term remission (clinical, endoscopic, and histological remission). Despite these advancements, the understanding of diseases among patients with CD is often underestimated in many healthcare systems. In addition, research on specific treatment targets crucial for Chinese patients with CD remains relatively limited. Self-assessment of clinical conditions and disease severity, along with the choice of various medications and surgical options, significantly influence patients' treatment decisions and information-seeking behaviors. Physicians often underestimate the impact of the disease on patients. However, the perspectives of patients and physicians on how these issues are handled in clinical practice have not yet been thoroughly evaluated. Understanding the views of these two groups is critical for identifying gaps, unmet needs, and differences in viewpoints. Identifying such disparities could help implement measures to improve two-way communication and foster a deeper mutual understanding.

In light of these considerations, we report the findings from a multicenter retrospective study in China, an international web-based survey encompassing physicians' and patients' perspectives on diagnosis and treatment of CD, the social burdens associated with the disease, and the dynamics of physician–patient relationships. Our objective was to identify patient preferences and expectations regarding treatment goals, rather than focusing solely on treatment, to promote more effective disease management approaches.

Crohn's disease is increasing in prevalence worldwide. It arises from a complex interplay between both genetic predisposition and environmental influence. A search of databases and clinical practice guidelines was performed to provide the most up-to-date evidence-based approach for diagnosing and managing patients with Crohn's disease. No single gold standard investigation exists. Whilst full ileocolonoscopy with biopsies remains the mainstay for diagnosis, other less invasive imaging modalities are being actively considered in the workup, as well as the use of serological markers. Management should incorporate dietary and lifestyle modifications where necessary, the use of medications in induction and remission of disease, and consideration of surgical intervention where medical therapy has failed.

The degree of symptoms is variable and may wax and wane throughout the disease course, and patients can require chronic immunosuppression and operations to treat the disease symptoms, but both are unable to cure the disease. Monoclonal antibodies have become the cornerstone of medical therapy for moderate-to-severe disease; however, their utility is limited by primary and secondary loss.

### ACR appropriateness criteria Crohn disease [^117KVkz9]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Crohn disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder involving the gastrointestinal tract, characterized by episodic flares and times of remission. Underlying structural damage occurs progressively, with recurrent bouts of inflammation. The diagnosis and management of this disease process is dependent on several clinical, laboratory, imaging, endoscopic, and histologic factors. In recent years, with the maturation of CT enterography, and MR enterography, imaging has played an increasingly important role in relation to Crohn Disease. In addition to these specialized examination modalities, ultrasound and routine CT have potential uses. Fluoroscopy, radiography, and nuclear medicine may be less beneficial depending on the clinical scenario. The imaging modality best suited to evaluating this disease may change, depending on the target population, severity of presentation, and specific clinical situation. This document presents seven clinical scenarios (variants) in both the adult and pediatric populations and rates the appropriateness of the available imaging options. They are summarized in a consolidated table, and the underlying rationale and supporting literature are presented in the accompanying narrative. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every three years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Tailoring the treatment to the individual in Crohn's disease [^115zd15Q]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease is a heterogeneous disease with approximately 30–40% of patients having a simple benign history and the rest having a chronic progressive disease leading to complications, surgeries and potentially socio-professional marginalisation. Recent studies have shown that an early treatment with immunosuppressive treatment and/or anti-tumour necrosis factor agents could change the natural history of the disease and avoid the development of such disabling disease. The therapy should thus be tailored according to the risk of developing such disabling disease. Recent cohort studies have shown that clinical factors such as age at diagnosis, disease extent, disease location and behaviour at diagnosis were predictive for the development of severe or disabling disease and could be used in helping the physician to tailor therapy.

### French national consensus clinical guidelines for the management of Crohn's disease [^112bQ91c]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic and disabling condition. There is no curative medical treatment but current treatments provide increasingly sustainable control of the disease and allow patients a better quality of life. There is limited evidence supporting CD management in specific clinical situations, thus precluding an evidence-based approach.

Aims

To help clinicians in making informed treatment decisions, a group of 59 French gastroenterologists with experience in the management of CD met to develop straightforward and practical algorithms based on the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) recommendations.

Methods

This experts' opinion was developed following a Nominal Group consensus methodology. Nine clinical situations were identified: mildly active CD; uncomplicated moderately active CD, with, and without poor prognostic factors; uncomplicated severely active CD; perianal CD with a single fistula; perianal CD with complex fistula with or without abscess; complicated CD with abscess; intestinal stricture; and post-operative CD. Two working groups were formed and proposed algorithms that were then approved by a two-thirds majority of the Nominal Group.

Results

These algorithms represent the pragmatic consensus of a group of experts in gastroenterology on the modalities of therapeutic care in different clinical situations in CD. They are available via a web application at: www.algorithmici.com.

### Crohn's disease [^112aFzMU]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that is characterized by chronic inflammation of any part of the gastrointestinal tract, has a progressive and destructive course and is increasing in incidence worldwide. Several factors have been implicated in the cause of Crohn's disease, including a dysregulated immune system, an altered microbiota, genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, but the cause of the disease remains unknown. The onset of the disease at a young age in most cases necessitates prompt but long-term treatment to prevent disease flares and disease progression with intestinal complications. Thus, earlier, more aggressive treatment with biologic therapies or novel small molecules could profoundly change the natural history of the disease and decrease complications and the need for hospitalization and surgery. Although less invasive biomarkers are in development, diagnosis still relies on endoscopy and histological assessment of biopsy specimens. Crohn's disease is a complex disease, and treatment should be personalized to address the underlying pathogenetic mechanism. In the future, disease management might rely on severity scores that incorporate prognostic factors, bowel damage assessment and non-invasive close monitoring of disease activity to reduce the severity of complications.

Crohn's disease (CD) — medical management includes that mucosal healing as determined by endoscopy is a goal of therapy, and scoring systems are available to measure the endoscopic disease activity and may be used to monitor response to therapy. No maintenance treatment is a treatment option for some patients with asymptomatic (silent), mild CD; however, routine monitoring is recommended to identify disease progression. Sulfasalazine should only be considered for patients with symptomatic mild colonic CD, and antibiotics are not an effective treatment for luminal inflammatory CD and should not be used as a primary therapy. For adult patients with mild CD and low risk of progression, diet-based strategies along with careful monitoring for inadequate symptom relief, worsening inflammation, or disease progression may be considered. Azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate may be used in treatment of active CD and as adjunctive therapy for reducing immunogenicity associated with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy.

ACG Crohn's disease — natural history and risk factors indicate progression risks and monitoring needs: Most patients initially present with nonpenetrating, nonstricturing behavior, but up to half develop an intestinal complication within 20 yr of diagnosis, particularly with ileal, ileocolonic, or proximal gastrointestinal involvement, extensive anatomic involvement, or deep ulcerations. High-risk features for progressive burden include young age at diagnosis, initial extensive bowel involvement, ileal/ileocolonic involvement, perianal/severe rectal disease, extraintestinal manifestations at diagnosis, and penetrating or stenosis phenotype. Over long observation, only 20%–30% have a nonprogressive or indolent course. Symptoms do not correlate well with active inflammation and therefore should not be the sole guide for therapy; objective evaluation by endoscopic or cross-sectional imaging should be used periodically. In the absence of immunomodulator or biologic treatment, corticosteroid dependency and/or resistance occurs in up to half of patients.

Crohn's disease — when to refer for surgery and common indications: Surgery may be considered for symptomatic CD localized to a short segment of bowel, and surgery is required to treat emergent complications. A resection of a segment of diseased intestine is the most common surgery for a patient with CD. Indications include intractable hemorrhage, perforation, persisting or recurrent obstruction, abscess, dysplasia or cancer, or medically refractory disease; the most common indication for intestinal resection is small bowel obstruction from a fibrostenotic stricture, with penetrating CD as the second most common. Although resection is the most definitive treatment for a stricture, strictureplasty is an option as a bowel‑preserving measure in patients at risk for short bowel syndrome; multidisciplinary management and early surgical consultation are appropriate.

### Is top-down therapy a more effective alternative to conventional step-up therapy for Crohn's disease? [^112teDx5]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease remains a challenge for practitioners to treat, and top-down therapy will be a continued area of research in the coming years. As advances are made in the field of monoclonal antibodies, the development of newer biologic immunosuppressing drugs will continue. However, given the costs and potential side-effects of the long-term use of immunosuppression, care should be taken in designing trials to ensure that well-designed treatment regimens with appropriate disease stratification and objective outcome measures can provide good evidence for future treatment.

In its current state, nevertheless, the mainstay of therapy continues to be based largely on imprecise treatment using either "step-up" or newly proposed "top-down" approaches. Research and evidence supporting top-down therapy remain limited. Combined therapy showed promising results over both early biologic and early immunomodulatory treatment and may be a recommended area for further study. Drug combinations, timing, and dosage are all areas that should be addressed. Considering this, we recommend that the most desirable treatment for a newly diagnosed Crohn's disease patient should be a personalized and tailored approach and that the disease should be stratified for each patient, taking into consideration the location, extent, previous disease course and severity of their Crohn's disease, as well as their comorbidities and the patient's personal preferences. Combined ("top-down") therapy should be considered for patients with complicated disease, with poor prognostic factors (e.g. diagnosis as pediatric patient, recurrent flare-up, steroid dependent, multiple failed steroid treatments), and extensive disease suggestive of an aggressive disease course (e.g. perianal disease, evidence of severe bowel damage and/or need for surgical intervention). Patients undergoing top-down therapy must be place under close monitoring to ensure their safety prior to their intensive treatment. Further research will need to focus on investigation into the genetics and pathophysiology of Crohn's disease. Only with proper understanding of the nature of Crohn's disease can one truly develop precision therapy that targets relevant pathologic pathways. If precise medications can be identified to achieve specific outcomes, a more personalized and targeted treatment may be possible.

Crohn's disease (CD) is an idiopathic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology with genetic, immunologic, and environmental influences. The incidence of CD has steadily increased over the past several decades. The diagnosis and treatment of patients with CD has evolved since the last practice guideline was published. These guidelines represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology and were developed under the auspices of the Practice Parameters Committee for the management of adult patients with CD. These guidelines are established for clinical practice with the intent of suggesting preferable approaches to medical problems as established by interpretation and collation of scientifically valid research, derived from extensive review of published literature. When exercising clinical judgment, health care providers should incorporate this guideline along with patient's needs, desires, and their values to care for patients fully and appropriately with CD. Shared decision-making with the patient is advocated. This guideline is intended to be flexible, not necessarily indicating the only acceptable approach, and should be distinguished from standards of care that are inflexible and rarely violated. To evaluate the level of evidence and strength of recommendations, we used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. The Committee reviews guidelines in depth, with participation from experienced clinicians and others in related fields. The final recommendations are based on the data available at the time of the production of the document and may be updated with pertinent scientific developments later.

### Crohn's disease management: translating STRIDE-II for UK clinical practice [^116JYjTi]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterised by gastrointestinal lesions, mucosal or endoscopic inflammation and progressive bowel damage. The annual incidence of CD is estimated to be approximately 11 individuals per 100,000 in the United Kingdom. Treatment strategies for CD in clinical practice have traditionally focused on symptom control, often via a stepwise pharmacologic therapeutic approach which may include surgical resection in refractory patients. – However, symptom resolution and CD activity are poorly correlated, suggesting that patients who achieve symptom resolution may remain at risk of inflammatory complications. By contrast, the widely adopted 'treat-to-target' (T2T) approach has the potential to improve endoscopic and clinical outcomes through individualised goal-directed treatment strategies. Understanding targets for individual treatment options is thus crucial for utilising T2T strategies in UK clinical practice.

In 2013, the Selecting Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (STRIDE) initiative was launched by the International Organization for the Study of IBD (IOIBD) to identify treatment targets and goals for IBD. The STRIDE-I (2015)and updated STRIDE-II (2021)guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for short- and long-term therapeutic targets, focusing on the T2T management of IBD in clinical practice. The key framework of the STRIDE-II guidelines facilitates target individualisation and adaptation to local resources to improve IBD-associated clinical outcomes. This article aims to summarise the STRIDE-II guidelines and provide guidance to healthcare professionals (HCPs) on how best to apply the principles of STRIDE-II to current clinical practice in the United Kingdom. Although STRIDE-II includes guidance for both adults and children with IBD (CD or ulcerative colitis (UC)), this article focuses exclusively on adults with CD.

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterised by endoscopic inflammation, progressive bowel damage and gastrointestinal lesions. Although treatment strategies for CD have traditionally focused on a stepwise pharmacological approach to achieve clinical remission or symptom resolution, these treatment goals correlate poorly with disease activity. Thus, achieving full clinical remission and full endoscopic healing alone may be insufficient, as patients may remain at risk of inflammatory complications. Individualised 'treat-to-target' (T2T) pharmacological and treatment approaches represent a promising strategy for improving endoscopic remission and symptom resolution among patients with CD. The Selecting Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (STRIDE) and STRIDE-II guidelines, launched in 2013 and later renewed, identified individualised targets for a T2T therapeutic approach for patients with IBD. These guidelines facilitate the individualisation of target treatment goals through evidence-based, long-term (health-related quality of life, absence of disability, endoscopic healing) and intermediate/short-term (abdominal pain, stool frequency, normalisation of biomarker levels) treatment targets, allowing patients and clinicians to consider the risk-to-benefit balance of goals and selected therapeutic strategies. This article aims to summarise the STRIDE-II guidelines and provide intellectual guidance for healthcare professionals to apply the STRIDE-II principles to current clinical practice in the United Kingdom (UK). Management recommendations for primary and secondary first-line non-responders are provided, along with suggestions for utilising the endoscopic outcomes scoring system in UK clinical practice.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® Crohn disease-child [^111zXN17]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Crohn disease is an inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract with episodes of exacerbation and remission occurring in children, adolescents, and adults. Crohn disease diagnosis and treatment depend upon a combination of clinical, laboratory, endoscopic, histological, and imaging findings. Appropriate use of imaging provides critical information in the settings of diagnosis, assessment of acute symptoms, disease surveillance, and therapy monitoring. Four variants are discussed. The first variant discusses the initial imaging for suspected Crohn disease before established diagnosis. The second variant pertains to appropriateness of imaging modalities during suspected acute exacerbation. The third variant is a substantial discussion of recommendations related to disease surveillance and monitoring of Crohn disease. Finally, panel recommendations and discussion of perianal fistulizing disease imaging completes the document. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Infliximab in Crohn's disease: early and long-term treatment [^113sMis1]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2008). Low credibility.

The natural history of Crohn's disease is characterized by a remitting and relapsing course that progresses to complications and surgery in the majority of patients. Current treatment guidelines advocate a stepwise approach according to disease location and severity at presentation, with goals mainly aimed at inducing and maintaining clinical remission. Major advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease offered significant opportunities for the development of new therapies over the past years. Infliximab and other biologic agents have shown impressive results in Crohn's disease patients refractory to standard therapy, suggesting a potential disease course-modifying action. These led to the proposal to reverse the traditional therapeutic algorithms using these agents early in the course of the disease. Preliminary data suggest that early intervention may be a more effective treatment strategy in some Crohn's disease patients. As yet, early and indiscriminate use of biologics remains to be supported by convincing evidence. Data on long-term treatment of Crohn's disease with infliximab or other biologics are even more scarce. Future studies aimed to identify predictors of complicated disease and long-term randomized studies aimed to compare "step-up" and "top-down" strategies in high-risk groups should help to answer if early introduction of biological therapy alters the natural history of Crohn's disease.

### World gastroenterology organization practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of IBD in 2010 [^1153k91A]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a group of idiopathic, chronic, inflammatory intestinal conditions. Its two main disease categories are: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), which feature both overlapping and distinct clinical and pathological features. While these diseases have, in the past, been most evident in the developed world, their prevalence in the developing world has been gradually increasing in recent decades. This poses unique issues in diagnosis and management which have been scarcely addressed in the literature or in extant guidelines. Depending on the nature of the complaints, investigations to diagnose either form of IBD or to assess disease activity will vary and will also be influenced by geographic variations in other conditions that might mimic IBD. Similarly, therapy varies depending on the phenotype of the disease being treated and available resources. The World Gastroenterology Organization has, accordingly, developed guidelines for diagnosing and treating IBD using a cascade approach to account for variability in resources in countries around the world.

MEDLINE was searched from 2000 to 2011. Additional citations were procured from references of select research and review articles. Evidence was graded using the American Heart Association level-of-evidence guidelines.

Results

Although mesalamines are still often used to treat Crohn disease, the evidence for their efficacy is lacking. Corticosteroids can be effectively used to induce remission in moderate to severe Crohn disease, but they do not maintain remission. The mainstays of treatment are immunomodulators and biologics, particularly anti-tumor necrosis factor.

Conclusion and Relevance

Immunomodulators and biologics are now the preferred treatment options for Crohn disease.

### Patients with stricturing or penetrating Crohn's disease phenotypes report high disease burden and treatment needs [^112927f7]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

What You Need to Know

Background: There are limited real-world data describing the characteristics, treatment needs, and disease burden of patients with complicated (stricturing and/or penetrating) Crohn's disease phenotypes.

Findings: Patients with complicated Crohn's disease phenotypes have a higher disease burden, despite greater use of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors and corticosteroids, than patients with inflammatory Crohn's disease.

Implications for patient care: Early recognition and optimized management of Crohn's disease are necessary to prevent progression to complicated phenotypes and, consequently, improve health outcomes in patients with Crohn's disease.

### Time to revisit disease classification in inflammatory bowel disease: is the current classification of inflammatory bowel disease good enough for optimal clinical management? [^117A5cKC]. Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), historically subdivided into Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a very heterogeneous condition. While the tendency in medicine is to try to reduce complexity, IBD is a disease that cannot justify a one-size-fits-all principle. Our current clinical classification tools are suboptimal and need further refinement to capture, at least in part, the variety of phenotypes encountered in daily clinical practice. Although these revised classification tools alone will not be sufficient and should be complemented by more detailed molecular subclassifications, optimized clinical phenotypes can contribute to improved trial designs, future translational research approaches, and better treatment outcomes. In the current review, we discuss key clinical features important in IBD disease heterogeneity, tackle limitations of the current classification systems, propose some potential improvements, and raise priorities for future research in this domain.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^113mmowo]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Structuring Crohn's disease — assessment and medical/endoscopic approaches are summarized with key concepts and supporting data. For patients with stricturing CD, symptom, radiologic, and endoscopic assessments are necessary to help guide treatment approach; patients with CD with symptomatic strictures and evidence of active inflammation may respond to advanced therapies; and patients with CD with symptomatic strictures plus endoscopic or radiologic features indicating more of a fibrostenotic-predominant picture may benefit from endoscopic dilation or surgery. In a single-center randomized trial, high‑dose adalimumab induction therapy (80 mg weekly x 4 then 40 mg every 2 weeks with opportunity for dose escalation based on disease activity) in combination with thiopurines versus standard‑dose adalimumab monotherapy led, at the end of 12 months, to more patients being symptom free (64% vs 36%), greater improvement in a 14‑day obstructive symptom score (79% vs 64%), and radiographic improvement in stricture score (46% vs 26%), with lower treatment failure (10% vs 28%), although surgery rates were not significantly different. In a multicenter prospective cohort of symptomatic strictures treated with adalimumab, 64% achieved treatment success by week 24 and, at time of last follow‑up (median, 3.8 years), 46% continued to do well with no bowel resection; across 3 Crohn's disease trials, 62.5% of patients with nonpassable strictures achieved endoscopic improvement at 1 year, with over 50% achieving clinical remission and 38% endoscopic remission.

Crohn's disease (CD) — strictures and postoperative management specify that for patients with stricturing CD, symptom, radiologic and endoscopic assessments are necessary to help guide treatment approach. Patients with CD with symptomatic strictures and evidence of active inflammation may respond to advanced therapies, whereas patients with CD with symptomatic strictures plus endoscopic or radiologic features indicating more of a fibrostenotic-predominant picture may benefit from endoscopic dilation or surgery. Prophylactic treatment is recommended after small intestinal resection in patients with risk factors for recurrence, and risk factors for postoperative CD recurrence should be considered when deciding on treatment.

### Azathioprine or ileocolic resection for steroid-dependent terminal ileal Crohn's disease? A Markov analysis [^114ZzGmK]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2004). Low credibility.

Introduction

The objective of this study was to determine whether initial azathioprine therapy, followed by ileocolic resection if azathioprine fails, or initial ileocolic resection without a trial of azathioprine is the preferred treatment strategy in steroid-dependent, terminal ileal Crohn's disease.

Methods

A Markov, decision analytic model was developed to simulate a 36-month course for a patient with steroid-dependent, terminal ileal Crohn's disease who would initially take azathioprine or have ileocolic resection. Clinically important outcomes in the model included side effects and effectiveness of azathioprine and postoperative complications, mortality, and recurrence following ileocolic resection. The probabilities and utilities for these variables were derived from previously published studies.

Results

Initial azathioprine therapy offered a relatively small benefit of 0.45 quality-adjusted life-months over initial ileocolic resection. The model was sensitive to utility for being symptom-free on azathioprine and utility for being symptom-free postoperatively.

Conclusions

Initial azathioprine therapy and initial ileocolic resection are both reasonable treatment strategies in this setting. The preferred treatment strategy is highly dependent on the quality of life that can be achieved with each treatment option. Therefore, individual response and symptom control with each treatment must be strongly considered in this treatment decision.

### Identification of spontaneous patient-reported complaints related to perianal fistula in patients with Crohn's disease [^111TCqqj]. Colorectal Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Crohn's disease is worldwide an increasingly frequent diagnosed, chronic inflammatory, relapsing condition, primarily affecting the digestive tract, including the perianal region. It may have a profound impact on patient's quality of life, particularly if perianal symptoms are present, and associated overall health costs are considerable and increasing. It is critical to identify the most bothersome symptoms and treat them accordingly, in order to improve quality of life in these patients. Nevertheless, it is widely acknowledged that many patients are not able to discuss their most distressing symptoms with their physician, and that physicians do not discuss the impact on quality of life of these symptoms in nearly half of patients.

Perianal disease comprises fissures, fistulas, abscesses, and stenosis. It occurs in a meaning proportion of patients with Crohn's disease, with a reported prevalence of active perianal disease in the community‐based population as high as 39%. The negative impact on quality of life may be profound. Despite a number of treatment options being available, therapeutic outcome in perianal disease remains poor in a substantial group of patients.

There is a paucity of studies on patient reported symptoms associated with perianal disease. Consequently, in most studies on the effect of therapy for perianal disease (e.g. perianal fistula), patient reported outcomes have been evaluated using insufficiently validated questionnaires, such as the perianal disease activity index, which have been validated against physician and patient global assessments. This has also been shown in a recent systematic review. This raises the question whether the effect of therapy on symptom improvement of perianal disease is assessed from a patient's perspective, similarly as so‐called patient reported outcome measures evaluating therapeutic options in luminal Crohn's disease.

True, reproducible, and subjective, patient‐reported outcomes seem indispensable for development and evaluation of clinically relevant therapies, particularly regarding the patients' (subjective) perspective. With the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) mandate to move from clinical disease activity indices to coprimary end points of patient‐reported outcomes and objective measures of disease for regulatory approval of inflammatory bowel disease pharmacotherapy, the need to identify which factors in patients with perianal disease contribute to a diminished quality of life is clearly highlighted.

### Clinical insights into IL-23 inhibition: risankizumab for Crohn's disease through a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115ExKkw]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract with rising global prevalence, affecting approximately 1 million individuals in the United States alone. Common symptoms include abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and fatigue. Diagnosis is typically established through clinical evaluation, imaging studies, endoscopic procedures, and histological analysis. Patients with Crohn's disease often experience significantly lower health-related quality of life compared to healthy individuals, driven by factors such as disease activity, work disability, and frequent hospitalizations. Despite advances in treatment, many patients experience inadequate responses or intolerance to current therapies, highlighting the need for more effective and targeted treatment options.

Current treatment options for Crohn's disease include advanced biological therapies. Anti-TNF agents (e.g. infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab) are widely used for moderate-to-severe cases. Anti-integrin therapies — such as vedolizumab — block the migration of inflammatory cells and are associated with favorable safety profiles. Recently, interleukin (IL)-23 inhibitors have emerged as promising alternatives. IL-23, part of the IL-12 cytokine family, plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease by promoting T helper 17 cell differentiation and survival. These cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-17A and IL-22, which drive intestinal inflammation. Structurally, IL-23 comprises a unique p19 subunit and a shared p40 subunit (with IL-12).

### ACR appropriateness criteria® Crohn disease [^116gYeez]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Three common clinical scenarios involving use of imaging in Crohn disease are covered. These include the initial evaluation of Crohn disease when the diagnosis has not been previously established, the evaluation for anticipated exacerbation of known disease, and the evaluation of disease activity during therapy monitoring. The appropriateness of a given imaging modality for each scenario is rated as one of three categories (usually appropriate, may be appropriate, usually not appropriate) to help guide evaluation. Pediatric presentation of Crohn disease and the appropriateness of imaging are not covered in this document. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Endpoints for clinical trials evaluating disease modification and structural damage in adults with Crohn's disease [^114a7UYv]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

The management of Crohn's disease is rapidly changing. The advent of potent immunomodulatory and biologic therapies has led to more demanding endpoints for clinical trials than only clinical response and remission. Complete withdrawal of corticosteroids, healing of endoscopically visible lesions, and prevention of structural damage are only a few new endpoints that are finding their way into the clinical trials of today and those that are being developed for the future. Given the importance of selecting the most appropriate and relevant endpoints, the International Organization for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IOIBD) decided to develop guidelines that could be used by individual researchers, the pharmaceutical industry, and the regulatory bodies. The current document is to be read as a "position paper", which is the result of several years of discussion and consensus finding that was finally approved by the entire membership of the group. The proposed instruments will need further validation and standardization to demonstrate that they are reliable in stable disease and responsive to change, and to determine the cutoff points for response and remission.

### American Gastroenterological Association institute guideline on the use of thiopurines, methotrexate, and anti-TNF-α biologic drugs for the induction and maintenance of remission in inflammatory Crohn's disease [^114nUUwj]. Gastroenterology (2013). Medium credibility.

American Gastroenterological Association Institute guideline — discussion and scope — states that data on the safety of long-term combination therapy versus anti–TNF-α drug alone are of very low quality and do not suggest increased serious infection risk, but combination therapy is associated with increased lymphoma; the guideline used the GRADE methodology to create recommendations on immunomodulators and anti–TNF-α drugs for induction and maintenance of remission in moderately severe Crohn's disease, aiming to inform clinical decision making and establish quality indicators with transparent and actionable recommendations. It notes that strong recommendations were limited by poor-quality data on serious adverse events and that insufficient high-quality data precluded recommendations on precise questions (timing of therapy initiation, symptom versus endoscopic targets, and responses to early or late treatment failures). The guideline was designed not to address certain treatment strategies (corticosteroid induction with thiopurine maintenance versus anti–TNF-α induction/maintenance without corticosteroids) and does not address special populations (fistulizing Crohn's disease, surgically induced remission, or children), while being the first to address medical therapy in Crohn's disease using a methodology that explicitly assesses the balance of benefits and risks together with patient values and preferences based on systematic review.

### A global consensus on the definitions, diagnosis and management of fibrostenosing small bowel Crohn's disease in clinical practice [^111oGUto]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Fibrostenosis of the small bowel is common in patients with Crohn's disease. No consensus recommendations on definition, diagnosis and management in clinical practice are currently available. In this Consensus Statement, we present a clinical practice RAND/UCLA appropriateness study on the definition, diagnosis and clinical management of fibrostenosing Crohn's disease. It was conducted by a panel of 28 global experts and one patient representative. Following a systematic literature review, 526 candidate items grouped into 136 questions were generated and subsequently evaluated for appropriateness. Strictures are best defined as wall thickening, luminal narrowing and prestenotic dilation. Cross-sectional imaging is required for accurate diagnosis of fibrostenosing Crohn's disease, and it is recommended before making treatment decisions. It should also assess the degree of inflammation in the bowel wall. Multiple options for medical anti-inflammatory, endoscopic and surgical therapies were suggested, including follow-up strategies following therapy. This Consensus Statement supports clinical practice through providing guidance on definitions, diagnosis and therapeutic management of patients with fibrostenosing small bowel Crohn's disease.

### Medical and surgical management of perianal Crohn's disease [^111zY4p7]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease is increasingly thought to encompass multiple possible phenotypes. Perianal manifestations account for one such phenotype and represent an independent disease modifier. In its more severe form, perianal Crohn's disease confers a higher risk of a severe and disabling disease course, relapses, hospital admissions and operations. This, in turn, imposes a considerable burden and disability on patients. Identification of the precise manifestation is important, as management is nuanced, with both medical and surgical components, and is best undertaken in a multidisciplinary setting for both diagnosis and ongoing treatment. The introduction of biologic medication has heralded a significant addition to the management of fistulizing perianal Crohn's disease in particular, albeit with modest results. It remains a very challenging condition to treat and further work is required to optimize management in this group of patients.

Conclusion

The management of paediatric CD has evolved significantly over recent years with evidence-based guidelines now in place to assist day-to-day practice. Novel tools for personalised IBD management (drug metabolites, anti-TNF antibodies, stool inflammatory markers) provide a better understanding of the patients' disease status. The pathophysiology of CD remains relatively poorly understood, but advances in molecular technologies are likely to facilitate a deeper understanding of pathways involved in IBD pathogenesis, and will hopefully reveal novel disease biomarkers and treatment strategies.

Although standard medical therapy in Crohn's disease is efficient in most patients, a substantial proportion of patients suffering from chronic active disease do not adequately respond to standard therapy. In these patients, alternative regimens have to be considered. Due to the major advances in understanding the pathogenesis of this complex disease involving genetic, environmental, microbial and immunological factors, various new biological therapies targeting key mechanisms have emerged. In this review, a critical appraisal of modern therapeutical concepts will be presented, focusing on antibody and small inhibitory molecule therapies, including inhibition of TNF-alpha and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules and T cell activation, as well as hormonal therapies.

Clinical trials and decision-making — because the Crohn's Disease Activity Index may be as high in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) as in IBD and the SONIC trial showed no difference between treatment arms when inclusion was based on Crohn's Disease Activity Index alone without objective inflammation, objective activity assessment is required for trials and therapeutic choices should not rely solely on symptoms: measurement of increased clinical and objective activity "is a prerequisite for inclusion in clinical trials", and "no therapeutic decision should be taken based on clinical consideration alone".

### Crohn's disease basics | IBD… [^115pRYVm]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the digestive tract, from the mouth to the anus.
- It inflames areas of the intestine walls, causing patches of damage that can reach the outer lining.
- People with this disease may experience diarrhea, mouth sores, or malnutrition.
- Complications can be serious, but most people with Crohn's disease can control their symptoms and lead active lives. Overview Inflammatory bowel disease refers to a group of lifelong diseases that cause inflammation of the intestine. Crohn's disease is one of the main types of IBD. Crohn's disease can impact a person's quality of life. But most people who have it can still lead active lives with long periods of remission. How Crohn's disease impacts the digestive tract Inflammation from Crohn's disease causes the walls of the intestines to thicken.

This makes affected areas crack, forming tunnels or passageways in the intestine walls. Crohn's disease can:

- Affect any part of the digestive tract, from the mouth to the anus, most commonly on parts of the small or large intestines.
- Affect all layers of the intestine walls, moving outward.
- Cause swelling in patches, leaving areas of healthy tissue. Possible complications Crohn's disease can put people at increased risk of developing other health conditions. Most complications also occur in other types of IBD. These require extra monitoring. The treatment for Crohn's disease usually controls some of the most common complications, such as: Ulcers. These are open sores that result from inflammation. Crohn's disease ulcers are deep lines that grow outward through the intestine wall. Anal fissures. This happens when inflammation creates small tears in the tissue lining the anus. This causes painful bowel movements and discomfort.

If a complication becomes extremely severe or is left untreated, it may become life-threatening. Fistulas that develop in the stomach may become infected and form an abscess. This can cause digested food, fluids, or puss to leak inside the body. Complete intestinal obstructions occur when strictures narrow so much that the intestines actually become blocked. This prevents the movement of food and stool entirely.

### Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) basics… [^112rRA3C]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Inflammatory bowel disease refers to a group of lifelong diseases affecting the intestines.
- The main types of IBD are ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.
- IBD symptoms come and go. They can range from mild to severe.
- Most people with IBD can control their symptoms and lead active lives. Overview IBD is a group of several diseases Inflammatory bowel disease refers to a group of lifelong diseases affecting the intestines. IBD occurs when the body's natural defense system mistakenly attacks healthy bowel cells. This causes inflammation and other damage that does not go away on its own. Types The main types of IBD are ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Despite some similarities, each impacts different parts of the digestive tract in different ways. Click below to read more about each type. Symptoms IBD symptoms can range from mild to severe. Common symptoms include:

- Diarrhea or changes in bowel movements.
- Stomach pain.
- Fatigue.
- Nausea.
- Weight loss. Symptoms come and go in waves.
- "Remission" refers to periods when symptoms temporarily go away.
- "Flare-ups" refer to periods of increased symptoms. Complications IBD can lead to health complications both inside the gastrointestinal tract and outside the GI tract. Complications inside the GI tract include:

- Dehydration.
- Not absorbing enough essential nutrients.
- Increased risk of colon and rectal cancers. Complications outside the GI tract include:

- Low red blood cell count.
- Reduced bone density.
- Joint pain.
- Skin changes.
- Eye irritation.
- Delayed or impaired growth in some children. Quality of life Living a quality life The effects of IBD may seem intimidating, but the right treatment can control symptoms and allow people to get back to doing the things they love. Click the link below to read more.
