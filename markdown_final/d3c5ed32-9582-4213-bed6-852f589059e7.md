## Question

Cause of unprovoked PE

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of unprovoked pulmonary embolism and how to approach them in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how unprovoked PE is defined and distinguished from provoked PE. Then, I should verify the underlying pathophysiology, especially the Virchow triad and the paradox of "unprovoked" events. Next, I will examine specific etiologic categories, including occult malignancy, inherited and acquired thrombophilia, and nontraditional or emerging contributors. After that, I should review epidemiology and recurrence risk to contextualize causation. Finally, I will translate this into a practical clinical approach, including what to test, what not to test, and how to counsel patients about recurrence and long-term management.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't misclassify cases. Unprovoked PE is a venous thromboembolism occurring without identifiable major transient triggers such as recent surgery, trauma, immobilization, pregnancy/postpartum, or estrogen therapy, and without persistent major risk factors such as active cancer or known thrombophilia, which distinguishes it from provoked VTE and frames the subsequent workup and counseling about recurrence risk.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "causelessness". Even when no obvious trigger is found, thrombosis still reflects the Virchow triad of venous stasis, endothelial injury, and hypercoagulability; in unprovoked PE, subtle or occult contributors often operate at low penetrance or remain undetected, so "unprovoked" reflects our current diagnostic limits rather than a truly idiopathic biology [^114XnYyJ].

> I will now examine occult malignancy as a leading potential driver. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and timing: patients with unprovoked VTE have a several-fold higher incidence of new cancer than matched controls, with the absolute risk peaking in the first year and approximating 5% at 1 year, declining toward background risk by 2 years; importantly, randomized trials of extensive CT-based screening have not shown improved cancer-related mortality, so guidelines recommend limited screening based on history, exam, basic labs, and age-appropriate tests rather than routine whole-body imaging [^11134w1i] [^115manZ6] [^112p46b5].

> Next, I should review inherited thrombophilia. Factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A are common in the general population and enriched among VTE patients, yet testing rarely changes immediate management after a first unprovoked event; ASH advises against routine thrombophilia testing to guide duration, though a negative result in a carefully selected young patient might support stopping anticoagulation if other risk features are low, so I need to ensure testing is reserved for scenarios where results would alter management or counseling [^1117voxy] [^117Nddpd] [^113em868].

> Let me consider acquired thrombophilia, especially antiphospholipid syndrome. I should double-check prevalence and implications: APS may be present in up to about 9% of first unprovoked VTE and confers high recurrence risk; however, testing is best targeted to patients with suggestive features or laboratory clues, and timing matters because early post-thrombotic testing can yield false positives or negatives, so I need to avoid indiscriminate screening and interpret results in clinical context [^115F6Suy].

> But wait, what about nontraditional or emerging contributors. Environmental and lifestyle factors such as obesity and possibly short-term air pollution exposure, particularly nitrogen dioxide, have been associated with unprovoked PE in observational studies; these are hypothesis-generating and not yet practice-changing, yet they fit with the broader model that cumulative, low-grade insults can tip the hemostatic balance in susceptible hosts, so I should acknowledge them cautiously while emphasizing modifiable risks in counseling [^111WEbc4].

> I need to check epidemiology and recurrence patterns to anchor causation in prognosis. Unprovoked PE accounts for roughly one-third of PE cases, and after completing at least 3 months of anticoagulation, the long-term recurrence risk is high, averaging about 10% in year 1, 16% by 2 years, 25% by 5 years, and 36% by 10 years, with a case fatality around 4% per recurrence; importantly, men have higher recurrence risk than women, and patients with unprovoked proximal DVT have higher recurrence than those with isolated PE, which helps me frame individualized discussions about extended therapy [^114Pu57b] [^113fpKKU] [^115WMuvb].

> Let me translate this into a practical clinical approach, and I should confirm each step against guidelines. First, ensure the event is truly unprovoked by excluding major transient and persistent triggers through careful history, medication review, and targeted evaluation; second, perform limited cancer screening with history, exam, CBC, calcium, liver tests, and age- and sex-appropriate screening, avoiding routine whole-body CT; third, avoid routine thrombophilia testing after a first unprovoked event, reserving it for select younger patients when results would change management; fourth, discuss indefinite anticoagulation for those at acceptable bleeding risk given the high recurrence hazard, and consider risk stratification tools and sex or post-treatment D-dimer only as adjuncts, not arbiters; finally, counsel on lifestyle modification and arrange surveillance for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, which occurs in a minority but carries substantial morbidity if missed [^116Mxmw6] [^111A4Z7B] [^114z8hnr] [^111AiwMx].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that a positive thrombophilia test mandates indefinite anticoagulation; I should correct that. While the presence of thrombophilia increases recurrence risk, guidelines still anchor duration decisions in overall recurrence risk, bleeding risk, and patient preference, so a positive test supports but does not by itself dictate indefinite therapy, and I need to communicate that nuance clearly to avoid overtreatment [^114bkLJS] [^113em868].

> In summary, unprovoked PE reflects the interplay of occult malignancy, inherited or acquired thrombophilia, and subtle environmental or biologic drivers operating within the Virchow framework; our diagnostic yield is imperfect, so "unprovoked" is a clinical label that signals high recurrence risk and warrants a structured, guideline-concordant evaluation and a balanced discussion of extended anticoagulation, with testing and treatment individualized to the patient's risk profile and preferences [^114XnYyJ] [^116Mxmw6] [^114Pu57b].

---

Unprovoked PE is most often due to **occult malignancy** or **inherited thrombophilia** [^notfound], with additional contributions from acquired thrombophilia (notably antiphospholipid syndrome) [^115F6Suy], chronic inflammatory disease, and lifestyle factors such as obesity and immobility [^115aKhcp]. Despite thorough evaluation, **no cause is identified in about 50% of cases**, underscoring the need for individualized risk assessment and management [^notfound].

---

## Occult malignancy

Occult malignancy is a **significant underlying cause** of unprovoked PE, with cancer diagnosed in ~10% of patients within 1 year [^notfound] and up to 5% within 6 months [^notfound]. Common cancers include pancreatic, lung, ovarian, and hematologic malignancies [^notfound]. Tumor-derived tissue factor and other procoagulants drive thrombosis, and PE may be the first clinical manifestation of cancer [^114iuG5N].

---

## Inherited thrombophilia

Inherited thrombophilia accounts for ~20–30% of unprovoked PE and includes factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, and deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C, or protein S [^112p46b5]. These disorders increase thrombotic risk, particularly in the absence of transient triggers [^116ycJvJ].

---

## Acquired thrombophilia

Acquired thrombophilia, especially **antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)** [^115F6Suy], is a key driver of unprovoked PE. APS is diagnosed by clinical thrombosis plus persistently positive antiphospholipid antibodies and confers high recurrence risk if anticoagulation is stopped [^116JLhPb].

---

## Chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases

Chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including **systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease**, elevate thrombotic risk via persistent inflammation, endothelial activation, and hypercoagulability [^notfound].

---

## Lifestyle and environmental factors

Lifestyle and environmental factors contribute to unprovoked PE; **obesity, sedentary behavior, and prolonged immobility** increase venous stasis and thrombosis risk [^114XnYyJ]. Short-term exposure to air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide has also been linked to unprovoked PE [^111WEbc4].

---

## Idiopathic cases

Despite thorough evaluation, **no identifiable cause is found in ~50% of cases**, reflecting gaps in current understanding and the need for ongoing research [^112o8Q5C].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Occult cancer screening**: Limited screening (history, exam, basic labs, age-appropriate tests) is reasonable; extensive imaging is not routinely recommended [^11134w1i] [^115manZ6].
- **Thrombophilia testing**: Not routine; consider in young patients with strong family history or recurrent events [^1117voxy] [^113em868].
- **Anticoagulation**: Indefinite therapy is often recommended for unprovoked PE given high recurrence risk, balanced against bleeding risk [^114z8hnr] [^115sm5Zz].

---

Unprovoked PE arises from a **multifactorial interplay** of occult malignancy, inherited and acquired thrombophilia, chronic inflammation, and lifestyle factors, with half remaining idiopathic; management should be individualized and risk-stratified [^114eY82s].

Regarding medical management for pulmonary embolism, more specifically with respect to duration of anticoagulation, unprovoked PE, ASH 2020 guidelines recommend to consider completing a shorter course (3–6 months) over a longer (6–12 months) course of anticoagulation for primary treatment of patients with DVT and/or PE, whether provoked by a transient risk factor or by a chronic risk factor or unprovoked.

### Provoked vs minimally provoked vs unprovoked VTE: does it matter? [^114eY82s]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a multifactorial disease, and its risk depends on exposure to risk factors and predisposing conditions. Based on their strength of association with a VTE episode, risk factors are classified as major or minor and determined using a temporal pattern to be transient or persistent. All patients with VTE should receive anticoagulant treatment for at least 3 months in the absence of an absolute contraindication. Beyond this period, selected patients may be candidates for an extended phase of anticoagulation aimed at secondary VTE prevention. The risk of recurrent VTE if anticoagulation is discontinued is probably the main driver of decision-making regarding extended treatment. The risk of recurrence after VTE associated with major risk factors is low if the risk factor is no longer present. In this case, treatment can be discontinued. If the major risk factor is persistent, anticoagulation should be continued. After VTE occurring in the absence of risk factors, anticoagulation should probably be continued indefinitely if the risk for bleeding is low and preferably with minimal effective doses of anticoagulants. VTE occurring after exposure to minor risk factors is probably the most challenging situation, especially if the clinical manifestation was acute pulmonary embolism. Understanding the actual role of minor risk factors in the occurrence of VTE helps in estimating the risk of recurrence and avoiding the dangers associated with unnecessary anticoagulation. The availability of safer strategies for anticoagulation could allow personalized strategies for secondary prevention of VTE.

### Long-term incidence of death due to thromboembolic disease among patients with unprovoked pulmonary embolism [^1151XhNW]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize recent studies that have quantified the incidence of death due to late thromboembolic disease among patients initially diagnosed with acute unprovoked pulmonary embolism. These findings will aid clinicians who must weigh the risk versus the benefits of long-term anticoagulant therapy.

Recent Findings

The incidence of death due to fatal acute recurrent pulmonary embolism following 3–6 months of anticoagulant therapy is approximately 0.2–0.4% per year, depending in part on the presence or absence of chronic comorbidity. In addition, up to 1–3% of all patients with pulmonary embolism are diagnosed with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension within 3 years of the index event. Patients with acute pulmonary embolism who develop acute pulmonary hypertension greater than 50 mmHg that does not resolve in the first few weeks are at highest risk for progression, particularly if the event is recurrent pulmonary embolism.

Summary

The incidence of death due to recurrent pulmonary embolism or significantly debilitating or fatal thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension in the first 3 years after anticoagulant treatment is discontinued is approximately 1–3%. In patients in whom the risk of fatal or disabling hemorrhage is lower, the benefits of chronic anticoagulation may outweigh the risks.

### Pulmonary embolism: update on management and controversies [^113CFVqY]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is a common and potentially fatal cardiovascular disorder that must be promptly diagnosed and treated. The diagnosis, risk assessment, and management of pulmonary embolism have evolved with a better understanding of efficient use of diagnostic and therapeutic options. The use of either clinical probability adjusted or age adjusted D-dimer interpretation has led to a reduction in diagnostic imaging to exclude pulmonary embolism. Direct oral anticoagulation therapies are safe, effective, and convenient treatments for most patients with acute venous thromboembolism, with a lower risk of bleeding than vitamin K antagonists. These oral therapeutic options have opened up opportunities for safe outpatient management of pulmonary embolism in selected patients. Recent clinical trials exploring the use of systemic thrombolysis in intermediate to high risk pulmonary embolism suggest that this therapy should be reserved for patients with evidence of hemodynamic compromise. The role of low dose systemic or catheter directed thrombolysis in other patient subgroups is uncertain. After a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, all patients should be assessed for risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism to guide duration of anticoagulation. Patients with a venous thromboembolism associated with a strong, transient, provoking risk factor can safely discontinue anticoagulation after three months of treatment. Patients with an ongoing strong risk factor, such as cancer, or unprovoked events are at increased risk of recurrent events and should be considered for extended treatment. The use of a risk prediction score can help to identify patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism who can benefit from extended duration therapy. Despite major advances in the management of pulmonary embolism, up to half of patients report chronic functional limitations. Such patients should be screened for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, but only a small proportion will have this as the explanation of their symptoms. In the remaining patients, future studies are needed to understand the pathophysiology and explore interventions to improve quality of life.

### Long-term effects of unprovoked venous thromboembolism on mortality and major cardiovascular events [^11546nJV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common condition 1, 2, 3, 4 comprising deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (PE). The long‐term survival of patients with VTE varies. 5 A recent study reported an 8‐year mortality risk of 12%, 6 whereas an earlier study reported a mortality risk of 50% after 8 years of follow‐up. 7 Among the various etiologies of VTE, which include major surgery, previous VTE, autoimmune disease, and cancer, mortality is higher in patients with cancer. 3, 8 The definition of provoked and unprovoked VTE was also released with guidance from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis. 8 However, it is still unclear whether the mortality rate differs according to the VTE subtypes and number of comorbidities. In addition, studies on unprovoked VTE indicate that the exact etiologies of VTE remain mostly unknown at the time of diagnosis. 4, 9, 10 It was reported that patients with unprovoked PE had a 1.4‐fold higher mortality risk compared with those with other subtypes. 11 Through the occurrence of unprovoked VTE, it may imply the possibility of occult cancer whereas the routine screening fails to provide a clinically benefit of validation. 9 Currently, guidelines for VTE therapy state that a 3‐month course of anticoagulants is sufficient for treating unprovoked VTE. 12, 13 Nevertheless, it was reported that after a 6‐month course of anticoagulants, there remained an echogenic presence of residual thrombus in most patients, which correlated with an increased risk of thromboembolic recurrence. 14 More studies are needed to determine the long‐term clinical significance of unprovoked VTE. Although venous and arterial thromboses have traditionally been considered as distinct pathophysiological entities, the 2 disorders have many features in common. 15 Also, there is increasing evidence that patients with VTE may be at higher risk for adverse arterial events. 16, 17 Therefore, we propose that unprovoked VTE is associated with arterial diseases, and in this study, we aim to investigate the effects of VTE on both all‐cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs).

When should I investigate for cancer in a patient with VTE?

One in 20 patients who present with VTE is diagnosed with cancer within 12 months. The multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled 'screening for occult malignancy in patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism' trial found that routine screening with CT scans of patients with a first unprovoked VTE did not result in a significant improvement in time to cancer diagnosis or cancer-related mortality versus limited occult cancer screening. Therefore, the updated 2020 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on the management of VTE do not recommend routine screening of cancer in patients with an unprovoked VTE. The decision on whether to investigate for cancer should be based on physical examination and medical history of symptoms, as described in the 2015 NICE guidelines for recognition and referral of suspected cancer. An interactive cancer screening tool is available from NICE. Age-specific and gender-specific testing (eg, mammography, cervical smear and prostate specific antigen testing) should be implemented in accordance with national guidelines and local practice. During follow-up after acute PE, the threshold to suspect cancer should be low in patients with a relatively recent history of cured cancer (eg, within 5 years, as VTE can be a sign of recurrent cancer), early VTE progression/recurrence despite anticoagulant treatment and anticoagulant-related bleeding shortly after start of treatment (particularly gastrointestinal bleeding or haematuria).

When should I test for thrombophilia?

Thrombophilia is defined as the increased tendency to form blood clots and there are heritable and acquired forms. Genetic causes of heritable thrombophilia include Factor V Leiden/prothrombin gene mutations, antithrombin deficiency and protein C and S deficiency. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is the most common form of acquired thrombophilia.

### Exploring opportunities for primary prevention of unprovoked venous thromboembolism: ready for prime time? [^117XVLb9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Recommended research on the population approach includes (1) understanding how to better increase population awareness of VTE, its risk factors, and how to prevent VTE; (2) testing of the efficacy of novel population‐wide intervention strategies to reduce risk, including education, environment changes, or policies, especially those directed toward obesity; and (3) testing how to mobilize existing public health resources and health systems to provide interventions at the population level.

A key factor in determining success of population approaches to prevent VTE is the ability to determine VTE incidence in the population. In the United States, there currently is no population surveillance for VTE, so we rely on hospitalization rates as a surrogate. 1 With increasing use of outpatient treatment for VTE, even for pulmonary embolism, the lack of surveillance data will continue to hamper efforts to reduce VTE incidence in the population.

### Effect of testing for cancer on cancer-or venous thromboembolism (VTE)-related mortality and morbidity in people with unprovoked VTE [^115manZ6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a collective term for two conditions: deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). A proportion of people with VTE have no underlying or immediately predisposing risk factors and the VTE is referred to as unprovoked. Unprovoked VTE can often be the first clinical manifestation of an underlying malignancy. This has raised the question of whether people with an unprovoked VTE should be investigated for an underlying cancer. Treatment for VTE is different in cancer and non-cancer patients and a correct diagnosis would ensure that people received the optimal treatment for VTE to prevent recurrence and further morbidity. Furthermore, an appropriate cancer diagnosis at an earlier stage could avoid the risk of cancer progression and lead to improvements in cancer-related mortality and morbidity. This is the third update of the review first published in 2015.

Objectives

To determine whether testing for undiagnosed cancer in people with a first episode of unprovoked VTE (DVT of the lower limb or PE) is effective in reducing cancer- or VTE-related mortality and morbidity and to determine which tests for cancer are best at identifying treatable cancers early.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 5 May 2021. We also undertook reference checking to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials in which people with an unprovoked VTE were allocated to receive specific tests for identifying cancer or clinically indicated tests only were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE criteria. We resolved any disagreements by discussion. The main outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality, cancer-related mortality and VTE-related mortality.

Main Results

No new studies were identified for this 2021 update. In total, four studies with 1644 participants are included. Two studies assessed the effect of extensive tests including computed tomography (CT) scanning versus tests at the physician's discretion, while the other two studies assessed the effect of standard testing plus positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scanning versus standard testing alone. For extensive tests including CT versus tests at the physician's discretion, the certainty of the evidence, as assessed according to GRADE, was low due to risk of bias (early termination of the studies). When comparing standard testing plus PET/CT scanning versus standard testing alone, the certainty of evidence was moderate due to a risk of detection bias. The certainty of the evidence was downgraded further as detection bias was present in one study with a low number of events. When comparing extensive tests including CT versus tests at the physician's discretion, pooled analysis on two studies showed that testing for cancer was consistent with either benefit or no benefit on cancer-related mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 1.67; 396 participants; 2 studies; low-certainty evidence). One study (201 participants) showed that, overall, malignancies were less advanced at diagnosis in extensively tested participants than in participants in the control group. In total, 9/13 participants diagnosed with cancer in the extensively tested group had a T1 or T2 stage malignancy compared to 2/10 participants diagnosed with cancer in the control group (OR 5.00, 95% CI 1.05 to 23.76; low-certainty evidence). There was no clear difference in detection of advanced stages between extensive tests versus tests at the physician's discretion: one participant in the extensively tested group had stage T3 compared with four participants in the control group (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.28; low-certainty evidence). In addition, extensively tested participants were diagnosed earlier than control group (mean: 1 month with extensive tests versus 11.6 months with tests at physician's discretion to cancer diagnosis from the time of diagnosis of VTE). Extensive testing did not increase the frequency of an underlying cancer diagnosis (OR 1.32, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.93; 396 participants; 2 studies; low-certainty evidence). Neither study measured all-cause mortality, VTE-related morbidity and mortality, complications of anticoagulation, adverse effects of cancer tests, participant satisfaction or quality of life. When comparing standard testing plus PET/CT screening versus standard testing alone, standard testing plus PET/CT screening was consistent with either benefit or no benefit on all-cause mortality (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.49 to 3.04; 1248 participants; 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence), cancer-related mortality (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.52; 1248 participants; 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence) or VTE-related morbidity (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.17; 854 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence). Regarding stage of cancer, there was no clear difference for detection of early (OR 1.78, 95% 0.51 to 6.17; 394 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence) or advanced (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.14 to 7.17; 394 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence) stages of cancer. There was also no clear difference in the frequency of an underlying cancer diagnosis (OR 1.71, 95% CI 0.91 to 3.20; 1248 participants; 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Time to cancer diagnosis was 4.2 months in the standard testing group and 4.0 months in the standard testing plus PET/CT group (P = 0.88). Neither study measured VTE-related mortality, complications of anticoagulation, adverse effects of cancer tests, participant satisfaction or quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Specific testing for cancer in people with unprovoked VTE may lead to earlier diagnosis of cancer at an earlier stage of the disease. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions concerning the effectiveness of testing for undiagnosed cancer in people with a first episode of unprovoked VTE (DVT or PE) in reducing cancer- or VTE-related morbidity and mortality. The results could be consistent with either benefit or no benefit. Further good-quality large-scale randomised controlled trials are required before firm conclusions can be made.

### Recognition of unprovoked (idiopathic) pulmonary embolism-prospective observational study [^112oFb7q]. Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The assessment of the clinical symptoms is the weakest link of the pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnostic algorithm. Despite the presence of highly sensitive and specific imaging methods, verifying PE remains difficult due to nonspecific clinical symptoms and frequently its subclinical course.

Objective

The aim of this study is to improve the recognition of PE by investigating the clinical presentation and short-term prognosis of unprovoked PE in comparison to provoked PE. The study was directed to patients who suffer from PE as a primary disease.

Methods

This prospective observational study included 331 patients with PE, approved by computer tomographic pulmoangiography. They were categorized as having unprovoked or provoked PE, according to their epidemiological data. The clinical characteristics and one-month mortality rate were compared between both groups.

Results

About 67% of the patients had provoking factors and ∼33% had unprovoked PE. The patients in the unprovoked PE-group were younger compared to provoked PE-group (56.67 ± 17.95 vs 63.76 ± 14.58, p < .0001) and the males predominated vs females (62.04% vs 37.96%, p = .012). The patients with unprovoked PE had more previous thromboembolic events compared to provoked PE-group (30.56% vs 19.45%, p = .022) and a larger thrombotic burden (p = .001). Dyspnea (85.18% vs 85.13%), chest pain (47.22% vs 46.85%), cough (43.92% vs 45.94%), hemoptysis (16.67% vs 14.41%), hemodynamic instability (9.26% vs 8.56%), deep venous thrombosis (49.51% vs 44.5%) had similar frequencies in both groups. No significant differences in the means of systolic pressure of arteria pulmonalis, D-dimer, arterial blood gases, Revised Geneva probability score were found. One-month mortality was lower in unprovoked PE-group than in provoked (1.85% vs 8.52%, p = .042).

Conclusions

Unprovoked PE occurs at a younger age, more frequently in males. It is characterized by the following significant variables: higher Wells score, lower PESI score, lower CRP, higher thrombotic burden and lower one-month mortality rate, compared to provoked PE.

### Long term risk of symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment for first unprovoked venous thromboembolism event: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1157N3ai]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

For patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, the optimal duration of anticoagulant treatment is uncertain. After three to six months of initial anticoagulation, extended treatment is highly effective at reducing the risk of recurrent VTE, but this clinical benefit is not maintained when anticoagulation is stopped. After discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment, patients with a first unprovoked VTE have a much higher risk of recurrence compared with patients with VTE provoked by a major transient risk factor. Consequently, anticoagulant treatment is discontinued after three to six months in patients with VTE due to a major transient provoking factor, whereas current guidelines suggest extended (ie, indefinite) anticoagulation in patients with unprovoked proximal deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism who have a non-high bleeding risk. This is, however, a weak (grade 2B) recommendation, in large part as a result of uncertainty in estimates of the long term risk of major bleeding if treatment is continued, and, importantly, the long term risk of recurrent VTE if anticoagulation is discontinued. Thus deciding whether patients with a first episode of unprovoked VTE should receive indefinite anticoagulation or can stop treatment after the initial three to six months, remains an important challenge.

A previous individual patient data meta-analysisof 1732 patients with unprovoked VTE from six randomised trials, reported an overall risk of recurrent VTE of about 10% per year in the first two years after discontinuation of anticoagulation. That analysis did not assess the risk of recurrent VTE in men and women separately or in patients with isolated pulmonary embolism, and it only followed patients for 24 months. Furthermore, trials in that analysis were published before 2004, whereas since then additional prospective studies have reported on the risk for recurrent VTE after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment in patients with a first episode of unprovoked VTE, with several of these studies having followed patients beyond 24 months and some up to 10 years. This offers an opportunity to obtain reliable estimates of the long term risk of recurrent VTE and to assess how the risk varies over time — knowledge that is crucial for deciding the need for indefinite anticoagulation, as well as defining the burden of illness in this common patient population.

### Effect of testing for cancer on cancer-and venous thromboembolism (VTE)-related mortality and morbidity in people with unprovoked VTE [^1148PiUL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a collective term for two conditions: deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). A proportion of people with VTE have no underlying or immediately predisposing risk factors and the VTE is referred to as unprovoked. Unprovoked VTE can often be the first clinical manifestation of an underlying malignancy. This has raised the question of whether people with an unprovoked VTE should be investigated for an underlying cancer. Treatment for VTE is different in cancer and non-cancer patients and a correct diagnosis would ensure that people received the optimal treatment for VTE to prevent recurrence and further morbidity. Furthermore, an appropriate cancer diagnosis at an earlier, potentially curative stage could avoid the risk of cancer progression and thus lead to improvements in cancer-related mortality and morbidity. This is an update of a review first published in 2015.

Objectives

To determine whether testing for undiagnosed cancer in people with a first episode of unprovoked VTE (DVT of the lower limb or PE) is effective in reducing cancer and VTE-related mortality and morbidity and to determine which tests for cancer are best at identifying treatable cancers early.

Search Methods

For this update, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Specialised Register (16 February 2017). In addition, the CIS searched the Cochrane Register of Studies CENTRAL (2017, Issue 1). We searched trials registries (February 2017) and checked the reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials in which people with an unprovoked VTE were allocated to receive specific tests for cancer or clinically indicated tests only were eligible for inclusion in this review. Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, cancer-related mortality and VTE-related mortality.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed quality and extracted data. We resolved any disagreements by discussion.

Main Results

Four studies with 1644 participants met the inclusion criteria (two studies in the original review and two in this update). Two studies assessed the effect of extensive tests versus tests at the physician's discretion) while the other two studies assessed the effect of standard testing plus positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scanning versus standard testing alone. For extensive tests versus tests at the physician's discretion, the quality of the evidence was low due to risk of bias (early termination of the studies). When comparing standard testing plus PET/CT scanning versus standard testing alone, the quality of evidence was moderate due to a risk of detection bias. The quality of the evidence was downgraded further when detection bias was present in one study with a low number of events. When comparing extensive tests versus tests at the physician's discretion, pooled analysis on two studies showed that testing for cancer was consistent with either a benefit or no benefit on cancer-related mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 1.67; 396 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.26; low quality evidence). One study (201 participants) showed that, overall, malignancies were less advanced in extensively tested participants than in participants in the control group. In total, 9/13 participants diagnosed with cancer in the extensively tested group had a T1 or T2 stage malignancy compared to 2/10 participants diagnosed with cancer in the control group (OR 5.00, 95% CI 1.05 to 23.76; P = 0.04; low quality evidence). There was no clear difference in detection of advanced stages between extensive tests versus tests at the physician's discretion: one participant in the extensively tested group had stage T3 compared with four participants in the control group (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.28; P = 0.22; low quality evidence). In addition, extensively tested participants were diagnosed earlier than control group (mean: 1 month with extensive tests versus 11.6 months with tests at physician's discretion to cancer diagnosis from the time of diagnosis of VTE). Extensive testing did not increase the frequency of an underlying cancer diagnosis (OR 1.32, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.93; 396 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.50; low quality evidence). Neither study measured all-cause mortality, VTE-related morbidity and mortality, complications of anticoagulation, adverse effects of cancer tests, participant satisfaction or quality of life. When comparing standard testing plus PET/CT screening versus standard testing alone, standard testing plus PET/CT screening was consistent with either a benefit or no benefit on all-cause mortality (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.49 to 3.04; 1248 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.66; moderate quality evidence), cancer-related mortality (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.52; 1248 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.25; moderate quality evidence) or VTE-related morbidity (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.17; 854 participants; 1 study; P = 0.96; moderate quality evidence). With regards to stage of cancer, there was no clear difference for detection of early (OR 1.78, 95% 0.51 to 6.17; 394 participants; 1 study; P = 0.37; low quality evidence) or advanced (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.14 to 7.17; 394 participants; 1 study; P = 1.00; low quality evidence) stages of cancer. There was also no clear difference in the frequency of an underlying cancer diagnosis (OR 1.71, 95% CI 0.91 to 3.20; 1248 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.09; moderate quality evidence). Time to cancer diagnosis was 4.2 months in the standard testing group and 4.0 months in the standard testing plus PET/CT group (P = 0.88). Neither study measured VTE-related mortality, complications of anticoagulation, adverse effects of cancer tests, participant satisfaction or quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Testing for cancer in people with unprovoked VTE may lead to earlier diagnosis of cancer at an earlier stage of the disease. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions concerning the effectiveness of testing for undiagnosed cancer in people with a first episode of unprovoked VTE (DVT or PE) in reducing cancer and VTE-related morbidity and mortality. The results could be consistent with either benefit or no benefit. Further good-quality large-scale randomised controlled trials are required before firm conclusions can be made.

### A case of acute pulmonary embolism with severe haemoptysis [^114RdGGd]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Haemoptysis is a potentially life-threatening symptom, which require immediate management. Haemoptysis is a challenging situation because the potential numerous causes lead to strongly different therapeutic options (medical, surgical, systematic embolization). When haemoptysis occurred at the acute phase of pulmonary embolism, anticoagulation should be stopped and inferior vena cava filter is justified. Based on a case report of massive haemoptysis related to pulmonary infarction (i.e., no other causes) in a patient with a unprovoked intermediate high-risk pulmonary embolism, we describe the dilemma set in the paradox between the need for stopping anticoagulation and the need to treat the cause of haemoptysis which is also anticoagulation. If anticoagulation should be stopped, however, the optimal management regarding the use of specific reversal agents or prothrombotic plasma concentrates remains uncertain and weakly documented. After haemoptysis has been resolved, there is also uncertainty on restarting anticoagulation modalities. Regarding long-term management, the decision to stop at three months or to prolong indefinitely based on international recommendation is also challenging in the case of unprovoked severe pulmonary embolism. In this particularly high risk situation, multidisciplinary expertise is essential.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111ojjh2]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline on unprovoked DVT of the leg (isolated distal or proximal) or pulmonary embolism (PE) — we recommend treatment with anticoagulation for at least 3 months over treatment of a shorter duration (Grade 1B), and we recommend treatment with anticoagulation for 3 months over treatment of a longer time-limited period (eg, 6, 12, or 24 months) (Grade 1B). After 3 months of treatment, patients with unprovoked DVT of the leg or PE should be evaluated for the risk-benefit ratio of extended therapy.

### Long term risk of symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment for first unprovoked venous thromboembolism event: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112cEUkX]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Our results provide clinicians, patients, and policymakers with rigorous benchmarks as well as a management framework in which to consider the long term risks and consequences of recurrent VTE if anticoagulation is stopped. When weighed against current best estimates for risks and consequences of major bleeding if anticoagulation is continued, our results could be used to decide whether to consider indefinite anticoagulation for unprovoked VTE. For example, in a typical patient with a first episode of unprovoked VTE with a risk for recurrent VTE of 36% at 10 years, combined with a case fatality rate for recurrent VTE of 4% as determined by our analysis, the risk of death from a first recurrent VTE after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment would be about 1.44% by 10 years. Indeed, our pooled results showed a cumulative risk of recurrent fatal VTE of 1.5% at 10 years after discontinuation of treatment. For the same patient, the annual risk for major bleeding if treatment is continued is estimated at 1.2%, translating to a 10 year risk for major bleeding of 12%. When combined with the case fatality rate for major bleeding of 11%, the risk of death from major bleeding if anticoagulation is continued would be about 1.32% at 10 years. Hence, over a 10 year horizon, patients with a first unprovoked VTE might be expected to derive a small net long term mortality benefit from continuing anticoagulation, consistent with current guidelines that suggest considering indefinite anticoagulation in patients with unprovoked proximal deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism who are not at high risk for bleeding. Nevertheless, our estimation of the net mortality benefit is limited owing to the uncertainty in estimates of the long term risk of major bleeding and case fatality rate of major bleeding during extended anticoagulation in patients with a first unprovoked VTE event, which should be the focus of future research.

### Comparison of international guideline recommendations for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^112kKbjQ]. The Lancet: Haematology (2023). High credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is one of the leading causes of death due to cardiovascular disease. Timely diagnosis is crucial, but challenging, as the clinical presentation of pulmonary embolism is unspecific and easily mistaken for other common medical emergencies. Clinical prediction rules and D-dimer measurement allow stratification of patients into groups of expected prevalence and are key elements in adequate selection of patients for diagnostic imaging; however, the strengths and weaknesses of the multiple proposed prediction rules, when to measure D-dimer, and which cutoff to apply might be elusive to a significant proportion of physicians. 13 international guidelines authored by medical societies or expert author groups provide recommendations on facets of the diagnostic investigations in suspected pulmonary embolism, some of which are hallmarked by pronounced heterogeneity. This Review summarises key recommendations of each guideline, considers the most recent evidence on the topic, compares guideline recommendations on each facet of the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, and provides a synthesis on the most common recommendations.

### Patients with a first symptomatic unprovoked deep vein thrombosis are at higher risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism than patients with a first unprovoked pulmonary embolism [^113b1sEm]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Previous studies are mixed as to whether patients with unprovoked pulmonary embolism (PE) have a higher rate of venous thromboembolism (VTE) recurrence after anticoagulation is discontinued than patients with unprovoked deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Objectives

To determine whether patients with unprovoked PE have a higher rate of VTE recurrence than patients with unprovoked DVT in a prospective multicenter cohort study.

Patients/Methods

Six hundred and forty-six patients with a first episode of symptomatic unprovoked VTE were treated with heparin and subsequent oral anticoagulation for 5–7 months, and were followed every 6 months for recurrent VTE after their anticoagulant therapy was discontinued.

Results

Of 646 patients, 194 had isolated PE, 339 had isolated DVT, and 113 had both DVT and PE. After a mean of 18 months of follow-up, there were 91 recurrent VTE events (9.5% annualized risk of recurrent VTE in the total population). The crude recurrent VTE rate for the isolated PE, isolated DVT and DVT and PE groups were 7.7%, 16.5% and 17.7%, respectively. The relative risk of recurrent VTE for isolated DVT vs. isolated PE was 2.1 (95% confidence interval 1.2–3.7).

Conclusions

This study has demonstrated that patients with a first episode of unprovoked isolated DVT are 2.1 times more likely to have a recurrent VTE episode than patients with a first episode of unprovoked isolated PE. These findings need to be considered when determining the optimal duration of anticoagulant therapy for patients with unprovoked VTE.

### Long term risk of symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment for first unprovoked venous thromboembolism event: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Pu57b]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objectives

To determine the rate of a first recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) event after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment in patients with a first episode of unprovoked VTE, and the cumulative incidence for recurrent VTE up to 10 years.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sources

Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (from inception to 15 March 2019).

Study selection

Randomised controlled trials and prospective cohort studies reporting symptomatic recurrent VTE after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment in patients with a first unprovoked VTE event who had completed at least three months of treatment.

Data extraction and synthesis

Two investigators independently screened studies, extracted data, and appraised risk of bias. Data clarifications were sought from authors of eligible studies. Recurrent VTE events and person years of follow-up after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment were used to calculate rates for individual studies, and data were pooled using random effects meta-analysis. Sex and site of initial VTE were investigated as potential sources of between study heterogeneity.

Results

18 studies involving 7515 patients were included in the analysis. The pooled rate of recurrent VTE per 100 person years after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment was 10.3 events (95% confidence interval 8.6 to 12.1) in the first year, 6.3 (5.1 to 7.7) in the second year, 3.8 events/year (95% confidence interval 3.2 to 4.5) in years 3–5, and 3.1 events/year (1.7 to 4.9) in years 6–10. The cumulative incidence for recurrent VTE was 16% (95% confidence interval 13% to 19%) at 2 years, 25% (21% to 29%) at 5 years, and 36% (28% to 45%) at 10 years. The pooled rate of recurrent VTE per 100 person years in the first year was 11.9 events (9.6 to 14.4) for men and 8.9 events (6.8 to 11.3) for women, with a cumulative incidence for recurrent VTE of 41% (28% to 56%) and 29% (20% to 38%), respectively, at 10 years. Compared to patients with isolated pulmonary embolism, the rate of recurrent VTE was higher in patients with proximal deep vein thrombosis (rate ratio 1.4, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 1.7) and in patients with pulmonary embolism plus deep vein thrombosis (1.5, 1.1 to 1.9). In patients with distal deep vein thrombosis, the pooled rate of recurrent VTE per 100 person years was 1.9 events (95% confidence interval 0.5 to 4.3) in the first year after anticoagulation had stopped. The case fatality rate for recurrent VTE was 4% (95% confidence interval 2% to 6%).

Conclusions

In patients with a first episode of unprovoked VTE who completed at least three months of anticoagulant treatment, the risk of recurrent VTE was 10% in the first year after treatment, 16% at two years, 25% at five years, and 36% at 10 years, with 4% of recurrent VTE events resulting in death. These estimates should inform clinical practice guidelines, enhance confidence in counselling patients of their prognosis, and help guide decision making about long term management of unprovoked VTE.

### Reducing the hospital burden associated with the treatment of pulmonary embolism [^115xebya]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a major health care burden worldwide (estimated annual incidence of 0.75 to 2.69 cases per 1000 population), and is associated with considerable morbidity and health care resource utilization 1. In patients with PE, almost half report reduced aerobic functional capacity 1 year after their PE diagnosis, which negatively impacts on patient quality of life 2, 3.

The hospital burden of PE is particularly high for several reasons. First, approximately two‐thirds of non‐fatal PE and fatal VTE cases are associated with recent (≤ 90 days) hospitalization for surgical procedures associated with a moderate to high risk of VTE or admission to a medical ward after acute medical illness, making them leading preventable causes of hospital‐acquired morbidity and mortality 4, 5, 6. Second, patients diagnosed with PE have traditionally been treated in hospital 7. Last, data from the European PREFER in VTE registry indicated that 10% to 25% of patients with PE were rehospitalized within 1 year of diagnosis, and 20% of these readmissions were due to VTE‐related events 8, 9.

Current guidelines suggest that the approximately 30% to 55% of patients with PE who are at low mortality risk may be suitable for early discharge and outpatient treatment 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Nonetheless, clinical trial and real‐world data suggest that 80% to 98% of patients diagnosed with PE are admitted to hospital 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. The necessity of this strategy is unclear, because some centers have established outpatient treatment pathways that result in ~50% to 70% of patients with PE receiving outpatient therapy 22, 23. As well as clinical indicators of cardiopulmonary stability (e.g. blood pressure and oxygen saturation) and PE risk (e.g. high/intermediate vs. low risk), factors favoring hospitalization over outpatient treatment include first VTE (vs. recurrent VTE), provoked VTE (vs. unprovoked VTE), advancing age, and presence of comorbidities (e.g. renal impairment or cancer) 20, 22, 24, 25, 26. Type of health care system, geographical location, level of medicolegal risk, physician attitudes, and patient preferences also influence the proportion of patients with PE treated in the outpatient setting 22, 27, 28, 29.

### Long term risk of symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment for first unprovoked venous thromboembolism event: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115WMuvb]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

In patients with a first unprovoked isolated pulmonary embolism, the pooled rate of recurrent VTE in the first year after discontinuation of anticoagulation was 7.7 events per 100 person years (95% confidence interval 5.6 to 10.2; I² = 49%). In the second year after treatment had stopped, the rate was 4.5 events per 100 person years (2.6 to 6.8; I² = 45%) (table 4). The cumulative two year incidence for recurrent VTE was 11.9% (8.1% to 16.3%) (table 4).

Among those with pulmonary embolism plus deep vein thrombosis as the initial unprovoked VTE, the pooled rate of recurrent VTE in the first year after discontinuation of anticoagulation was 10.2 events per 100 person years (6.7 to 14.2; I² = 59%). In the second year after treatment had stopped, the rate was 7.6 events per 100 person years (4.7 to 11.2; I² = 23%) (table 4). The cumulative two year incidence for recurrent VTE was 17.0% (95% confidence interval 11.1% to 23.8%) (table 4).

Overall, patients with distal deep vein thrombosis had a lower rate of recurrent VTE compared to patients with proximal deep vein thrombosis (rate ratio 0.2, 95% confidence interval 0.04 to 0.5, P < 0.001), isolated pulmonary embolism (0.2, 0.05 to 0.7, P = 0.009), as well as pulmonary embolism plus deep vein thrombosis (0.2, 0.03 to 0.5, P < 0.001). Patients with proximal deep vein thrombosis had 1.4 times the rate of recurrent VTE of patients with isolated pulmonary embolism (1.4, 1.1 to 1.7, P = 0.004), and 0.9 times the rate of recurrent VTE of patients with pulmonary embolism plus deep vein thrombosis (0.9, 0.7 to 1.2, P = 0.47). Patients with pulmonary embolism plus deep vein thrombosis had 1.5 times the rate of recurrent VTE of patients with isolated pulmonary embolism (1.5, 1.1 to 1.9, P = 0.005) (table 5).

### Long term risk of symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment for first unprovoked venous thromboembolism event: systematic review and meta-analysis [^11264UeE]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Additional findings from our study are noteworthy. Firstly, our results show that it is unlikely that patients with a first unprovoked distal deep vein thrombosis will benefit from indefinite anticoagulation given the low rate of recurrent VTE (1.9%, 95% confidence interval 0.5% to 4.3%) in the year after discontinuation of treatment. Secondly, a cohort studysuggested that patients with a first unprovoked pulmonary embolism have a higher rate of recurrent VTE after discontinuation of anticoagulation is discontinued than patients with a first unprovoked proximal deep vein thrombosis, whereas another cohort study suggested the opposite. Our meta-analysis shows that the rate of recurrent VTE after discontinuation of anticoagulation in patients with a first unprovoked proximal deep vein thrombosis is 1.4-fold higher than in patients with a first unprovoked isolated pulmonary embolism and is comparable to the rate of recurrent VTE in patients with pulmonary embolism plus deep vein thrombosis. Thirdly, our study establishes that the absolute risk of recurrent VTE in patients with a first unprovoked VTE varies considerably over time — it is highest in the first year after treatment, reaching 10.3% (95% confidence interval 8.6% to 12.1%), declines in the second year after treatment to 6.3% (5.1% to 7.7%), and then significantly drops to an average of 3.1% to 3.8% (95% confidence interval 1.7% to 4.9%) per year in the subsequent eight years. Given current guideline recommendations on treatment duration for unprovoked VTE, this finding might help clinicians counsel patients who have already stopped treatment and want advice about resuming anticoagulation. Our results suggest that patients who have not experienced a recurrence within two years of discontinuing anticoagulant treatment are unlikely to experience a net long term mortality benefit from restarting anticoagulation.

### Effect of testing for cancer on cancer-and venous thromboembolism (VTE)-related mortality and morbidity in patients with unprovoked VTE [^111vWqmU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a collective term for two conditions: deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). A proportion of patients with VTE have no underlying or immediately predisposing risk factors and the VTE is referred to as unprovoked. Unprovoked VTE can often be the first clinical manifestation of an underlying malignancy. This has raised the question of whether patients with an unprovoked VTE should be investigated for an underlying cancer. Treatment for VTE is different in cancer and non-cancer patients and a correct diagnosis would ensure that patients received the optimal treatment for VTE to prevent recurrence and further morbidity. Furthermore, an appropriate cancer diagnosis at an earlier, potentially curative stage could avoid the risk of cancer progression and thus lead to improvements in cancer-related mortality and morbidity.

Objectives

To determine whether testing for undiagnosed cancer in patients with a first episode of unprovoked VTE (DVT or PE) is effective in reducing cancer and VTE-related mortality and morbidity and to establish which tests for cancer are most useful.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched January 2015) and the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS) (2014, Issue 12). Clinical trials databases were searched. The reference lists of relevant articles were also checked.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials in which patients with an unprovoked VTE were allocated to receive specific tests for cancer or clinically indicated tests only were eligible for inclusion in this review. Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, cancer-related mortality and VTE-related mortality.

Data Collection and Analysis

Selection of the studies, quality assessment and data extraction were completed independently by two review authors. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion.

Main Results

Two studies with a combined total of 396 patients met the inclusion criteria for this review. Both studies assessed the effect of testing for cancer versus clinically indicated tests only in patients with an unprovoked VTE. The quality of the evidence was moderate because although the studies were judged to be at low or unclear risk of bias, there was concern that the studies were small as reflected in the wide confidence intervals (CIs). Pooled analysis showed that testing for cancer was consistent with either a benefit or no benefit on cancer-related mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.49, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.67, P = 0.26). One study showed that, overall, malignancies were less advanced in patients belonging to the extensive screening group than in patients of the control group (64% versus 20%, P = 0.047) and that tested patients were diagnosed earlier than untested patients (mean 1 month versus 11.6 months to cancer diagnosis from the time of diagnosis of VTE). Standard deviations were not provided for time to diagnosis, so it was not possible to perform an independent statistical analysis on this association. Neither study measured all-cause mortality, VTE-related morbidity and mortality, side effects of anticoagulation, side effects of cancer tests or patient satisfaction.

Authors' Conclusions

Testing for cancer in patients with idiopathic VTE leads to earlier diagnosis of cancer at an earlier stage of the disease. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions concerning the effectiveness of testing for undiagnosed cancer in patients with a first episode of unprovoked VTE (DVT or PE) in reducing cancer and VTE-related morbidity and mortality. The results are imprecise and could be consistent with either harm or benefit. Further good-quality large-scale randomised controlled trials are required before firm conclusions can be made.

### Patient outcomes after acute pulmonary embolism. A pooled survival analysis of different adverse events [^112hyjmH]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Rationale

There is a lack of information on the long-term prognosis of patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE).

Objectives

To assess the long-term risk for adverse events after PE.

Methods

Consecutive patients diagnosed with PE between January 2001 and July 2007, and patients in whom PE was ruled out from a previous study were followed until July 2008 for the occurrence of adverse clinical events: mortality, symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism, cancer, arterial cardiovascular events and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Hazard ratios (HR) for all endpoints and a combined endpoint were calculated and adjusted for potential confounders.

Measurements and Main Results

Three hundred eight patients with unprovoked, 558 with provoked, and 334 without PE were studied with a median follow-up period of 3.3 years. Patients with unprovoked PE had a lower overall risk for mortality than patients with provoked PE (HR, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.43–0.82), but a higher risk for nonmalignancy-related mortality (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3–2.5), recurrent venous thromboembolism (HR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3–3.1), cancer (HR, 4.4; 95% CI, 2.0–10), cardiovascular events (HR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5–3.8) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (1.5 vs. 0%). The risk for the combined endpoint did not differ between both groups (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.82–1.1). Patients without PE had similar risks for malignancy and cardiovascular events than patients with provoked PE, but lower risks for the remaining outcomes. The fraction of both patients with provoked and unprovoked PE without events after 1 year was only 70% and decreased to fewer than 60% after 2 years and fewer than 50% after 4 years, whereas this latter was 84% for the control patients.

Conclusions

The clinical course of acute PE is complicated by high rates of serious adverse events, which occur in half of the patients within 4 years.

### Long term risk of symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment for first unprovoked venous thromboembolism event: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112hvSie]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

In the second year after discontinuation of treatment, the pooled rate of recurrent VTE events per 100 person years was 6.3 (95% confidence interval 5.1 to 7.7; I² = 56%). The rate of recurrent VTE events per 100 person years for deep vein thrombosis was 3.7 (2.8 to 4.7; I² = 55%), for pulmonary embolism was 2.0 (1.4 to 2.6; I² = 36%), and for pulmonary embolism plus deep vein thrombosis was 0.2 (0.1 to 0.4; I² = 0%) (table 2).

In years 3–5 after discontinuation of treatment, the pooled rate of recurrent VTE per 100 person years was 3.8 events/year (95% confidence interval 3.2 to 4.5; I² = 24%). The recurrent VTE events annually per 100 person years for deep vein thrombosis was 2.5 (95% confidence interval 2.0 to 2.9; I² = 0%), for pulmonary embolism was 1.0 (0.4 to 1.8; I² = 83%), and for pulmonary embolism plus deep vein thrombosis was 0.1 (0.0 to 0.3; I² = 71%) (table 2).

Fatal recurrent pulmonary embolism and case fatality rate of recurrent VTE

After discontinuation of anticoagulation, the pooled rate of fatal recurrent pulmonary embolism events per 100 person years was 0.4 (95% confidence interval 0.2 to 0.7; I² = 57%) in the first year, 0.3 (0.2 to 0.6; I² = 10%) in the second year, and 0.1 (95% confidence interval 0.0 to 0.3) in both years 3–5 (I² = 53%) and years 6–10 (I² = 0%) (table 2). The cumulative incidence for fatal recurrent pulmonary embolism was 0.7% (95% confidence interval 0.4% to 1.3%) at 2 years, 1.0% (0.4% to 2.2%) at 5 years, and 1.5% (0.4% to 3.6%) at 10 years (table 2).

Based on 17 studies involving 6864 patients with information available on both fatal recurrent pulmonary embolism (n = 49) and recurrent VTE (n = 1145), the pooled case fatality rate of recurrent VTE after discontinuation of anticoagulation was 3.8% (95% confidence interval 2.0% to 6.1%; I² = 59%) (fig 2), which remained constant over time (Appendix table 5).

### Emergency evaluation for pulmonary embolism, part 1: clinical factors that increase risk [^113wQsRn]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism (PE) can be fatal, but profligate testing for PE can harm patients.

Objectives

With consideration of potential medicolegal implications, this two-part review provides current evidence about the care of patients with suspected and diagnosed PE in the emergency department (ED) setting.

Discussion

In part 1, we review published evidence to describe the epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical presentation of PE in the ED setting. Older age, surgery requiring endotracheal intubation within the past 30 days, new use of oral contraceptives, and prior unprovoked venous thromboembolism in nonanticoagulated patients are clear risk factors for PE in ED patients. Recent history of unexplained dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and hemoptysis increase probability, but the effect of syncope is less clear. Treated and inactive cancer, smoking, obesity, and pregnancy have not been found to increase the probability of PE in symptomatic ED patients. Unexplained dyspnea, tachycardia, and a low pulse oximetry reading increase probability of PE. Finding of wheezing on lung auscultation reduces the probability of PE, and findings that suggest deep venous thrombosis increase the probability of PE.

Conclusions

Understanding of risk factors, historical data, and physical findings that have been found to increase or decrease the probability of PE in symptomatic ED patients can help create rational guidelines for the diagnostic approach to PE.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Using a standardised form, two authors (FK, AR) independently extracted data, with clarifications requested from the study's authors when necessary. Data were extracted on study design; number of eligible patients; average age of patients; percentage of men; number of eligible patients with isolated distal deep vein thrombosis (ie, in deep veins of the calf), proximal deep vein thrombosis (ie, in the popliteal, femoral, or iliac veins), and pulmonary embolism (with or without deep vein thrombosis); and the definition of unprovoked VTE. For the calculation of event rates, we requested the following from the authors: aggregate data on the number of recurrent VTE events (any VTE, and subtypes deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary embolism plus deep vein thrombosis, and fatal pulmonary embolism), and the total number of person years of follow-up during each of the specified intervals (to ensure appropriate censoring of deaths, patients lost to follow-up and those withdrawn from study). Patients who did not satisfy our eligibility criteria (eg, those with cancer or a second unprovoked VTE event) were not included in those aggregate data.

The same two authors independently assessed the risk of bias of studies. Since our objective was to establish pooled event rates after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment, we evaluated all studies, including each arm of a randomised trial, as an independent observational cohort. As such, the risk of bias for each observational cohort was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale scorebased on three selection criteria and three outcome criteria only (criteria assessing comparability were considered irrelevant in the context of this systematic review and meta-analysis). Given data clarifications obtained from the authors of all included studies, we judged the risk of bias assessment not only at the published study level but also based on authors' clarifications. Following quality assessment standards of a previous meta-analysis, we considered studies in our meta-analysis that met four or more of these Newcastle-Ottawa scale criteria to be of higher quality. A third author (MAR) resolved discrepancies.

Epidemiology

Venous thromboembolism is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and hospitalisation. A model based on data from 6 European countries with a combined population of 310 million found approximately 466,000 cases of DVT and 296,000 cases of PE in 2004. These resulted in approximately 370,000 deaths, of which 7% were thought to be from diagnosed and treated VTE, 34% from sudden fatal PE and 59% from PE following undiagnosed VTE. Incidence for DVT and PE increases with age. VTE is rare prior to late adolescence.

One-third of PE episodes occur without any known risk factor and are classified as 'unprovoked'. The remaining 'provoked' PE episodes are secondary to a risk factor that may be temporary (e.g. surgery, trauma, immobilisation, pregnancy, oral contraceptive or hormone replacement therapy) or persistent (e.g. cancer or inherited thrombophilia). About 20% of all VTEs are cancer-related. Surgery and immobilisation each account for 15% of cases. Not infrequently, PE is without clinical manifestations.

The most frequent inherited risk factors are factor V and prothrombin (factor II) gene mutations. These have a European prevalence of 3–7% and 1–2%, respectively.

Following a PE, about one-third of patients show persistent pulmonary perfusion defects. Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is the principal long-term complication of PE with an incidence of 0.1–4%.

PE frequently recurs, usually after discontinuation of anticoagulation (13% at 1 year, 23% at 5 years and 30% at 10 years). Recurrence rate is higher after unprovoked VTE than after provoked VTE and higher after multiple episodes compared with a single event.

Aspirin after stopping anticoagulation for unprovoked proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) — we suggest aspirin over no aspirin to prevent recurrent VTE (Grade 2B) in patients who are stopping anticoagulant therapy and do not have a contraindication to aspirin; we do not consider aspirin a reasonable alternative to anticoagulant therapy in patients who want extended therapy, and use of aspirin should also be reevaluated when patients with VTE stop anticoagulant therapy because aspirin may have been stopped when anticoagulants were started.

### Long-term effects of unprovoked venous thromboembolism on mortality and major cardiovascular events [^1158DKj3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The following are the main findings of the present study: (1) The rates of mortality and MACE significantly increased in patients with unprovoked VTE compared with that in the matched controls; (2) mortality and MACEs occurred most frequently during the first year after the diagnosis of VTE; and (3) advanced age, male sex, and accompanying cardiovascular risks, except for hyperlipidemia, increased the risks of mortality and MACEs in patients with unprovoked VTE. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large‐scale, nation‐wide, population‐based study with long‐term follow‐up, comprehensively describing the risks of unprovoked VTE in Asia.

In the past, VTE was regarded as a rare disease in Asia. 22, 23 However, emerging evidences from India, Thailand, and Singapore indicated that VTE is no longer uncommon. 24, 25, 26 Although the incidence of VTE in Asian populations remains lower than that in the Western populations, the rates of recurrence and mortality are increasing. 22 One cohort study in Taiwan revealed a 1‐month mortality rate of 8.8% in patients diagnosed with VTE. 22 Cancer, advanced age, longer hospital stays, and recent major surgeries preceding a diagnosis of VTE were independent predictors of mortality. 20 Given the heterogeneous etiologies of VTE resulting in varied survival rates, the key determinants of survival are mainly associated with the underlying diseases. 6 For example, mortality was markedly higher among patients with cancer than that in those without, but the mortality in those without cancer was still twice that in the controls. 5 In addition, patients with VTE and an active malignancy or unprovoked PE had a worse prognosis than those with other subtypes of PE. 6 Nevertheless, the effect of unprovoked VTE on overall survival remains unknown. In this study, we excluded most patients with a reversible etiology, autoimmune disease, or malignancy and specifically focused on the population with unprovoked VTE. We found a noteworthy 2.23‐fold risk of all‐cause mortality in the patients with unprovoked VTE. Survival significantly dropped during the first year after diagnosis and consistently decreased over time. Therefore, the potential treats of unprovoked VTE should be highly evaluated.

### Six monthstwo years of oral anticoagulation after a first episode of unprovoked deep-vein thrombosis. the PADIS-DVT randomized clinical trial [^115pAJwP]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism have a high risk of recurrence after short-term oral anticoagulant therapy for 3 to 6 months. – Current guidelines suggest indefinite anticoagulation in these patients, although this is supported by only a moderate level of evidence.

Extending anticoagulation beyond 6 months of therapy is highly effective in preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism as long as treatment is maintained, but exposes patients to an increased risk of bleeding proportionate to treatment duration.

Only a few randomized trials have followed patients during a substantial period (up to 1 or 2 years) after stopping anticoagulation to determine whether or not the benefit of extended anticoagulant therapy is maintained. –, In a recent randomized trial comparing an additional 18 months of warfarin with placebo after a first episode of unprovoked pulmonary embolism initially treated for 6 months, we confirmed that the benefit of extended therapy was not maintained during a 2-year follow-up period after discontinuing anticoagulation. However, although the rate of recurrent venous thromboembolism after an unprovoked pulmonary embolism has been reported to be close to that observed after an unprovoked deep-vein thrombosis, there is evidence that the case-fatality rate of recurrence is about 4-fold higher after pulmonary embolism than after deep-vein thrombosis. Consequently, findings concerning unprovoked pulmonary embolism might not apply to patients with unprovoked deep-vein thrombosis.

We therefore conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial in patients with a first episode of unprovoked proximal deep-vein thrombosis given an initial 6-month course of oral anticoagulant therapy, to assess the benefits and risks of an additional 18 months of treatment with warfarin versus placebo during the study treatment period and during the 24 months following treatment discontinuation. A further aim was to compare the therapeutic effect of an additional 18 months of treatment in patients presenting unprovoked deep-vein thrombosis with that observed in the PADIS-PE trial.

### Six months vs extended oral anticoagulation after a first episode of pulmonary embolism: the PADIS-PE randomized clinical trial [^111A5Y8X]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The optimal duration of anticoagulation after a first episode of unprovoked pulmonary embolism is uncertain.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of an additional 18-month treatment with warfarin vs placebo, after an initial 6-month nonrandomized treatment period on a vitamin K antagonist.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind trial (treatment period, 18 months; median follow-up, 24 months); 371 adult patients who had experienced a first episode of symptomatic unprovoked pulmonary embolism (ie, with no major risk factor for thrombosis) and had been treated initially for 6 uninterrupted months with a vitamin K antagonist were randomized and followed up between July 2007 and September 2014 in 14 French centers.

Interventions

Warfarin or placebo for 18 months.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the composite of recurrent venous thromboembolism or major bleeding at 18 months after randomization. Secondary outcomes were the composite at 42 months (treatment period plus 24-month follow-up), as well as each component of the composite, and death unrelated to pulmonary embolism or major bleeding, at 18 and 42 months.

Results

After randomization, 4 patients were lost to follow-up, all after month 18, and 1 withdrew due to an adverse event. During the 18-month treatment period, the primary outcome occurred in 6 of 184 patients (3.3%) in the warfarin group and in 25 of 187 (13.5%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.22; 95% CI, 0.09–0.55; p = 0.001). Recurrent venous thromboembolism occurred in 3 patients in the warfarin group and 25 patients in the placebo group (HR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.05–0.43); major bleeding occurred in 4 patients in the warfarin group and in 1 patient in the placebo group (HR, 3.96; 95% CI, 0.44 to 35.89). During the 42-month entire study period (including the study treatment and follow-up periods), the composite outcome occurred in 33 patients (20.8%) in the warfarin group and in 42 (24.0%) in the placebo group (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.47–1.18). Rates of recurrent venous thromboembolism, major bleeding, and unrelated death did not differ between groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with a first episode of unprovoked pulmonary embolism who received 6 months of anticoagulant treatment, an additional 18 months of treatment with warfarin reduced the composite outcome of recurrent venous thrombosis and major bleeding compared with placebo. However, benefit was not maintained after discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy.

### Residual pulmonary embolism as a predictor for recurrence after a first unprovoked episode: results from the REVERSE cohort study [^112sjNAu]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of oral anticoagulant therapy after a first, unprovoked venous thromboembolism is controversial due to tightly balanced risks and benefits of indefinite anticoagulation. Risk stratification tools may assist in decision making.

Objectives

We sought to determine the relationship between residual pulmonary embolism assessed by baseline ventilation-perfusion scan after completion of 5–7months of oral anticoagulant therapy and the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism in patients with the first episode of unprovoked pulmonary embolism.

Methods

We conducted a multicentre prospective cohort study of participants with a first, unprovoked venous thromboembolism enrolled after the completion of 5–7months of oral anticoagulation therapy. The participants completed a mean 18-month follow-up. Participants with pulmonary embolism had baseline ventilation-perfusion scan before discontinuation of oral anticoagulant therapy and the percentage of vascular obstruction on baseline ventilation-perfusion scan was determined. During follow-up after discontinuation of oral anticoagulant therapy, all episodes of suspected recurrent venous thromboembolism were independently adjudicated with reference to baseline imaging.

Measurements and Main Results

During follow-up, 24 of 239 (10.0%) participants with an index event of isolated pulmonary embolism or pulmonary embolism associated with deep vein thrombosis and central assessment of percentage of vascular obstruction on baseline ventilation-perfusion scan had confirmed recurrent venous thromboembolism. As compared to participants with no residual pulmonary embolism on baseline ventilation-perfusion scan, the hazard ratio for recurrent venous thromboembolism was 2.0 (95% CI 0.5–7.3) for participants with percentage of vascular obstruction of 0.1%-4.9%, 2.1 (95% CI 0.5–7.8) for participants with percentage vascular obstruction of 5.0%-9.9% and 5.3 (95% CI 1.8–15.4) for participants with percentage vascular obstruction greater than or equal to 10%.

Conclusions

Residual pulmonary embolism assessed by pulmonary vascular obstruction on baseline ventilation-perfusion performed after 5–7months of oral anticoagulant therapy for the first episode of unprovoked pulmonary embolism was associated with a statistically significant higher risk of subsequent recurrent venous thromboembolism. Percentage of pulmonary vascular obstruction assessment by ventilation-perfusion scans maybe a useful tool to help guide the duration of oral anticoagulant therapy after a first unprovoked pulmonary embolism.

### Extended anticoagulation after pulmonary embolism: a multicenter observational cohort analysis [^115aKhcp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Outcomes and Definitions

Outcomes used were those recommended in regulatory guidelines for studies of extended treatment for VTE diseases. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of death from any cause or recurrent VTE. Secondary efficacy outcomes included: recurrent VTE or VTE‐related death; non‐VTE‐related cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke; and recurrent VTE, VTE‐related death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular disease‐related death. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding. Secondary safety outcomes included CRNMB; major or CRNMB; and a composite of VTE, VTE‐related death, myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death, or major bleeding. All suspected outcome events were classified by a central adjudication committee (S. G. and R. C.). Disagreement was resolved by a third author (N.M.). The criteria for the diagnosis and adjudication of all outcomes and their components are described in Data S1. Risk factors for PE were categorized as transient or reversible, persistent provoked, and no identifiable risk factor or unprovoked PE. Associated cancer was defined as active or anti‐tumor therapy within the last 6 months, or metastatic state. Transient or reversible VTE factors included recent surgery (within 90 days), recent trauma (within 90 days), immobilization (3 days or more), recent hospitalization (within 90 days), pregnancy, postpartum, any infection within 30 days, exacerbation of inflammatory disease, oral contraceptive use, or hormone replacement therapy. Persistent risk factors included active cancer, inflammatory disease, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Unprovoked PE included factors which did not meet criteria for transient or persistent provoking factor.

### Pulmonary embolism [^114XnYyJ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on pulmonary embolism:

- **Definition**: PE is defined as an occlusion of the pulmonary artery or one of its branches, most often caused by a thrombus originating from deep veins of the lower extremities. The clot blocks blood flow to the pulmonary circulation, leading to impaired oxygen exchange and potentially life-threatening hemodynamic instability.
- **Pathophysiology**: Most pulmonary emboli (70–80%) arise from thrombi in the deep veins of the legs or pelvis, though about 6% originate in the upper extremities. Thrombosis is promoted by Venous stasis, Endothelial injury, and Hypercoagulability-the classic Virchow triad. Risk factors include major surgery, trauma, immobility, cancer, estrogen therapy, pregnancy, and inherited thrombophilias. Hemodynamic compromise results from increased pulmonary vascular resistance, RV overload, reduced LV filling, and decreased cardiac output.
- **Epidemiology**: PE occurs in approximately 60–120 cases per 100,000 people per year, causing an estimated 60,000–100,000 deaths annually in the US. Incidence increases with age, from fewer than 50 per 100,000 in those younger than 50 to about 350 per 100,000 in people older than 75. Widespread use of CT pulmonary angiography has increased diagnosis, including detection of smaller, nonfatal emboli. In-hospital mortality is about 14%, and 90-day mortality approaches 20%.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for PE include immobilization or recent surgery, previous history of DVT or PE, malignancy, and certain genetic conditions. Other factors such as HR > 100 bpm and the presence of hemoptysis can also increase the likelihood of PE according to the Wells' Criteria.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, PE can present with a variety of symptoms including acute dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, tachycardia, and syncope. Some patients may also present with hemoptysis or signs of DVT such as unilateral leg swelling. Severe cases can cause hypotension, right HF, or cardiac arrest. Complications can include RV dysfunction, arrhythmia, hemodynamic collapse, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of PE varies depending on patient's hemodynamic status, underlying disease, and the presence of RV dysfunction. Adverse events within 30 days of PE diagnosis, such as death, secondary cardiogenic shock, or recurrent VTE, occur in approximately 7.4% of patients. Long-term prognosis can be influenced by the cause of the PE, with idiopathic PE associated with a worse long-term survival compared to other causes.

European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

This position paper provides a comprehensive guide for optimal follow-up of patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE), covering multiple relevant aspects of patient counselling. It serves as a practical guide to treating patients with acute PE complementary to the formal 2019 European Society of Cardiology guidelines developed with the European Respiratory Society. We propose a holistic approach considering the whole spectrum of serious adverse events that patients with acute PE may encounter on the short and long run. We underline the relevance of assessment of modifiable risk factors for bleeding, of acquired thrombophilia and limited cancer screening (unprovoked PE) as well as a dedicated surveillance for the potential development of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension as part of routine practice; routine testing for genetic thrombophilia should be avoided. We advocate the use of outcome measures for functional outcome and quality of life to quantify the impact of the PE diagnosis and identify patients with the post-PE syndrome early. Counselling patients on maintaining a healthy lifestyle mitigates the risk of the post-PE syndrome and improves cardiovascular prognosis. Therefore, we consider it important to discuss when and how to resume sporting activities soon after diagnosing PE. Additional patient-relevant topics that require Focused counselling are travel and birth control.

Cancer screening

The overall incidence of a new cancer diagnosis is up to six-fold higher in patients with VTE than in sex- and age-matched controls. The absolute risk is highest during the first months after VTE diagnosis, in patients with unprovoked VTE, and in patients aged older than 50 years. The 1-year incidence of cancer is ∼1% in patients with provoked VTE compared to 5% in patients with unprovoked VTE, an incidence that gradually decreases to the risk of the general population over a 2-year period. Given these facts, we propose limited cancer screening in patients with unprovoked VTE to detect cancer at an early stage. Screening should include a thorough medical history, physical examination, basic laboratory testing (including a complete blood count, calcium, and liver function tests), and lung imaging (unless computed tomography [CT] pulmonary angiography was performed to diagnose PE). Age- and gender-specific testing (e.g. mammography, cervical smear, and prostate specific antigen testing) should be implemented in accordance with national guidelines and local practice. During follow-up after acute PE, the threshold to suspect cancer should be low in patients with a relatively recent history of cured cancer (e.g. within 5 years, as VTE can be a sign of recurrent cancer), early VTE progression/recurrence despite anticoagulant treatment, and anticoagulant-related bleeding shortly after start of treatment (particularly gastrointestinal bleeding or haematuria). If cancer is detected in the course of PE treatment, the choice and dosage of the anticoagulant as well as the duration of treatment should be adjusted accordingly.

Although (extensive) screening for cancer leads to an earlier cancer diagnosis, evidence that screening reduces cancer-related morbidity or mortality is lacking. Extensive imaging-based screening with chest CT imaging, abdominal CT imaging, and/or 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT imaging may further increase the number of cancers detected at VTE diagnosis but should be avoided, since the survival benefit of such an approach has never been demonstrated, and at the same time it carries the considerable costs and risks of invasive tests, false-positive findings, and overdiagnosis.

The prevalence of confirmed antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) can be as high as 9% in patients with a first unprovoked VTE. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are currently not recommended in patients with acute PE and APS, particularly in the presence of a double or triple positive APS. Therefore, we propose limiting APS screening to patients with unprovoked PE presenting with signs or concomitant conditions that may raise the suspicion of APS. Twelve of the 16 panel members proposed to test patients with unprovoked PE for APS (only) in case of prior episodes of arterial or small-vessel thrombosis, prior thrombosis at unusual sites, pregnancy complications such as recurrent miscarriage or pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, autoimmune diseases, younger age (< 50 years), or patients with an unexplained pre-treatment prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time. The panel suggests to avoid testing for APS during the first 4–6 weeks after the PE diagnosis because of potential unwanted interfering with the test, which may lead to both false-positive as well as false-negative results. For the interpretation of the type and titre of antiphospholipid antibodies, we refer to the statement made by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) as the present position paper does not aim at exploring laboratory issues in detail. All panel members agree that the ISTH document sets the standards for this specific point. We further propose that the option of switching to a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) should be discussed with patients with confirmed APS who are already on a NOAC and who have remained free of recurrent thromboembolic events. Preliminary long-term follow-up data from a phase III trial suggest that switching from NOAC to VKA may be beneficial also within 2 years of VTE diagnosis.

### Risk scores for occult cancer in patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism: results from an individual patient data meta-analysis [^113rk7QH]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

For the present analysis, individual patient data were used from patients with objectively confirmed unprovoked VTE that were previously obtained in a systematic review (Table S1). 1 The design and detailed methods of this systematic review were reported previously. 1 Briefly, adults with unprovoked deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism were enrolled in randomized controlled trials or prospective cohort studies evaluating protocol‐mandated screening strategies for occult cancer. Patients were followed for at least 12 months for cancer diagnoses missed by the initial screening strategy.

2.1 Study description

The definition of unprovoked VTE was consistent across studies. In general, the studies excluded patients if the index VTE was related to known cancer, recent surgery or immobilization, known thrombophilia, pregnancy or puerperium, or if it was a recurrent unprovoked event. Follow‐up durations ranged between 1 and 3 years. Patients in whom VTE was not objectively confirmed and patients who were enrolled more than 90 days after the index VTE diagnosis were excluded from the dataset. Risk of bias assessment is shown in Tables S2 and S3. Detailed characteristics of the included studies and of their population are presented in Tables S4‐S6.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113Y15wY]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Better selection of patients for extended venous thromboembolism (VTE) therapy — first unprovoked events: In patients with a first unprovoked proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) without a high risk of bleeding, patient sex and a D-dimer measured about 1 month after stopping anticoagulant therapy can help stratify recurrence risk; men have about a 75% higher (1.75-fold) risk than women, a positive D-dimer has about double the risk vs a negative result, and the predictive value of the two factors appears additive. In women with a negative posttreatment D-dimer, risk appears similar to that for proximal DVT or PE provoked by a minor transient risk factor (approximately 15% recurrence at 5 years), whereas in men with a negative D-dimer the risk is not much less than that estimated for unprovoked proximal DVT or PE (approximately 25% compared with approximately 30% recurrence at 5 years); D-dimer testing will often influence a woman's decision but will often not influence a male's decision. Because there is still uncertainty about how to use D-dimer testing and a patient's sex to make decisions about extended therapy in patients with a first unprovoked VTE, we have not made recommendations based on these factors, though a qualifying remark notes that sex and D-dimer measured a month after stopping anticoagulant therapy may influence this treatment decision.

Pulmonary embolism is the most serious complication of venous thromboembolism, with an elevated case/fatality rate. Patients who survived a first episode of pulmonary embolism should be evaluated for the risk of recurrence and of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH).

Recent Findings

The risk of recurrence is higher in patients with unprovoked pulmonary embolism than in those with transient risk factors. Persistent risk factors, such as active cancer and antiphospholipid antibodies, are associated with high risk of recurrence. Recently, elevated D-dimer levels after discontinuation of therapy have been identified as a risk factor for recurrence. CTEPH is characterized by intravascular organization of emboli and occurs in 0.5–1% of cases. Some patients with CTEPH have impaired fibrinolysis, likely due to a structural abnormality of fibrin or fibrin clot. Echocardiography often reveals signs of pulmonary hypertension. This should be confirmed by direct measurement of pulmonary artery pressures at right heart catheterization.

Summary

CTEPH patients should receive life-long anticoagulation for preventing recurrent pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary endarterectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with proximal pulmonary vascular occlusion. Patients with predominantly distal pulmonary vascular occlusion are candidates for pharmacological treatment. All patients with unprovoked pulmonary embolism should be evaluated for long-term anticoagulation.

### Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism [^113buXtu]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, collectively referred to as venous thromboembolism, constitute a major global burden of disease. The diagnostic work-up of suspected deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism includes the sequential application of a clinical decision rule and D-dimer testing. Imaging and anticoagulation can be safely withheld in patients who are unlikely to have venous thromboembolism and have a normal D-dimer. All other patients should undergo ultrasonography in case of suspected deep vein thrombosis and CT in case of suspected pulmonary embolism. Direct oral anticoagulants are first-line treatment options for venous thromboembolism because they are associated with a lower risk of bleeding than vitamin K antagonists and are easier to use. Use of thrombolysis should be limited to pulmonary embolism associated with haemodynamic instability. Anticoagulant treatment should be continued for at least 3 months to prevent early recurrences. When venous thromboembolism is unprovoked or secondary to persistent risk factors, extended treatment beyond this period should be considered when the risk of recurrence outweighs the risk of major bleeding.

### Duration of anticoagulant therapy for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism [^115sm5Zz]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

It takes about 3 months to complete "active treatment" of venous thromboembolism (VTE), with further treatment serving to prevent new episodes of thrombosis ("pure secondary prevention"). Consequently, VTE should generally be treated for either 3 months or indefinitely (exceptions will be described in the text). The decision to stop anticoagulants at 3 months or to treat indefinitely is dominated by the long-term risk of recurrence, and secondarily influenced by the risk of bleeding and by patient preference. VTE provoked by a reversible risk factor, or a first unprovoked isolated distal (calf) deep vein thrombosis (DVT), has a low risk of recurrence and is usually treated for 3 months. VTE associated with active cancer, or a second unprovoked VTE, has a high risk of recurrence and is usually treated indefinitely. The decision to stop anticoagulants at 3 months or to treat indefinitely is more finely balanced after a first unprovoked proximal DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE). Indefinite anticoagulation is often chosen if there is a low risk of bleeding, whereas anticoagulation is usually stopped at 3 months if there is a high risk of bleeding. The decision to continue anticoagulation indefinitely after a first unprovoked proximal DVT or PE is strengthened if the patient is male, the index event was PE rather than DVT, and/or d-dimer testing is positive 1 month after stopping anticoagulant therapy.

### Pulmonary embolism: care standards in 2018 [^113cidmW]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality worldwide. Clinical presentation can be diverse, and clinicians should have a high index of suspicion regarding the diagnosis. Evaluation should include detailed history of possible risk factors, physical examination and laboratory tests that would support the diagnosis and help risk-stratify patients. Finally, a dedicated imaging study should be performed in order to make a definitive diagnosis. Decisions regarding short-term, immediate, treatment are dictated by PE risk category. Treatment of low and high-risk PE is relatively straightforward. But treating moderate risk PE is challenging since aggressive treatment is not devoid of potential harm. This review focuses on the acute and chronic treatment of PE. We present risk stratification, guidance as to treatment choice and insights into chronic treatment with available anticoagulants.

### Management dilemmas in acute pulmonary embolism [^111qSbwW]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The suggested approaches are based on a review of the available evidence and guidelines and on our clinical experience. For many of the dilemmas the evidence base is not substantial and is potentially hampered by reporting bias. Management in an individual patient will require clinical assessment of risks and benefits and will also depend on local availability of therapeutic interventions.

### Evaluation of venous thromboembolism recurrence scores in an unprovoked pulmonary embolism population: a post-hoc analysis of the PADIS-PE trial [^114TSMKe]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

We aimed to validate the Men Continue and HERDOO2 (HERDOO2), D-dimer, age, sex, hormonal therapy (DASH), and updated Vienna recurrent venous thromboembolism prediction models in a population composed entirely of first unprovoked pulmonary embolism, and to analyze the impact of the addition of the pulmonary vascular obstruction index (PVOI) on score accuracy.

Methods

Analyses were based on the double-blind, randomized PADIS-PE trial, which included 371 unprovoked pulmonary embolism patients initially treated for 6 months, successively randomized to receive an additional 18 months of warfarin or placebo, and subsequently followed-up for 2 years.

Results

The HERDOO2, DASH, and updated Vienna scores displayed C-statistics of 0.61 (95% CI 0.54–0.68), 0.60 (95% CI 0.53–0.66), and 0.58 (95% CI 0.51–0.66), respectively. Only the HERDOO2 score identified low recurrence risk patients (< 3%/year) after anticoagulation was stopped. When added to either of the prediction models, PVOI measured at pulmonary embolism diagnosis, after 6 months of anticoagulation, or both, improved scores' C-statistics between +0.06 and +0.11 points and consistently led to identifying at least 50% of patients who experienced recurrence but in whom the scores would have indicated against extended anticoagulation.

Conclusions

In patients with a first unprovoked pulmonary embolism, the HERDOO2 score is able to identify patients with a low recurrence risk after treatment discontinuation. Addition of PVOI improves accuracy of all scores.

Unprovoked deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) — In patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, the ASH Latin American Guideline Panel suggests maintaining indefinite anticoagulation over discontinuing it after a period of 3 to 6 months (conditional recommendation based on moderate certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕⊕⊕◯). This recommendation applies to patients with an average risk of bleeding, and clinicians should be aware that bleeding risk may change over time, so the balance between the desirable and undesirable consequences of indefinite anticoagulation should be reassessed periodically. Estimated venous thromboembolism (VTE) recurrence after a first unprovoked event was 7.4 events per 100 patient-years; of these, 4.1 events per 100 patient-years correspond to DVT, and 3.3 events per 100 patient-years corresponds to PE.

### Clinical outcomes after discontinuing anticoagulant therapy in patients with first unprovoked venous thromboembolism [^113ACj36]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The duration of anticoagulation for a first episode of unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE) should balance the likelihood of VTE recurrence against the risk of major bleeding.

Objectives

Analyze rates and case-fatality rates (CFRs) of recurrent VTE and major bleeding after discontinuing anticoagulation in patients with a first unprovoked VTE after at least 3 months of anticoagulation.

Methods

We compared the rates and CFRs in patients of the Registro Informatizado Enfermedad Trombo Embólica (RIETE) and Contemporary management and outcomes in patients with venous thromboembolism registries. We used logistic regression models to identify predictors for recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE) and major bleeding.

Results

Of 8261 patients with unprovoked VTE in RIETE registry, 4012 (48.6%) had isolated deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and 4250 had PE. Follow-up (median, 318 days) showed 543 recurrent DVTs, 540 recurrent PEs, 71 major bleeding episodes, and 447 deaths. The Contemporary management and outcomes in patients with venous thromboembolism registry yielded similar results. Corresponding CFRs of recurrent DVT, PE, and major bleeding were 0.4%, 4.6%, and 24%, respectively. On multivariable analyses, initial PE presentation (hazard ratio [HR], 3.03; 95% CI, 2.49–3.69), dementia (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.01–2.13), and anemia (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.57–0.91) predicted recurrent PE, whereas older age (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.15–3.87), inflammatory bowel disease (HR, 4.39; 95% CI, 1.00–19.3), and anemia (HR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.35–3.73) predicted major bleeding. Prognostic scores were formulated, with C statistics of 0.63 for recurrent PE and 0.69 for major bleeding.

Conclusion

Recurrent DVT and PE were frequent but had low CFRs (0.4% and 4.6%, respectively) after discontinuing anticoagulation. On the contrary, major bleeding was rare but had high CFR (24%). A few clinical factors may predict these outcomes.

### Risk of arterial cardiovascular events in patients after pulmonary embolism [^114gtRUV]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

Studies have reported inconsistent evidence for an association between venous thrombosis and arterial cardiovascular events. We further studied the association between both diseases by comparing the occurrence of cardiovascular events in patients diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) contrasted to patients with comparable baseline risk characteristics (patients in whom PE was clinically suspected but ruled out). Included were 259 patients with provoked PE, 95 patients with unprovoked PE, and 334 control patients without PE. Patients diagnosed with PE were treated with vitamin K antagonists for 6 months. Median follow-up was 4.2 years. Sixty-three arterial cardiovascular events were registered (incidence, 5.1/100 patient-years). Adjusted hazard ratio was not different between patients with all-cause PE and control patients (1.39, 95% confidence interval, 0.83–2.3) but increased for patients with unprovoked PE versus both patients with provoked PE and control patients without PE (2.18; 95% CI, 1.1–4.5; and 2.62; 95% CI, 1.4–4.9, respectively). This effect was confirmed after redefining the study start date to the moment the vitamin K antagonists were discontinued. Our study underlines the association between unprovoked venous thrombosis and arterial cardiovascular events; however, risk differences between patients with provoked PE and patients in whom PE was clinically suspected but ruled out could not be demonstrated.

The Validation of the Accuracy of Unprovoked VTE Diagnosis

To validate the accuracy of the unprovoked VTE diagnosis, we reviewed the charts for all patients, including both in‐patients and out‐patients, with an ICD‐9‐CM diagnosis code of deep venous thrombosis (ICD‐9‐CM codes 453.8) or PE (ICD‐9‐CM codes 415.1) from 2010 to 2015 in Chi‐Mei Medical Center (Tainan, Taiwan). Our goal was to understand whether the codes had been used correctly. Also, after excluding patients with risk factors of VTE, such as malignant cancer (ICD‐9 codes 140–208), autoimmune diseases (ICD‐9 codes 696.0, 696.1, 696.8, 710.0, 710.1, 710.2, 710.3, 710.4, and 714.0), iatrogenic pulmonary embolism and infarction (ICD‐9 codes 415.11), pregnancy (ICD‐9 codes 671.3, 671.4, 673, and 673.2), or immobilization anytime during the 3 months because of major surgeries or systemic diseases (ICD‐9 codes 820–823, procedure code 81.51, 81.52, 81.53, and 81.54), we investigated the accuracy of VTE diagnosis in the remaining patients according to the guidance of International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis. A cardiologist reviewed all the clinic records.

### Prognosis of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism in buenos aires: a prospective cohort study [^1161VcoP]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The prognosis of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) in whom PE has been ruled out (RPE) is unclear. We aimed to evaluate survival and diagnosis of new cancer in suspected PE patients at follow up.

Methods

A prospective cohort study nested in a prospective Institutional Registry of Venous Thromboembolic Disease was performed between 2006 and 2011. This study was designed to evaluate all consecutive, incident cases of suspected PE in adults. The study was performed at the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, a tertiary level hospital, in hospitalized patients and outpatients. Suspected PE cases were collected using a computerized system that alerts whenever a physician requests pulmonary angiography, angiotomography, or ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy. PE was defined by pre-specified criteria and RPE was defined when diagnostic tests were negative for PE.

Results

We included 1736 cases of suspected PE. The prevalence of PE was 29% (n = 504). There was no difference in the overall survival at 30 days and follow-up between PE and RPE patients. The presence of provoked or unprovoked venous thromboembolic disease in these patients did not affect survival. The main causes of death were PE in the confirmed PE group (60%), and neoplasm (42%) and sepsis (37%) in the RPE group. Survival at 90 days was 63% for PE (95% CI 58–67%) and 67% for RPE patients (95% CT 64–69%). At follow-up, there was no difference in diagnosis of new cancer between PE and RPE patients (2% vs 2%, p = 0.82), even when taking into account the unprovoked group.

Conclusions

Even when the main cause of death in PE patients is PE itself, the overall mortality is similar between PE and RPE patients. The reason for this finding could be because of the more frequent and severe comorbidities in RPE than in PE patients.

### Does the use of direct oral anticoagulants influence the incidence of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension after acute pulmonary embolism? [^111qrkmw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Risk Factors ofAfter Acute PE

One of the key elements of this study was the investigation of the risk factors associated with the development of CTEPH after acute PE in the era of DOAC therapy. By identifying patients with acute PE who are at a risk of developing CTEPH, it may be possible to decrease the incidence of undiagnosed CTEPH and allocate resources more effectively to high‐risk populations. This study identified possible risk factors for CTEPH after acute PE, including female sex, longer interval between symptom onset and diagnosis, hypoxemia at diagnosis, right heart load, low‐dimer levels, and unprovoked PE. These risk factors may be useful for risk stratification during the long‐term follow‐up after acute PE. A longer interval between symptom onset and diagnosis suggests that the more challenging clot dissolution and reduced anticoagulation effectiveness may have influenced the development of CTEPH.

### Long-term effects of unprovoked venous thromboembolism on mortality and major cardiovascular events [^1161J4Hq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Study Design

This nation‐wide, population‐based, retrospective cohort study was conducted to determine the association between VTE diagnosis and subsequent mortality. The VTE cohort comprised patients with a diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (ICD‐9‐CM codes 453.8) and PE (ICD‐9‐CM codes 415.1) at discharge for the first time from January 2000 to December 2013 by the same subset of the NHI database described above. These codes were considered to be reliable for a diagnosis of VTE on the basis of the clinical symptoms and those patients were regarded to be free from VTE previously. Previous validation studies showed that using ICD‐9 codes to define VTE, a positive predictive value was ≈90%. 20, 21 The date of first‐time VTE diagnosis is called the index date in this study. To specifically select patients with unprovoked VTE at the time of initial enrollment, we excluded patients diagnosed with malignant cancer (ICD‐9 codes 140–208, concomitantly registered with catastrophic illness), autoimmune diseases (ICD‐9 codes 696.0, 696.1, 696.8, 710.0, 710.1, 710.2, 710.3, 710.4, and 714.0), or iatrogenic pulmonary embolism and infarction (ICD‐9 codes 415.11). Notably, because the issue of catastrophic illness is associated with the payment of the NHI, the coding of cancer and autoimmune diseases are validated to achieve a high accuracy. 19 We also excluded patients who were pregnant at the time of enrollment (ICD‐9 codes 671.3, 671.4, 673, and 673.2) or were immobilized anytime during the 3 months before diagnosis owing to major surgeries or systemic diseases (ICD‐9 codes 820–823, procedure code 81.51, 81.52, 81.53, and 81.54).

Non-thrombotic PE does not represent a distinct clinical syndrome. It may be due to a variety of embolic materials and result in a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, making the diagnosis difficult. With the exception of severe air and fat embolism, the haemodynamic consequences of non-thrombotic emboli are usually mild. Treatment is mostly supportive but may differ according to the type of embolic material and clinical severity.

### Frequency and predictors for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension after a first unprovoked pulmonary embolism: results from PADIS studies [^111fosLV]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a life-threatening complication of a pulmonary embolism (PE) whose incidence and predictors are not precisely determined.

Objective

To determine the frequency and predictors for CTEPH after a first unprovoked PE.

Patients/Methods

In a randomized trial comparing an additional 18-month warfarin versus placebo in patients after a first unprovoked PE initially treated with vitamin K antagonist for 6 months, we applied recommended CTEPH screening strategies through an 8-year follow-up to determine cumulative incidence of CTEPH. CTEPH predictors were estimated using Cox models. Pulmonary vascular obstruction (PVO) and systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP) at PE diagnosis and 6 months were studied by receiver operating curves analysis. All CTEPH cases and whether they were incident or prevalent were adjudicated.

Results

During a median follow-up of 8.7years, nine CTEPH cases were diagnosed among 371 patients, with a cumulative incidence of 2.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95–4.64), and of 1.31% (95% CI 0.01–2.60) after exclusion of five cases adjudicated as prevalent. At PE diagnosis, PVO > 45% and sPAP > 56mmHg were associated with CTEPH with a hazard ratio (HR) of 33.00 (95% CI 1.64–667.00, p = .02) and 12.50 (95% CI 2.10–74.80, p < .01), respectively. Age > 65years, lupus anticoagulant antibodies and non-O blood groups were also predictive of CTEPH. PVO > 14% and sPAP > 34mmHg at 6 months were associated with CTEPH (HR 63.90 [95% CI 3.11–1310.00, p < .01]and HR 17.2 [95% CI 2.75–108, p < .01]).

Conclusion

After a first unprovoked PE, CTEPH cumulative incidence was 2.8% during an 8-year follow-up. PVO and sPAP at PE diagnosis and at 6 months were the main predictors for CTEPH diagnosis.

### Correlation between short-term air pollution exposure and unprovoked lung embolism. prospective observational (contamina-TEP group) [^111WEbc4]. Thrombosis Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The aim was to analyze the temporal relationship between short-term air pollution exposure and acute symptomatic unprovoked pulmonary embolism (PE).

Patients/Methods

We performed a prospective, multicenter study in consecutive patients diagnosed with acute symptomatic unprovoked PE from February 2012 to January 2013. We analyzed demographic and clinical data, patients' addresses, meteorological and air pollutants data (PM 10, SO 2, CO, NO 2, ozone emission data). We considered the number of days the patient had symptoms, and the study period constituted the previous 30 days. Likewise, the mean annual data of the reference season were calculated as well as the data of the 30-day study period corresponding to the same dates in the previous 3 years in order to obtain the monthly mean of the different pollutants for each period.

Results

A total of 162 patients with acute symptomatic PE were recruited (43.2% unprovoked PE). The air pollutants could be determined in 50% of the patients with unprovoked PE, and a final analysis was performed in 35 patients. In the multiple comparison analysis to verify a possible correlation between the study period and the annual median, only NO 2 showed a statistically significant association (p = 0.009). When comparing the study period with the previous 3 years, only NO 2 maintained a statistically significant association for the 3 study periods.

Conclusions

We found a relationship between short-term exposure to NO 2 and the presence of unprovoked PE.

### Beyond pulmonary embolism; nonthrombotic pulmonary embolism as diagnostic challenges [^115cfuX8]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Nonthrombotic pulmonary embolism (NTPE) is less well understood and is encountered less frequently than pulmonary embolism from venous thrombosis. NTPE results from embolization of nonthrombotic material to the pulmonary vasculature originating from many different cell types as well as nonbiologic or foreign materials. For many radiologists NTPE is a challenging diagnosis, presenting nonspecific or unusual imaging findings in the setting of few or unusual clinical signs. The aim of this paper is to review the pathophysiology of diverse causes of NTPE, which should aid radiologists to better understand and, more importantly, diagnose these infrequent events.

### The risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism after discontinuing anticoagulation in patients with acute proximal deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. A prospective cohort study in 1, 626 patients [^116ycJvJ]. Haematologica (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

While it has long been recognized that patients with acute unprovoked deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) have a higher risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) than that of patients with secondary thrombosis, whether other clinical parameters can help predict the development of recurrent events is controversial. The aim of this investigation was to assess the rate of recurrent VTE after withdrawal of vitamin K antagonists, and to identify clinical parameters associated with a higher likelihood of recurrence.

Design and Methods

We followed, up to a maximum of 10 years, 1626 consecutive patients who had discontinued anticoagulation after a first episode of clinically symptomatic proximal DVT and/or PE. All patients with clinically suspected recurrent VTE underwent objective tests to confirm or rule out the clinical suspicion.

Results

After a median follow-up of 50 months, 373 patients (22.9%) had had recurrent episodes of VTE. The cumulative incidence of recurrent VTE was 11.0% (95% CI, 9.5–12.5) after 1 year, 19.6% (17.5–21.7) after 3 years, 29.1% (26.3–31.9) after 5 years, and 39.9% (35.4–44.4) after 10 years. The adjusted hazard ratio for recurrent VTE was 2.30 (95% CI, 1.82–2.90) in patients whose first VTE was unprovoked, 2.02 (1.52–2.69) in those with thrombophilia, 1.44 (1.03–2.03) in those presenting with primary DVT, 1.39 (1.08–1.80) for patients who received a shorter (up to 6 months) duration of anticoagulation, and 1.14 (1.06–1.12) for every 10-year increase of age. When the analysis was confined to patients with unprovoked VTE the results did not change.

Interpretation and Conclusions

Besides unprovoked presentation, other factors independently associated with a statistically significant increased risk of recurrent VTE are thrombophilia, clinical presentation with primary DVT, shorter duration of anticoagulation, and increasing age.

### Unprovoked proximal venous thrombosis is associated with an increased risk of asymptomatic pulmonary embolism [^1143d2E7]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is common in patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT). The outcome of DVT with concomitant symptomatic PE is worse than the outcome of isolated DVT. The risk factors for DVT and simultaneous asymptomatic PE have not been systematically studied yet.

Aim

To evaluate the frequency and risk factors for asymptomatic PE in patients with DVT.

Patients/Methods

In 155 consecutive patients with a first episode of DVT and no PE symptoms, a ventilation-perfusion lung scan was performed. Body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were calculated and concentrations of D-dimer, high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and troponin were measured. Laboratory tests for thrombophilia were performed.

Results

Asymptomatic PE was present in 36% of patients. No differences in gender, age, BMI and WHR were found between the patients with and without PE. PE was more common in patients with proximal DVT than in those with distal DVT (42% vs. 17%, p < 0.01), and in patients with unprovoked DVT compared to patients with provoked DVT (51% vs. 28%, p < 0.01). The risk of silent PE was the highest in patients with unprovoked proximal DVT (OR, 6.9; 95% CI, 2.3–21.0). Patients with asymptomatic PE had significantly higher values of D-dimer, hsCRP, t-PA and troponin than patients with isolated DVT.

Conclusions

Asymptomatic PE affected more than one third of patients with a first DVT. Unprovoked proximal DVT is the most important risk factor for the occurrence of silent PE.

During the 18-month study treatment period, the primary outcome occurred in none of the 50 patients in the warfarin group and in 16 of 54 patients in the placebo group (cumulative risk, 29.6%; 28.3 events per 100 person-years), resulting in a relative risk reduction of 97% in favor of warfarin (HR, 0.03; 95% CI: 0.01–0.51; P < 0.001) (Table 2). As no major bleeding occurred in either group, the primary outcome was driven solely by the occurrence of symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism. All 16 episodes of symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism reported in the placebo group were unprovoked: one was fatal pulmonary embolism, 13 were isolated deep-vein thrombosis (2 contralateral and 11 ipsilateral) and two were non-fatal pulmonary embolism (1 was associated with an ipsilateral deep-vein thrombosis and 1 with a contralateral deep-vein thrombosis).

Primary and secondary outcomes according to study group assignment.

Clinical outcomes after the study treatment period

During the 24-month follow up after study treatment discontinuation, the composite outcome occurred in 14 patients in the warfarin group (cumulative risk, 26.3%; 16.5 events per 100 person-years) and in one patient in the placebo group (cumulative risk, 2.0%; 1.0 events per 100 person-years) (Table 2). In the warfarin group, symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism occurred in 14 patients, all in the absence of anticoagulation, and in 12 (86.0%) cases was unprovoked. Of these 14 recurrences 13 were non-fatal isolated deep-vein thrombosis (6 contralateral and 7 ipsilateral), and one was non-fatal pulmonary embolism. In the placebo group, symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism occurred in one patient as an isolated ipsilateral deep-vein thrombosis, in the absence of anticoagulation, and was unprovoked and non-fatal. In the warfarin group, one patient had non-fatal major bleeding on warfarin.

### Heart disease in patients with pulmonary embolism [^111CSRW9]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Several heart diseases are promoters of left-side cardiac thrombosis and could lead to arterial embolism. The same mechanism may be responsible for right-side cardiac thrombosis and therefore be a direct source of pulmonary embolism.

Recent Findings

Yasuoka et al. showed a higher incidence of perfusion defects in lung scan in patients with spontaneous echocontrast in the right atrium than in those without it (40% and 7% respectively; P = 0.006). We recently assessed the prevalence of heart diseases in 11.236 consecutive patients older than 60 years discharged from Venetian hospitals with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. We observed a higher prevalence of all-cause heart diseases (odds ratio 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–1.40) in patients with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism alone (secondary or unprovoked) compared with those discharged with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism associated with deep vein thrombosis, generating the hypothesis that some specific heart diseases in older patients could themselves be a possible source of pulmonary emboli.

Summary

Further prospective studies are required to confirm these findings, which have the potential to open new horizons for the interpretation and management of venous thromboembolic disease.

### Long-term treatment of venous thromboembolism [^114bkLJS]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

The most important decision in the long-term treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is how long to anticoagulate. VTE provoked by a reversible risk factor, or a first unprovoked isolated distal deep vein thrombosis (DVT), generally should be treated for 3 months. VTE provoked by a persistent or progressive risk factor (eg, cancer), or a second unprovoked proximal DVT or PE, is generally treated indefinitely. First unprovoked proximal DVT or PE may be treated for 3 to 6 months or indefinitely. Male sex, presentation as PE (particularly if concomitant proximal DVT), a positive d-dimer test after stopping anticoagulation, an antiphospholipid antibody, low risk of bleeding, and patient preference favor indefinite anticoagulation. The type of indefinite anticoagulation is of secondary importance. Low-dose oral Xa inhibitors are convenient and are thought to have a lower risk of bleeding; they are less suitable if there is a higher risk for recurrence. For cancer-associated VTE, we now prefer full-dose oral Xa inhibitors over low-molecular-weight heparin, with gastrointestinal lesions being a relative contraindication. Graduated compression stockings are not routinely indicated after DVT, but are encouraged if there is persistent leg swelling or if a trial of stockings improves symptoms. Medications have a limited role in the treatment of postthrombotic syndrome. After PE, patients should have clinical surveillance for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), with ventilation-perfusion scanning and echocardiography being the initial diagnostic tests if CTEPH is a concern. Patients with CTEPH and other symptomatic patients with extensive residual perfusion defects should be evaluated for endarterectomy, balloon pulmonary angioplasty, or vasodilator therapies.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism [^116fSSds]. Blood Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), occurs in ∼1 to 2 individuals per 1000 each year, corresponding to ∼300000 to 600000 events in the United States annually.

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines from the American Society of Hematology (ASH) intend to support patients, clinicians, and others in decisions about treatment of VTE.

Methods

ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The McMaster University GRADE Centre supported the guideline development process, including updating or performing systematic evidence reviews. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and adult patients. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

Results

The panel agreed on 28 recommendations for the initial management of VTE, primary treatment, secondary prevention, and treatment of recurrent VTE events.

Conclusions

Strong recommendations include the use of thrombolytic therapy for patients with PE and hemodynamic compromise, use of an international normalized ratio (INR) range of 2.0 to 3.0 over a lower INR range for patients with VTE who use a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for secondary prevention, and use of indefinite anticoagulation for patients with recurrent unprovoked VTE. Conditional recommendations include the preference for home treatment over hospital-based treatment for uncomplicated DVT and PE at low risk for complications and a preference for direct oral anticoagulants over VKA for primary treatment of VTE.

### Optimal length of oral anticoagulant treatment for maximum benefit within 5 years after discontinuation of oral anticoagulants in patients with acute pulmonary embolism who require secondary thromboprophylaxis [^11223dwz]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

To our best knowledge, the studies which are comparable to the current one are scarce, despite there were several relevant studies. The results from the current study were basically consistent with that from the study of Chopard et al, in which extended OA treatment over 2.5 years after acute PE diagnosis may provide a net clinical benefit, compared with those without extended anticoagulation, although its mean duration of study follow-up was only 2.1 ± 0.3 years. In the PADIS-PE randomised clinical trial, for 371 patients who had experienced a first episode of symptomatic unprovoked PE and had been treated initially for six uninterrupted months with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), an additional 18 months of anticoagulation treatment with warfarin reduced the composite outcome of recurrent venous thrombosis and major bleeding compared with placebo. However, such benefit was not maintained at the end of 42 months of follow-up after the discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy (20.8% of events in the warfarin group vs 24.0% in the placebo, HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.47 to 1.18). The PADIS-PE study suggested that an overall 2-year VKA anticoagulant therapy can benefit patients with unprovoked acute PE. Nevertheless, such duration is not an optimal one since its legacy effect could not sustain after the discontinuation of anticoagulation treatment. In a meta-analysis of six randomised trials including 5920 patients with VTE at intermediate risk of recurrence, compared with the shorter anticoagulation arm (7.5 months), the longer anticoagulation arm (18.6 months) was associated with a statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.75; 0.8% vs 1.8%). PE-related death was also lower in the longer anticoagulation arm (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.83; 0.2% vs 0.6%), compared with the shorter one. It is partly consistent with the result of the current study with respect to the PE-related mortality, whereas it is inconsistent with the result of the current study with regards to the all-cause mortality. The reason for the disparity in all-cause mortality may lie in that the all-cause mortality could be impacted by a variety of causes of death during an average follow-up period being longer than 7 years after PE diagnosis in the present study, which was much longer than the average 18.6 months after PE diagnosis in the previous study. In the SURVET Study, for 615 patients with first-ever unprovoked VTE who had completed 3–12 months of OA treatment and were randomly assigned to sulodexide, which is a natural glycosaminoglycan with antithrombotic and profibrinolytic activities or placebo for 2 years in addition to elastic stockings, VTE recurred in 15 patients who received sulodexide (N = 307) and in 30 patients who received placebo (N = 308) (HR: 0.49 (0.27 to 0.92); p = 0.025). It indicated that a 2–3 years of antithrombotic therapy is beneficial for patients with unprovoked VTE, being basically consistent with the results of the current study.

Recommendation 7 — Unprovoked deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) and use of D-dimer/prognostic scores: In patients with unprovoked DVT or PE, the Guideline Panel suggests against use of D-dimer or prognostic scores to guide the duration of anticoagulation, stating that the majority of individuals should instead be managed according to Recommendation 8 and that this is a conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence about effects.

Inherited and acquired thrombophilia

Inherited thrombophilia can be detected in up to 30% of VTE patients. However, screening for inherited thrombophilia should only be performed if the results of testing are expected to modify (i) patient management in terms of type, dosage, or duration of anticoagulant therapy or (ii) counselling on oral contraception or prophylactic measures during pregnancy for female first degree relatives. In particular, the presence of inherited thrombophilia should not drive the choice of anticoagulant drug class or its intensity. Notably, in younger patients without identifiable strong risk factors for VTE recurrence and without a strong family history of VTE, in whom the physician and patient are considering anticoagulant treatment discontinuation, the absence of inherited thrombophilia might support the latter decision. Seven of 16 panel members would use the results of genetic thrombophilia testing to support clinical decisions for young patients (e.g. age < 50 years) with unprovoked PE if validated risk assessment models suggest a low risk of recurrence. In their opinion, the presence of inherited thrombophilia may, under those circumstances, support a decision in favour of indefinite anticoagulation. The remaining nine panel members considered available evidence insufficient to support this practice.

### Current approach to the diagnosis of acute nonmassive pulmonary embolism [^1172XN7R]. Chest (2011). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is a common and potentially lethal disease. Given the variable presentation and associated morbidity of this condition, an accurate and efficient diagnostic algorithm is required. Clinical pretest probability serves as the root of any diagnostic approach. We, thus, review several clinical decision rules that may help standardize this determination. Using a review of the literature, the accuracy, predictive values, and likelihood ratios for several diagnostic tests are described. The combination of these tests, based on the pretest probability of disease, can be used in a Bayesian fashion to make accurate treatment decisions. A completely noninvasive diagnostic algorithm for patients presenting with suspected acute pulmonary embolism is proposed.

### Patient-level meta-analysis: effect of measurement timing, threshold, and patient age on ability of D-dimer testing to assess recurrence risk after unprovoked venous thromboembolism [^116SsMwk]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with a first unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE), an elevated d-dimer level after anticoagulation is stopped is a risk factor for recurrent VTE. However, questions remain about the utility of measuring d-dimer in clinical practice.

Purpose

To determine whether the timing of testing, patient age, and the cut point used to define a positive or negative result affect the ability of d-dimer testing to distinguish risk for recurrent disease.

Data Sources

Comprehensive search of electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) until July 2010, supplemented by reviewing conference abstracts and contacting content experts.

Study Selection

7 prospective studies that investigated an association between d-dimer, measured after stopping anticoagulation, and disease recurrence in patients with a first unprovoked VTE (proximal deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or both).

Data Extraction

Patient-level databases were obtained, transferred to a central database, checked, completed with further information provided by study investigators, and pooled into a single database.

Data Synthesis

1818 patients with a first unprovoked VTE were followed for a mean of 26.9 months (SD, 19.1). A study-stratified multivariate Cox regression model, which included patient age, sex, hormone therapy use at the time of the index event, body mass index, timing of postanticoagulation d-dimer testing, and inherited thrombophilia as possible confounders, indicated that the hazard ratio for d-dimer status (positive vs. negative) was 2.59 (95% CI, 1.90 to 3.52). Only male sex had a significant effect on risk for recurrent VTE independent of d-dimer status. The Cox regression model and the log-rank test confirmed that the risk for recurrent VTE was higher in patients with a positive d-dimer result than in those with a negative result, regardless of the timing of postanticoagulation d-dimer testing or patient age. No study- or assay-specific d-dimer effect was found, and reassessing the analysis after recoding data according to specific quantitative d-dimer cut points (500 µg/L and 250 µg/L) did not change the results.

Limitations

Unmeasured variables could have affected the risk for recurrent VTE. The study population was predominantly white.

Conclusion

In patients with a first unprovoked VTE who have their d-dimer level measured after stopping anticoagulation, the timing of d-dimer testing, patient age, and the assay cut point used do not affect the ability of d-dimer to distinguish patients with a higher or lower risk for recurrent VTE.

### International clinical practice guideline Recommendations for acute Pulmonary embolism: harmony, dissonance, and silence [^115ZsUrY]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite abundant clinical innovation and burgeoning scientific investigation, pulmonary embolism (PE) has continued to pose a diagnostic and management challenge worldwide. Aging populations, patients living with a mounting number of chronic medical conditions, particularly cancer, and increasingly prevalent health care disparities herald a growing burden of PE. In the meantime, navigating expanding strategies for immediate and long-term anticoagulation, as well as advanced therapies, including catheter-based interventions for patients with more severe PE, has become progressively daunting. Accordingly, clinicians frequently turn to evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for diagnostic and management recommendations. However, numerous international guidelines, heterogeneity in recommendations, as well as areas of uncertainty or omission may leave the readers and clinicians without a clear management pathway. In this review of international PE guidelines, we highlight key areas of consistency, difference, and lack of recommendations (silence) with an emphasis on critical clinical and research needs.

### Pearls and myths in the evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism [^115Z88Rr]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Significant improvement has been achieved in diagnostic accuracy, validation of probability scores, and standardized treatment algorithms for patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism. These developments have provided the tools for a safe and cost-effective management for most of these patients. In our experience, however, the presence of medical myths and ongoing controversies seem to hinder the implementation of these tools in everyday clinical practice. This review provides a selection of such dilemmas and controversies and discusses the published evidence beyond them. By doing so, we try to overcome these dilemmas and suggest pragmatic approaches guided by the available evidence and current guidelines.

Conclusions

Compared with the control cohort, the risks of mortality and MACEs were significantly higher in patients with unprovoked VTEs. These risks were present since the first year after diagnosis. Among patients with VTE, advanced age, male sex, and comorbid cardiovascular risks contributed to increased risk of mortality and MACEs. These results indicate that the dangers of unprovoked VTE are significant and require further investigations.

### Extended anticoagulation after pulmonary embolism: a multicenter observational cohort analysis [^113QuJQn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The COMMAND VTE (Contemporary Management and Outcomes in Patients with Venous Thromboembolism) multicenter "real‐world" registry evaluated long‐term recurrent VTE and bleeding risks between cancer‐related, unprovoked, and provoked VTE. In the landmark analysis, the cumulative 3‐year incidence of recurrent VTE was lower in patients on anticoagulation than in patients off anticoagulation beyond 1 year in the unprovoked group (on [3.7%] versus off [12.2%], P < 0.001), but not in the transient risk and cancer groups (respectively, 1.6% versus 2.5%, P = 0.30; 5.6% versus 8.6%, P = 0.44). Conversely, in our analysis, we observed a clinical benefit of anticoagulation across all subgroups, including cancer‐associated PE. The numerically higher rates of extended anticoagulation among patients with PE with associated transient or reversible factors and cancer observed in our study might explain these differences (33.7% versus 37.3% for PE with transient or reversible factors not receiving extended anticoagulation, and 34.4% versus 43.5% for cancer‐associated PE, respectively).

This chapter about treatment for venous thromboembolic disease is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do or do not outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patient values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading, see "Grades of Recommendation" chapter). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: for patients with objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), we recommend anticoagulant therapy with subcutaneous (SC) low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), monitored IV, or SC unfractionated heparin (UFH), unmonitored weight-based SC UFH, or SC fondaparinux (all Grade 1A). For patients with a high clinical suspicion of DVT or PE, we recommend treatment with anticoagulants while awaiting the outcome of diagnostic tests (Grade 1C). For patients with confirmed PE, we recommend early evaluation of the risks to benefits of thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1C); for those with hemodynamic compromise, we recommend short-course thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1B); and for those with nonmassive PE, we recommend against the use of thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1B). In acute DVT or PE, we recommend initial treatment with LMWH, UFH or fondaparinux for at least 5 days rather than a shorter period (Grade 1C); and initiation of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) together with LMWH, UFH, or fondaparinux on the first treatment day, and discontinuation of these heparin preparations when the international normalized ratio (INR) is ≥ 2.0 for at least 24 h (Grade 1A). For patients with DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, we recommend treatment with a VKA for 3 months over treatment for shorter periods (Grade 1A). For patients with unprovoked DVT or PE, we recommend treatment with a VKA for at least 3 months (Grade 1A), and that all patients are then evaluated for the risks to benefits of indefinite therapy (Grade 1C). We recommend indefinite anticoagulant therapy for patients with a first unprovoked proximal DVT or PE and a low risk of bleeding when this is consistent with the patient's preference (Grade 1A), and for most patients with a second unprovoked DVT (Grade 1A). We recommend that the dose of VKA be adjusted to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations (Grade 1A). We recommend at least 3 months of treatment with LMWH for patients with VTE and cancer (Grade 1A), followed by treatment with LMWH or VKA as long as the cancer is active (Grade 1C). For prevention of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) after proximal DVT, we recommend use of an elastic compression stocking (Grade 1A). For DVT of the upper extremity, we recommend similar treatment as for DVT of the leg (Grade 1C). Selected patients with lower-extremity (Grade 2B) and upper-extremity (Grade 2C). DVT may be considered for thrombus removal, generally using catheter-based thrombolytic techniques. For extensive superficial vein thrombosis, we recommend treatment with prophylactic or intermediate doses of LMWH or intermediate doses of UFH for 4 weeks (Grade 1B).

### Practical guide to management after an acute pulmonary embolism [^111hJdis]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Conclusion

The suggested approaches are based on a non-systematic review of the guidelines and literature, and expert consensus. Management in an individual patient should be based on clinical risk–benefit assessment, careful management of coagulation status and effective physician–patient communication. Structured follow-up post-acute PE is important to improve patient outcomes, including diagnosing CTEPH. How best to deliver such care and how best to structure follow-up PE clinics requires further evaluation.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113eigC9]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Conclusion — key guideline changes and evidence grading: The guideline states "We now suggest the use of NOACs over VKA for the treatment of VTE in patients without cancer", and "we still suggest LMWH as the preferred long-term treatment for VTE and cancer", while noting "we no longer suggest VKA over NOACs in these patients". It also notes "we now suggest that graduated compression stocking are not routinely used to prevent PTS". Unchanged recommendations now supported by better evidence include "discouragement of IVC filter use in anticoagulated patients", "encouragement of indefinite anticoagulant therapy after a first unprovoked PE", and "discouragement of thrombolytic therapy in PE patients who are not hypotensive and are not deteriorating on anticoagulation". The document reports, "Of the 54 recommendations that are included in the 30 statements in this update, 20 (38%) are strong recommendations (Grade 1) and none is based on high-quality (Grade A) evidence".

### Occult cancer in patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism: a nested case-control study [^114iuG5N]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Patients with a cancer diagnosis are at an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Research suggests that approximately 2% to 15% of all patients with malignancies experience thrombotic events. It has been documented that in certain instances, VTE may present as the first sign of cancer. In fact, up to 10% of patients with an unprovoked VTE have subsequently diagnosed malignancies following their initial thrombotic event. To aid in the early detection of hidden cancers in patients with unprovoked VTE, clinical practice guidelines advocate for limited cancer screening that typically includes a review of the patient's medical history, a physical examination, basic laboratory tests, and chest x-ray. Recent studies indicate, however, that implementing an extensive cancer screening, including more diagnostic tests, may have clinical significance for select patients. Additionally, some authors have developed a novel risk-prediction score to identify patients with unprovoked VTE who are at high risk for occult cancer and would benefit from more extensive screening. Although this score has yielded promising results, further research is necessary before it can be implemented in a clinical setting.

Numerous hypotheses have been put forward to explain the increased risk of thrombosis in patients with cancer. Cancer cells are known to express procoagulant molecules, such as tissue factor (TF), that possess the capacity to activate coagulation mechanisms directly. Furthermore, tumor cells can stimulate cytokine production, which in turn activates coagulation processes and fosters rapid cancer development. During the evolution of malignancies, the expression of P-selectin is enhanced. This protein promotes the adhesion of circulating malignant cells to leukocytes and activated platelets.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a diverse group of lipid bilayer–delimited particles that most cell types release naturally. Although they cannot replicate like cells do, they play a crucial role as mediators of cell-to-cell communication. Moreover, they have shown potential as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of various diseases, including thrombosis and cancer. The objective of this nested case-control study, conducted in a 1-year prospective cohort of patients experiencing unprovoked VTE, was to investigate the potential predictive value of biomarkers related to blood coagulation in identifying the presence of occult malignancies.

Recurrent unprovoked DVT or PE — In patients with a recurrent unprovoked DVT or PE, the ASH Latin American Guideline Panel recommends maintaining indefinite anticoagulation over discontinuing it after a period of 3 to 6 months (strong recommendation based on moderate certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕⊕⊕◯). This recommendation assumes an average risk of bleeding and may not apply to patients with a high risk of bleeding, and clinicians should be aware that bleeding risk may change over time, so the balance between the desirable and undesirable consequences of indefinite anticoagulation should be reassessed periodically. Estimated VTE recurrence after a recurrent unprovoked event was 12 events per 100 patient-years; of these, 6.6 events per 100 patient-years correspond to DVT, and 5.4 events per 100 patient-years correspond to PE.

### Clinical prognosis of nonmassive central and noncentral pulmonary embolism: a registry-based cohort study [^112o8Q5C]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Whether the localization of nonmassive pulmonary embolism (PE) is associated with the short-term and long-term prognosis of patients remains unknown. Our aim was to characterize associations of nonmassive PE localization with risks of recurrent VTE, major bleeding, and mortality during and after anticoagulation.

Methods

Among participants of the Registro Informatizado de la Enfermedad ThromboEmbòlica (RIETE) registry with incident symptomatic nonmassive PE diagnosed by CT scan, we compared risks of recurrent VTE, major bleeding, and mortality during and after anticoagulation between central PE (main pulmonary artery) and noncentral PE (more peripheral arteries) using Cox proportional hazard-adjusted models.

Results

Of the 6,674 participants, patients with central PE (40.5%) had age (mean 66 years), sex (46.9% male sex), and proportion of idiopathic (45.0%) and cancer-related (22.3%) PE that were similar to those of patients with noncentral PE. During anticoagulation (5,256.1 patient-years), the risk of recurrent VTE was similar between the two groups (2.5 vs 2.1 per 100 patient-years; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.32; 95% CI, 0.91–1.90), as were risks of major bleeding and mortality. After anticoagulation was discontinued (2,175.4 patient-years), participants with central PE had a borderline greater risk of recurrent VTE than did participants with noncentral PE (11.0 vs 8.0 per 100 patient-years; aHR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.01–1.78) but not when restricted to participants after unprovoked PE (13.8 vs 11.9 per 100 patient-years; aHR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.79–1.68; p = 0.48). Risks of major bleeding and mortality were similar.

Conclusions

In nonmassive PE, central localization of PE is associated with greater risk of recurrent VTE after anticoagulation cessation. However, the low magnitude of this association and the absence of association after unprovoked PE suggest that the clinical relevance of this finding is limited and that the duration of anticoagulation should not be tailored to PE localization after nonmassive unprovoked PE.

### Patient information: pulmonary embolism… [^112XWnZP]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. A pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that blocks a blood vessel in the lung. A PE is usually caused by a blood clot that forms in a vein and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs. In the US, PE affects approximately 370 000 people per year and is estimated to cause 60 000 to 100 000 deaths per year. Signs and Symptoms of Pulmonary Embolism Patients with a small PE may experience no symptoms. Larger PEs commonly cause shortness of breath and chest pain. Very large PEs can limit the heart's ability to deliver blood to the lung, causing low blood pressure, fainting, or death. Risk Factors for Pulmonary Embolism.

Risk factors for PE include a personal or family history of blood clots, older age, current diagnosis of cancer, use of estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, pregnancy, and being postpartum. Other factors that increase the risk of PE include recent surgery, fracture or traumatic injury, and immobilization. Diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism The first step of diagnosis involves determining the likelihood of PE using a validated scoring system or the clinical opinion of a treating clinician. Patients at low or moderate risk of PE typically undergo blood testing for D-dimer, which is a by-product of blood clotting. If the D-dimer level is low, no further evaluation for PE is needed. An imaging study should be ordered for all patients at high risk of PE and those at low or intermediate risk who have elevated D-dimer.

The preferred imaging test is a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram, which uses intravenous contrast to identify blood clots in the pulmonary artery. Some patients develop post-PE syndrome, which may include shortness of breath and decreased health-related quality of life several months after starting anticoagulation. Approximately 1% to 4% of patients with an acute PE develop chronically elevated pressure in the pulmonary artery. This condition has a mortality rate of 25% to 30% at 3 years, if untreated, but can be cured or improved with surgery.

### Pulmonary embolism as cause of cardiac arrest… [^11322LWq]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Results Within 8 years, PE was found as the cause in 60 of 1246 cardiac arrest victims. The initial rhythm diagnosis was pulseless electrical activity in 38, asystole in 19, and ventricular fibrillation in 3 of the patients. PULMONARY embolism is a possible noncardiac cause of cardiac arrest and has an extremely unfavorable prognosis. In fulminant PE, up to 90% of cardiac arrests occur within 1 to 2 hours after the onset of symptoms. 1 Therefore, most of these patients will require cardiopulmonary resuscitation well before any attempt to diagnose the cause of cardiac arrest has been made, and in many cases the diagnosis will be established only by autopsy after unsuccessful CPR. 2–5. The mechanism of cardiac arrest caused by PE is based on pulmonary mainstream obstruction and liberation of vasoconstrictive mediators from the thrombi, leading to increased right ventricular afterload.

As the right ventricle fails, right atrial pressure rises and cardiogenic shock ensues. Overload of the right ventricle results in a leftward shift of the ventricular septum, leading to decreased left ventricular diastolic filling and end-diastolic volume. Circulatory failure occurs through a profound decrease in left ventricular preload.
6. Previous studies have reported on the difficulties involved in diagnosing PE. Hauch et al2 demonstrated that fatal PE was an unexpected autopsy finding in 10 of 16 postoperative cases. In another study, 3 PE was responsible for 8 of 80 cardiac arrests where a cardiac origin had been primarily suspected. Bedell and Fulton4 showed that the 2 diseases most frequently undetected clinically were ischemic bowel disease and PE. In another autopsy study, Karwinski and Svendsen5 reported that the clinical diagnosis of PE as the immediate cause of death was missed in 84% of all cases of patients with death of unknown reason.

We believe that clinical suspicion of PE as a cause of cardiac arrest remains the key in timely diagnosis and treatment. In our study, the most suggestive reported symptoms of PE were sudden dyspnea and syncope. Therefore, these symptoms should increase and reinforce the clinical suspicion of acute PE, especially in the presence of predisposing conditions. This suggests that lack of signs of deep vein thrombosis is not as helpful in acute decision making as previously believed.

### Status epilepticus without an underlying cause and risk of death… [^116DLhFQ]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

We ascertained 291 people with a first brief unprovoked seizure and 16 with SE. There were 27 deaths among people with seizure and 5 deaths among people with SE. Compared with people with seizure, the adjusted relative risk for death in those with SE was 2. 4 over 10 years. It was increased 5-fold. To eliminate the possibility that the risk of death is further increased in association with repeated unprovoked seizures or their correlates, we conducted a stratified analysis, classifying subjects based on whether they had a second unprovoked seizure. In the 184 subjects who did not develop epilepsy, the cumulative risk of death at 10 years was 20. 0% for the SE group and
13. 7% for the seizure group.

In this study, subjects with idiopathic/cryptogenic SE as their first unprovoked seizure had a nonsignificant 2. 4-fold increased risk of death compared with subjects who had briefer unprovoked seizures at 10 years. There was also a 2. 6-fold increased risk of death when compared with the general population. Previous studies of mortality following SE had several limitations, including a short follow-up and the inclusion of cases with multiple causes. This is, to our knowledge, the first study to show an independent association between SE without an underlying cause and reduced life expectancy, although it is restricted to subjects who later developed epilepsy and to elderly subjects. The excess mortality identified in studies10–12 of newly diagnosed cases of idiopathic/cryptogenic epilepsy among elderly persons may be largely attributed to that associated with incident SE.

An alternative explanation may be that some elderly subjects may have underlying vascular or neurodegenerative disease without clinical manifestations and, therefore, are incorrectly classified as having idiopathic/cryptogenic SE. 7 To our knowledge, there are no published data on the risk of epilepsy among subjects with silent stroke or cognitive decline to support or refute this hypothesis, which postulates that there is an interaction between subclinical pathological features and SE, and not SE itself, that determines the increased mortality.
