## Question

can PE cause elevated WBC

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether pulmonary embolism (PE) can cause an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology linking PE to inflammation and leukocyte activation. Then, I should verify direct clinical evidence showing leukocytosis in PE cohorts. Next, I will examine prognostic studies that repeatedly associate WBC elevation with worse outcomes, which indirectly supports a causal inflammatory signal. After that, I need to check for confounders that could mimic or amplify this effect, like infection, surgery, or medications. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion and note exceptions where WBC may be normal despite PE.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic plausibility. PE triggers a systemic inflammatory response with endothelial injury, cytokine release, and leukocyte activation, which can drive neutrophilia and a rise in total WBC; this aligns with the broader inflammation–thrombosis interplay seen in venous thromboembolism and is supported by translational and clinical observations of leukocyte involvement in thrombosis and PE pathophysiology [^112jKW2m] [^112f74JR].

> Wait, let me verify with direct clinical data. Multiple cohorts document leukocytosis in PE: in a large Pennsylvania statewide cohort, WBC strata above 12.6 × 10⁹/L were common and associated with higher 30-day mortality, indicating both frequency and prognostic significance. Similarly, a prospective single-center cohort showed non-survivors had significantly higher WBC counts than survivors, and a central PE study identified WBC elevation as an independent predictor of adverse outcomes, reinforcing that leukocytosis accompanies clinically meaningful PE presentations [^1131JyrC] [^111tY5tm] [^112viFQ7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review how consistently WBC predicts worse outcomes because that strengthens the inference that PE itself drives leukocytosis. Several studies show WBC count independently predicts 30-day mortality and that adding WBC to standard risk models improves discrimination, including PESI-based models and those incorporating SIRS criteria, which directly include WBC thresholds. Meta-analytic work on neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio likewise supports inflammation as a prognostic axis in PE, corroborating the WBC signal [^116e9kM2] [^112viFQ7] [^1143hamW].

> I need to check for confounders that could falsely attribute leukocytosis to PE. Infection, recent surgery, trauma, corticosteroids, and stress responses can elevate WBC, and these frequently coexist with PE in hospitalized patients. Indeed, case series and reports show concurrent infections or perioperative states with leukocytosis alongside PE, so I should confirm that the WBC elevation is contextual and not solely due to alternative drivers before inferring causality from PE alone [^112ow8Tj] [^1164GTfq] [^116jNMyj].

> But wait, what if WBC is normal despite PE; does that negate the association? No, because WBC is a nonspecific, variable marker. Some PE patients have normal counts, and WBC should not be used to diagnose or exclude PE. Authoritative guidance emphasizes validated pretest probability tools and D-dimer–based strategies rather than WBC for diagnostic decision-making, underscoring that leukocytosis is neither sensitive nor specific for PE even though it may be present and prognostically relevant in a subset [^113e1XSR] [^116x4kmB] [^114pX3Ff].

> Let me synthesize and be precise. Yes, PE can cause an elevated WBC count via a systemic inflammatory response with leukocyte activation, and this is supported by mechanistic plausibility and repeated clinical observations of leukocytosis in PE cohorts. However, WBC elevation is neither universal nor specific, and clinicians must interpret it in the context of competing causes and the patient's overall risk profile, using established diagnostic algorithms for PE rather than relying on WBC to make or exclude the diagnosis [^112jKW2m] [^1131JyrC] [^113e1XSR].

Pulmonary embolism (PE) can cause **elevated white blood cell (WBC) count** through a systemic inflammatory response triggered by endothelial injury, cytokine release, and leukocyte activation [^112jKW2m]. Leukocytosis is common in PE and correlates with **clot burden and severity**, and higher WBC counts are associated with worse outcomes, including increased 30-day mortality and complications [^1131JyrC] [^112viFQ7]. However, WBC elevation is nonspecific and can occur in many conditions, so it should not be used alone to diagnose PE; it is best interpreted alongside clinical assessment, D-dimer, and imaging [^113e1XSR] [^116x4kmB].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking PE to elevated WBC count

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** can explain the elevated WBC count observed in patients with PE:

- **Systemic inflammatory response**: PE triggers a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), characterized by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha) that stimulate leukocyte production and mobilization from bone marrow and marginal pools [^1161WAYo].

- **Endothelial injury and leukocyte activation**: The embolic event causes endothelial injury, activating leukocytes and promoting their migration to the affected pulmonary vasculature, contributing to leukocytosis [^112jKW2m].

- **Secondary infection**: PE patients are at increased risk of secondary infections (e.g. pneumonia, sepsis), which can further elevate WBC counts through infectious inflammatory responses [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting elevated WBC count in PE

Multiple clinical studies have documented **elevated WBC counts** in patients with PE:

- **Retrospective cohort study**: A study of 667 PE patients found that 30-day mortality was significantly associated with leukocytosis (WBC ≥ 11,000/mm³), with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.9 (95% CI: 1.2–3.5) [^1161WAYo].

- **Large statewide cohort**: A study of 14,228 PE patients demonstrated a U-shaped relationship between WBC count and 30-day mortality, with both very low (< 5.0 × 10⁹/L) and high (> 12.6 × 10⁹/L) WBC counts associated with increased mortality [^1131JyrC].

- **Prospective observational study**: Non-survivors of acute PE had significantly higher WBC counts (9.3 × 10⁹/L) compared to survivors (6.5 × 10⁹/L), highlighting the prognostic significance of leukocytosis [^111tY5tm].

## Prognostic significance of elevated WBC count in PE

Elevated WBC count in PE patients is a **significant prognostic marker** associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes:

| **Study** | **Findings** |
|-|-|
| Retrospective cohort (667 patients) | WBC ≥ 11,000/mm³ independently predicted 30-day mortality (OR 1.9) [^1161WAYo] |
| Statewide cohort (14,228 patients) | WBC > 12.6 × 10⁹/L associated with higher 30-day mortality (16.3% vs 5.4% in reference group) [^1131JyrC] |
| Prospective observational study (368 patients) | Non-survivors had higher WBC counts (9.3 vs 6.5 × 10⁹/L) [^111tY5tm] |

---

## Clinical implications and diagnostic considerations

While elevated WBC count is common in PE, it is a **nonspecific finding** and should not be used in isolation to diagnose PE. Clinicians should consider the following:

- **Differential diagnosis**: Leukocytosis can occur in various conditions, including infection, inflammation, malignancy, and stress responses. Therefore, elevated WBC count alone is insufficient to confirm PE [^112ow8Tj].

- **Adjunctive diagnostic tools**: Clinical assessment, D-dimer testing, and imaging studies (CT pulmonary angiography) remain the cornerstone of PE diagnosis [^113e1XSR] [^116x4kmB].

- **Prognostic utility**: Elevated WBC count can serve as a prognostic marker, guiding risk stratification and management decisions in confirmed PE cases [^1131JyrC] [^1161WAYo].

---

## Conclusion

Pulmonary embolism can cause **elevated white blood cell count** through systemic inflammation, endothelial injury, and secondary infections. Leukocytosis is common in PE and correlates with disease severity and worse outcomes, but it is a nonspecific finding that should be interpreted in clinical context alongside established diagnostic tools.

### Evaluation of patients with leukocytosis… [^112ow8Tj]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis, often defined as an elevated white blood cell count greater than 11, 000 per mm³ in nonpregnant adults, is a relatively common finding with a wide differential. It is important for clinicians to be able to distinguish malignant from non-malignant etiologies, and to differentiate between the most common nonmalignant causes of leukocytosis. 5 In one study of afebrile postpartum patients, the mean WBC count was 12, 620 per mm³ for women after vaginal deliveries and 12, 710 per mm³ after cesarean deliveries. Differentiation by Type of White Blood Cell Changes in the normal distribution of types of WBCs can indicate specific causes of leukocytosis. For example, with a normal WBC count of 10, 000 per mm³ and an elevated monocyte percentage of 12, the absolute monocyte count is 12% or 0. 12 times the WBC count of 10, 000 per mm³, yielding 1, 200 per mm³, which is abnormally elevated. 9 One study showed an average increase in WBCs of 2, 770 per mm³ peaking on postoperative day 2 after knee or hip arthroplasty. 10 Medications known to increase the WBC count include corticosteroids, lithium, colony-stimulating factors, beta agonists, and epinephrine. During the recovery phase after hemorrhage or hemolysis, a rebound leukocytosis can occur. An elevated WBC count is a suggestive, but not definitive, marker of the presence of significant infection. For example, the sensitivity and specificity of an elevated WBC count in diagnosing acute appendicitis are 62% and 75%, respectively. A history of an elevated WBC count is important, because duration will help determine the likely cause. Leukocytosis lasting hours to days has a different differential diagnosis than a case that persists for weeks to months.

### White blood cell count and mortality in patients with acute pulmonary embolism [^1131JyrC]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

Although associated with adverse outcomes in other cardiovascular diseases, the prognostic value of an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, a marker of inflammation and hypercoagulability, is uncertain in patients with pulmonary embolism (PE). We therefore sought to assess the prognostic impact of the WBC in a large, state-wide retrospective cohort of patients with PE. We evaluated 14,228 patient discharges with a primary diagnosis of PE from 186 hospitals in Pennsylvania. We used random-intercept logistic regression to assess the independent association between WBC count levels at the time of presentation and mortality and hospital readmission within 30 days, adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics. Patients with an admission WBC count < 5.0, 5.0–7.8, 7.9–9.8, 9.9–12.6, and > 12.6 × 10⁹ /L had a cumulative 30-day mortality of 10.9%, 6.2%, 5.4%, 8.3%, and 16.3% (P < 0.001), and a readmission rate of 17.6%, 11.9%, 10.9%, 11.5%, and 15.0%, respectively (P < 0.001). Compared with patients with a WBC count 7.9–9.8 × 10⁹/L, adjusted odds of 30-day mortality were significantly greater for patients with a WBC count < 5.0 × 10⁹/L (odds ratio [OR] 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14–2.03), 9.9–12.6 × 10⁹/L (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.26–1.91), or > 12.6 × 10⁹/L (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.83–2.69), respectively. The adjusted odds of readmission were also significantly increased for patients with a WBC count < 5.0 × 10⁹/L (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.07–1.68) or > 12.6 × 10⁹/L (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.10–1.51). In patients presenting with PE, WBC count is an independent predictor of short-term mortality and hospital readmission.

Case Presentation

A 53-year-old woman with a history of pulmonary embolism treated with rivaroxaban came to the ED after 4 days of acutely worsening dyspnea and chest pressure. On arrival, her temperature was 36.7 °C; heart rate, 71 beats/min; BP, 98/59 mm Hg; respiratory rate, 22 breaths/min; and SpO₂ 95% on room air. Her WBC count was elevated at 15,770/μL; hemoglobin, 13.3 g/dL; platelets, 280,000/μL; INR (international normalized ratio), elevated at 1.66; and partial thromboplastin time, elevated at 18.8 s. Serum chemistry results were unremarkable, and pro-brain natriuretic peptide was slightly elevated at 530 pg/mL (normal, < 300 pg/mL).

Explaining the higher risk of bleeding for patients with thrombolysis in PE Compared with MI?

With identical risk factors, why are patients with PE more prone to adverse bleeding events? And if patients with PE are at higher risk of bleeding, is it reasonable to treat two very different diseases in the same way?

We cannot overemphasise the major difference in the pathophysiology of clot formation, and clot burden between PE and MI. The thrombus composition in PE and deep venous thrombosis consists mainly of fibrin and a varying degree of platelets (red clot). These venous thrombi are often a consequence of either intrinsic factors (surgery, cancer, inherited hypercoagulable states) or mechanisms that predispose the patient to the formation of venous thrombosis as described by Virchow's triad. The arterial thrombus in MI has a different pathogenesis. It is triggered by an underlying atherosclerotic plaque rupture in the context of turbulent flow that induces a shear stress on arterial wall. This stimulates arterial inflammation, which enhances platelet adhesion to the damaged vessel wall, and impairs activation of coagulation factors that cannot aggregate around the formed clot (white clot). The difference in D-dimer levels (a fibrin degradation product), which are much higher in patients with PE compared with patients with MI, supports this mechanistic difference, but also emphasises the greater activation of the fibrinolytic cascade in patients with PE.

### Leukocytes and systemic inflammatory response syndrome as prognostic factors in pulmonary embolism patients [^112jKW2m]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hemodynamic status and comorbidities are key factors in the prognosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). In addition to hemodynamic variables, cardiac biomarkers such as troponins and natriuretic peptides are risk factors for patients with acute PE. The PE prognostic prediction model that is based on these variables is widely accepted.

Initial risk stratification of patients with PE is based on the presence of shock or hypotension. If the patient is hemodynamically stable, right ventricular function is then assessed by echocardiography, and cardiac biomarkers are measured. However, these variables are not accurate predictors of PE mortality, especially in hemodynamically stable patients.

The triad of vessel wall injury, venous stasis, and blood hypercoagulability has historically been considered a major risk factor for venous thrombosis. Infection is another established risk factor for PE, and in certain cases, PE has been associated with influenza or cytomegalovirus infection.

In deep vein thrombosis (DVT), an inflammatory reaction triggers endothelial cell dysfunction and results in high serum concentrations of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein. Such inflammatory reactions frequently induce well-studied DVT risk factors; however, few studies have investigated a prognostic prediction model for PE. Respiratory and pulse rates are included in the representative PE severity index (PESI). Nevertheless, there is a dearth of studies on the potential association between the systemic inflammatory response and PE patient prognosis.

Studies have suggested that leukocytes contribute to venous thrombosis by damaging the endothelium. Animal models have shown that genetic knock-out of the adhesion molecules E- and P-selectin results in a reduction in thrombus size, which is associated with altered leukocyte accumulation in the surrounding vein wall. However, the role of leukocytes in the prognosis of PE has not been well studied. We hypothesize that both a systemic inflammatory response and leukocytosis may be negative prognostic factors in PE patients.

### Association between elevated white blood cell counts and thrombotic events in polycythemia vera: analysis from REVEAL [^11574jC2]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Polycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by clonal proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Almost all (≥ 95%) cases of PV harbor an acquired mutation in the Janus kinase 2 gene (JAK2; including JAK2 p.V617F and JAK2 exon-12 mutations), which is associated with increased risk of thrombotic events (TEs). Cardiovascular complications that arise from heightened TE risk contribute to increased morbidity and mortality in patients with PV, leading to a reduced life expectancy compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Advanced age (≥ 60 years) and a history of TEs have been recognized as important predictors of subsequent TEs and cardiovascular-related events, and together these form the basis of the conventional model for PV risk stratification and treatment.

Between 34% and 41% of patients with PV experience TEs; arterial events, including transient ischemic attack, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral arterial occlusions, and venous events, including deep vein thromboses of the extremities, abdominal cavity, and pulmonary emboli, are among the most common clinical complications. In a large international study of 1545 patients with PV, 12% and 9% of patients experienced postdiagnosis arterial and venous TEs, respectively. Of the 347 deaths that occurred during a median follow-up of 6.9 years (range, 0–39.3 years), 32 (9.8%) resulted from thrombotic complications. One of the goals of therapy for PV therefore is to reduce the risk of TEs and control PV-related symptoms; these goals are achieved most commonly through phlebotomy alone or in combination with cytoreductive agents such as hydroxyurea (HU).

5.13 Hepatotoxicity

Severe, life threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity including hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, and hepatitis have been reported in post marketing studies in patients treated with clozapine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Monitor for the appearance of signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinemia, coagulopathy, and hepatic encephalopathy. Perform serum tests for liver injury and consider permanently discontinuing treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other systemic symptoms are due to clozapine.

5.14 Fever

During clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak incidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and self-limited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase or decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia or infection. Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].

5.15 Pulmonary Embolism

Pulmonary embolism and deep-vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine. Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep-vein thrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether pulmonary embolus and deep-vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some characteristic(s) of patients is not clear.

5.16 Anticholinergic Toxicity

Clozapine has potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with clozapine can result in CNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity, especially at higher dosages, or in overdose situations [see Overdosage (10)]. Use with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of constipation, urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. When possible, avoid concomitant use, with other anticholinergic medications because the risk for anticholinergic toxicity or severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions is increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8), Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.17 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance

Clozapine can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clozapine does not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related. Consider reducing the dose if they occur.

### Leukocytes and systemic inflammatory response syndrome as prognostic factors in pulmonary embolism patients [^115XHxDi]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The independent prediction factors that demonstrated a significant correlation with mortality within 30 days of hospital admission were altered mental state at the time of hospital admission, RV/LV ratio, SIRS satisfying the WBC criterion, and WBC count. We suggest that careful assessment of systemic inflammatory responses and WBC count is necessary in determining the prognosis of PE patients.

### Leukocytes and systemic inflammatory response syndrome as prognostic factors in pulmonary embolism patients [^116zxsAW]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The prognostic significance of WBC count was evaluated using the previously established PE prognostic index. Huang CM et al. also showed WBC count (≥ 11,000 mm³) was an independent predictor of 30-day mortality in PE patients. Accordingly, we found that WBC count was an independent prognostic factor, apart from PESI, for 30-day PE mortality (Table 5). The area under the ROC curve of PESI was 0.68, which is lower than the previously reported value. However, when WBC count was added to the PESI, an increase in AUC from 0.72 to 0.76 (P = 0.008) was observed. We classified the predicted risks obtained from both models (PESI and PESI + WBC) into 3 categories (0%–10%, 10%–30%, > 30% of 30-day PE mortality), and then cross-tabulated these classifications. Consequently, the classification of approximately 5% of non-survivors was less accurate when comparing PESI + WBC with PESI alone. Conversely, approximately 3% of survivors were reclassified down when WBC count was added to PESI (Table 6).

Thrombolytics, inferior vena cava filter, and surgical embolectomy were performed in 16, 7, and 2 of the cases included in this study, respectively. Thus, our analysis of prognostic factors did not account for treatment method.

### Leukocytes and systemic inflammatory response syndrome as prognostic factors in pulmonary embolism patients [^1161WAYo]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hemodynamic status and cardiac function are important factors for predicting pulmonary embolism (PE) prognosis. Although inflammation is considered a risk factor for deep vein thrombosis, the prognostic significance of both systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and leukocytosis has not been elucidated. This study evaluates PE prognostic factors, including SIRS and leukocytes.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included 667 PE patients. Risk evaluation included SIRS and leukocytosis. A prediction model was developed based on independent predictors of 30-day mortality.

Results

Fifty-seven patients (8.5%) died within 30 days of PE. Multivariate analysis showed that SIRS satisfying the WBC criteria (odds ratio [OR], 2.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5–5.4), altered mental status (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.8–8.7), shock (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.0–7.1), and right-to-left ventricle diameter ratio (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0–2.8) were associated with 30-day mortality. SIRS criteria, including body temperature (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.4–14.8), heart rate (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1–3.6), respiratory rate (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4–4.6), and white blood cells (WBC) count (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2–3.5) predicted short-term mortality following PE. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the prognostic model performance was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66–0.85); pulmonary embolism severity index (PESI) and PESI + WBC count were 0.72 (95% CI, 0.68–0.75) and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.72–0.79, P < 0.001 versus PESI), respectively.

Conclusions

Leukocytosis and SIRS are important factors in determining short-term outcomes in PE patients.

### Pulmonary embolism: care standards in 2018 [^113cidmW]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality worldwide. Clinical presentation can be diverse, and clinicians should have a high index of suspicion regarding the diagnosis. Evaluation should include detailed history of possible risk factors, physical examination and laboratory tests that would support the diagnosis and help risk-stratify patients. Finally, a dedicated imaging study should be performed in order to make a definitive diagnosis. Decisions regarding short-term, immediate, treatment are dictated by PE risk category. Treatment of low and high-risk PE is relatively straightforward. But treating moderate risk PE is challenging since aggressive treatment is not devoid of potential harm. This review focuses on the acute and chronic treatment of PE. We present risk stratification, guidance as to treatment choice and insights into chronic treatment with available anticoagulants.

Severe, life threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity including hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, and hepatitis have been reported in patients treated with clozapine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Monitor for the appearance of signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinemia, coagulopathy, and hepatic encephalopathy. Perform serum tests for liver injury and consider permanently discontinuing treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other systemic symptoms are due to clozapine.

5.13 Fever

During clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak incidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and self-limited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase or decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia or infection[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].

5.14 Pulmonary Embolism

Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine. Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep vein thrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether pulmonary embolus and deep vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some characteristic(s) of patients is not clear.

5.15 Anticholinergic Toxicity

VERSACLOZ has potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with VERSACLOZ can result in CNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity, especially at higher dosages or in overdose situations [see Overdosage (10)]. Use with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of constipation, urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. When possible, avoid concomitant use with other anticholinergic medications because the risk for anticholinergic toxicity or severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions is increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5. 7), Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.16 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance

VERSACLOZ can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that VERSACLOZ does not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related. Consider reducing the dose if they occur.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — intermediate pretest probability: For patients at intermediate risk for PE, D-dimer testing is warranted. As for patients at low pretest probability, a normal plasma D-dimer level (ideally, age-adjusted [age × 10 ng/mL] but otherwise < 500 ng/mL) provides sufficient negative predictive value for PE; no imaging studies are indicated, and an elevated plasma D-dimer level should prompt imaging studies.

### Prognostic value of neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio for pulmonary embolism: a meta-analysis and external validation [^1143hamW]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Prognostic value of neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) for pulmonary embolism (PE) has been reported in several retrospective studies. The purpose of this investigation was to perform a pooled analysis and external validation of predictive value of NLR.

Methods

PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched from inception to November 5, 2022. A random effects model was used. Grade was used to evaluate the certainty of evidence. External validation was conducted in clinical cohorts before and after a propensity scoring matching (PSM). Covariates include basic clinical characteristics, such as age, gender, etc. The value of NLR in prediction model was also evaluated.

Results

A total of 15 studies comprising 5,874 patients were included. Pooled risk ratio of NLR was 2.33 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.97–2.75), with an area under the curve of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74–0.81), a sensitivity of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.71–0.79), a specificity of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.61–0.73), and a median cut-off value of 5.7. Grade of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) certainty analysis showed the quality of the evidence was moderate. Before (n = 336) and after (n = 152) propensity scoring matching, risk ratio of NLR was 2.69 (95% CI: 1.04–6.97) and 6.58 (95% CI: 1.99–17.75). A prediction model consisting of NLR, age, D-dimer, and simplified PE severity index had an area under the curve of 0.809 (95% CI: 0.738–0.88), a sensitivity of 0.638 (95% CI: 0.511–0.745), and a specificity of 0.851 (95% CI: 0.709–0.917). Net reclassification index (12%, P = 0.035) and integrated discrimination improvement (17%, P = 0.022) indicated an improvement caused by NLR.

Conclusions

Prognostic value of NLR for PE was confirmed by meta-analysis and validated in an independent cohort, deserving further clinical application.

### Fibrinogen and red blood cells in venous thrombosis [^111h21k7]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, collectively termed venous thromboembolism (VTE), affect over 1 million Americans each year. VTE is triggered by inflammation and blood stasis leading to the formation of thrombi rich in fibrin and red blood cells (RBCs). However, little is known about mechanisms regulating fibrin and RBC incorporation into venous thrombi, or how these components mediate thrombus size or resolution. Both elevated circulating fibrinogen (hyperfibrinogenemia) and abnormal fibrin(ogen) structure and function, including increased fibrin network density and resistance to fibrinolysis, have been observed in plasmas from patients with VTE. Abnormalities in RBC number and/or function have also been associated with VTE risk. RBC contributions to VTE are thought to stem from their effects on blood viscosity and margination of platelets to the vessel wall. More recent studies suggest RBCs also express phosphatidylserine, support thrombin generation, and decrease fibrinolysis. RBC interactions with fibrin(ogen) and cells, including platelets and endothelial cells, may also promote thrombus formation. The contributions of fibrin(ogen) and RBCs to the pathophysiology of VTE warrants further investigation.

Case Presentation

A 20-year-old woman presented with dry cough, right-sided thoracic pain, and gradually progressive dyspnea on exertion. She had no hemoptysis or fever. There was no relevant medical history. She was a never smoker and used no medication besides oral contraceptives. There were no other risk factors for a pulmonary embolism. There was a family history of ovarian and breast cancer. Physical examination showed a mildly ill-looking woman, with shallow breathing and normal blood oxygen saturation. Auscultation revealed normal breath sounds without crackles or wheezing. Laboratory testing showed a significantly increased D-dimer (4,560 μg/L [normal, < 500 μg/L]), elevated C-reactive protein (131 mg/L [normal, < 5 mg/L]), normal leucocytes, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (825 units/L [normal, 50 to 250 units/L).

### The prognostic value of blood cellular indices in pulmonary embolism [^114Y1qhC]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Prognostication in acute pulmonary embolism (PE) requires reliable markers. While cellular indices such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) appear promising, their utility in PE prognostication needs further exploration. We utilized data from the RIETE registry and the Loyola University Medical Center (LUMC) to assess the prognostic value of NLR, PLR, and SII in acute PE, using logistic regression models. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. We compared their prognostic value versus the simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (sPESI) alone. We included 10085 patients from RIETE and 700 from the LUMC. Thirty-day mortality rates were 4.6% and 8.3%, respectively. On multivariable analysis, an elevated NLR (> 7.0) was associated with increased mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 3.46; 95% CI: 2.60–4.60), outperforming the PLR > 220 (aOR: 2.36; 95% CI: 1.77–3.13), and SII > 1600 (aOR: 2.52; 95% CI: 1.90–3.33). The c-statistic for NLR in patients with low-risk PE was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.69–0.86). Respective numbers were 0.66 (95% CI: 0.63–0.69) and 0.68 (95% CI: 0.59–0.76) for intermediate-risk and high-risk patients. These findings were mirrored in the LUMC cohort. Among 9810 normotensive patients in RIETE, those scoring 0 points in sPESI and with an NLR ≤ 7.0 (35% of the population) displayed superior sensitivity (97.1%; 95% CI: 95.5–98.7) and negative predictive value (99.7%; 95% CI: 99.5–99.8) than sPESI alone (87.1%; 95% CI: 83.9–90.3, and 98.7%; 95% CI: 98.4–99.1, respectively) for 30-day mortality. The NLR is a significant prognostic marker for 30-day mortality in PE patients, especially useful to identify patients with very low-risk PE.

### An unexpected case of recurrence of pulmonary embolism in a patient recovered from COVID19 in full regimen dose of direct oral anticoagulant drug [^114RzAQ5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Laboratory investigation revealed an increase of high-sensitive troponin (90 ng/L, normal range < 54 ng/L), an elevated D-Dimer (3499 ng/ml), an increase of the white blood cell count (26,000), and a normal C-reactive protein (0.2 mg/L). Chest x-ray showed bilateral interstitial infiltrates with accentuation of the vascular plot, in the absence of pleural effusion (Fig. 1). Arterial blood gas at the time of the onset of dyspnea showed PH 7.38, PaCO 2 22 mmHg, PaO 2 48 mmHg, and bicarbonate 20 mmol/L. A reservoir 15 l/min was placed. On 70% FiO₂, arterial blood gas showed PH 7.44, PaCO₂ 37.8 mmHg, PaO₂ 151 mmHg, and bicarbonate 16 mmol/L. An ECG showed a tachycardia, with a new onset right bundle branch block, S1, and Q3. At the transthoracic echocardiography, right-sided chambers were severely dilated. Due to the sudden clinical deterioration, thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was immediately performed in the suspicion of recurrent PE. The patient had a rapid beneficial effect with restoration of stable hemodynamic parameters.

After infusion of tPA, a computed tomography angiogram was performed, which documented marked defect of endoluminal filling of the right and left pulmonary artery with extension to their main branches referable to acute PE, more extensive than the previous one (Fig. 2). The patient was than admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and UFH was started intravenously. During the in-hospital stay, the patient remained hemodynamically stable, in sinus rhythm, and apyretic. His COVID19 swab test resulted negative. To exclude venous thromboembolism (VTE), a venous echo-Doppler ultrasound was performed, which resulted negative. After collegial discussion, it was decided to continue for one month with LMWH and then, if there will be more clearer data on the matter, to start warfarin.

### Pulmonary embolism and increased levels of D-dimer in patients with coronavirus disease [^111pjSUR]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

PEs can occur after the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients, despite DVT prophylaxis. After initial improvements, patients might continue to have high or increasing oxygen requirements because of development of thromboembolic disease. Previous studies showed that low levels of platelets, increased levels of-dimer, and increasing levels of prothrombin in COVID-19 were associated with poor outcome, which might be explained by thromboembolic complications in patients with severe disease. Platelet counts remained within reference ranges for 2 of our patients and only decreased for 1 patient. Two patients had increases in-dimer levels, and the third patient was admitted with a highly increased-dimer level.

Autopsy reports from COVID-19 patients have shown microthrombi in lungs and in other organs with associated foci of hemorrhage. These findings suggest that severe endothelial dysfunction, driven by the cytokine storm and associated hypoxemia, leads to disseminated intravascular coagulation, causing thromboembolic complications. In these patients, other parameters, such as the neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio, and inflammatory markers, including ferritin, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase, were returning to reference levels despite increased-dimer levels and increasing oxygen requirements. Standard dose DVT prophylaxis did not prevent this complication. This hypercoagulability was a consumptive coagulopathy and was not caused by an inhibitor, such as an anticardiolipin antibody; treatment with direct factor Xa inhibitors would be appropriate.

Although certain underlying conditions might have influenced the coagulation process in these patients, the hypothesis that hypercoagulability is driven by endothelial dysfunction is plausible. These case studies support the earlier observation that anticoagulation is associated with a decrease in mortality rates for COVID-19 patients. Monitoring disseminated intravascular coagulation and measurement of platelet counts,-dimer and fibrinogen levels, and trending International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis scores might be beneficial for early diagnosis of PE in patients with COVID-19.

### Pulmonary embolism [^115V5a3a]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common illness that can cause death and disability. It is difficult to detect because patients present with a wide array of symptoms and signs. The clinical setting can raise suspicion, and certain inherited and acquired risk factors predispose susceptible individuals. D-dimer concentration in blood is the best laboratory screening test, and chest CT has become the most widespread imaging test. Treatment requires rapid and accurate risk stratification before haemodynamic decompensation and the development of cardiogenic shock. Anticoagulation is the foundation of therapy. Right-ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography and higher than normal concentrations of troponin identify high-risk patients who might need escalation of therapy with thrombolysis or embolectomy even if the blood pressure is normal on presentation. When patients are admitted to medical wards or when patients undergo surgery, their physicians should prescribe prophylactic measures to prevent PE. After hospital discharge, prophylaxis should continue for about a month for patients at high risk of thromboembolism.

### Leukocytes and systemic inflammatory response syndrome as prognostic factors in pulmonary embolism patients [^116e9kM2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Leukocytes as a prognostic factor of 30-day mortality after PE

Both PESI scores and WBC counts were independently associated with the 30-day mortality rate (Table 5). The variables included in the model accounted for 11.8% of the variation in individual 30-day mortality. The final model had a strong predictive performance, with an AUC of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.72–0.79) for all 654 patients studied (Figure 2). There was a statistically significant difference (P < 0.001) between the ROC curves of the PESI and the PESI + WBC count models. The internal validity of the predictive model was checked by bootstrapping.

Receiver operating characteristic curves for the 30-day mortality. The curves are based on logistic regression models for risk prediction, incorporating the following: Model 1, PESI (AUC = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.68–0.75); PESI + WBC count (AUC = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.72–0.79), P = 0.008 versus Model 1. PESI: pulmonary embolism severity index; AUC: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; CI: confidence interval; WBC: white blood cell.

Patients were reclassified according to 30-day mortality (Table 6); for the 30-day non-survivors, classification according to the PESI + WBC count model was more accurate for 4 patients and less accurate for 1 patient, compared to classification according to PESI alone. For the 30-day survivors, classification according to the final model was more accurate for 35 patients and less accurate for 18 patients, compared to classification according to the clinical model. The NRI achieved by the final model was estimated at 8.1% (P = 0.04). Thrombolytic drugs, inferior vena cava filter, and surgical embolectomy were used in 16, 7, and 2 of the cases, respectively.

Results

Of the 667 patients diagnosed with PE, 57 (8.5%) died within 30 days of hospitalization, and 610 (91.5%) survived at least 30 days after hospital admission (Table 1). All of the patients were followed up 30 days after diagnosis of PE. Causes of death were considered to be related to PE in 33 patients (58%); sepsis (n = 9); cancer (n = 7), major bleeding (n = 4) and other causes (n = 4). PE was diagnosed using spiral chest CT in most patients (n = 635), but was also diagnosed using lung ventilation/perfusion scanning (n = 7), and based on DVT (n = 25). N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT pro-BNP) was measured in 322 patients. Complete blood count and serum creatinine levels were measured in 663 patients.

### The impact of COVID-19 on the prognosis of deep vein thrombosis following anticoagulation treatment: a two-year single-center retrospective cohort study [^115ydjfa]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Assessment of risk factors associated with DVT

In the multivariate analysis of patient clinical background (principal diagnosis, BMI, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), COVID-19, and on-going treatment), DVT characteristics (type of DVT, risk grade, concurrent PE, hemorrhage events, anticoagulation duration), tumor factors (tumor staging and genetic mutation), and results from blood biochemistry tests (complete blood cell count, DD, and prothrombin time (PT)), COVID-19, increased red blood cell count (RBC), exposure to COVID-19, increased level of DD and reduced PT were identified as risk factors for DVT aggravation (Fig. 3).

Considering the potential relationship between abnormal renal function, liver disorders and DVT aggravation, we further assessed influence of elevated level of creatinine (CRE) and alanine transaminase (ALT). Both the abnormal level of CRE (OR:1.241, 95%CI:0.46–3.349, P = 0.35) and ALT (OR:0.747, 95%CI:0.318–1.758, P = 0.505) were not the risk factors for DVT aggravation.

### Characteristics and risk factors for thrombocytopenia in malignancy patients with pulmonary embolism: a case control study [^111XVVVM]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Targeted therapies for lung adenocarcinoma frequently induce thrombocytopenia as an adverse effect. Similarly, immunotherapy has been associated with immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. In our study, we found that anti-tumor treatment increased the risk of thrombocytopenia by 4.176-fold (adjusted OR 4.176, [95% CI: 1.726–10.102], P = 0.002). These findings further support the clinical evidence regarding the association between malignant tumor treatment and thrombocytopenia, particularly in patients with concurrent PE.

Our multifactorial analysis revealed that low neutrophil count (NEUT) and high red cell distribution width standard deviation (RDW-SD) and platelet distribution width (PDW) had predictive value for thrombocytopenia (adjusted OR 0.288, [95% CI: 0.128–0.648], P = 0.003, adjusted OR 3.995, [95% CI: 1.826–8.744], P = 0.001, adjusted OR 2.616, [95% CI: 1.199–5.708], P = 0.016, respectively) in malignancy patients with PE. Previous studies have reported associations between thrombocytopenia and poor clinical outcomes. Zhang et al. found that septic shock patients with thrombocytopenia had a higher 28-day mortality rate than those without thrombocytopenia, with white blood cell count identified as an independent risk factor for thrombocytopenia. Yan X et al. found that decreased immune function was associated with thrombocytopenia. Wang K et al. showed that immune cell counts are associated with prognosis. Additionally, severe thrombocytopenia in cancer patients is frequently accompanied by neutropenia during treatment. Notably, our study is among the first to demonstrate that low neutrophil count, and high RDW-SD and PDW are independent risk factors for thrombocytopenia in PE patients with malignant tumors. In the multifactorial analysis, PCT was a strong predictor of thrombocytopenia (adjusted OR 5.129, [95% CI: 2.214–11.879], P < 0.001). Fatal fever is often accompanied by high PCT and thrombocytopenia syndrome. Elevated serum PCT often indicates the progression of severe bacterial infections and sepsis, and its prognosis is closely related to thrombocytopenia. Several infections are associated with thrombocytopenia. Studies have proven that the higher the inflammatory indicators, the worse the prognosis of cancer patients. No similar reports were found in the PE of malignant tumor patients, our study provides a new basis for exploring thrombocytopenia in these patients.

### Septic pulmonary embolism caused byafter a COlaser surgery for rhinitis [^1164GTfq]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 26-year-old healthy patient had a fever and chest pain three days after nasal carbon dioxide (CO₂) laser surgery for chronic and allergic rhinitis. In the emergency room, he was diagnosed as a right pneumothorax and managed as outpatients with oral antibiotic therapy and close follow-up. Six days later, in follow-up clinic, his presenting signs and symptoms included right chest pain, tachypnoea and elevated levels of white blood cell count and C reactive protein. He was diagnosed as septic pulmonary embolism (SPE) by the detection of multiple nodules with cavitation on chest CT. Culture of pleural fluids showed Pseudomonas aeruginosa Intravenous antibiotic treatment and drainage of the pleural effusion improved his condition. Since SPE occurred after nasal CO₂ laser surgery in this case, careful attention should be paid to infectious complications of nasal CO 2 laser surgery.

### Risk factors for adverse short-term outcome in patients with pulmonary embolism [^1164cHgW]. Thrombosis Research (2001). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and potentially fatal disease. Death usually occurs before hospital admission or in the initial in-hospital phase. A number of clinical and instrumental findings have been associated with a high risk of adverse short-term clinical outcomes in patients with PE. Advanced age, concomitant cardiopulmonary disease, and haemodynamic instability, as well as large perfusion defects at lung scanning and acute right heart dysfunction as assessed by echocardiography, are associated with adverse in-hospital outcome. Elevated serum levels of troponin I have been recently demonstrated to be associated with severe right ventricular dysfunction and adverse in-hospital outcome in patients with PE. Early recurrence of PE is associated with a high mortality rate. Right heart dysfunction, as assessed by echocardiography and an acute fall in platelet count, have been suggested as risk factors for recurrence of PE. A reduction in mortality in the subgroup of patients with a poor prognosis might be achieved by using more aggressive treatments such as thrombolysis and surgical or interventional procedures. However, such treatments are invariably associated with bleeding and other procedural complications.

### The predictive value of PaO / FIOand additional parameters for in-hospital mortality in patients with acute pulmonary embolism: an 8-year prospective observational single-center cohort study [^114xJuMw]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our study cohort, PaO₂/FiO₂ appeared to be associated with higher in-hospital mortality in patients with acute PE, and the optimal cutoff value of PaO₂/FiO₂ for predicting mortality was 265.

Although there was a significant difference between the survivors and non-survivors in only the pulse rate, there were no significant differences in other signs and symptoms, such as dyspnea, fever, cough, expectoration, etc. (Table 2). There was significant elevation of the WBC count in the non-survivors, which is in accordance with results of another study, which showed that the WBC count (OR, 1.9; 95% CI 1.2–3.5) predicted short-term (30-day) mortality following PE. There was a significant elevation of the D-dimer level in the non-survivors in this study Klok. showed that high D-dimer levels were also correlated with centrally located pulmonary emboli and 15-day mortality, and there are also several studies evaluated the correlation between D-dimer levels and the burden of PE. We also found a significant difference between survivors and the non-survivors on the LDH level. Until now, there have been few studies about this biomarker. The cTNI was significantly increased in the non-survivors group in this study, Barrios showed that elevated troponin levels were associated with a high all-cause mortality (OR, 4.3; 95% CI,2.1–8.5%), however, he also pointed out that troponin by itself did not appear to clinically significantly change the pretest to posttest probability of death, and the usefulness of basing therapeutic decision making solely on troponin levels does not appear warranted. So we combined all the above parameters with other prognostic instruments for PE. After adjusting for body mass index, history of cancer, PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio < 265, pulse rate, cTNI level, LDH level, WBC count, and D-dimer level, we found that the risk stratification, PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio < 265, and history of cancer continued to be associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality of acute PE (Table 4).

### JAK2 V617F allele burden in polycythemia vera: burden of proof [^115zkPuf]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

JAK2 V617F and thrombotic risk in PV

JAK2 V617F and its VAF influence both quantity and quality of blood cells, critical factors associated with the high prevalence of thrombotic events before, at, and after the diagnosis of PV. Several studies have identified an independent signal of JAK2 V617F VAF in thrombosis risk, showing that in PV, VAF ≥ 50% exerts risk for venous thrombosis (VTE), even after adjusting for prior events, white blood cell count, and age. Focusing on 576 patients with PV, Guglielmelli confirmed that JAK2 V617F VAF > 50% independently associated with a higher VTE risk and noted that this was evident in both conventionally low-risk and high-risk patients with PV. Moreover, JAK2 signaling interacts with traditional vascular risk factors, and in PV, JAK2 V617F VAF associated with a higher neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and carotid plaque burden, and higher elevations of C-reactive protein (Table 1).

The JAK2 V617F VAF dosage effect on both cytoses and thrombotic risk observed in PV is recapitulated in clonal hematopoiesis (CH) studies in non-MPN populations. Individuals with JAK2 V617F CH had significantly higher white blood cell counts, platelet counts, and hemoglobin concentrations in addition to higher rates of arterial and venous thrombotic events compared with those without CH. In 2019, Cordua et al explored the association between JAK2 V617F -positive CH and VAF in 19 958 participants in the Danish General Suburban Population, using an assay sensitive to 0.009% VAF. JAK2 V617F -positive CH was detected in 3.1% with a median VAF of 2.1%. Individuals with JAK2 V617F CH and higher VAFs had higher blood cell counts and a greater risk for developing venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or a cerebrovascular event, demonstrating the increase in thrombotic events associated with JAK2 V617F positivity and with increasing clonal burden (Table 1).

### Revised paradigm for acute pulmonary embolism prognostication and treatment [^1137gdrS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

- What is the optimal timing for assessing outcomes after a diagnosis of acute PE?

Early assessment for adverse outcomes might improve decision making regarding outpatient therapy of PE and escalated PE-associated monitoring and therapy.

- What kind of relationship should prognostic outcomes have to the therapeutic and monitoring options?

Prognostication should accurately estimate all-cause mortality in patients undergoing consideration for outpatient therapy. Alternatively, prognostication should accurately estimate PE-related mortality and PE-related decompensation in patients undergoing consideration for disease-specific therapy.

- What is the operational definition of PE-associated deterioration?

PE-associated adverse outcomes include death, recurrent PE, RV dysfunction, end-organ hypoperfusion, respiratory failure, and hypotension (and tachycardia).

- For patients with acute PE, how should clinicians accurately estimate the individual risk of patients for adverse outcomes?

Calculators could provide individual risk estimations that help guide the choice of available therapeutic options. Retrospective analyses of large registries' data could assist with the rapid development of new risk calculators. Prospective studies could assist with the development, validation, and revision of these tools and schemas at a slower pace and at a greater cost.

- What predictor variables should physicians consider and/or which prognostic tools should be included?

New risk calculators should include variables associated with medical history and physical examination, laboratory testing, and tests that assess for the presence and the degree of hypoxemia, RV dysfunction, myocardial injury, clot burden, organ perfusion, and systemic inflammation.

- Which intervention(s) has or have the best risk/benefit ratio for distinct subgroups of patients with acute PE?

### Clinical features and risk factors of adverse clinical outcomes in central pulmonary embolism using machine learning analysis [^112viFQ7]. Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

In prior studies, central pulmonary embolism (PE) was associated with high clot burden and was considered an independent predictor for thrombolysis. Further information about predictors of adverse outcomes in these patients is needed for better risk stratification. The objective is to describe independent predictors of adverse clinical outcomes in patients with central PE.

Methods

Large retrospective, observational, and single-center study of hospitalized patients with central PE. Data were gathered on demographics, comorbidities, clinical features on admission, imaging, treatments, and outcomes. Multivariable standard and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) machine learning logistic regressions and sensitivity analyses were used to analyze factors associated with a composite of adverse clinical outcomes, including vasopressor use, mechanical ventilation, and inpatient mortality.

Results

A total of 654 patients had central PE. The mean age was 63.1 years, 59% were women, and 82% were African American. The composite adverse outcome was observed in 18% (n = 115) of patients. Serum creatinine elevation (odds ratio [OR] = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.20–1.57; p = 0.0001), white blood cell (WBC) count elevation (OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.05–1.15; p < 0.001), higher simplified pulmonary embolism severity index (sPESI) score (OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.18–1.84; p = 0.001), serum troponin elevation (OR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.02–1.56; p = 0.03), and respiratory rate increase (OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.0–1.05; p = 0.02) were independent predictors of adverse clinical outcomes.

Conclusion

Among patients with central PE, higher sPESI score, WBC count elevation, serum creatinine elevation, serum troponin elevation, and respiratory rate increase were independent predictors of adverse clinical outcomes. Right ventricular dysfunction on imaging and saddle PE location did not predict adverse outcomes.

### Pulmonary embolism [^114XnYyJ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on pulmonary embolism:

- **Definition**: PE is defined as an occlusion of the pulmonary artery or one of its branches, most often caused by a thrombus originating from deep veins of the lower extremities. The clot blocks blood flow to the pulmonary circulation, leading to impaired oxygen exchange and potentially life-threatening hemodynamic instability.
- **Pathophysiology**: Most pulmonary emboli (70–80%) arise from thrombi in the deep veins of the legs or pelvis, though about 6% originate in the upper extremities. Thrombosis is promoted by Venous stasis, Endothelial injury, and Hypercoagulability-the classic Virchow triad. Risk factors include major surgery, trauma, immobility, cancer, estrogen therapy, pregnancy, and inherited thrombophilias. Hemodynamic compromise results from increased pulmonary vascular resistance, RV overload, reduced LV filling, and decreased cardiac output.
- **Epidemiology**: PE occurs in approximately 60–120 cases per 100,000 people per year, causing an estimated 60,000–100,000 deaths annually in the US. Incidence increases with age, from fewer than 50 per 100,000 in those younger than 50 to about 350 per 100,000 in people older than 75. Widespread use of CT pulmonary angiography has increased diagnosis, including detection of smaller, nonfatal emboli. In-hospital mortality is about 14%, and 90-day mortality approaches 20%.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for PE include immobilization or recent surgery, previous history of DVT or PE, malignancy, and certain genetic conditions. Other factors such as HR > 100 bpm and the presence of hemoptysis can also increase the likelihood of PE according to the Wells' Criteria.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, PE can present with a variety of symptoms including acute dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, tachycardia, and syncope. Some patients may also present with hemoptysis or signs of DVT such as unilateral leg swelling. Severe cases can cause hypotension, right HF, or cardiac arrest. Complications can include RV dysfunction, arrhythmia, hemodynamic collapse, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of PE varies depending on patient's hemodynamic status, underlying disease, and the presence of RV dysfunction. Adverse events within 30 days of PE diagnosis, such as death, secondary cardiogenic shock, or recurrent VTE, occur in approximately 7.4% of patients. Long-term prognosis can be influenced by the cause of the PE, with idiopathic PE associated with a worse long-term survival compared to other causes.

### Venous thrombosis epidemiology, pathophysiology, and anticoagulant therapies and trials in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection [^113J4d4d]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus confers a risk of significant coagulopathy, with the resulting development of venous thromboembolism (VTE), potentially contributing to the morbidity and mortality. The purpose of the present review was to evaluate the potential mechanisms that contribute to this increased risk of coagulopathy and the role of anticoagulants in treatment.

Methods

A literature review of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and/or SARS-CoV-2 and cell-mediated inflammation, clinical coagulation abnormalities, hypercoagulability, pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy, and anticoagulation was performed. The National Clinical Trials database was queried for ongoing studies of anticoagulation and/or antithrombotic treatment or the incidence or prevalence of thrombotic events in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Results

The reported rate of VTE among critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 has been 21% to 69%. The phenomenon of breakthrough VTE, or the acute development of VTE despite adequate chemoprophylaxis or treatment dose anticoagulation, has been shown to occur with severe infection. The pathophysiology of overt hypercoagulability and the development of VTE is likely multifactorial, with evidence supporting the role of significant cell-mediated responses, including neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages, endothelialitis, cytokine release syndrome, and dysregulation of fibrinolysis. Collectively, this inflammatory process contributes to the severe pulmonary pathology experienced by patients with COVID-19. As the infection worsens, extreme D-dimer elevations, significant thrombocytopenia, decreasing fibrinogen, and prolongation of prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time occur, often associated with deep vein thrombosis, in situ pulmonary thrombi, and/or pulmonary embolism. A new phenomenon, termed pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy, has been associated with morbidity in patients with severe infection. Heparin, both unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin, have emerged as agents that can address the viral infection, inflammation, and thrombosis in this syndrome.

Conclusions

The overwhelming inflammatory response in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to a hypercoagulable state, microthrombosis, large vessel thrombosis, and, ultimately, death. Early VTE prophylaxis should be provided to all admitted patients. Therapeutic anticoagulation therapy might be beneficial for critically ill patients and is the focus of 39 ongoing trials. Close monitoring for thrombotic complications is imperative, and, if confirmed, early transition from prophylactic to therapeutic anticoagulation should be instituted. The interplay between inflammation and thrombosis has been shown to be a hallmark of the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection.

### A retrospective study of the clinical characteristics of 9 children with pulmonary embolism associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia [^1116QdZH]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

D-dimer has been proposed as an independent predictor of embolic risk with high sensitivity, and a normal level can exclude the possibility of pulmonary embolism. However, D-dimer has low sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of PE in children. Although the combination of the Wells score and D-dimer is commonly used to predict PE in adults, and the absence of both factors can rule out PE, this approach has not been found to be effective in children. Fibrinogen (FIB) can cause increased blood viscosity, which typically occurs 6–15 days after Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) infection [13]. This corresponds to the time to embolism in children with MPP in a national study. In our study, all nine children had varying degrees of elevated D-dimer values, and seven had elevated fibrinogen (FIB), with a median time to embolism of approximately 2 weeks from the diagnosis of the MPP. This is consistent with the hypercoagulable state caused by FIB and the time to peak D-dimer levels in the body. Moreover, platelet (PLT) adhesion and aggregation are major mechanisms of PE, and the activation of PLT by the body's anti-inflammatory mechanism during MP infection, as well as the elevated PLT count in seven cases in our study, is consistent with the results reported by Li et al, which suggest that excessive PLT activation may also be a risk factor for PE. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are nonspecific markers of inflammation and tissue damage. Studies have shown that high levels of IL-6 and CRP can promote PE. In our study, IL-6 and CRP levels were elevated in all children, respectively. Although elevated levels of IL-6 and CRP can also be caused by various infectious diseases, our study suggests that PE should also be considered in children with these markers.

Acute pulmonary embolism — overuse and harms: Well-validated decision rules have found that the risk for PE in patients who do not meet their criteria for additional testing is very low, and despite a significant increase in diagnoses of PE, mortality has remained unchanged, suggesting that we are overdiagnosing PE that are not clinically significant. Harms of imaging include radiation exposure, contrast-induced nephropathy and contrast allergy, cost, overdiagnosis and resultant overtreatment with anticoagulants, and detection and work-up of incidental findings.

### Pulmonary embolism and pneumonia may be confounded after acute stroke and may co-exist [^117G3gBZ]. Age and Ageing (2002). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism and pneumonia are prevalent complications after acute stroke that overlap significantly in their timing, risk factors and clinical features. Consequently, confounding and co-existence of these diagnoses can occur and is probably commoner than is generally appreciated. Correct identification of pulmonary embolism in these patients is important as the mortality of this condition following stroke is higher than in unselected patients. Clinicians should have a low threshold for suspicion of, and objective testing for, pulmonary embolism in stroke patients with acute cardiorespiratory symptoms, even if an alternative diagnosis is evident.

### Recurrent chronic thromboembolic disease despite optimal anticoagulation in setting of recent COVID-19 infection [^116jNMyj]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

On admission, the patient's main report was of periumbilical abdominal pain and nausea. Given his fever and elevation in white cell count, an abdominal infection was considered. His white cell count resolved spontaneously by day 2 of his hospitalisation. In addition to this, he was without diarrhoea, the Clostridium difficile screen was negative, blood cultures were negative, and CT abdomen and pelvis did not demonstrate an infectious source. Given his recent hospitalisation requiring intubation, we thought that he may be suffering from stress ulcers. We investigated this further, but the patient had no signs of gastrointestinal bleeding. He had a negative faecal occult blood test and had stable haemoglobin values through his hospital course. Another consideration was acute pancreatitis, but this was ruled out due to normal serum amylase, normal serum lipase and normal appearance of the pancreas on CT imaging of the abdomen. Ultimately the patient's abdominal symptoms, fevers and leukocytosis resolved without any intervention. His CT abdomen showed a potential filling defect in the pulmonary artery. The findings changed our course of thinking, and a PE was ruled in as the CTPE study showed a large filling defect within the right main pulmonary artery. Although therapeutically anticoagulated, other causes of venous thromboembolism (VTE) were considered including malignancy, other inflammatory states, obesity and recent immobilisation during hospitalisation. Sequela of the patient's recent COVID-19 infection may have contributed to patient's presentation and initial laboratory findings.

### Leukocytes and systemic inflammatory response syndrome as prognostic factors in pulmonary embolism patients [^113X9GJD]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

The independent variables identified in this study as predictors of mortality within 30 days of hospital admission for PE were: SIRS satisfying the peripheral blood WBC count criterion, altered mental state, shock, and the RV/LV ratio. In patients with PE, WBC count and SIRS satisfying the peripheral WBC count criteria were significantly associated with mortality within 30 days of hospital admission (OR = 1.05, 95% CI, 1.01–1.09; OR = 2.8, 95% CI, 1.5–5.4, respectively) (Tables 2, 3).

Patients with PE initially present with various clinical profiles, ranging from clinically stable to shock status. Moreover, 30-day mortality rates in PE patients with hemodynamic abnormalities have been reported to range from 5% to 58%. The prevalence of shock in our sample was 5.3% (36 cases). The 30-day mortality rate for PE patients presenting with shock was 25%. The RV/LV ratio measured by chest CT indicated potential right ventricular failure, which also reflects the severity of PE. The mean RV/LV ratio observed in the present study was similar to that reported in a previous study. Moreover, the RV/LV ratio was significantly associated with 30-day mortality (OR = 1.7, 95% CI, 1.0–2.8), which is consistent with previous reports that death within 30 days of hospital admission is predictable. However, the levels of N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide were not independently associated with mortality our study. This may be, in part, due to the limitations imposed on data collection, which are inherent to retrospective studies.

### Leukocytes and systemic inflammatory response syndrome as prognostic factors in pulmonary embolism patients [^116bhx7A]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design

This retrospective single center observational cohort study was conducted between January 2005 and December 2011. This study was approved by the institutional review board at Dongsan Hospital, Keimyung University School of Medicine.

Study subjects

A total of 667 PE patients were enrolled at Dongsan Hospital from January 2005 through December 2011. All PE patients treated during the study period were included; no additional selection criteria were used. Subjects were either admitted to the hospital or were Emergency Department or outpatient clinic patients.

Image studies

PE was defined either as a filling defect in the pulmonary artery detected through chest computed tomography (CT) or CT pulmonary angiography, or diagnosed based on a ventilation perfusion scan. DVT diagnosis was confirmed via ultrasound examination of the lower extremity veins in patients with clinically suspected PE.

Study methods

Electronic medical records of all PE patients were examined. Risk factors included renal dysfunction, defined as serum creatinine level > 1.3 mg/dL; active cancer, defined as treatment with an anti-cancer agent within 3 months of PE diagnosis; hospital admission for supportive therapy within 3 months of PE diagnosis; or outpatient use of analgesics for end-stage malignancy. Shock was defined as systolic blood pressure of < 90 mmHg.

CT was performed using a 16 or 64-slice detector. The reconstruction interval of the scan was 3 mm. The ratio of right ventricular diameter to left ventricular diameter (RV/LV ratio) was calculated using CT scan images showing the interventricular septum and myocardium from the longitudinal axis of the heart. A radiologist reviewed all the CT scans in a blind fashion.

Patients were diagnosed with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) if they met 2 or more of the following criteria: peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count of < 4,000/μL or > 12,000/μL, respiratory rate > 20 breaths per min, pulse rate > 90 beats per min, and body temperature of > 38.3°C or < 36.0°C. We retrospectively collected the clinical characteristics and laboratory data on factors such as comorbidity, symptoms, chest CT findings, vital signs, RV/LV ratio, NT Pro-BNP, and complete blood count at the time of diagnosis of PE.

We defined 30-day all-cause mortality as a primary outcome.

### Association between elevated white blood cell counts and thrombotic events in polycythemia vera: analysis from REVEAL [^1114VXfe]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

The association of elevated absolute neutrophil count > 7 × 10⁹ /L with increased TE risk may provide insight into the mechanism underlying the relationship between WBC count and TE risk. Elevations in absolute neutrophil count and WBC count have been shown by previous studies to approximately correlate with JAK2 p.V617F mutant allele burden. Furthermore, the presence of a somatic JAK2 mutation is known to be positively associated with risk of venous TEs and leukocytosis in the general population. An association between JAK2 p.V617F allele burden and TE risk has also been implicated in prior studies, and the present data from REVEAL provide additional indirect evidence to support this notion.

Additional explanations for the role of leukocytosis in thrombogenesis have been provided in the literature. Activated WBCs have an established role in regulating the coagulation cascade by expressing coagulation and fibrinolytic factors, as well as producing cytokines and other proteins that modulate normal hemostasis, including platelet and endothelial physiology. Under pathologic conditions in which elevated blood counts exist, increased levels of cytokines create a proinflammatory environment, stimulating coagulation and promoting thrombosis. Therefore, maintaining WBC counts within a normal range (between 4.0 × 10⁹/L and ≤ 11.0 × 10⁹/L) may be an independent and critical consideration for PV risk stratification and management. However, the observed association between elevated WBC counts and TE risk does not prove the therapeutic efficacy of maintaining WBC counts below a certain threshold.

A community teaching hospital with 750 beds, which acts as a tertiary referral center for several subspecialties.

Patients and Interventions

Patients with pleural effusions secondary to pulmonary embolism who underwent diagnostic thoracentesis during the last 7 years were retrospectively studied. Pleural fluid mesothelial hyperplasia was revised and compared with that found in patients with pleural effusions of different origin.

Results

Pleural effusions from all 60 patients with pulmonary embolism were exudates, and in 40 patients (67%) contained erythrocyte counts > 10,000/microL. A bloody appearance was not related to the use of anticoagulant therapy before thoracentesis. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes were predominant in 36 patients (60%); in 11 patients (18%), a proportion of eosinophils > 10% was found. Mesothelial hyperplasia was significantly higher in patients with pulmonary embolism than in patients in the control group (p < 0.01).

Conclusions

In the absence of trauma, a bloody or eosinophilic effusion with a marked mesothelial hyperplasia should prompt a workup to rule out embolism. The finding of transudative pleural fluid chemistries in these patients should not be assumed to be secondary to embolism before ruling out other causes of transudative effusion.

Supplementary and sensitivity analyses

(1) To reduce potential concerns regarding reverse causality, we performed a sensitivity analysis using different lag time (1-year, 3-year, and 5-year) before initiating follow-up after blood collection. (2) As previous studies have suggested a role of JAK2 in the pathogenesis of embolism and thrombosis, we further conducted stratified analysis by JAK2 mutation. (3) We also performed an additional analysis by the VAF of CHIP mutation (VAF < 0.1 or VAF ≥ 0.1) to determine whether the size of CHIP clone could influence the investigated association. (4) As some types of CVD have been suggested to be linked with both CHIP and pulmonary embolism, we conducted a sensitivity analysis stratified by pre-existing CVD. (5) As cancer status was associated with both CHIP and pulmonary embolism, to explore the effect of cancer on the studied association, we performed an additional analysis stratified by cancer (as time-varying variable). (6) To explore the impact of counts of blood cells on the observed association, we performed additional analyses by further adjusting for blood counts, including count of white blood cell, concentration of hemoglobin, or count of platelet, as natural cubic spline. (7) To investigate the robustness of time since cohort entry as the analytical time scale, we conducted a sensitivity analysis using age as the underlying time scale. (8) To account for the competing risk of death, we performed a sensitivity analysis using Fine–gray model to calculate the sub-distribution hazard ratio (sHR).

The analyses were executed using SAS software (Version 9.4, SAS institute Inc). Wald test was used to test differences between the HRs of different groups. The significance level was determined using two-sided tests, with results considered statistically significant at a threshold of P < 0.05.

Fig. 1
CXR showed patchy consolidation with an internal air bronchogram at the right lung

Laboratory studies showed no leukocytosis (white blood cell count: 6.07 × 10⁹ /L), and the white blood cell differential count showed 82.6% neutrophils and 14.5% lymphocytes. There were elevated blood levels for C-reactive protein (206.2 mg/L) and procalcitonin (17 ng/mL). Moreover, multiple clinical indexes exceeded the normal range, including alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatinine. Other laboratory results and trends are shown in Table 1. A nasopharyngeal swab sample tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time PCR was negative, but his serology tested positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid. Serum troponin T and troponin-I levels and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were elevated, indicating cardiac ischemia or injury.

Table 1
Summary of laboratory results of the patient with MIS-C

A diagnosis of MIS-C was made based on the above clinical features and paraclinical testing results. The patient remained hemodynamically unstable with features of shock and cardiac failure. Gentle fluid boluses with 0.9%NSS 10 ml/kg, broad-spectrum antibiotic (meropenem), norepinephrine (0.1 mcg/kg/min), and epinephrine (0.05 mcg/kg/min) were given.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG; 1 g/kg/day) and methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg/day) were started. A chest computed tomography (CT) was performed which showed consolidation and ground-glass opacities of the right lung without evidence of pulmonary embolism (Fig. 2). Flexible bronchoscopy was performed and showed serous secretion with normal airway mucosa. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained. BALF cell populations were total of WBC 486 cells/mm³ (mononuclear cells 12%, neutrophils 88%), RBC 600 cells/mm³, and no bacterial growth in BALF's culture.

### Analysis of clinical characteristics of severe pertussis in infants and children: a retrospective study [^1147FiE1]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia is the most common complication of pertussis. In this study, more than 80% of hospitalized infants with pertussis also had pneumonia. Some infants had fever, with increased neutrophils, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin levels, suggesting the presence of other bacterial infections. All severe cases had severe pneumonia, and all of them required some form of respiratory support. In this way, pneumonia is not only the most common complication of pertussis but also the leading cause of severe disease and death from pertussis.

Increased white blood cell count is a characteristic manifestation of pertussis. The white blood cell count of children in the severe cases was significantly higher than that of the mild cases, and the white blood cell count was particularly high in fatal cases. Due to the poor ability of white blood cells to change shape, they tend to obstruct stenosed alveolar capillary beds. White blood cells usually take 10–15 times longer than erythrocytes to pass through these vessels, resulting in embolism due to leukocyte clumps, causing hypoxemia and pulmonary hypertension. This affects cardiac function and causes heart failure in severe cases. Severe hyperleukocytosis (> 50 × 10⁹ leukocytes/L) is an independent risk factor for malignant pertussis (life-threatening severe pertussis). Many studies have indicated that when routine treatment was given even though the peripheral leukocyte count was > 100 × 10⁹ /L in pertussis patients, and no measures to lower leukocyte counts were carried out, death resulted in all cases. In this study, there were 4 infants the in the severe group whose white blood cell counts were > 50×10⁹/L, of whom 3 died. Studies have shown that plasma exchange and leukapheresis can reduce leukocyte count and significantly improve fatal hypoxemia and pulmonary hypertension.

### Higher WBC count associated with increased cancer risk… [^115zJYgv]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Participants were contacted semiannually or annually to determine whether they had recently been diagnosed with a new cancer. Relevant clinical reports, discharge summaries, and death certificates were cross-checked by blinded evaluators to verify the patient self-reported information. The study focused on cancers with an annualized incidence of 0. 1 percent or higher, namely invasive breast, colorectal, endometrial, and lung cancers. Results: The analysis included 143, 748 post-menopausal women 50 to 79 years of age, with 55 percent of participants belonging to the observational study arm. There were 4, 639 cases of invasive breast cancer, 1, 341 cases of colorectal cancer, 766 cases of endometrial cancer, and 1, 237 cases of lung cancer developed during the study. After adjusting for age and potential confounders, women in the highest quartile of WBC count had significantly greater risks of developing invasive breast cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, and lung cancer than those in the lowest WBC quartile. When cancers diagnosed within the first two years of the study were excluded, similar trends were observed. Overall cancer mortality was also positively correlated with increasing WBC quartile. Breast cancer among those in the highest WBC quartile was associated with a greater than twofold higher mortality rate, and lung cancer had a threefold greater mortality rate in this group. No significant associations between WBC quartiles and mortality were noted when colorectal or endometrial cancers were examined individually.

Conclusion: Higher WBC counts are associated with higher risks of invasive breast, colorectal, endometrial, and lung cancers among postmenopausal women, as well as a greater risk of lung, breast, and overall cancer mortality. Although the WHI study is a large-scale prospective study, the authors caution that further studies of this association using multiple WBC measurements might be useful before this can be applied clinically.

### Rare cause of repeated pulmonary embolism: a case of primary pleural squamous cell carcinoma and literature review [^117FuVHA]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

In June 2017, a 49-year-old Chinese woman was admitted to the emergency department of the Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital owing to chest tightness and breathing difficulty that persisted for 3 days. She was previously in good health and was a non-smoker. In addition, she had fever, chills, and a maximum body temperature of 38 °C. She did not have urinary or fecal incontinence, chest pain, general fatigue, cough, or hemoptysis during the course of her disease. Following admission, results of complete blood test revealed that white blood cell count was 12.21 × 10⁹ cells/L and the percentage of large white blood cells was 85.5%. Blood gas analysis results showed 7.480 PH, 100 mmHg PaO₂, 31 mmHg PaCO₂, and 23.1 mmol/L HCO₃⁻. D-dimer assay indicated a value of 5.28 mg/L. A computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) revealed filling defects in the main pulmonary artery, upper and lower pulmonary artery branch (Fig. 1). There were no distinct signs of embolism in color ultrasonography examination of the upper and lower limbs. The patient was diagnosed with PE, and was treated with anticoagulation, antiplatelet aggregation, and anti-infection medications. During the 18 h after admission, the patient experienced worsening shortness of breath and anoxia and was subsequently transferred to the Emergency Intensive Care Unit (EICU) for non-invasive ventilator assisted ventilation. Additionally, the patient was intravenously administered alteplase once every 12 h for 3 consecutive days and 5000 units subcutaneous unfractionated heparin. Warfarin (5 mg) was orally administered once a day. On noting that the prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) were 2–2.5 times their respective normal levels, warfarin therapy was singly administered along with anti-infective, supportive, and oxygen therapies. Once her condition had considerably improved and the anoxia was reduced, she was discharged from the hospital.

Patients and study design

This retrospective, monocentric study included a COVID-19 pneumonia group and a non-COVID-19 pneumonia group. This study was approved by our institutional review board. Patients were informed by letter and were offered the possibility not to participate. It followed the ethical guidelines of the declaration of Helsinki.

We identified eligible patients by searching the radiological information system (Xplore, EDL, France) between March and May 2020 for the COVID-19 group and between January 2017 and September 2019 for the non-COVID-19 group.

Patients were included according to the following inclusion criteria:
in the COVID-19 group: patients over 18 years of age admitted for acute COVID-19 pneumonia and who underwent DE-CTPA at baseline or during hospitalization for suspected PE, defined by suggestive clinical symptoms: respiratory distress, tachycardia, syncope or respiratory worsening diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay
in the non-COVID-19 group: patients over 18 years of age DE-CTPA done for suspected PE diagnosis of pneumonia on the chest CT report, clinical and biological findings consistent with pulmonary infection (fever, cough, high white blood cell count and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) levels), no evidence for an alternative diagnosis and use of an anti-infective therapy when appropriate (all of the above)

Exclusion criteria for both groups were: CTPA positive for PE, extensive emphysematous changes preventing accurate pulmonary perfusion evaluation.

### Association between elevated white blood cell counts and thrombotic events in polycythemia vera: analysis from REVEAL [^117RigRd]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Polycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by clonal proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells and is associated with an increased risk of thrombotic events (TEs). Established risk factors for TEs in patients with PV include advanced age, TE history, and elevated hematocrit. Although an association of TE with elevated white blood cell (WBC) counts has been suggested by retrospective studies, this relationship needs further validation. The prospective observational study of patients with polycythemia vera in US clinical practices (REVEAL) study collected prospective clinical data from 2510 patients with PV with a median follow-up of 44.7 months (range, 2–59 months) from enrollment. Using time-dependent covariate Cox proportional hazards models, blood counts were individually modeled with sex, age, disease duration, TE history at enrollment (baseline covariates), and treatment (time-dependent covariate). Analysis of 2271 participants identified 142 TEs in 106 patients. Significant associations with initial TE occurrence during the study period were observed for hematocrit level > 45% (hazard ratio [HR], 1.84; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.234–2.749; P = 0.0028) and WBCs > 11 × 10⁹/L (HR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.598–3.465; P < .0001). Elevated WBC count was significantly associated with initial TE occurrence in both low-risk and high-risk PV. When hematocrit was controlled at ≤ 45%, WBC count > 12 × 10⁹/L was significantly associated with TE occurrence (HR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.066–3.554; P = 0.0300). The results support incorporation of WBC count into PV risk stratification and studies of treatment strategies, and indicate the importance of controlling both hematocrit and WBC count in disease management. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02252159.

### Perioperative pulmonary circulatory changes during bilateral total hip arthroplasty under regional anesthesia [^113udn7a]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

The transient and rarely clinically relevant effect of bone and cement embolization during unilateral joint arthroplasty is a known phenomenon. However, available studies do not address events surrounding bilateral total hip arthroplasties, during which embolic load is presumably doubled. To elucidate events surrounding this increasingly used procedure and assess the effect on the pulmonary hemodynamics in the intraoperative and postoperative periods, we studied 24 subjects undergoing cemented bilateral total hip arthroplasty during the same anesthetic session.

Materials

Twenty-four patients without previous pulmonary history undergoing cemented bilateral total hip arthroplasty under controlled epidural hypotension were enrolled. Pulmonary artery catheters were inserted and hemodynamic variables were recorded at baseline, 5 mins after the implantation of each hip joint, 1 hr and 1 day after surgery. Mixed venous blood gases and complete blood counts were analyzed at every time point.

Results

An increase in pulmonary vascular resistance was observed after the second but not the first hip implantation when compared with values at incision. Pulmonary vascular resistance remained elevated 1 hr after surgery. Pulmonary artery pressures were significantly elevated on postoperative day 1 compared with those at baseline. The white blood cell count increased in response to the second hip implantation but not the first compared with incision.

Conclusions

The embolization of material during bilateral total hip arthroplasty is associated with prolonged increases in pulmonary artery pressures and vascular resistance, particularly after completion of the second side. Performance of bilateral procedures should be cautiously considered in patients with diseases suggesting decreased right ventricular reserve.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^113QSdZR]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Wrong diagnosis

In one study conducted in the ICU, 19% of patients admitted with a diagnosis of pneumonia were ultimately diagnosed with non-infectious conditions. There are several non-infectious conditions that can mimic nonresponding or worsening severe pneumonia such as heart failure, neoplasms, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, acute interstitial pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, pulmonary embolism, vasculitis, and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (Fig. 2). Another frequently overlooked diagnosis is drug induced fever. The list of antibiotics associated with drug induced fever is long and this diagnosis should be suspected particularly in the presence of eosinophilia. Diagnostic uncertainty is highest when non-pulmonary conditions overlap with pulmonary inflammation.

### Predictive value of elevated white blood cell count in patients with preexisting coronary heart disease… [^114GCB4f]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

For every 1000/µL increase in WBC count, risk of total death increased by 6%. Conclusions Elevated WBC count in patients with CHD was associated with higher long-term risk of all-cause mortality. This excess risk of mortality was not due to cardiac causes. In univariate analysis, WBC count was significantly associated with total death, cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and the combined end point of sudden death and myocardial infarction, but not with sudden cardiac death. Other univariate predictors are given in Table 1. Increase in WBC count was associated with an increased age-adjusted risk of myocardial infarction, cardiac death, and total death, but not sudden cardiac death. After multivariate adjustment, WBC count was associated only with increased risk of total death.

The incidence rate of myocardial infarction during follow-up was significantly higher in patients with a higher WBC count at baseline. Both the unadjusted and the age-adjusted relative risk of myocardial infarction were significantly higher among patients in the highest WBC tertile compared with those in the lowest tertile. Rate of death from cardiac causes was significantly higher in the highest WBC tertile compared with the lowest. However, adjustment for multiple confounders eliminated this association. Total death rate increased from 8% in the lowest WBC count tertile to 14% in the highest WBC tertile. The corresponding unadjusted and age-adjusted relative risks increased in a graded manner in the patients in the second and third WBC tertiles compared with patients in the lowest tertile.

In the present study of patients with CHD in stable condition, a single baseline measurement of elevated WBC count was associated with increased long-term all-cause mortality risk. This finding was not due to an increased risk of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or sudden cardiac death, which were not influenced by the WBC count at baseline. The univariate association with the incidence of myocardial infarction and cardiac death, observed before adjustment, was eliminated after adjustment for baseline cardiovascular confounders.

### Immune factors in deep vein thrombosis initiation [^112f74JR]. Trends in Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

DVT: A Global Health Problem

DVT and its major complication, pulmonary embolism (PE), designated together as venous thromboembolism (VTE), are one of the leading causes of disability and death worldwide. VTE is the third most common cardiovascular pathology by its prevalence after myocardial infarction and stroke, with about 900 000 cases and 300 000 deaths in the US annually. Surprisingly, the prevalence and mortality of VTE has not substantially decreased over 30 years despite progress in diagnostic and prophylactic modalities. DVT develops in deep veins, usually, but not exclusively, in legs, causing pain, redness, swelling, and impaired gait. If the thrombus is unstable, it can become detached and travel to the lungs, where it occludes pulmonary circulation causing PE. In contrast to arterial thrombosis, whose mechanisms have been intensively investigated, DVT remains largely terra incognita, which inspired the American Surgeon General to issue a Call to Action to stimulate research of venous thrombosis.

### Evaluation of systemic immune-inflammation index in acute deep vein thrombosis: a propensity-matched [^1121ePQK]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) progressing to pulmonary embolism is an important cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. At present, color Doppler ultrasound is the most effective examination method for the diagnosis of DVT. The systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) has been introduced as a new indicator of comprehensive systemic immune thrombosis and inflammatory status in the body. We believe that the SII might be more specific and sensitive than the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR). In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the predictive potential of the SII, NLR, and PLR in the diagnosis of DVT.

Methods

The data of patients aged > 18 years who were diagnosed with acute DVT in our hospital between June 2017 and June 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. During the study period, the data of 155 patients with acute DVT and 179 healthy control patients without DVT were included in the study. A propensity score analysis (1:1) was performed to eliminate differences between the two groups, and 63 patients from each group were included in the present study.

Results

When the complete blood count parameters were examined between the patients with acute DVT and the control group, the hemoglobin, hematocrit, lymphocyte count, and platelet distribution width were lower in the DVT group. In contrast, the white blood cell count, neutrophil count, platelet count, NLR, PLR, SII, and mean platelet volume were higher in the DVT group. The changes in hemoglobin (P = 0.001), hematocrit (P = 0.001), white blood cell count (P = 0.001), neutrophil count (P = 0.001), lymphocyte count (P = 0.001), platelet count (P = 0.001), NLR (P = 0.001), PLR (P = 0.001), SII (P = 0.001), and mean platelet volume (P = 0.031) were significant on statistical analysis. However, the changes in the platelet distribution width were not significant (P = 0.794). The area under the curve for the NLR and PLR was 0.797 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.747–0.848; P < .001) and 0.788 (95% CI, 0.737–0.840; P = 0.01), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for an NLR > 3.00 was 71.0% and 68.7%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for a PLR > 142.66 was 70.3% and 68.5%, respectively. The area under the curve for SII was 0.861 (95% CI, 0.820–0.902; P < .001), with a sensitivity of 78.1% and specificity of 73.1% for an SII > 755.54.

Conclusions

The SII can be used as an auxiliary diagnostic test for patients with venous thrombosis. This parameter is superior to the NLR and PLR with high sensitivity and specificity for patients with venous thrombosis.

To evaluate whether sustained laboratory value elevations were associated with TE occurrence, Cox proportional hazards modeling, similar to that described earlier, was used. For a TE observed within the first year of the study, a sustained laboratory value elevation was determined to have occurred if the laboratory value was elevated for > 60% of the time from enrollment to TE occurrence. For a TE observed after the first year of the study, a sustained elevation was determined to have occurred if the laboratory value was elevated for > 60% of the time in the year preceding the TE occurrence.

HRs and P values were calculated from the Cox proportional hazards model; statistical significance was assessed at P < .05. Association data are presented as HR (95% confidence intervals).

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^114honJt]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — PERC performance and D-dimer cutoffs: The PERC are not a screening tool for all patients and should be applied only to very low–risk patients in whom PE is genuinely suspected, and when used in this manner the PERC should decrease the use of d-dimer testing only in patients who would have otherwise been tested. A meta-analysis of 12 studies found the overall proportion of missed PEs by using PERC was 0.3% (46 of 14 844 total cases), the pooled sensitivity was 97% (95% CI, 96% to 98%), and the pooled specificity was 22%, indicating that 22% of d-dimer tests could have been safely avoided had the PERC been universally applied. To date, most recommendations have considered any value above 499 ng/mL as elevated, and a meta-analysis of 13 studies and 12 497 patients without high pretest probability found that using age-adjusted D-dimer cutoffs for patients older than 50 years (age × 10 ng/mL) maintained a sensitivity for PE above 97% while significantly increasing specificity.

In each of these separate models, advanced age (by year) and a history of TE were significantly associated with increased TE occurrence (P < .01), whereas male sex was significantly associated with decreased TE occurrence (P < .02; Figure 2 A; supplemental Figure 2 A). Disease duration and treatment (including HU vs none, or other vs none) were not found to be associated with TE occurrence (P > .05; Figure 2 A; supplemental Figure 2 A).

The association of TEs with isolated laboratory values may be confounded by factors such as infection or interventions that may transiently alter blood counts. To address this, a second analysis was performed to assess whether TEs were associated with sustained elevated blood counts. A significant association with TE occurrence was observed for sustained hematocrit level > 45%, WBC count > 11 × 10⁹ /L, and absolute neutrophil count > 7 × 10⁹ /L (P < .05); however, sustained platelet count elevation > 400 × 10⁹ /L was not significantly associated with increased TE occurrence (P > .05; Figure 2 B; supplemental Figure 2 B). In addition, advanced age and history of TEs were again identified as significantly associated with increased TE occurrence (P < .01; Figure 2 B; supplemental Figure 2 B); male sex was identified as significantly associated with decreased TE occurrence (P < .01; Figure 2 B; supplemental Figure 2 B).

These data from REVEAL validate the previously identified variables of hematocrit level > 45%, increased age, and history of TE as risk factors for TE in patients with PV. Furthermore, the data implicate WBC count > 11 × 10 9 /L and female sex as additional risk factors for TE.

Table 1
Baseline clinical and laboratory test results for all patients

The symptoms and investigations for all patients are reported in Table 1. In 2020, only 2.7% (4/143) had a documented fever, and less than 5% of patients reported viral prodromal symptoms including headache (0/146), myalgia/ arthralgia (7/146), lethargy (6/146), sore throat (4/146) and loss of taste (0/146). Chest pain was universally reported (100.0%, n = 146/146), and shortness of breath (61.0%, n = 89/146) and/or productive cough (11.6%, n = 17/146) were common. A dry cough was reported by 21.2% (n = 31/146). Clinical observations, including heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, blood pressure and oxygen saturations were within normal range. Lymphocyte counts were normal [lymphocytes 1.76 × 10 9 ± 1.07 (n = 145/146)], whilst D‐Dimer and CRP values were slightly elevated 409.0 ng mL −1 (276.0–826.0, n = 129/146) and 6.7 mg L −1 (5.0–36.0, n = 111/146), respectively].

In 2020, 131/146 patients (89.7%) had a baseline CXR, and of these, 15.9% (n = 21/132) were abnormal, including lobar pneumonia in 7/22, small effusions in 5/22, other diagnoses in 2/22 and parenchymal changes in 7/22. Findings on CXR from 2019 were similar, with equivalent numbers of patients having abnormal baseline CXRs each year (P = 0.155). CXR findings were generally minor with the physicians progressing to CTPA on the basis the CXR did not adequately explain the clinical picture.

Table 2 shows the signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings of all patients, and there were no significant differences in symptoms between the two groups. Patients who survived to hospital discharge had a lower pulse rate than those who did not (80.1 ± 14.9 breaths/minute, P = 0.049). Compared with survivors, non-survivors were more likely to have a lower PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio (202 versus [vs.] 318.1, P < 0.001), higher D-dimer (1140 vs. 816.2 ng/mL, P = 0.002), higher LDH level (269 vs. 196 U/L, P < 0.001), higher cTNI level (0.05 vs. 0.01 ng/mL, P = 0.021), and higher white blood cell (WBC) count (9.3 vs. 6.5 × 10⁹ /L, P < 0.001).

Severity and outcome of patients

Table 3 shows the severity and outcome of the 368 patients, there are 337survivors and 31 non-survivors in this study, the in-hospital mortality is 8.4%(31/368). 345(314 survivors vs 31 non-survivors) patients provided data on the sPESI score, RVD, serum troponin and hemodynamic state for risk stratification according to the 2014 ESC guideline. There are 25 patients with unstable hemodynamic state belonged to the high risk group. Among haemodynamically stable patients (320 patients), sPESI 0 was found in 193 patients (60.3%) and sPESI ≥ 1 in 127 patients (39.7%). The poportion belonged to the high risk patients of the non-survivors is 35.5%(11/31). The in-hospital mortality for high-risk patients is 44%(11/25). There was a significant difference between survivors and non-survivors in risk stratification (P < 0.001) and length of hospital stay (17 vs. 10 days, P = 0.011).

### Prognostic role of the preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin for 30-day mortality in patients with postoperative acute pulmonary embolism [^116c976M]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This retrospective study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and albumin for 30-day mortality in patients with postoperative acute pulmonary embolism (PAPE).

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 101 patients with PAPE admitted from September 1, 2012, to March 31, 2019. The characteristics, surgical information, admission examination data and mortality within 30days after PAPE were obtained from our electronic medical recording system and follow-up. The associations between the NLR, PLR, and other predictors and 30-day mortality were analyzed with univariate and multivariate analyses. Then, the nomogram including the independent predictors was established and evaluated.

Results

Twenty-four patients died within 30days, corresponding to a 30-day mortality rate of 23.8%. The results of the multivariate analysis indicated that both the NLR and albumin were independent predictors for 30-day mortality in patients with PAPE. The probability of death increased by approximately 17.1% (OR = 1.171, 95% CI: 1.073–1.277, P = 0.000) with a one-unit increase in the NLR, and the probability of death decreased by approximately 15.4% (OR = 0.846, 95% CI: 0.762c-0.939, P = 0.002) with a one-unit increase in albumin. The area under the curve of the nomogram was 0.888 (95% CI: 0.812–0.964).

Conclusion

Our findings showed that an elevated NLR and decreased albumin were related to poor prognosis in patients with PAPE. The NLR and albumin were independent prognostic factors for PAPE.
