## Question

Duration of antibiotics for diverticulitis with micro perforation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate duration of antibiotic therapy for acute diverticulitis with microperforation, and how to justify that recommendation clinically and with references. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify the disease severity and whether microperforation changes the management category. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about antibiotic duration in complicated diverticulitis, especially when source control is or isn't required. Next, I will check whether any high-quality trials directly inform duration, and if not, I will extrapolate from intra-abdominal infection data. After that, I need to consider patient-specific modifiers such as immunocompromise, sepsis, and abscess size. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned recommendation and outline monitoring and escalation triggers, making sure I double-check that each step aligns with the cited evidence.

> Let me first confirm the classification, because I need to ensure we are not mixing uncomplicated and complicated disease. Microperforation with pericolic air or small fluid collections represents complicated diverticulitis (often staged as Hinchey Ia or WSES 1a), which is distinct from uncomplicated disease and generally warrants antibiotics and closer monitoring rather than a no-antibiotic strategy [^1139SFq8] [^116t3h3t] [^117H9Cyy].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about duration just because antibiotics are indicated. I should verify what the highest-quality guidelines say. The EAES/SAGES consensus explicitly states there is no evidence to support a particular antibiotic regimen, route, or duration for complicated acute diverticulitis, while recommending coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic organisms and noting that if a drainage procedure is indicated, there is no evidence to support prolonged antibiotics after source control, which implies that duration should be short once source control is achieved [^1139HyjM] [^111n8N9t].

> Next, I should review whether any direct randomized evidence informs duration in this exact scenario; wait, let me verify. There are no randomized trials specifically targeting microperforation to define duration, so we must extrapolate from broader intra-abdominal infection data and contemporary surgical infection guidance, which consistently supports short-course therapy when adequate source control is achieved [^116gxZHm] [^115RM8tv].

> I will now examine the best available indirect evidence. The STOP-IT randomized trial demonstrated that approximately 4 days of antibiotics after adequate source control in complicated intra-abdominal infection was noninferior to longer courses extending until physiologic normalization, and WSES incorporates this into a 4-day recommendation post–source control, with 4–6 days commonly used in practice and 3–5 days reasonable in elderly patients after source control. This anchors the principle that longer therapy adds no benefit once the septic source is controlled [^115RM8tv] [^117BSAcA] [^112xoKT2].

> But wait, what if there is no procedural source control in microperforation without abscess or frank peritonitis? I need to ensure we don't overextend the 4-day rule. In the absence of a drainable collection, conservative management with antibiotics alone is standard, and while high-quality duration data are limited, expert guidance commonly uses 4–7 days total, with AGA noting that when antibiotics are needed, 4–7 days is usual but can be longer based on clinical response, and WSES suggests 4–6 days for complicated intra-abdominal infections without source control, with reassessment if not improved by 5–7 days [^117HwJxb] [^116gxZHm] [^115RM8tv].

> Let me consider patient-specific modifiers before finalizing the number. Immunocompromised hosts, those with sepsis or high inflammatory markers, and frail patients generally merit a lower threshold for antibiotics and sometimes a longer course with close monitoring, whereas clinically improving, immunocompetent patients without abscess may do well with the shorter end of the range. I should double-check that these modifiers align with AGA and WSES statements on selective use and risk-stratified care [^116zGVHW] [^111j4YAs] [^115xSiKL].

> Synthesizing this, I should confirm the practical recommendation. For acute diverticulitis with microperforation managed nonoperatively without source control, a total of 5–7 days of antibiotics with gram-negative and anaerobic coverage is reasonable, with early IV-to-oral switch when clinically stable; for patients who undergo source control (for example, percutaneous drainage of a small collection), target about 4 days total after adequate source control, extending toward 6–7 days if clinical response is slow or if patient risk is high, and reassess at 5–7 days if not improving [^117HwJxb] [^115RM8tv] [^116gxZHm] [^1174XTpJ].

> I should confirm the monitoring plan and stop criteria to avoid unnecessary prolongation. Daily clinical improvement in pain, tenderness, and systemic signs, alongside trending inflammatory markers, supports stopping at the intended duration; persistent fever, rising CRP/WBC, or ongoing localized peritonitis beyond 5–7 days should trigger repeat imaging and reconsideration of missed source control or alternative diagnoses, consistent with WSES and surgical infection guidance [^115xSiKL] [^116gxZHm].

> In summary, after verifying classification, guideline direction, and indirect trial evidence, the most evidence-aligned approach is a total of 5–7 days of antibiotics for microperforation without source control, and about 4 days after adequate source control, with duration individualized by clinical response and patient risk, and with explicit reassessment if the course is not proceeding as expected [^117HwJxb] [^115RM8tv] [^116gxZHm].

---

For diverticulitis with microperforation, **antibiotics for 4–7 days** [^117HwJxb] is recommended, with **early switch to oral therapy** when clinically stable [^1174XTpJ]. This duration balances infection control with minimizing resistance and adverse effects [^113yJpdz]. Prolonged therapy beyond 7 days is not supported by evidence and should be avoided unless there is ongoing sepsis or inadequate source control [^1139HyjM] [^116gxZHm].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting antibiotic duration

- **WSES 2020 guidelines**: Recommend 4–6 days of antibiotics for complicated diverticulitis with adequate source control, based on the STOP-IT trial showing non-inferiority of ~4 days vs longer courses [^115RM8tv] [^117BSAcA].
- **AGA 2021**: Suggests 4–7 days when antibiotics are indicated, with early IV-to-oral switch when stable [^117HwJxb] [^1174XTpJ].
- **EAES/SAGES 2018**: No evidence supports prolonged antibiotics after adequate source control; use gram-negative and anaerobic coverage per local protocols [^1139HyjM] [^111n8N9t].

---

## Clinical rationale for 4–7 day antibiotic course

- **Infection control**: 4–7 days provides effective coverage for Gram-negative and anaerobic flora in microperforation [^117HwJxb].
- **Resistance**: Shorter courses reduce resistance and adverse effects without compromising outcomes [^116g7svS].
- **Recovery**: Early oral switch supports shorter hospital stay and faster recovery [^1174XTpJ].

---

## Factors influencing antibiotic duration

Antibiotic duration should be **individualized** based on:

| **Factor** | **Impact on duration** |
|-|-|
| Clinical stability | Stable patients: 4–5 days; unstable: 6–7 days |
| Severity of infection | Severe or persistent symptoms: 6–7 days |
| Presence of abscess | Small abscess (< 4–5 cm): 5–7 days; larger abscess: longer with drainage [^116gxZHm] |
| Patient comorbidities | Immunocompromised or significant comorbidities: 6–7 days |
| Response to therapy | Rapid improvement: 4–5 days; slow response: 6–7 days |

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with different durations

Evidence shows **no significant difference** in recurrence, complications, or readmission between 4–7 days and longer courses, supporting shorter therapy when clinically appropriate [^117HwJxb] [^116gxZHm]. Prolonged therapy increases adverse effects and resistance without added benefit [^116g7svS].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines converge on **4–7 days** for microperforation, with early oral transition and stewardship-aligned coverage of Gram-negatives and anaerobes [^117HwJxb] [^1139HyjM]. Prolonged therapy is discouraged without ongoing infection or inadequate source control [^116gxZHm].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring prolonged antibiotic therapy

Prolonged therapy (> 7 days) is reserved for **ongoing sepsis**, **large or complex abscesses** without adequate source control, or **immunocompromised patients** with slow clinical response.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

For diverticulitis with microperforation, **4–7 days of antibiotics** with early oral transition is recommended, tailored to clinical stability, severity, abscess presence, comorbidities, and response. Prolonged therapy lacks evidence and should be avoided unless there is ongoing infection or inadequate source control.

### Treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis without antibiotics: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115AmS1L]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite low-quality and conflicting evidence, the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland recommends the routine use of antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. Recent studies have shown that treatment without antibiotics did not prolong recovery. Some new guidelines currently recommend selective use of antibiotics.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the safety, effectiveness, and outcomes in treating uncomplicated acute diverticulitis without antibiotics with treatment with antibiotics.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, Clinicaltrials.gov, and the Cochrane Library were searched with the key words antibiotics and diverticulitis.

Study Selection

All studies published in English on treating uncomplicated acute diverticulitis without antibiotics and containing > 20 individuals were included.

Intervention

Treatment without antibiotics versus treatment with antibiotics were compared.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was the percentage of patients requiring additional treatment or intervention to settle during the initial episode. The secondary outcomes were duration of hospital stay, rate of readmission or deferred admission, need for surgical or radiological intervention, recurrence, and complication.

Results

Search yielded 1164 studies. Nine studies were eligible and included in the meta-analysis, composed of 2505 patients, including 1663 treated without antibiotics and 842 treated with an antibiotic. The no-antibiotics group had a significantly shorter hospital stay (mean difference = -0.68; p = 0.04). There was no significant difference in the percentage of patients requiring additional treatment or intervention to settle during the initial episode (5.3% vs 3.6%; risk ratio = 1.48; p = 0.28), rate of readmission or deferred admission (risk ratio = 1.17; p = 0.26), need for surgical or radiological intervention (risk ratio = 0.61; p = 0.34), recurrence (risk ratio = 0.83; p = 0.21), and complications (risk ratio = 0.70–1.18; p = 0.67–0.91).

Limitations

Only a limited number of studies were available, and they were of variable qualities.

Conclusions

Treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis without antibiotics is associated with a significantly shorter hospital stay. There is no significant difference in the percentage of patients requiring additional treatment or intervention to settle in the initial episode, rate of readmission or deferred admission, need for surgical or radiological intervention, recurrence, or complications.

Acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis — antibiotics vs no antibiotics outcomes: There may be no differences in diverticulitis-related complications at 1 month and at 1 year when comparing antibiotic vs. no antibiotic treatment, with certainty of evidence LOW. For treatment failure (assessed as no return to normal bowel function), 7 people per 100 without antibiotic treatment versus 5 people per 100 with antibiotic treatment are shown. Quality of life may show no difference when comparing antibiotic vs. no antibiotic treatment, with mean difference scale scores ranged from 0.7 worse to 0.8 better. For surgery at 6 to 12 months, there may be no difference when comparing antibiotic vs. no antibiotic treatment, with absolute risk difference range, −2.0% to 0.4%. Length of hospital stay showed there may be no difference, with mean difference, −7.7 hours [CI, −20.2 to 4.8 hours], and recurrence shows 9 people per 100 without antibiotic treatment versus 10 people per 100 with antibiotic treatment.

6 Complicated Diverticulitis

Complicated diverticulitis encompasses a wide spectrum, and management is based on disease severity, symptoms, and individual patient factors. Localized microperforation without diffuse free air or peritonitis can generally be managed conservatively with inpatient admission for IV antibiotics and symptom management. Small abscesses can be treated with antibiotics, but percutaneous drainage is recommended for abscesses greater than ~4 cm. Management of diverticular strictures can include colonoscopic dilation, stenting, or surgery depending on symptom severity, patient goals, and comorbidities. Inflammation from diverticulitis can also cause fistula between the colon and small bowel, bladder, uterus, vagina, or skin. Fistulae can be managed surgically and are usually managed in the elective setting.

In general, all patients with complicated diverticulitis should be referred to a surgeon, if surgery aligns with their goals of care (Figure 2). While some manifestations of complicated diverticulitis, such as perforation with peritonitis warrant emergent surgical intervention, others may be managed non operatively. Thus, surgical decision making should consider not only the patient's clinical presentation but also their broader clinical context, comorbidities, functional status, and goals of care.

### Implementing an antibiotic stewardship program: guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America [^116g7svS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic stewardship program (ASP) implementation and evidence needs highlight actionable strategies and research gaps. ASPs can successfully intervene to reduce the duration of therapy for many infections because well-constructed, randomized controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that clinical outcomes are equivalent, and ASPs can cite high quality data to reduce unnecessary antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated diverticulitis or ASB. Additional clinical trials that incorporate consideration of antibiotic stewardship in their design are critically needed. There is a dearth of implementation research, and although national plans may require ASPs across facilities, little effort and limited research funding have been allocated to study how best to achieve large-scale implementation; qualitative assessments addressing organizational culture, prescriber attitudes, and steward self-efficacy are lacking. There is inadequate information on the best model for an ASP, and approaches studied for common infections have not been broadly disseminated because they require interpretation, expertise, and engagement. A new or adapted model for ASP is likely needed and best developed through rigorous implementation science. Despite these gaps, the guideline identifies core interventions for all ASPs and additional interventions based on facility-specific assessments of need and resources; every healthcare facility is able to perform stewardship, and institution of an ASP is attainable and of great importance to public health.

Consensus was reached with no further voting.

Statement: There is no evidence to support a particular antibiotic regime, route, or duration for complicated acute diverticulitis. Antibiotics are indicated in all complicated acute diverticulitis cases. If a drainage procedure is indicated, there is no evidence to support a prolonged course of antibiotics after source control is achieved.

### Observational versus antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis: an individual-patient data meta-analysis [^113yJpdz]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The decision to treat patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis with antibiotics or not does not depend on a single outcome measure. All reasons in favour of using antibiotics and all reasons in favour of omitting them should be taken into account. Omitting antibiotics did not increase the risk of ongoing diverticulitis, recurrent diverticulitis, complicated diverticulitis or sigmoid resection, and is therefore a safe treatment strategy. Insufficient statistical power to detect small differences in complicated diverticulitis and sigmoid resection may leave some room for discussion if these small differences are considered clinically relevant. Furthermore, the use of antibiotics should be limited as much as possible to minimize the global threat of rising microbial resistance and to prevent antibiotic‐related morbidity (8.3 per cent of all patients in DIABOLO 2), including potentially life‐threatening allergic reactions. In the end, individual‐patient characteristics or preferences may be deciding factors in the decision‐making process. However, in subgroups of patients with independent risk factors for adverse outcome (high pain scores, high WBC and a history of acute diverticulitis at presentation) no beneficial role for antibiotics in the prevention of such adverse outcomes was found.

### Observational versus antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis: an individual-patient data meta-analysis [^115Z79w5]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

A strength of this meta‐analysis is the use of individual‐patient data from the only two available RCTs on this topic. A regular meta‐analysis would only have been able to pool results at the (different) follow‐up times reported in the results papers. Furthermore, not all necessary information, about, for instance, the proportion of emergency or elective surgery, was reported in both results papers, and definitions of outcome measures differed between studies. Use of individual‐patient data resolved these issues, and so analyses were more accurate and complete. Although differences between the studies were resolved as much as possible, remaining differences could have influenced the results. Cases of acute diverticulitis within 3 months of randomization were considered ongoing rather than recurrent episodes. In the AVOD trial, however, ongoing diverticulitis was not an outcome measure and recurrent episodes within 3 months were converted into ongoing episodes, even though no data were available to indicate whether patients recovered in between episodes. In addition, to make the trials as homogeneous as possible, all patients with small pericolic abscesses from the DIABOLO trial were excluded. The AVOD trial did not involve such patients, so including these patients with Hinchey 1b disease in the meta‐analysis would not have any added value toward the analyses that have already been performed in the DIABOLO results paper and the number of such patients would still be too small for conclusions to be drawn.

### Position paper: management of perforated sigmoid diverticulitis [^116D3YES]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

For patients who have stage III and stage IV disease and concerning signs of sepsis but are not in septic shock also need source control. While traditionally these patients were taken expeditiously to the OR for a HP or a PRA, we believe that the recent case series indicate that LLD is a viable option that should be employed to low risk patients but recommend a definitive sigmoid resection for high risk that include patients who are a) immunocompromised, b) have severe co-morbidities c) organ dysfunctions attributable to ongoing sepsis or d) stage IV disease. The again the decision to perform an anastomosis should be individualized based on the current physiology, the condition of bowel, patient co-morbidities, and surgeon experience.

Patients who do not require an emergency operation

Initial recommended treatment of stage IA and IB diverticulitis includes a) nil per os (NPO), b) nasogastric tube to treat (if present) symptoms of nausea, vomiting and abdominal distention and c) antibiotics with activity against common gram-negative and anaerobic pathogens. A number of single agents and combination regimens provide such activity. However, there is little evidence on which to base selection of specific antimicrobial regimens, and no regimen has demonstrated superiority. In general, episodes of diverticulitis severe enough to warrant hospitalization should be initially managed with IV antibiotics. Oral antibiotic therapy can be started when the patient's condition improves and continued as outpatient treatment. There is a paucity of data regarding the optimal duration of antimicrobial therapy.

Patients with stage II diverticulitis should be managed as above but should also be evaluated by interventional radiology for CT guided PCD. The preferred approach is trans-abdominal either anterior or lateral, attempting to avoid the inferior epigastric or deep circumflex iliac vessels. Other approaches include transgluteal, transperineal, transvaginal or transanal. Reported failure rates for PCD range from 15% to 30% with a complication rate of 5% (including bleeding, perforation of a hollow viscous or fistula formation).

Observation

Patients with stage IA, IB and II diverticulitis should be treated as described above and observed with serial a) physical exams, b) assessments of SIRS severity and c) laboratory evidence organ dysfunctions. It is expected that their clinical condition will improve over 72 hours. If it does not improve or their condition worsens they should undergo an urgent operation. Patients who resolve their symptoms should be discharged to home on oral antibiotics with follow-up (described below).

### WSES guidelines for the management of acute left sided colonic diverticulitis in the emergency setting [^117FBk5Z]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

A multi-centre randomized trial involving ten surgical departments in Sweden and one in Iceland recruited 623 patients with computed tomography-verified acute uncomplicated left-sided diverticulitis was published in 2012 by Chabok et al. Patients were randomized to treatment with (314 patients) or without (309 patients) antibiotics. Antibiotic treatment for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis neither accelerated recovery nor prevented complications or recurrence. It should therefore be reserved for the treatment of complicated diverticulitis.

A recent prospective single-arm study analyzed the safety and efficacy of symptomatic (nonantibiotic) treatment for CT-proven uncomplicated diverticulitis during a 30-day follow-up period. Overall, 161 patients were included in the study, and 153 (95%) completed the 30-day follow-up. A total of 14 (9%) patients had pericolic air. Altogether, 140 (87%) patients were treated as outpatients, and 4 (3%) of them were admitted to the hospital during the follow-up. None of the patients developed complicated diverticulitis or required surgery, but, 2 days (median) after inclusion, antibiotics were given to 14 (9%, 6 orally, 8 intravenously) patients.

However the high mortality associated with sepsis, requires clinicians to maintain a high index of clinical suspicion, in the conditions that predispose to sepsis. WSES expert panel suggests antimicrobial therapy covering Gram negative and anaerobes in patients with radiological documented uncomplicated acute diverticulitis associated with systemic manifestations of infection.

An appropriate antimicrobial regimen administered for an adequate duration has minimal impact on the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.

If antimicrobial therapy is necessary oral administration of antibiotics may be equally as effective as intravenous administration.

A randomized controlled trial of oral versus intravenous therapy for clinically diagnosed acute uncomplicated diverticulitis was published in 2009. Oral and intravenous regimens utilizing ciprofloxacin and metronidazole were compared. There were 41 patients in the oral arm and 38 in the IV arm (n = 79). No patients had to be converted to intravenous antibiotics from the oral group. There was a complete resolution of symptoms in both groups.

Antibiotic treatment versus no antibiotic treatment in acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis — low-certainty evidence shows antibiotics may not result in differences in quality of life at 3, 6, 12, or 24 months or 11 years, diverticulitis-related complications (1.1% vs. 1.8% at 1 month and 2.1% vs. 4.0% at 1 year), or need for surgery at 12 months (absolute risk difference range, −0.9% to −0.4%); a post hoc individual patient data meta-analysis of 2 RCTs found antibiotics may slightly decrease treatment failure (absolute risk difference, −2.2% [CI, −4.4% to 0.8%]), while evidence was very uncertain about effects on diverticulitis-related mortality.

### Antibiotics for uncomplicated diverticulitis [^116TRamW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Diverticulitis is an inflammatory complication to the very common condition diverticulosis. Uncomplicated diverticulitis has traditionally been treated with antibiotics with reference to the microbiology, extrapolation from trials on complicated intra-abdominal infections and clinical experience.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotic interventions for uncomplicated diverticulitis on relevant outcome.

Search Methods

Studies were identified by computerised searches of the The Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE. Ongoing trials were identified and reference lists of identified trials and relevant review articles were screened for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

RCTs including all types of patients with a radiological confirmed diagnosis of left-sided uncomplicated diverticulitis. Interventions of antibiotics compared to any other antibiotic treatment (different regime, route of administration, dosage or duration of treatment), placebo or no antibiotics. Outcome measures were complications, emergency surgery, recurrence, late complications and duration of hospital stay and recovery of signs of infection.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors performed the searches, identification of RCTs, trial assessment and data extraction. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or involvement of a third part. Authors of trials were contacted to obtain additional data if needed or were contacted for preliminary results of ongoing trials. Effect estimates were extracted as relative risks (RR).

Main Results

Three RCTs were identified. A qualitative approach with no meta analysis was performed because of variety in interventions between included studies. Interventions compared were antibiotics to no antibiotics, single to double compound antibiotic therapy and short to long IV administration. None of the studies found significant difference between the tested interventions. Risk of bias varied from low to high. The newest RCT overall had the best quality and statistical power.

Authors' Conclusions

The newest evidence from one RCT says there is no significant difference between antibiotics versus no antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated diverticulitis. Previous RCTs have only suggested a non-inferiority between different antibiotic regimes and treatment lengths. This new evidence needs confirmation from more RCTs before it can be implicated safely in clinical guidelines. Ongoing RCTs will be published in the years to come and more are needed. The role of antibiotics in the treatment of complicated diverticulitis has not been investigated yet.

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^113ngLXg]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Non-operative treatment, with bowel rest and antibiotics, is suggested in patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis (Recommendation 1 C).

Conservative treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis is successful in 70 to 100 percent of patients. Uncomplicated diverticulitis may be managed as an outpatient (dietary modification and oral antibiotics) for those without appreciable fever, excessive vomiting, or marked peritonitis, as long as there is the opportunity for follow-up. The patient should be able to take liquids and antibiotics by mouth. Hospitalization is indicated if the patient is unable to take liquids or has severe pain, or if symptoms fail to improve despite adequate outpatient therapy. Antibiotics should be selected to treat the most common bacteria found in the colon: gram-negative rods and anaerobic bacteria. Non-operative treatment will resolve acute diverticulitis in 85 percent of patients, but approximately one-third will have a recurrent attack often within one year.

The decision to recommend elective sigmoid colectomy after recovery from acute diverticulitis should be made on a case-by-case basis (Recommendation 1 C).

The overall rate of recurrence appears to be approximately 10 to 30% within a decade after a first documented attack and that the majority of patients who have a single episode of diverticulitis will not have another. In one report involving an average follow-up of 9 years with 2551 patients whose initial episode of diverticulitis was treated successfully without surgery, only 13% had recurrent attacks and only 7% required colectomy. These observations imply that routine elective colectomy is probably unwarranted if the disease is successfully managed on initial presentation and that surgical treatment should be limited to patients whose symptoms persist despite conservative therapy. Thus, continued observation may be appropriate for most patients who have repeated attacks of uncomplicated diverticulitis.

Acute uncomplicated diverticulitis (AUD)

The management of patients with AUD has undergone several modifications in terms of hospital admission, antibiotic administration and surgical intervention. A recent systematic review found that selected patients with the mild form of AUD, without relevant comorbidities or risk factors for complications, might be safely managed without hospital admission, with an average cost saving that ranged from 42–82% compared to inpatient treatment. Some recent studies highlighted that some AUD patients may be treated with conservative therapy without antibiotics. The American Gastroenterological Association's guidelines suggest that antibiotics should be used selectively, case by case, rather than routinely as in the past, but the grade of recommendation was conditional and the quality of evidence low. A recent meta-analysis of 8 studies found no difference in treatment outcome, readmission rate, diverticulitis complications, or need for elective or emergent surgery between AUD patients treated with or without antibiotics. However, only 2 randomized studies, both from Scandinavia, were included, whilst all the others were retrospective, non-randomized studies. Therefore, the data should be interpreted with caution, since at entry the enrolled patients were not comparable in terms of several clinical characteristics, based on which the choice of treatment (antibiotic or conservative) was arbitrarily applied by the clinician. Data from ongoing randomized controlled trials are awaited. When antibiotic therapy is deemed necessary, some concerns may arise about both therapy duration and route of administration. It has been found that a 5-day course of antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and metronidazole i.v. is equally effective to a 5–10 day course. Moreover, some studies have challenged the traditional concept of treating acute diverticulitis with intravenous antibiotic therapy, instead proposing that oral antibiotic therapy may be appropriate. A randomized controlled trial found no difference in the outcome of AUD patients treated with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole administered orally or i.v.

### Observational versus antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis: an individual-patient data meta-analysis [^11665bAo]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This individual‐patient data meta‐analysis of two RCTs demonstrated that omitting antibiotics does not increase the risk of ongoing diverticulitis, recurrent diverticulitis, complicated diverticulitis or sigmoid resection. Although some risk factors for adverse events were identified, antibiotic treatment failed to improve outcomes in patients at risk of adverse events.

Earlier results of the DIABOLO 2 and AVOD 1 trials showed no significant differences between groups for all outcomes. However, some outcomes at 6 or 12 months showed a trend towards a potential benefit from antibiotics, as suggested by others 6. These trends could not be confirmed in the present meta‐analysis of 1‐year follow‐up results; there was no statistically significant difference in any outcome between groups. As the present meta‐analysis repeated some analyses from the original study papers, a correction for multiple testing was applied. However, even without this correction the results would have been comparable; only the duration of hospital stay would have been significantly shorter in the observational group in the absence of correction for multiple testing, but the small difference would have made this finding clinically irrelevant. Although not statistically different, the small differences in rates of complicated diverticulitis and sigmoid resection may be considered clinically relevant. The sample size of the meta‐analysis appeared to be insufficient to detect such small differences. However, a statistical power of 80 per cent would need over 2500 patients to test the difference in complicated diverticulitis rates, and over 1800 patients to test the difference in sigmoid resection rates. As AVOD and DIABOLO are the only RCTs available on this topic, it is very unlikely that a sufficient sample size would be achieved.

Follow‐up times were made as comparable as possible but some differences probably still exist. The final follow‐up in the AVOD trial took place at different times in the 13th month, whereas in the DIABOLO trial follow‐up during the entire 13th month was available for most patients. Therefore, the follow‐up duration for patients in DIABOLO was slightly longer than that for patients in AVOD. However, if all adverse events from the 13th month in DIABOLO had been excluded (0 cases of complicated diverticulitis; 5 cases of recurrent diverticulitis – 3 in the observational and 2 in the antibiotics group; and 3 sigmoid resections – 2 in the observational and 1 in the antibiotics group), the results would not have changed. Another limitation is the small number of adverse events among patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Therefore, the statistical power is limited for the analysis of these secondary outcomes, leading to imprecision; this may be a reason for downgrading the level of evidence, as in the American Gastroenterological Association Institute guideline 12. Finally, both studies excluded patients with sepsis without predefining sepsis, and the AVOD trial lacked a description of patients who were excluded after assessment for eligibility. Although failing to give reasons for exclusion may slightly limit the assessment of generalizability, the fact that only four of 323 patients were excluded owing to sepsis in the DIABOLO trial shows that the effect of this exclusion criterion was most likely minimal.

Stage 1 A

Stage 1 A diverticulitis is a confined inflammatory process that may include a microperforation but excludes an abscess, and/or peritonitis. CT findings include pericolic air in the form of air bubbles or little pericolic fluid without abscess. Pericolic air is defined as air bubbles or air collection within 5 cm of the inflamed bowel segment without distant air (Figure 3). Patients have left iliac fossa pain, initial localized tenderness and there are usually signs of sepsis. Small locules of pericolic air is a feature of a (micro) perforation of a diverticulum. Stage 1 A diverticulitis may progress to more complicated clinical forms if it is not treated promptly. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are therefore indicated in stage 1 A patients. Antibiotics should be always given to the patients with pericolic air or small fluid collection. Various antimicrobial regimens may be used in the treatment of acute diverticulitis in order to ensure complete coverage against Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and aerobic–anaerobic bacterial strains. Antimicrobial regimens with beta-lactamase inhibiting antibiotics such as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole are appropriate for community acquired acute diverticulitis, although high rates of resistance to quinolones have reported in many countries. In critically ill patients or in immunocompromised patients broader-spectrum regimens should be used. An appropriate antimicrobial therapy given for an appropriate duration has minimal impact on the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.

Figure 3
Diverticular disease, colonic wall thickening, fat stranding and pericolic fluid and air bubbles.

Patients with CT findings of pericolic air and signs of sepsis and initial tenderness should require bowel rest, intravenous fluid hydration and empirical intravenous antimicrobial therapy. In these patients to optimize antimicrobial therapy and minimize hospital stay, antimicrobial therapy may be started initially intravenously and switched to oral therapy as soon as clinical conditions improve.

Patients with pericolic air or small fluid collection should be managed by antimicrobial therapy. Patients with signs of sepsis and initial tenderness should demand bowel rest, intravenous fluid hydration and empirical intravenous antimicrobial therapy. In these patients intravenous antimicrobial therapy may be switched to oral therapy as soon as clinical conditions improve.

Clinical findings should be sufficient to monitor resolution of the acute episode. In patients who have persistent or recurrent clinical evidence of intra-abdominal infection after 4–6 days of therapy, new CT imaging should be undertaken.

### 2020 update of the WSES guidelines for the management of acute colonic diverticulitis in the emergency setting [^115RM8tv]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

What is the optimal antibiotic therapy for patients with diffuse peritonitis due to diverticular perforation? What is the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy after surgical source control in diffuse peritonitis due to diverticular perforation?

We suggest to choose the empirically designed antibiotic regimen on the basis of the underlying clinical condition of the patient, the pathogens presumed to be involved, and the risk factors for major antimicrobial resistance patterns (strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B).

We suggest a 4-day period of postoperative antibiotic therapy in complicated ALCD if source control has been adequate (weak recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B).

Antibiotic therapy plays an important role in the management of complicated acute diverticulitis. Typically, it is an empiric antibiotic treatment. The regimen should depend on the severity of infection, the pathogens presumed to be involved, and the risk factors indicative of major resistance patterns. Several recommendations have been recently published in literature. However, consideration of local epidemiological data and resistance profiles is essential for antibiotic selection.

Considering intestinal microbiota of large bowel acute diverticulitis requires antibiotic coverage for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as for anaerobes. Most of the complicated acute diverticulitis is mainly a community-acquired infection. The main resistance threat in IAIs is posed by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, which are becoming increasingly common in community-acquired infections worldwide. The most significant risk factors for ESBL-producing pathogens include prior exposure to antibiotics and comorbidities requiring concurrent antibiotic therapy. Anti-ESBL-producer coverage should be warranted for patients with these risk factors. Discontinuation of antibiotic treatment should be at 4 days from source control as this has been demonstrated as non-inferior to longer therapy based on the STOP IT trial.

The recent prospective trial by Sawyer et al. demonstrated that in patients with complicated IAIs undergoing an adequate source-control procedure, the outcomes after approximately 4 days fixed-duration antibiotic therapy were similar to those after a longer course of antibiotics that extended until after the resolution of physiological abnormalities. Patients who have signs of sepsis beyond 5 to 7 days of adequate antibiotic treatment warrant aggressive diagnostic investigation in search of a reservoir of infection.

### Randomized clinical trial of antibiotics in acute uncomplicated diverticulitis [^115GJJpx]. The British Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The standard of care for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis today is antibiotic treatment, although there are no controlled studies supporting this management. The aim was to investigate the need for antibiotic treatment in acute uncomplicated diverticulitis, with the endpoint of recovery without complications after 12 months of follow-up.

Methods

This multicentre randomized trial involving ten surgical departments in Sweden and one in Iceland recruited 623 patients with computed tomography-verified acute uncomplicated left-sided diverticulitis. Patients were randomized to treatment with (314 patients) or without (309 patients) antibiotics.

Results

Age, sex, body mass index, co-morbidities, body temperature, white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level on admission were similar in the two groups. Complications such as perforation or abscess formation were found in six patients (1.9 per cent) who received no antibiotics and in three (1.0 per cent) who were treated with antibiotics (P = 0.302). The median hospital stay was 3 days in both groups. Recurrent diverticulitis necessitating readmission to hospital at the 1-year follow-up was similar in the two groups (16 per cent, P = 0.881).

Conclusion

Antibiotic treatment for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis neither accelerates recovery nor prevents complications or recurrence. It should be reserved for the treatment of complicated diverticulitis.

### Antibiotics Do not reduce length of hospital stay for uncomplicated diverticulitis in a pragmatic double-blind randomized trial [^1143u8AR]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Antibiotic treatment is the standard care for patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. However, this practice is based on low-level evidence and has been challenged by findings from 2 randomized trials, which did not include a placebo group. We investigated the non-inferiority of placebo vs antibiotic treatment for the management of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis.

Methods

In the selective treatment with antibiotics for non-complicated diverticulitis study, 180 patients hospitalized for uncomplicated acute diverticulitis (determined by computed tomography, Hinchey 1a grade) from New Zealand and Australia were randomly assigned to groups given antibiotics (n = 85) or placebo (n = 95) for 7 days. We collected demographic, clinical, and laboratory data and answers to questionnaires completed every 12 hrs for the first 48 hrs and then daily until hospital discharge. The primary endpoint was length of hospital stay; secondary endpoints included occurrence of adverse events, readmission to the hospital, procedural intervention, change in serum markers of inflammation, and patient-reported pain scores at 12 and 24 hrs.

Results

There was no significant difference in median time of hospital stay between the antibiotic group (40.0 hrs; 95% CI, 24.4–57.6 hrs) and the placebo group (45.8 hrs; 95% CI, 26.5–60.2 hrs) (P = 0.2). There were no significant differences between groups in adverse events (12% for both groups; P = 1.0), readmission to the hospital within 1 week (1% for the placebo group vs 6% for the antibiotic group; p = 0.1), and readmission to the hospital within 30 days (11% for the placebo group vs 6% for the antibiotic group; p = 0.3).

Conclusions

Foregoing antibiotic treatment did not prolong length of hospital admission. This result provides strong evidence for omission of antibiotics for selected patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis.

### Antibiotics versus No antibiotics for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Y7LZA]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are routinely used for diverticulitis irrespective of severity. Current practice guidelines favor against the use of antibiotics for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis.

Objective

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the role of antibiotic use in an episode of uncomplicated diverticulitis.

Data Sources

PubMed/Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane were used.

Study Selection

Eligible studies included those with patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis receiving any antibiotics compared with patients not receiving any antibiotics (or observed alone).

Main Outcome Measures

Pooled odds rate of total complications, treatment failure, recurrent diverticulitis, readmission rate, sigmoid resection, mortality rate, and length of stay were measured.

Results

Of 1050 citations reviewed, 7 studies were eligible for the analysis. There were total of 2241 patients: 895 received antibiotics (mean age = 59.1 y; 38% men) and 1346 did not receive antibiotics (mean age = 59.4 y; 37% men). Antibiotics were later added in 2.7% patients who initially were observed off antibiotics. Length of hospital stay was not significantly different among either group (no antibiotics = 3.1 d vs antibiotics = 4.5 d; p = 0.20). Pooled rate of recurrent diverticulitis was not significantly different among both groups (pooled OR = 1.27 (95%, CI 0.90–1.79); p = 0.18). Rate of total complications (pooled OR = 1.99 (95% CI, 0.66–6.01); p = 0.22), treatment failure (pooled OR = 0.68 (95% CI, 0.42–1.09); p = 0.11), readmissions (pooled OR = 0.75 (95% CI, 0.44–1.30); p = 0.31). and patients who required sigmoid resection (pooled OR = 3.37 (95% CI, 0.65–17.34); p = 0.15) were not significantly different among patients who received antibiotics and those who did not. Mortality rates were 4 of 1310 (no-antibiotic group) versus 4 of 863 (antibiotic group).

Limitations

Only 2 randomized controlled studies were available and there was high heterogeneity in existing data.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis of current literature shows that patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis can be monitored off antibiotics.

What is the best treatment for patients with a small diverticular abscess (< 4–5 cm)? What is the best treatment for patients with large diverticular abscess?

For patients with a small (< 4–5 cm) diverticular abscess, we suggest an initial trial of non-operative treatment with antibiotics alone (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

We suggest to treat patients with large abscesses with percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotic treatment; whenever percutaneous drainage of the abscess is not feasible or not available, we suggest to initially treat patients with large abscesses with antibiotic therapy alone, clinical conditions permitting. Alternatively, an operative intervention is required (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

Approximately 15–20% of patients admitted with acute diverticulitis have an abscess on CT scan. The treatment of abscess always requires antibiotic therapy. If the abscess is limited in size, systemic antibiotic therapy alone is considered safe and effective in removing the abscess and solving acute inflammation with a pooled failure rate of 20% and a mortality rate of 0.6%.

3 What is the best treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis (WSES stage 0) in elderly patients?
4 What is the best treatment for localized complicated diverticulitis without abscess (WSES stage 1a) diverticulitis in elderly patients?

Statement 3.1 We suggest that antibiotic therapy should be avoided in immunocompetent elderly patients with uncomplicated left colonic diverticulitis (WSES stage 0) without sepsis-related organ failures [Conditional recommendation, very low-quality of evidence]
Statement 4.1 We suggest antibiotic therapy administration for elderly patients with localized complicated left colonic diverticulitis with pericolic air bubbles or little pericolic fluid without abscess (WSES stage 1a). [Conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence]

According to the WSES guidelines, antibiotic therapy can be avoided in immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis without systemic manifestations of infection. The AVOD trial involved ten surgical departments in Sweden and one in Iceland and recruited 623 patients with a mean age of 57 years with CT-verified uncomplicated ALCD. Patients were randomized to treatment with (314 patients) or without (309 patients) antibiotics. Antibiotic treatment in patients with uncomplicated ALCD (without CT signs of abscess, fistula, or free air) neither accelerates recovery nor prevents complications or recurrences. The DIABOLO trial included 528 patients with CT-proven, primary, left-sided, uncomplicated, ALCD (Hinchey 1a-1b) with age ranging from 48 to 64 years. Amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 1.2 g four times daily intravenously for at least 48 hours (after which the route was switched to oral administration of 625 mg three times daily), for a first episode of CT-proven uncomplicated ALCD, demonstrated that observational treatment without antibiotics did not prolong recovery and could be considered appropriate in patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis. Even if no significant differences between Hinchey stages 1a and 1b diverticulitis were found, it should be noted that the vast majority of patients included had a diagnosis of Hinchey stage 1a ALCD (90.1% in the observational and 94% in the antibiotic-treated group) with only a small percentage of patients with Hinchey stage 1b diverticulitis.

### The natural history of diverticulitis: fact and theory [^111YpTeW]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Epidemiological and anatomic evidence indicates that approximately 60% of humans of westernized societies living into the sixth decade will develop diverticulosis of the colon. The cause remains unknown, but epidemiological studies indicate it is a combination of decreased dietary fiber intake and increased intracolonic pressure. The intraluminal pressure exerted on the wall causes a diverticular outpocketing at any one of the three areas in which vessels enter the wall. In this paper, we advance a hypothesis that fiber deficiency not only leads to diverticula formation but also causes a change in the microecology that results in decreased colon immune response and permits a low-grade chronic inflammatory process that precedes a full-blown acute diverticulitis. Pathophysiologic studies reveal that complications do not occur until there is microperforation through the wall of the diverticulum into the pericolic tissue. The perforation might be small and cause a microabscess, or extend to a phlegmon, or extend to a large abscess formation. Free perforation occurs rarely, but fistulization does occur and most commonly to the bladder. The clinical findings vary. Most often, the clinical picture is one of fever, abdominal pain, a change in bowel habit, and localizing findings associated with leukocytosis. Computerized tomography scanning has become the procedure of choice to evaluate the symptoms since it is of less risk than a barium enema and obtains more information. The differential diagnosis may be difficult but usually can be made with accuracy. Medical treatment is preferred with appropriate antibiotic therapy and variations in fiber intake. When abscess occurs, percutaneous drainage may be tried, but when it is unsuccessful, surgical intervention is necessary. Sudden hemorrhage from a vessel in diverticula may also occur. It is estimated that approximately 20% of all patients that develop diverticula will have either inflammatory or bleeding episodes. In conclusion, fiber deficiency results in diverticular formation and a chronic inflammation that may progress to acute or chronic diverticulitis that can be treated medically but may require surgical intervention.

### The WSES / SICG / ACOI / SICUT / AcEMC / SIFIPAC guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute left colonic diverticulitis in the elderly [^115xSiKL]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

According to the WSES guidelines, the empirically planned antimicrobial regimen is based on the patient's underlying clinical condition, the microorganisms suspected of being involved, and risk factors for significant resistance patterns.﻿ The principles of empiric antibiotic treatment should be developed based on the most commonly isolated microorganisms, while also taking into account the local trend of antibiotic resistance. The presence of anaerobes and Gram-negative bacteria in the lower gastrointestinal tract should be taken into account while choosing empirical therapy for acute diverticulitis. In addition, quinolone and carbapenem resistance, as well as the presence of ESBL-producing bacteria in the local environment and the location of recent travel, should always be taken into account.

Because inoculation in a healthcare facility, corticosteroid usage, organ transplantation, baseline pulmonary or hepatic disease, and past anti-microbial therapy are the most relevant factors in predicting the presence of resistant bacteria, elderly individuals frequently fall into this category. One of the factors that is significantly linked to poor outcomes in critically ill patients is an ineffective or inadequate antimicrobial treatment. In patients with organ dysfunction and septic shock, broad empiric antimicrobial therapy should be started as soon as possible.

Furthermore, for individuals at risk for resistant bacteria, intraperitoneal samples for microbiological evaluation are always indicated from the site of infection. When the findings of microbiological tests are available, the patient should be reviewed, and antimicrobial de-escalation or withdrawal should be considered.
15 When should discontinuation of anti-microbial treatment be considered?

Statement 15.1 In elderly patients with complicated diverticulitis a short course of antibiotic therapy (3–5 days) after adequate source control is a reasonable option. [Conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence]
Statement 15.2 In elderly patients with complicated diverticulitis who have ongoing signs of peritonitis or systemic illness (ongoing infection) beyond 5 to 7 days of antibiotic treatment, further diagnostic investigation is indicated. [Conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence]

The outcomes after 4 days of antibiotic therapy were similar to those following a longer course of antibiotics in patients with intraabdominal infections who completed an acceptable source control regimen.

Although discontinuation of anti-microbial treatment should be based on clinical criteria, a 4–6 day period of postoperative anti-microbial therapy in complicated ALCD is suggested if source control has been adequate. Patients who have persistent symptoms of peritonitis or systemic sickness (ongoing infection) after 5 to 7 days of antibiotic treatment should be re-evaluated.

The treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis (UD) with antibiotics remains common despite substantial evidence supporting the non-inferiority of nonantibiotic outpatient management. In the past 15 years, there have been two landmark randomized-controlled clinical trials, follow-up studies, and numerous retrospective studies that have supported the non-inferiority of nonantibiotic management of UD. Multiple medical societies including the American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Physicians recommend using antibiotics selectively rather than routinely in UD. We aim to raise physician awareness of the latest guideline recommendations through our article, potentially improving antibiotic stewardship and reducing related healthcare costs.

Should antibiotics be recommended in immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis?

In immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis without signs of systemic inflammation, we recommend to not prescribe antibiotic therapy (strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1A).

In patients requiring antibiotic therapy, we recommend oral administration whenever possible, primarily, because an early switch from intravenous to oral therapy may facilitate a shorter inpatient length of stay (strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B).

The definition of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is often vague and poorly defined. Uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is defined as localized diverticular inflammation without any abscess or perforation. A universally accepted classification divides intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) into complicated and uncomplicated. In uncomplicated IAIs, the infection only involves a single organ and does not extend to the peritoneum, while in complicated IAIs, the infectious process extends beyond the organ, causing either localized or diffuse peritonitis. For a better definition of acute diverticulitis in these guidelines, we use the term complicated and uncomplicated according to the classification of IAIs.

Uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is an anatomically confined inflammatory process. CT findings include diverticula, thickening of the wall, and increased density of the pericolic fat. Patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis usually have an indolent course with a low incidence of subsequent complications.

The utility of antibiotics in acute uncomplicated acute diverticulitis has been a point of controversy. In recent years, several studies demonstrated that antimicrobial treatment was not superior to withholding antibiotic therapy, in terms of clinical resolution, in patients with mild unperforated diverticulitis. The current consensus is that uncomplicated acute diverticulitis may be a self-limiting condition in which local host defenses can manage the inflammation without antibiotics in immunocompetent patients. In this context, antibiotics are not necessary in the treatment of uncomplicated disease.

A multicenter randomized trial was published in 2012 by Chabok et al. involving ten surgical departments in Sweden and one in Iceland recruiting 623 patients with computed tomography-confirmed acute uncomplicated left-sided diverticulitis. Patients were randomized to treatment with (314 patients) or without (309 patients) antibiotics. Antibiotic treatment for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis neither accelerated recovery nor prevented complications or recurrence. Therefore, antibiotics should be reserved for the treatment of complicated diverticulitis.

### Observational versus antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis: an individual-patient data meta-analysis [^114iKtUj]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Uncomplicated acute diverticulitis has been treated routinely with antibiotics for decades, although several guidelines have adapted their recommendations meanwhile. These now state that antibiotics should not be used routinely or can be avoided 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Some guidelines, however, state that antibiotics 'should be used selectively' (American Gastroenterological Association Institute guideline 11), antibiotics 'should be given to patients with risk indications of a complicated course' (German guideline 9), or antibiotics 'on a case‐by‐case basis should possibly be considered' (Italian guideline 8).

Little is known, however, about risk factors for a complicated course of initially uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. Therefore, guidelines cannot recommend antibiotics for specific patient subgroups, besides subgroups that were excluded from studies on this topic such as immunocompromised patients and women. The present meta‐analysis identified several risk factors for one or more adverse outcomes that can guide the selection of patients who may benefit from antibiotics. However, the results showed that omitting antibiotics does not increase the risk of adverse outcomes in these high‐risk patients. Therefore, prevention of these adverse outcomes with antibiotic treatment may not be warranted.

Further, the patients studied were inpatients with uncomplicated disease confirmed by computed tomography (CT); therefore, the results should not be generalized to complicated patients (those with abscesses or fistulas), those with severe infection or sepsis, immunosuppressed patients, or patients with significant comorbidities. Outpatient management without antibiotics has not been studied, although we would expect these patients to have generally milder disease and logically equal or better outcomes.

Antimicrobial therapy

24) The empirically designed antimicrobial regimen depends on the underlying clinical condition of the patient, the pathogens presumed to be involved, and the risk factors indicative of major resistance patterns (Recommendation 1 C).
25) Although discontinuation of antimicrobial treatment should be based on clinical and laboratory criteria, a 4–6 days period of post-operative antimicrobial therapy in complicated ALCD is suggested if source control has been adequate (Recommendation 1 A).

Antimicrobial therapy plays an important role in the management of complicated acute diverticulitis. It is typically empiric antibiotic treatment. The empirically designed antimicrobial regimen depends on the underlying severity of infection, the pathogens presumed to be involved, and the risk factors indicative of major resistance patterns. Several recommendations have been recently published in literature in the setting of intra-abdominal infections. However consideration of local epidemiological data and regional resistance profiles is essential for antibiotic selection.

Considering intestinal microbiota of large bowel acute diverticulitis requires antimicrobial coverage for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, as well as for anaerobes. Most of the complicated acute diverticulitis is community acquired infection. The main resistance threat in intra-abdominal infections is posed by Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, which are becoming increasingly common in community-acquired infections worldwide. The most significant risk factors for ESBL producing infection include prior exposure to antibiotics and comorbidities requiring concurrent antibiotic therapy. Anti-ESBL-producer coverage should be warranted for patients with these risk factors. Although discontinuation of antimicrobial treatment should be based on clinical and laboratory criteria such as fever and markers of inflammation, a period of 4–6 days for adult patients is generally sufficient to treat in patients with acute diverticulitis who have been treated with proper source control and prompt surgical intervention.

The recent prospective trial by Sawyer et al. demonstrated that in patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections undergoing an adequate source-control procedure, the outcomes after approximately 4 days fixed-duration antibiotic therapy were similar to those after a longer course of antibiotics that extended until after the resolution of physiological abnormalities. Patients who have signs of sepsis beyond 5 to 7 days of antibiotic treatment warrant aggressive diagnostic investigation to determine if an ongoing uncontrolled source of infection exists.

Limit antimicrobial therapy to four days in patients who have adequate source control (Grade 1-A). Consider limiting antimicrobial therapy to 5–7 days when a definitive source control procedure is not performed and re-assess patients who do not respond fully within 5–7 days for potential source control intervention (Grade 2-C). Consider limiting antimicrobial therapy to seven days in patients with secondary bacteremia because of IAI who have undergone adequate source control and are no longer bacteremic (Grade 2-B). There are insufficient data to evaluate duration of therapy in patients receiving immunosuppressive medications (no recommendation).

### Observational versus antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis: an individual-patient data meta-analysis [^115L6LTL]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute uncomplicated diverticulitis has been treated routinely with antibiotics for decades, although evidence in favour of antibiotic treatment has always been lacking. Recently two RCTs 1, 2 demonstrated the safety of omitting antibiotics in the treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis up to 1 year of follow‐up. First, the AVOD Antibiotics in Acute Uncomplicated Diverticulitis trial 1 showed comparable rates of complicated diverticulitis, recurrent diverticulitis and sigmoid resection between observational and antibiotic treatment. Second, the DIABOLO (Diverticulitis: Antibiotics or Close Observation) trial 2 found no significant differences regarding time to recovery, complicated diverticulitis, recurrent diverticulitis and sigmoid resection. However, both RCTs reported somewhat – by and large non‐significant – higher rates of complicated diverticulitis and sigmoid resections in the non‐antibiotic group. As neither of the studies was powered to analyse these secondary outcomes, uncertainty remained whether these small differences could potentially be true causal associations, the consequence of patient selection or findings by chance in accordance with statistical non‐significance. A regular meta‐analysis of the two RCTs would not be able to account for different follow‐up times and different outcome definitions that were provided in the results papers of these studies. In contrast, a meta‐analysis of individual‐patient data can not only account for these differences but additionally provide an opportunity to use the increased sample size of both trials combined. The aim was to identify patients at risk of complications who may benefit from antibiotic treatment.

### Systematic review of evidence and consensus on diverticulitis: an analysis of national and international guidelines [^112H69fh]. Colorectal Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Aim

The study aimed to analyse the currently available national and international guidelines for areas of consensus and contrasting recommendations in the treatment of diverticulitis and thereby to design questions for future research.

Method

MEDLINE, EMBASE and PubMed were systematically searched for guidelines on diverticular disease and diverticulitis. Inclusion was confined to papers in English and those < 10 years old. The included topics were classified as consensus or controversy between guidelines, and the highest level of evidence was scored as sufficient (Oxford Centre of Evidence-Based Medicine Level of Evidence of 3a or higher) or insufficient.

Results

Six guidelines were included and all topics with recommendations were compared. Overall, in 13 topics consensus was reached and 10 topics were regarded as controversial. In five topics, consensus was reached without sufficient evidence and in three topics there was no evidence and no consensus. Clinical staging, the need for intraluminal imaging, dietary restriction, duration of antibiotic treatment, the protocol for abscess treatment, the need for elective surgery in subgroups of patients, the need for surgery after abscess treatment and the level of the proximal resection margin all lack consensus or evidence.

Conclusion

Evidence on the diagnosis and treatment of diverticular disease and diverticulitis ranged from nonexistent to strong, regardless of consensus. The most relevant research questions were identified and proposed as topics for future research.

Statistical analysis

Observational and antibiotic treatment were compared following the intention‐to‐treat principle and differences were assessed for superiority. Numbers and percentages were calculated for categorical variables, and median (i.q.r.) for continuous variables as these data were not normally distributed. As the data in this meta‐analysis are clustered by study, comparison between treatment groups was corrected for this clustering. A generalized linear mixed model was fitted for each outcome measure. A logistic regression mixed model was used for dichotomous outcomes. A γ regression distribution was chosen for the only continuous outcome (duration of hospital stay) as the data were right‐skewed. Both treatment allocation and study were entered into the model as fixed effects. This meta‐analysis tested the outcomes of both trials (although some were slightly modified) in addition to the initial analysis of both trials. Therefore, correction for multiple testing was appropriate and a two‐sided P < 0.025 was considered statistically significant. For some relevant outcome measures, a post hoc power calculation was performed using the results from unequal groups and without continuity correction.

When abscess diameter is larger, antibiotics could fail to reach the adequate concentration inside the abscess leading to an increased failure rate.

The size of 4–5 cm may be a reasonable limit between antibiotic treatment alone, versus percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotic treatment in the management of diverticular abscesses. When the patient's clinical conditions allow it and percutaneous drainage is not feasible, antibiotic therapy alone can be considered. However, careful clinical monitoring is mandatory. A high suspicion for surgical control of the septic source should be maintained and a surgical treatment should be performed if the patient shows a worsening of inflammatory signs or the abscess does not reduce with medical therapy.

There are currently no randomized studies available on the best treatment of intra-abdominal abscess from acute diverticulitis, and current recommendations are based only on observational studies. A retrospective study comparing outcomes of selected patients treated with initial antibiotics alone versus percutaneous drainage was published in 2015 by Elagili et al. All patients with diverticular abscess ≥ 3 cm in diameter treated in a single institution in 1994–2012 with percutaneous drainage or antibiotics alone followed by surgery were identified from an institutional diverticular disease database. Groups were compared based on patient and disease characteristics, treatment failures, and postoperative outcomes. Thirty-two patients were treated with antibiotics alone because of either technically impossible percutaneous drainage or surgeon preference, while 114 underwent percutaneous drainage. Urgent surgery was required in 8 patients with persistent symptoms during treatment with antibiotics alone (25%) and in 21 patients (18%) after initial percutaneous drainage (p = 0.21). Patients treated with antibiotics had a significantly smaller abscess diameter (5.9 vs. 7.1 cm, p = 0.001) and shorter interval from initial treatment to sigmoidectomy (mean 50 vs. 80 days, p = 0.02). Postoperative complications following antibiotics alone were significantly less severe than after percutaneous drainage based on the Clavien-Dindo classification (p = 0.04).

In patients displaying an appropriate clinical improvement, the drainage catheter can be removed when the output has ceased or decreased substantially. In doubtful cases, a CT scan can be performed with water-soluble contrast via the percutaneous drainage catheter prior to drain removal. If no identifiable cavity remains, the catheter should be removed. If resolution of the abscess is not reached and the patient has no clinical improvement, further drainage or catheter repositioning might be indicated and may eventually necessitate surgery.

### Randomized clinical trial of observational versus antibiotic treatment for a first episode of CT-proven uncomplicated acute diverticulitis [^112Ayosi]. The British Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are advised in most guidelines on acute diverticulitis, despite a lack of evidence to support their routine use. This trial compared the effectiveness of a strategy with or without antibiotics for a first episode of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis.

Methods

Patients with CT-proven, primary, left-sided, uncomplicated, acute diverticulitis were included at 22 clinical sites in the Netherlands, and assigned randomly to an observational or antibiotic treatment strategy. The primary endpoint was time to recovery during 6 months of follow-up. Main secondary endpoints were readmission rate, complicated, ongoing and recurrent diverticulitis, sigmoid resection and mortality. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were done.

Results

A total of 528 patients were included. Median time to recovery was 14 (i.q.r. 6–35) days for the observational and 12 (7–30) days for the antibiotic treatment strategy, with a hazard ratio for recovery of 0.91 (lower limit of 1-sided 95 per cent c.i. 0.78; P = 0.151). No significant differences between the observation and antibiotic treatment groups were found for secondary endpoints: complicated diverticulitis (3.8 versus 2.6 per cent respectively; P = 0.377), ongoing diverticulitis (7.3 versus 4.1 per cent; P = 0.183), recurrent diverticulitis (3.4 versus 3.0 per cent; P = 0.494), sigmoid resection (3.8 versus 2.3 per cent; P = 0.323), readmission (17.6 versus 12.0 per cent; P = 0.148), adverse events (48.5 versus 54.5 per cent; P = 0.221) and mortality (1.1 versus 0.4 per cent; P = 0.432). Hospital stay was significantly shorter in the observation group (2 versus 3 days; P = 0.006). Per-protocol analyses were concordant with the intention-to-treat analyses.

Conclusion

Observational treatment without antibiotics did not prolong recovery and can be considered appropriate in patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis. Registration number: NCT01111253 (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov).

Evidence cited states there "may be no differences in diverticulitis-related complications (such as abscess, fistula, stenosis, and obstruction), quality of life, need for surgery, or long-term recurrence between those receiving and those not receiving antibiotics", though "antibiotic treatment may slightly decrease treatment failure rates (defined as "ongoing diverticulitis" within 3 months of treatment) compared with no antibiotic treatment". Clinical considerations specify this "does not apply to patients with complicated diverticulitis, systemic inflammatory response, immunosuppression, or ongoing or recent antibiotic treatment", and that "Initial management without antibiotics should be coupled with watchful waiting and ability to continue monitoring patient status, based on individual clinical judgment".

### Progress and challenges in the management of diverticular disease: which treatment? [^115ug61s]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Another innovative therapeutic approach is being suggested and recommended in several studies worldwide to reduce the use of antibiotics in the clinical management of these uncomplicated cases. Antibiotic treatment should be used in selected cases such as patients with signs of generalized infection, immunosuppressed patients, or conservative nonantibiotic treatment failure. Two systematic reviews have called antibiotic usage into question. The first systematic review identified three RCTs and reported that antibiotic use did not reduce the duration of symptoms or prevent subsequent complications or recurrence. However, we note that the quality of evidence from the included trials was low because of a high risk of bias, and only patients with modified Hinchey stage Ia and Ib were included, thus excluding immunocompromised patients, those with symptoms of sepsis, or significant comorbidity. Data from a RCT by Chabok and colleagues found that antibiotics may reduce complication risk during treatment [relative risk (RR) 0.49; 95% CI 0.12–1.95], but with no statistical significance. A recent systematic review including eight studies with over 2400 patients found no difference in complication rates between patients taking antibiotics and nonantibiotic usage, with only increasing length of hospital stay without antibiotics. Also, a recent multicenter RCT of systemic antibiotic treatment (1.2 g of amoxicillin clavulanic acid/6 h intravenously for a minimum of 48 h and then switched to oral administration of 625 mg/8 h) versus observation with no antibiotics for a first episode of uncomplicated AD showed that the observational arm was not associated with poorer outcomes.

Recommended antibiotic regimens include ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole, penicillin derivatives such as ampicillin or piperacillin/tazobactam, and third-generation cephalosporin to cover gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria. Data do not support intravenous antibiotic treatment over oral treatment, and duration of treatment from 4 days to over 7 days does not seem to have any advantage related to clinical outcomes. It should be emphasized, however, that the choice of antimicrobials is entirely empiric, since no trial has compared the efficacy of the different regimens mentioned above.

### Antibiotics for uncomplicated diverticulitis [^112KL8LJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Diverticulitis is a complication of the common condition, diverticulosis. Uncomplicated diverticulitis has traditionally been treated with antibiotics, as diverticulitis has been regarded as an infectious disease. Risk factors for diverticulitis, however, may suggest that the condition is inflammatory rather than infectious which makes the use of antibiotics questionable.

Objectives

The objectives of this systematic review were to determine if antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis affects the risk of complications (immediate or late) or the need for emergency surgery.

Search Methods

For this update, a comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted in Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform on February 2021.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including all types of patients with a radiologically confirmed diagnosis of left-sided uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. Comparator and interventions included antibiotics compared to no antibiotics, placebo, or to any other antibiotic treatment (different regimens, routes of administration, dosage or duration of treatment). Primary outcome measures were complications and emergency surgery. Secondary outcomes were recurrence, late complications, elective colonic resections, length of hospital stay, length to recovery of symptoms, adverse events and mortality.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors performed the searches, identification and assessment of RCTs and data extraction. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or involvement of the third author. Authors of trials were contacted to obtain additional data if needed or for preliminary results of ongoing trials. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias was used to assess the methodological quality of the identified trials. The overall quality of evidence for outcomes was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Effect estimates were extracted as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed with the Mantel-Haenzel method.

Main Results

The authors included five studies. Three studies compared no antibiotics to antibiotics; all three were original RCTs of which two also published long-term follow-up information. For the outcome of short-term complications there may be little or no difference between antibiotics and no antibiotics (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.30 to 2.62; 3 studies, 1329 participants; low-certainty evidence). The rate of emergency surgery within 30 days may be lower with no antibiotics compared to antibiotics (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.13, 1.71; 1329 participants; 3 studies; low-certainty evidence). However, there is considerable imprecision due to wide confidence intervals for this effect estimate causing uncertainty which means that there may also be a benefit with antibiotics. One of the two remaining trials compared single to double compound antibiotic therapy and, due to wide confidence intervals, the estimate was imprecise and indicated an uncertain clinical effect between these two antibiotic regimens (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.11 to 4.58; 51 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence). The last trial compared short to long intravenous administration of antibiotics and did not report any events for our primary outcomes. Both trials included few participants and one had overall high risk of bias. Since the first publication of this systematic review, an increasing amount of evidence supporting the treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis without antibiotics has been published, but the total body of evidence is still limited.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence on antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated acute diverticulitis suggests that the effect of antibiotics is uncertain for complications, emergency surgery, recurrence, elective colonic resections, and long-term complications. The quality of the evidence is low. Only three RCTs on the need for antibiotics are currently available. More trials are needed to obtain more precise effect estimates.

Question 1.4

Can acute diverticulitis be managed non‐operatively?

Recommendation: Antibiotics may be omitted in uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. Patients with complicated acute diverticulitis should be administered broad‐spectrum antibiotics and most can be treated non‐operatively, but regular clinical re‐evaluation must be undertaken to determine success or failure of treatment.

Level of evidence: I

Grade of recommendation: A

Consensus: 100% (SA 88.9%, A 11.1%)

There is no evidence mandating the use of routine antibiotics in uncomplicated AD. Conservative treatment strategy without antibiotics in patients with uncomplicated AD has proven to be safe, with long‐term outcomes, in terms of recurrence, complications and need for surgery, being similar to those treated with antibiotics. However, CRP level > 170 mg/l is a risk factor for non‐antibiotic treatment failure and selective, rather than routine, omission of antibiotics is still recommended.

There is no evidence to support a particular antibiotic regime, route or duration for complicated AD. Antibiotics are indicated in all cases of complicated AD. If a drainage procedure is indicated, there is no evidence to support a prolonged course of antibiotics after source control is achieved.

Approximately 20% of patients with AD will have complicated disease and the majority can be treated conservatively with antibiotics, including many cases with abscesses and pericolic extraluminal air. Mesocolic abscesses (Modified Hinchey 1b) are more likely than pelvic or intra‐abdominal abscesses to respond to antibiotics alone and Hinchey II patients with abscesses smaller than 4 cm in size can also usually be treated with antibiotics alone. Simultaneous abscess and perforation occur in around 18% of patients and the presence of an abscess increases the risk of failure of non‐operative management. Isolated pericolic extraluminal gas — defined as free gas no more than 5 cm from the site of inflammation — is found in up to 15% of patients with complicated AD, and 6% of patients with isolated pericolic extraluminal air will need emergency surgery (ES) with a 2% 30‐day mortality rate. Even in patients with free gas, provided there is an absence of severe peritonitis or sepsis, up to one‐third can be successfully managed non‐operatively. The decision to persist with non‐operative therapy in complicated AD must take into account the patient's physiological state, response to treatment through regular review and associated comorbidities.

### EAES and SAGES 2018 consensus conference on acute diverticulitis management: evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice [^113G6rPi]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

A number of areas of continuing controversy in the current diagnosis and management of AD were identified based on the lack of consensus amongst members' survey responses. After the congress presentations, a few areas of disagreement persisted involving the selective use of imaging to guide AD diagnosis, recommendations against antibiotics in non-complicated AD and routine colonic evaluation after resolution of non-complicated diverticulitis.

The first area of disagreement was on selective imaging to guide the diagnosis of acute diverticulitis. Although a consensus was achieved on the moderate strength evidence statement and recommendation, consensus was not achieved on the likelihood to change practice. The weak recommendation to defer or eliminate routine imaging in patients with suspected AD based on physical examination, symptoms and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels also did not gain traction. This likely reflects the reluctance to dramatically change institutional diagnostic protocols for patients presenting with abdominal pain, from concerns regarding alternative diagnoses and potential diagnosis and treatment delays.

Diverticulitis

Patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis should be treated with antibiotic therapy to address gram-negative and anaerobic pathogens (Recommendation 2C).

The routine use of antibiotics for patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is a point of controversy in the medical community.

In 2011, a systematic review was published overviewing antibiotic use in cases of uncomplicated diverticulitis. Relevant data regarding the use of antibiotics in mild or uncomplicated cases of diverticulitis were sparse and of poor methodological quality. There was no concrete evidence to support the routine use of antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated diverticulitis.

Recently a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial involving 10 surgical departments in Sweden and 1 in Iceland investigated the use of antibiotic treatment in cases of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Antibiotic treatment for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis neither accelerated recovery nor prevented complications or recurrence.

However, even in the absence of evidence supporting the routine use of antibiotics for patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis, we recommend adequate antimicrobial coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic microorganisms.

Mild cases of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis should be treated in an outpatient setting. Outpatient treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis depends on the condition and compliance of the patient as well as his or her availability for follow-up analysis. The treatment involves orally administered antibiotics to combat gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria. If symptoms persist or worsen, the patient should be admitted for more aggressive inpatient treatment.

Hospitalized patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis should be treated with intravenous fluids and antibiotic infusion.

The clinical value of antibiotics in the treatment of acute uncomplicated left-sided diverticulitis is poorly understood by the medical community and therefore merits further study.

Uncomplicated diverticulitis

Conservative treatment without antibiotics in patients with CT diagnosis of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis.
Antibiotic therapy for 5–7 days in patients with CT diagnosis of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is reserved for immunocompromised patients and patients with signs of sepsis.

The definition of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is often vague and poorly defined. Uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is defined as localized diverticular inflammation without any abscess or perforation. A universally accepted classification divides IAIs into complicated and uncomplicated. In uncomplicated IAIs, the infection only involves a single organ and does not extend to the peritoneum, while in complicated IAIs, the infectious process extends beyond the organ, causing either localized or diffuse peritonitis. For a better definition of acute diverticulitis in these guidelines, we use the term complicated and uncomplicated according to the classification of IAIs.

Uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is an anatomically confined inflammatory process. CT findings include diverticula, thickening of the wall, and increased density of the pericolic fat. Patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis usually have an indolent course with a low incidence of subsequent complications.

The utility of antibiotics in acute uncomplicated acute diverticulitis has been a point of controversy. In recent years, several studies demonstrated that antimicrobial treatment was not superior to withholding antibiotic therapy, in terms of clinical resolution, in patients with mild unperforated diverticulitis. The current consensus is that uncomplicated acute diverticulitis may be a self-limiting condition in which local host defenses can manage the inflammation without antibiotics in immunocompetent patients. In this context, antibiotics are not necessary in the treatment of uncomplicated disease.

A multicenter randomized trial was published in 2012 by Chabok et al. involving ten surgical departments in Sweden and one in Iceland recruiting 623 patients with computed tomography-confirmed acute uncomplicated left-sided diverticulitis. Patients were randomized to treatment with (314 patients) or without (309 patients) antibiotics. Antibiotic treatment for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis neither accelerated recovery nor prevented complications or recurrence. Therefore, antibiotics should be reserved for the treatment of complicated diverticulitis.

Omitting antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated ALCD did not result in more complicated diverticulitis, recurrent diverticulitis or sigmoid resections at long-term follow-up. As the DIABOLO trial was not powered for these secondary outcome measures, some uncertainty remains whether (small) non-significant differences could be true associations.

A systematic review and meta-analysis including 2469 patients (including elderly patients) with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis showed that treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis without antibiotics might be feasible with outcomes that are comparable to antibiotic treatment and with potential benefits for patients and the overall health economic system.

Furthermore, antibiotic use in patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis seems to increase the length of hospital stay.

Finally, current evidence does not support the administration of antibiotics to improve outcomes in carefully selected healthy patients with uncomplicated ALCD. However, this evidence comes from young patients (mean age in AVOD trial: 57; age range in DIABOLO trial: 48–64). For this reason, for elderly patients, the recommendation has very low-quality evidence. Further studies should help identify specific subpopulations of patients who would derive benefit from antibiotic therapy and help define appropriate antibiotic regimens and treatment durations that minimize cost, adverse effects, and risk of anti-microbial resistance. Due to the low event rate, it remains uncertain whether antibiotic treatment is necessary in cases with isolated pericolic gas, whether in young or elderly patients.

### Observational versus antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis: an individual-patient data meta-analysis [^116GwU69]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

This individual‐patient data meta‐analysis included 1109 patients, 545 in the observational group and 564 in the antibiotics group. Duration of follow‐up was comparable between the groups: 12.3 (i.q.r. 12.1–13.0) months in the observational group and 12.4 (12.1–13.0) months in the antibiotics group. Baseline characteristics were mostly comparable; however, primary diverticulitis was slightly but significantly more common in the antibiotics group (Table 2).

Table 2
Baseline characteristics of patients according to study group

Observational versus antibiotic treatment

The duration of stay for the initial hospital admission was slightly but non‐significantly shorter in the observational group compared with the antibiotics group (median 2 versus 3 days respectively; P = 0.037) (Table 3). Some 33 of 1109 patients (3.0 per cent) were treated as outpatients from the start of treatment. The rate of ongoing diverticulitis differed somewhat, but this difference failed to reach statistical significance: 7.2 per cent (39 of 545) in observational group versus 5.0 per cent (28 of 564) in the antibiotics group (P = 0.062). The rates of recurrent diverticulitis were comparable: 8.6 per cent (47 of 545) versus 9.6 per cent (54 of 564) respectively (P = 0.610). Complicated diverticulitis and sigmoid resection rates were recorded during the acute disease stage (within 1 month) and at 1‐year follow‐up. Rates of complicated diverticulitis within 1 month were comparable between groups: 1.8 per cent (10 of 545) in the observational group versus 1.1 per cent (6 of 564) in antibiotics group (P = 0.204); at 1‐year follow‐up they differed somewhat (by 10 patients), but non‐significantly: 4.0 per cent (22 of 545) versus 2.1 per cent (12 of 564) respectively (P = 0.079). Rates of sigmoid resection were no different between the groups at 1 month (0.6 per cent (3 of 545) versus 0.7 per cent (4 of 564); P = 0.818) or 1 year (5.0 per cent (27 of 545) versus 2.5 per cent (14 of 564); P = 0.214).

### Diagnosis and management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^114KKZGJ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis — initial care without antibiotics in select patients: ACP suggests that clinicians initially manage select patients with acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis without antibiotics (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). "Select" patients are defined as immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated left-sided diverticulitis, with no systemic inflammatory response or immunosuppression, who are not medically frail, do not require hospitalization, and can follow up as an outpatient under medical supervision with social and family support. For these patients, low-certainty evidence showed that there may be no differences in diverticulitis-related complications, quality of life, need for surgery, or long-term recurrence between those receiving and those not receiving antibiotics; initial management without antibiotics should be coupled with watchful waiting and ability to continue monitoring patient status, and this recommendation does not apply to patients with complicated diverticulitis, systemic inflammatory response, immunosuppression, or ongoing or recent antibiotic treatment. Implementation does not require a CT-confirmed diagnosis, but clinicians should err on the side of imaging in patients with signs and symptoms consistent with perforation, bleeding, obstruction, or abscess; the included studies did not report how many patients randomly assigned to watchful waiting needed antibiotics at follow-up (6, 12, 24 months and 11 years).

Our approach to the diagnosis and treatment of diverticulitis has evolved over the past 20 y. Routine use of antibiotics has decreased with recent studies suggesting simple cases of diverticulitis can be selectively managed without antibiotics. The criteria necessitating surgical intervention have also been amended as our understanding of the natural history of diverticulitis has grown. We favor selective use of antibiotics, percutaneous drainage, and surgery depending on the severity of the disease, patient factors, and clinical context.
