## Question

Fungal pneumonia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing suspected fungal pneumonia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about pretest probability and host risk stratification. Then, I should verify epidemiologic and exposure clues. Next, I will review clinical presentation and radiographic patterns. After that, I need to construct a tiered diagnostic algorithm, including when to escalate to bronchoscopy and biopsy. Then, I will consider special populations such as COVID-19, transplant, and HIV. Finally, I should outline empiric and targeted antifungal therapy, monitoring, and follow-up, while double-checking guideline concordance and correcting any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the foundation: pretest probability hinges on host factors, exposures, radiology, and the trajectory of illness, because fungal pneumonia is uncommon in immunocompetent hosts but increasingly recognized in immunocompromised patients and in endemic settings, and delays in diagnosis worsen outcomes, so I need to keep a high index of suspicion when the story fits [^115aCXmN].

> I need to check host risk categories carefully: hematologic malignancy, stem cell or solid organ transplantation, prolonged neutropenia, high-dose glucocorticoids, biologics like TNF-alpha inhibitors, and advanced HIV are major risks; inborn errors of immunity such as CGD, STAT3 deficiency, and IL-6 pathway defects also predispose to invasive fungal disease, and I should remember that severe viral pneumonia, especially influenza and COVID-19, creates a permissive environment for Aspergillus and Mucorales, so I must integrate these into pretest probability before ordering tests [^111PGijo] [^113MpCqD] [^112EL8Vs].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about geography; I should verify exposure risks and local epidemiology because coccidioidomycosis clusters in the Southwest, histoplasmosis in the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys, and blastomycosis in the Midwest and Southeast, and outdoor activities with soil disruption, construction, or decaying organic matter exposure increase risk; importantly, coccidioidomycosis accounts for a substantial fraction of CAP in endemic regions, so travel and occupational history are pivotal [^1178Tdat] [^117BMNPy] [^114cTZ4p].

> Next, I should review the clinical phenotype; wait, let me verify the symptom patterns because fungal pneumonias often mimic bacterial or viral CAP, with cough, dyspnea, fever, and chest pain, yet fever may be less prominent in some endemic mycoses and extrapulmonary clues like erythema nodosum or hyperhidrosis, when present, should raise suspicion; in immunocompromised hosts, presentations can be atypical or muted, so I must not anchor on classic bacterial CAP features [^115AD8Bk] [^115T7z2g].

> I will now examine imaging; chest radiography can be normal early, so if suspicion is high I should obtain a contrast-enhanced CT to look for nodules, consolidation, cavitation, halo or reversed halo signs, and air-crescent signs, recognizing that halo and reversed halo favor angioinvasive molds and that nodules may transiently enlarge early without true progression; I should double-check that these patterns are interpreted in the right host context to avoid overcalling colonization as disease [^115qQksU] [^116x7hTv] [^112VxisV].

> Let me think about a tiered diagnostic approach; for low-risk, immunocompetent patients with mild illness and no clear exposure, I should start with sputum culture and consider serology if endemic risk is plausible, escalating to antigen testing if illness persists; for high-risk hosts or severe disease, I should not delay bronchoscopy with BAL for galactomannan, Aspergillus PCR, and fungal culture, and add serum galactomannan and, when available, serum Aspergillus PCR; if results are negative but suspicion remains high, I should proceed to image-guided or surgical biopsy for histopathology and culture, because tissue invasion is the diagnostic gold standard for molds [^114GGrew] [^111zKyyo] [^113GkJo4] [^113QLQ7u] [^1151b2RT] [^1129HbTx] [^116gR8Fm].

> Wait, I should verify organism-specific testing nuances; for suspected histoplasmosis, urine and serum antigen testing provide rapid diagnostic yield, with serology as an adjunct in immunocompetent hosts; for blastomycosis, urine antigen and targeted antibody assays improve sensitivity; for coccidioidomycosis, a multimodal strategy with serology plus urine and serum antigen is recommended; for Pneumocystis, BAL PCR has excellent performance and combining with serum 1,3-beta-D-glucan can increase specificity; for Candida, I must avoid overcalling respiratory isolation as infection and seek histology or deep-site cultures before treating [^112F6LKy] [^113kjmTT] [^111tLN3j] [^117EZzQC] [^116m6Dcb] [^114nnFyP] [^111XZfkL].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of non-culture diagnostics; serum and BAL galactomannan have best evidence in high-risk hematology and transplant populations, with BAL outperforming serum, and false positives can occur with mucositis or certain antibiotics, so results must be integrated with host risk and imaging; breath volatile metabolite signatures for Aspergillus are intriguing but not yet standard of care, so I should not rely on them for decisions today [^111zKyyo] [^113GkJo4] [^1132kDM3].

> Let me consider special populations; in COVID-19, I need a low threshold for CAPA and CAM, given high mortality and the need for early BAL-based diagnostics; in transplant recipients, drug–drug interactions and nephrotoxicity constrain choices and prophylaxis strategies vary by center; in HIV, cryptococcosis and histoplasmosis rise as CD4 counts fall, so serum cryptococcal antigen and Histoplasma antigen testing should be front-loaded when compatible; in pediatrics, round pneumonia is usually bacterial, but immunocompromised children can have atypical fungal presentations, so I should tailor imaging and diagnostics to risk and severity [^113MpCqD] [^116Xp9rj] [^1127hwrq] [^116KR3a2] [^116tBkQw] [^112F6LKy] [^1139tUBc].

> I should double-check the diagnostic criteria framework for immunocompromised host pneumonia; the ATS workshop emphasizes that ICHP is a clinical-radiographic diagnosis in the right host, that pathogen identification is central but not mandatory to initiate therapy, and that invasive evaluation with BAL and/or biopsy should be pursued when feasible to guide targeted therapy and uncover immune defects, so I must balance speed with diagnostic yield [^115T7z2g] [^1138DXGc] [^113738cu].

> Now, empiric therapy; if a high-risk patient deteriorates and fungal pneumonia is strongly suspected, I should start mold-active therapy while diagnostics are pending, typically voriconazole for Aspergillus or isavuconazole if broader Mucorales coverage is desired or interactions preclude voriconazole; for suspected Pneumocystis, TMP-SMX is first-line; for severe endemic mycoses, lipid amphotericin B is appropriate until stabilized, with step-down to itraconazole or fluconazole based on species; I need to ensure therapeutic drug monitoring for triazoles and vigilance for hepatotoxicity, QT prolongation, and drug interactions, especially with immunosuppressants [^116p8m8H] [^111Mr7Yh] [^1176hL6B] [^112Z26Mq].

> But wait, what if the patient is immunocompetent with mild endemic mycosis; I should reconsider overtreatment because many cases are self-limited, and guidelines support observation for mild coccidioidal or histoplasma pneumonia, reserving antifungals for moderate to severe disease, progressive symptoms, or high-risk hosts; I need to align treatment with severity, comorbidities, and patient preference while ensuring close follow-up [^111Mr7Yh] [^1176hL6B].

> Next, I should review monitoring; early CT can expedite diagnosis in high-risk hosts, but I must avoid unnecessary serial imaging unless results will change management, as nodules may enlarge early without true progression; clinically, I will track fever curve, oxygenation, and symptoms, and repeat imaging at about 1–2 weeks if there is no improvement or if complications like cavitation or hemoptysis arise; I should confirm that my monitoring cadence matches the severity and pace of illness [^112VxisV].

> Finally, I need to ensure prevention and public health steps are addressed; in high-risk hematology patients, posaconazole or voriconazole prophylaxis reduces invasive mold infections; in endemic areas, patient education on exposure risks and symptom triggers can reduce delays; and during respiratory virus surges, heightened surveillance for secondary fungal infections is warranted given the excess mortality observed in COVID-19–associated fungal disease [^116p8m8H] [^114cTZ4p] [^1127hwrq].

Fungal pneumonia is a lung infection caused by fungi such as Histoplasma, Coccidioides, Blastomyces, Aspergillus, and Cryptococcus, with risk rising in immunocompromised hosts and those with environmental exposures [^115aCXmN] [^1139DzwE]. Diagnosis relies on **clinical suspicion plus imaging** [^113JQDfQ] and **targeted labs** (antigen/antibody, PCR, BAL) [^114GGrew], as symptoms and radiology often mimic bacterial pneumonia [^115AD8Bk] [^115qQksU]. Early, pathogen-specific therapy is essential — azoles for endemic mycoses [^111Mr7Yh], voriconazole or isavuconazole for aspergillosis [^116p8m8H], and amphotericin B for severe or disseminated disease — with outcomes closely tied to immune status and treatment timing [^1139DzwE] [^117NUaML].

---

## Etiology and epidemiology

Fungal pneumonia spans endemic and opportunistic pathogens; **endemic mycoses** (Histoplasma, Coccidioides, Blastomyces) are geographically restricted [^1139DzwE] and often cause community-acquired pneumonia [^117A4Jyx], whereas **opportunistic fungi** (Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, Pneumocystis, Mucorales) predominantly affect immunocompromised hosts [^116x7hTv] [^116KR3a2]. Risk increases with HIV/AIDS, hematologic malignancies, solid organ transplantation, corticosteroids, and TNF-α inhibitors [^111PGijo] [^116KR3a2] [^1161ZfrY].

---

## Clinical presentation

Symptoms are nonspecific and overlap with bacterial and viral pneumonia; **common features** include cough, dyspnea, fever, pleuritic chest pain, and hemoptysis [^114SmMQs] [^115MtdRt]. Immunocompromised patients may have **atypical or muted presentations**, including minimal fever or respiratory symptoms, which can delay diagnosis [^115T7z2g] [^111Zxxbp].

---

## Diagnostic methods

Diagnosis integrates clinical suspicion, imaging, and laboratory testing; **no single test is definitive**, so a multimodal approach is recommended [^114GGrew] [^112Z26Mq].

---

### Imaging

Chest radiography may show **nodules, consolidations, or cavitations** but is often nonspecific [^116gR8Fm] [^112yhoZd]. CT provides greater detail, with **halo sign, air-crescent sign, and reversed halo sign** suggesting invasive mold infection [^112VxisV].

---

### Laboratory tests

- **Antigen/antibody assays**: Histoplasma urine antigen, Blastomyces urine antigen, Coccidioides serology, and serum galactomannan for Aspergillus [^112F6LKy] [^117EZzQC] [^116m6Dcb] [^111zKyyo].
- **PCR**: Respiratory and blood PCR improve detection of Aspergillus, Pneumocystis, and other fungi [^113QLQ7u] [^114nnFyP] [^1151b2RT].
- **Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)**: Essential in immunocompromised hosts for culture, antigen testing, and PCR [^113GkJo4] [^1138DXGc].

---

## Treatment strategies

Treatment depends on the pathogen, severity, and host factors; **early, pathogen-directed therapy improves outcomes** [^113JQDfQ].

---

### Antifungal agents

- **Azoles**: Itraconazole, fluconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, and isavuconazole are first-line for many endemic and opportunistic infections [^111Mr7Yh] [^116jrckV] [^116p8m8H].
- **Amphotericin B**: Used for severe or disseminated disease, particularly in immunocompromised patients [^116jrckV].
- **Echinocandins**: Caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin for refractory Aspergillus or as part of combination therapy [^115PDHfX].

---

### Adjunctive therapies

Immune reconstitution and reduction of **immunosuppression** are critical where feasible [^116KR3a2]. Supportive care, including oxygen, ventilation, and management of complications, is essential [^116p8m8H].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis varies with pathogen, immune status, and treatment timing; **immunocompromised patients have higher mortality and risk of dissemination** [^112YJrWg]. Complications include respiratory failure, ARDS, chronic pulmonary damage, and dissemination to CNS or other organs [^115gTA3c] [^114mdvzp] [^115MtdRt].

---

## Prevention

Prevention focuses on **risk reduction and prophylaxis**. High-risk patients (e.g. hematologic malignancy, transplant) may receive antifungal prophylaxis [^116p8m8H]. Environmental precautions include avoiding high-risk exposures (e.g. construction sites, bird/bat roosts) in endemic areas [^115PDHfX]. Vaccination against influenza and COVID-19 reduces viral pneumonia–associated fungal risk [^notfound].

---

Fungal pneumonia is a **significant cause of morbidity and mortality**, especially in immunocompromised hosts. Early recognition, accurate diagnosis, and pathogen-specific therapy are essential to improve outcomes.

### A diagnostic approach to fungal pneumonia: an infectious diseases perspective [^115aCXmN]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Although bacteria significantly exceed fungi as the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infection, the incidence of fungal pneumonia is increasing because of a growing at-risk population of immunocompromised individuals as well as anthropogenic global heating and environmental disruption. When a patient presents with a clinical syndrome of pneumonia, a constellation of factors must be considered to determine the probability of a fungal pneumonia, including host factors, epidemiologic exposures, suggestive radiographic patterns, and the presence of a non-resolving pneumonia. In addition, knowledge of clinically important fungal pathogens, their epidemiology, and associated clinical syndromes are key in guiding appropriate diagnostic testing and result interpretation, and ultimately rendering a correct diagnosis of a fungal pneumonia. This article aims to provide a framework for the evaluation and appropriate diagnostic testing of patients with suspected fungal pneumonia.

### Pneumonia [^113JQDfQ]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2021). High credibility.

Pneumonia is a common acute respiratory infection that affects the alveoli and distal airways; it is a major health problem and associated with high morbidity and short-term and long-term mortality in all age groups worldwide. Pneumonia is broadly divided into community-acquired pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia. A large variety of microorganisms can cause pneumonia, including bacteria, respiratory viruses and fungi, and there are great geographical variations in their prevalence. Pneumonia occurs more commonly in susceptible individuals, including children of < 5 years of age and older adults with prior chronic conditions. Development of the disease largely depends on the host immune response, with pathogen characteristics having a less prominent role. Individuals with pneumonia often present with respiratory and systemic symptoms, and diagnosis is based on both clinical presentation and radiological findings. It is crucial to identify the causative pathogens, as delayed and inadequate antimicrobial therapy can lead to poor outcomes. New antibiotic and non-antibiotic therapies, in addition to rapid and accurate diagnostic tests that can detect pathogens and antibiotic resistance will improve the management of pneumonia.

### Endemic mycoses: overlooked causes of community acquired pneumonia [^114XXyDF]. Respiratory Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The endemic mycoses are important but often overlooked causes for community acquired pneumonia. Delays in recognition, diagnosis and proper treatment often lead to disastrous outcomes. This topic is not usually discussed in reviews and guidelines addressing the subject of community acquired pneumonia. In this review we discuss the three major endemic mycoses in North America that present as community acquired pneumonias; Coccidioidomycosis, Histoplasmosis and Blastomycosis. We discuss their epidemiology, clinical presentations, methods of diagnosis and current treatment strategies.

### CT findings of fungal pneumonia with emphasis on aspergillosis [^115qQksU]. Emergency Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Fungal pneumonias are increasingly common in the population of immunosuppressed patients. The diagnosis of fungal pneumonias represents a challenge for clinicians, and the morbidity and mortality of these infections are high in immunocompromised patients. CT findings may be nonspecific; however, in the appropriate clinical setting, they may suggest and even help establish the specific diagnosis. This article provides an overview about the CT findings and possible differential diagnosis of the most common pulmonary fungal infections.

### Invasive fungal pneumonia in immunocompromised patients [^116x7hTv]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Fungal pneumonia is the most frequent presentation of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) in patients with hematologic malignancies (HM) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients. The most common causes include Aspergillus, Mucor, Fusarium, and Candida species. The high incidence and high morbidity and mortality rate of fungal pneumonias in HM/HSCT populations arise from severe immune dysfunction that may be caused by both the underlying disease and/or its treatment. CT is routinely used when pulmonary complications are suspected after HSCT. Appropriate image interpretation of the posttransplant patient requires a combination of pattern recognition and knowledge of the clinical setting. In this article, we provide an overview of the clinical manifestations and CT imaging features of the most common invasive fungal pneumonias (IFPs) seen in severely immunosuppressed hosts.

### Recent advances in the epidemiology, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of fungal pneumonia [^115PDHfX]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Although pneumonia caused by fungi is not a common occurrence in the general population, disease in an enlarging immunocompromised population is encountered with increasing frequency. Fungal pneumonias are most frequently caused by Aspergillus spp., dimorphic fungi and Cryptococcus neoformans. Recent studies have identified risk factors of thrombocytopenia, environmental events (such as construction or renovation) and immunosuppressive drug therapies as being specific risk factors for invasive fungal disease in select patient populations. Diagnostic strategies to detect circulating antigens and polymerase chain reaction based detection systems have been explored to improve identification prior to the progressive advanced disease. Advances in prophylactic strategies include increased use of aerosolized formulations of amphotericin B, usually in conjunction with new and old systemic antifungal agents. Despite recent published guidelines for treatment of fungal pneumonia based on etiology, mortality remains high in some infections with advanced disease. Caspofungin, a new echinocandin antifungal, has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of invasive Aspergillus infections in patients unresponsive to or unable to receive amphotericin B. A triazole antifungal, voriconazole, has shown promise in phase III clinical trials in patients with refractory fungal infections and is expected to be available in early 2002. Other echinocandin and triazole antifungals are under development in attempts to provide improved effective therapy for fungal pneumonia.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to fungal testing (coccidioidomycosis), ATS 2019 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining more than one diagnostic test, including direct visualization and culture of sputum bronchoalveolar lavage or other biopsy material, urine and serum antigen testing, and serum antibody testing, in patients with appropriate geographic exposure and illness compatible with infection or pneumonia due to coccidioidomycosis. Tailor the testing approach to the severity of the illness, the clinical context, and the availability of tests.

### North American endemic fungal infections [^1139DzwE]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, and coccidioidomycosis are endemic fungal infections in North America. Many infections are subclinical, and many symptomatic infections are mild. Pneumonia is the most common clinical manifestation. All can occur in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients, with the latter at greater risk for disseminated and more severe disease. As with other acute respiratory illness, imaging can play a role in diagnosis. Knowledge of the acute and chronic imaging findings of endemic fungal infections is important for radiologists so that they can assist in establishing these often-elusive diagnoses, recognize normal evolution of imaging findings of infection, and identify complications.

### Imaging studies for diagnosing invasive fungal pneumonia in immunocompromised patients [^112VxisV]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim is to review imaging advances in invasive fungal pneumonia in cancer and transplant recipients and how their use can help guide treatment.

Recent Findings

Early chest computed tomographic (CT) imaging of immunocompromised patients with neutropenic fever leads to improved survival. Some of the typical CT findings of invasive fungal pneumonia are transitory and are most common during the first week of symptoms. The reversed halo sign, an early sign of disease, is more common in mucormycosis. During the first 10 days of infection, invasive fungal pneumonia nodules may grow on follow-up CT scans, but this does not necessarily equate to worsening disease. Because of the excessive radiation of chest CT and because pulmonary nodule size typically expands during the first few weeks of treatment, follow-up CT scans should be ordered only when therapy changes are dependent on imaging findings.

Summary

Early chest CT imaging in immunocompromised patients suspected of having invasive fungal pneumonia can help identify disease early, leading to improved outcome.

### The changing spectrum of fungal infections in pulmonary and critical care practice: clinical approach to diagnosis [^113vGC8Y]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2010). Low credibility.

Fungal lung infections are being diagnosed with increasing frequency. This is related to the increased numbers of immune-compromised and other susceptible patient groups. This article will focus on the evolving epidemiology of fungal lung infections and clinical manifestations that should prompt the clinician to consider the possibility of fungal lung infection. In addition, current approaches for the diagnosis of these infection are also reviewed. Heightened awareness of fungal lung infection, and appropriate use of the available diagnostic modalities, will permit appropriate treatment of these important clinical infections in immune-compromised individuals.

### Black fungus and beyond: COVID-19 associated infections [^116dkshE]. Clinical Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Globally, many hospitalized COVID-19 patients can experience an unexpected acute change in status, prompting rapid and expert clinical assessment. Superimposed infections can be a significant cause of clinical and radiologic deviations in this patient population, further worsening clinical outcome and muddling the differential diagnosis. As thrombotic, inflammatory, and medication-induced complications can also trigger an acute change in COVID-19 patient status, imaging early and often plays a vital role in distinguishing the cause of patient decline and monitoring patient outcome. While the common radiologic findings of COVID-19 infection are now widely reported, little is known about the clinical manifestations and imaging findings of superimposed infection. By discussing case studies of patients who developed bacterial, fungal, parasitic, and viral co-infections and identifying the most frequently reported imaging findings of superimposed infections, physicians will be more familiar with common infectious presentations and initiate a directed workup sooner. Ultimately, any abrupt changes in the expected COVID-19 imaging presentation, such as the presence of new consolidations or cavitation, should prompt further workup to exclude superimposed opportunistic infection.

### Symptoms in blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, and histoplasmosis versus other respiratory illnesses in commercially insured adult outpatients-United States, 2016–2017 [^115AD8Bk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, and histoplasmosis cause various symptoms and syndromes, which may present similarly to other infections such as bacterial or viral community-acquired pneumonia, influenza, and tuberculosis.

Methods

We used the IBM MarketScan Research Databases to identify adult outpatients with International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), diagnosis codes during 2016–2017 for blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, pneumonia (viral, bacterial, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and unspecified pneumonia), influenza; tuberculosis, and other lower and upper respiratory infections. We compared symptoms on and in the 90 days before diagnosis between patients with these diagnosis codes.

Results

Fever was less common in blastomycosis (2.6%), histoplasmosis (5.3%), and coccidioidomycosis (9.4%) than in patients with influenza (18.5%) or pneumonia (12.6–16.3%). Fungal diseases resembled bacterial, viral, and unspecified pneumonias for many pulmonary symptoms. However, cough was more common with coccidioidomycosis (31.4%) and less common with histoplasmosis (14.0%) and blastomycosis (13.1%) versus influenza (20.2%). Although less frequent, solitary pulmonary nodule (5.2–14.4%), enlarged lymph nodes (3.7–9.0%), hyperhidrosis (< 2%), and erythema nodosum (< 2%) were particularly suggestive of fungal diseases.

Conclusions

Despite limitations inherent in administrative coding, this analysis of symptom codes across disease types suggests that fungal diseases may be difficult to clinically distinguish from other causes of pneumonia except when certain uncommon symptoms are present. Healthcare providers caring for patients with pneumonia, especially if nonresponsive to conventional treatment, should consider fungal diseases as possible etiologies.

### An official ATS workshop report: emerging issues and current controversies in HIV-associated pulmonary diseases [^116tBkQw]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2011). Medium credibility.

Fungal pneumonias in HIV-associated pneumonia include Pneumocystis, Cryptococcus, Histoplasma, and Coccidioides as the most frequent etiologies, with Blastomyces, Aspergillus, and Penicillium also occurring; cryptococcosis occurs at advanced stages of HIV infection, and Cryptococcus neoformans is the usual pathogenic species in the U.S.; in HIV-infected patients with cryptococcal disease, meningitis with fever, weight loss, headache, and confusion is most common and pneumonia is less frequent; serum cryptococcal antigen tests can be useful in diagnosis, the organism can be cultured from respiratory secretions, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid, and fluconazole or itraconazole are recommended for initial treatment of mild pneumonia.

### Aspergillosis complicating severe coronavirus disease [^114j9r5Q]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 3
Schematic of coronavirus disease–associated pulmonary aspergillosis. Aspergillus conidia in airway are cleared poorly because of ≥ 1 defects in primary pulmonary immunity or secondary defenses, enabling conidial germination into hyphal morphotypes, which elicit increased inflammatory responses in the airway and potential invasion into the lungs. A mixed constellation of inflammatory to invasive airway disease, and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis leads to multiple manifestations, including tracheobronchitis and obstructive pneumonia, and complications of invasive fungal pneumonia (nodules, necrosis with cavities, pleural invasion). A) Airways. Aspergillus overgrowth causes pathologic airway inflammation and excess mucous production. B) Alveoli. Hyphal growth causes invasive pneumonia. C) Invasive aspergillosis tracheobronchitis postobstructive bacterial pneumonia.

Distinguishing between benign airway colonization and potential disease caused by Aspergillus spp. has always been difficult because conidia are common inhabitants of airways and do not always cause inflammatory or invasive disease. To improve the process of obtaining information about what constitutes disease, early efforts have been directed toward standardizing diagnostics and definitions by using a similar approach, as for IAA, which eliminates the classic immunocompromising host criteria and relies on BAL and serum antigen results to define certainty of disease. Cases reported in this study would be considered probable CAPA if tracheal aspirate or sputum cultures met microbiologic criteria. Although more efforts are required to clarify definitions, clinicians should understand that definitions are not meant to provide clinical guidance, but to support a metric to compare epidemiology and clinical trial data. Three prospective cohort studies suggest that treatment with antifungal drugs might improve clinical outcomes, but definitive evidence of clinical usefulness necessitates larger comparative studies that use antifungal drugs for prevention or early therapy.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to fungal testing (invasive aspergillosis), ATS 2019 guidelines recommend to obtain serum galactomannan testing in patients with severe immunocompromising conditions (such as neutropenia, hematological malignancy, or a history of hematological stem cell or solid organ transplantation) presenting with unexplained lung infiltrates suspected of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.

### Diagnosis of severe respiratory infections in immunocompromised patients [^115gTA3c]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

An increasing number of critically ill patients are immunocompromised. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (ARF), chiefly due to pulmonary infection, is the leading reason for ICU admission. Identifying the cause of ARF increases the chances of survival, but may be extremely challenging, as the underlying disease, treatments, and infection combine to create complex clinical pictures. In addition, there may be more than one infectious agent, and the pulmonary manifestations may be related to both infectious and non-infectious insults. Clinically or microbiologically documented bacterial pneumonia accounts for one-third of cases of ARF in immunocompromised patients. Early antibiotic therapy is recommended but decreases the chances of identifying the causative organism(s) to about 50%. Viruses are the second most common cause of severe respiratory infections. Positive tests for a virus in respiratory samples do not necessarily indicate a role for the virus in the current acute illness. Invasive fungal infections (Aspergillus, Mucorales, and Pneumocystis jirovecii) account for about 15% of severe respiratory infections, whereas parasites rarely cause severe acute infections in immunocompromised patients. This review focuses on the diagnosis of severe respiratory infections in immunocompromised patients. Special attention is given to newly validated diagnostic tests designed to be used on non-invasive samples or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and capable of increasing the likelihood of an early etiological diagnosis.

### Fungal pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients [^116KR3a2]. Respiratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Fungal pneumonia is a dreaded complication encountered after kidney transplantation, complicated by increased mortality and often associated with graft failure. Diagnosis can be challenging because the clinical presentation is non-specific and diagnostic tools have limited sensitivity and specificity in kidney transplant recipients and must be interpreted in the context of the clinical setting. Management is difficult due to the increased risk of dissemination and severity, multiple comorbidities, drug interactions and reduced immunosuppression which should be applied as an important adjunct to therapy. This review will focus on the main causes of fungal pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients including Pneumocystis, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, mucormycetes and Histoplasma. Epidemiology, clinical presentation, laboratory and radiographic features, specific characteristics will be discussed with an update on diagnostic procedures and treatment.

### Microbiological laboratory testing in the diagnosis of fungal infections in pulmonary and critical care practice. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1178Tdat]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis — epidemiology and risk factors: Coccidioidomycosis is an endemic mycosis caused by Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadasii, with highest incidence in the San Joaquin Valley in California, south-central Arizona, and northwestern Mexico, and it has emerged as a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with estimates that 15–30% of CAP in endemic areas is caused by Coccidioides. Immunosuppression is a major risk factor for dissemination and severe disease, and, unlike other endemic mycoses, ethnic (Filipino and African American) predisposition to dissemination is well characterized; cases have been increasing over the last decade among residents and visitors to endemic areas.

### Common and emerging fungal pulmonary infections [^112PeVgY]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Fungal pulmonary infections are becoming more prevalent as a consequence of the rising prevalence of immunocompromised patients. Besides ubiquitous opportunistic fungi such as Aspergillus spp and geographically delimited mycoses, fungi that were previously thought to be of uncertain pathogenicity, such as hyaline and dematiaceous molds, are increasingly being diagnosed as the causes of invasive disease in profoundly immunosuppressed hosts. Overall progress in the clinical management of fungal pulmonary infections has been slow compared with other areas of infectious diseases. However, recent encouraging advances in fungal diagnostics and therapeutics have resulted in improved clinical outcomes, particularly in vulnerable patient populations such as solid organ or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. This article provides an overview of endemic mycoses and other emerging fungal pulmonary infections. Recent developments in terms of the diagnosis and clinical management of these infections are also discussed.

Consensus statement — immunocompromised host pneumonia (ICHP) diagnosis requires clinical suspicion of a lung infection, with or without compatible clinical signs and symptoms, and with radiographic evidence of a new or worsening pulmonary infiltrate; the panel determined that the formal diagnostic criteria for ICHP would be best presented as an algorithm, with an approach for hosts with a known immune defect determined by compatible clinical presentation, possible pathogen identification, and exclusion of competing causes of the clinical, microbiologic, and radiographic manifestations, and an alternate algorithm for patients without previously known immune defects who present with evidence of pneumonia caused by an unusual opportunistic pathogen; additionally, clarifying statement 1 notes that clinical presentations of pneumonia are often atypical in immunocompromised hosts, therefore signs and symptoms of pneumonia are not required.

Coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and blastomycosis are lower respiratory tract fungal infections whose signs and symptoms can resemble those of other respiratory illnesses, including pneumonia caused by bacterial or viral etiologies; this overlap in clinical presentation might lead to missed or delayed diagnoses. The causative fungi live in the environment, often in soil or plant matter. To describe the epidemiologic characteristics of cases of coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and blastomycosis during the COVID-19 pandemic, CDC analyzed case surveillance data for 2019–2021. During this period, a total of 59,655 coccidioidomycosis cases, 3,595 histoplasmosis cases, and 719 blastomycosis cases were reported to CDC. In 2020, fewer cases of each disease occurred in spring compared with other seasons, and most cases occurred in fall; national seasonality is not typically observed, and cases were seasonally distributed more evenly in 2019 and 2021. Fewer cases coinciding with the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, along with an unusually high blastomycosis case fatality rate in 2021 (17% compared with more typical rates of 8%-10%), suggest that the pandemic might have affected patients' health care-seeking behavior, public health reporting practices, or clinical management of these diseases. Increased awareness and education are needed to encourage health care providers to consider fungal diseases and to identify pneumonia of fungal etiology. Standardized diagnostic guidance and informational resources for fungal testing could be incorporated into broader respiratory disease awareness and preparedness efforts to improve early diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and blastomycosis.

### A breath fungal secondary metabolite signature to diagnose invasive aspergillosis [^1132kDM3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Invasive aspergillosis (IA) remains a leading cause of mortality in immunocompromised patients, in part due to the difficulty of diagnosing this infection.

Methods

Using thermal desorption-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, we characterized the in vitro volatile metabolite profile of Aspergillus fumigatus, the most common cause of IA, and other pathogenic aspergilli. We prospectively collected breath samples from patients with suspected invasive fungal pneumonia from 2011 to 2013, and assessed whether we could discriminate patients with proven or probable IA from patients without aspergillosis, as determined by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group consensus definitions, by direct detection of fungal volatile metabolites in these breath samples.

Results

The monoterpenes camphene, α- and β-pinene, and limonene, and the sesquiterpene compounds α- and β-trans-bergamotene were distinctive volatile metabolites of A. fumigatus in vitro, distinguishing it from other pathogenic aspergilli. Of 64 patients with suspected invasive fungal pneumonia based on host risk factors, clinical symptoms, and radiologic findings, 34 were diagnosed with IA, whereas 30 were ultimately diagnosed with other causes of pneumonia, including other invasive mycoses. Detection of α-trans-bergamotene, β-trans-bergamotene, a β-vatirenene-like sesquiterpene, or trans-geranylacetone identified IA patients with 94% sensitivity (95% confidence interval, 81%-98%) and 93% specificity (95% CI, 79%-98%).

Conclusions

In patients with suspected fungal pneumonia, an Aspergillus secondary metabolite signature in breath can identify individuals with IA. These results provide proof-of-concept that direct detection of exogenous fungal metabolites in breath can be used as a novel, noninvasive, pathogen-specific approach to identifying the precise microbial cause of pneumonia.

### Fungal pneumonias in transplant recipients [^114tri3W]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Fungi are ubiquitous in the environment. Opportunistic fungal pneumonias in the immunocompromised host continue to increase most commonly due to Aspergillus sp. Affected patients are usually hematopoietic stem cell and lung transplant recipients. Clinical presentation is protean, and the diagnosis is challenging. Culture of respiratory specimens has limited utility. The detection of circulating fungal antigens and DNA seems promising, but more studies are needed. Value of prophylactic strategies or preemptive therapy remains contentious. New antifungal drugs for managing invasive pulmonary aspergillosis continue to emerge, with better safety, efficacy, and pharmacologic profiles.

Abstract

Coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and blastomycosis are lower respiratory tract fungal infections whose signs and symptoms can resemble those of other respiratory illnesses, including pneumonia caused by bacterial or viral etiologies; this overlap in clinical presentation might lead to missed or delayed diagnoses.

### Disease-specific gaps within fungal respiratory tract infections: clinical features, diagnosis, and management in critically ill patients [^113jYNBe]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We aim to examine the most recent findings in the area of invasive pulmonary fungal infections to determine the appropriate/and or lack of prevention measures and treatment of upper fungal respiratory tract infections in the critically ill.

Recent Findings

This will be addressed by focusing on the pathogens and prognosis over different bedridden periods in ICU patients, the occurrence of invasive fungal respiratory superinfections in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 which has been recently noted following the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Relevant reports referenced within include randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, observational studies, systematic reviews, and international guidelines, where applicable. Of note, it is clear there is a significant gap in our knowledge regarding whether bacterial and fungal infections in coronavirus disease 2019 are directly attributable to SARS-CoV-2 or a consequence of factors such as managing high numbers of critically unwell patients, and the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation/ICU admission duration of stay.

Summary

An optimal diagnostic algorithm incorporating fungal biomarkers and molecular tools for early and accurate diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia, invasive aspergillosis, candidemia, and endemic mycoses continues to be limited clinically. There is a lack of standardized molecular approach to identify fungal pathogens directly in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues and suboptimal diagnostic approaches for mould blood cultures, tissue culture processing for Mucorales, and fungal respiratory cultures (i.e., the routine use of bronchoscopic examination in ICU patients with influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis) for fungal point-of-care testing to detect and identify new, emerging or underrecognized, rare, or uncommon fungal pathogens.

### Cavitary lung diseases: a clinical-radiologic algorithmic approach [^112yhoZd]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Cavities occasionally are encountered on thoracic images. Their differential diagnosis is large and includes, among others, various infections, autoimmune conditions, and primary and metastatic malignancies. We offer an algorithmic approach to their evaluation by initially excluding mimics of cavities and then broadly classifying them according to the duration of clinical symptoms and radiographic abnormalities. An acute or subacute process (< 12 weeks) suggests common bacterial and uncommon nocardial and fungal causes of pulmonary abscesses, necrotizing pneumonias, and septic emboli. A chronic process (≥ 12 weeks) suggests mycobacterial, fungal, viral, or parasitic infections; malignancy (primary lung cancer or metastases); or autoimmune disorders (rheumatoid arthritis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis). Although a number of radiographic features can suggest a diagnosis, their lack of specificity requires that imaging findings be combined with the clinical context to make a confident diagnosis.

Introduction

Coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and blastomycosis are fungal infections that cause illness with primarily respiratory presentation ranging from mild symptoms to severe pulmonary or disseminated disease. The causative fungi live in soil and plant matter, and transmission usually occurs through inhalation of aerosolized spores. These diseases are typically limited to specific geographic ranges, but these ranges might be expanding because of climate change. Coccidioidomycosis primarily occurs in the southwestern United States, whereas histoplasmosis and blastomycosis are more commonly acquired in central and eastern states.

Diagnosis of these infections is challenging. Clinical signs and symptoms commonly resemble those of other respiratory infections, including COVID-19 and bacterial or viral community-acquired pneumonia, and laboratory tests might be difficult to access and interpret. Consequently, patients commonly can experience missed or delayed diagnosis and treatment, which can lead to persistent symptoms, severe disease, and adverse health outcomes.

Coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and blastomycosis are reportable in certain states. Each state designates reportable diseases, mandating health care providers and laboratories to notify public health departments of diagnosed cases or positive laboratory test results. Cases are classified according to the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists' case definitions. * For nationally notifiable diseases such as coccidioidomycosis, states and the District of Columbia voluntarily submit case data to CDC through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS).

The 2019 U.S. surveillance data for these fungal infections indicated that males and certain racial and ethnic populations were disproportionately affected. No pronounced national seasonality was observed. Histoplasmosis and blastomycosis were associated with high hospitalization and case fatality rates.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many persons avoided or delayed seeking medical care because of concerns regarding disease transmission and busy medical facilities. Although few cases of coinfection with COVID-19 and coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, or blastomycosis have been reported, how the COVID-19 pandemic might have otherwise affected acquisition, diagnosis, patient outcomes, and reporting of these diseases is not known. This report summarizes 2019–2021 U.S. surveillance data for coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and blastomycosis and examines epidemiologic changes that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with prepandemic data.

### Nucleic acid-based testing for noninfluenza viral pathogens in adults with suspected community-acquired pneumonia. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^117A4Jyx]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Nonviral target pathogens in suspected CAP — diagnostic considerations are highlighted as the panel recognizes the clinical importance and diagnostic challenges of detecting nonviral pathogens, noting that rapid molecular tests may improve etiologic diagnosis and selection of antimicrobials. "Atypical" bacterial pathogens such as Legionella spp, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae are common causes of CAP with distinct antimicrobial-susceptibility profiles, and in endemic regions and high-risk patients rapid molecular testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis likely improves diagnostic accuracy and informs infection prevention. Specific fungal pathogens, including coccidioidomycosis in the American Southwest and histoplasmosis and blastomycosis in the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys, can be common causes of CAP, and although specific recommendations are beyond the scope of this document, the panel notes these organisms may also be detected by some NAAT arrays and recognizes that a potential further benefit may exist.

### Microbiological laboratory testing in the diagnosis of fungal infections in pulmonary and critical care practice. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^114mdvzp]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Blastomycosis is caused by Blastomyces dermatitidis, a dimorphic fungus endemic to the central and southeastern United States, resulting in acute, subacute, and chronic lung infections and much less commonly in the adult respiratory distress syndrome or severe diffuse pneumonia. Most presentations are far less severe, such as lobar pneumonia, masslike consolidations, nodules, or chronic fibrocavitary disease. Dissemination from the lung is uncommon, but spread to skin, bone, genitourinary tract, and uncommonly the central nervous system can occur. In immunosuppressed patients, the disease is accelerated and can be life threatening. Accurate diagnosis of blastomycosis can be challenging, and successful diagnosis may employ cytopathological visualization of organisms from respiratory secretions and BAL, culture, serum antibody testing, antigen testing approaches, and more recently PCR strategies. Effective diagnosis is essential for implementing appropriate therapeutic agents. Comprehensive review of the literature revealed relatively few studies addressing this topic. In particular, studies directly comparing various traditional diagnostic modalities, such as visualization of B. dermatitidis and culture, with recent diagnostic strategies, particularly antigen testing, were not found. In addition, literature reviews of antibody testing included a variety of test strategies and assays. Accordingly, our approach for these guideline recommendations employs a narrative of our review of the relevant studies of the major testing strategies that met our criteria for inclusion in this review.

Implications for Public Health Practice

Increased awareness is needed to improve prompt diagnosis and treatment of coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and blastomycosis, particularly during periods of increased incidence of other respiratory diseases. To reduce misdiagnosis of these three fungal infections, standardized diagnostic guidance and informational resources for pan-respiratory testing, including fungal diseases, are needed and could be incorporated into broader respiratory disease awareness and preparedness efforts. Education to help clinicians distinguish fungal pneumonia from other respiratory infections might improve accurate diagnosis. Enhanced and expanded surveillance can also improve understanding of risk factors and epidemiologic trends to help guide efforts to raise awareness and improve diagnosis, management, and patient outcomes.

Background information about coccidioidomycosis — organism biology and early pulmonary infection are summarized as follows: Coccidioides species are dimorphic fungi that cause coccidioidomycosis, growing in the environment as mycelia that produce single-cell arthroconidia and, after mammalian infection, transforming into spherules that revert back to mycelial growth if cultured. Virtually all coccidioidal infections are initiated by inhalation of an arthroconidium, and the most common initial syndrome is that of a respiratory illness.

Immunocompromised host pneumonia — microbiologic testing and invasive evaluation: Diagnosis of ICHP does not require detection of a causative microorganism, and timely identification of an etiology should not delay empiric therapy if prompt treatment is dictated by the clinical situation; however, concerted efforts should be made to identify a specific pathogen through available culture-dependent and -independent methods. This often involves bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and/or transbronchial biopsies to evaluate for typical and opportunistic pathogens as well as alternative noninfectious diagnoses. Identification of an opportunistic organism in the lungs should prompt evaluation for an underlying host immune defect, and detection of an unusual pathogen in an apparently normal host may indicate an underlying immune defect; examples include invasive aspergillosis without apparent risk factors prompting investigation into PID because of inborn errors of immunity.

### Hemoptysis in a patient with elevated immunoglobulin E [^117TY5xf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Recurrent pneumonia with cavitation leading to pneumatoceles, secondary fungal infections, and hemoptysis are major causes of mortality and morbidity in patients with hyper-IgE syndrome. Prevention and aggressive treatment of pneumonia in these patients are essential to prevent further lung damage, but treatment may be delayed because the classic signs/symptoms of infection such as fever, chills, or rigors may be lacking. Early imaging to identify infection is essential for diagnosis and treatment. The mainstay of therapy is continuous, full-dose daily trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and commonly fungal coverage. Because hyper-IgE syndrome is a progressive disease, patients' condition may worsen despite compliance with prophylactic therapy.

### British society for medical mycology best practice recommendations for the diagnosis of serious fungal diseases: 2025 update [^112Z26Mq]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

The fungal diagnostic landscape is evolving; whereas previously, traditional culture-based methods dominated, most invasive fungal disease is now diagnosed with non-culture-based tests, including direct microscopy, antigen, antibody, and molecular assays, supported by histopathology and radiology. Access to and turnaround time of diagnostic tests and their clinical implementation varies across the UK. The British Society for Medical Mycology convened an expert group to update its 2015 best practice guidance. Guidance on histopathology and radiology investigations remain unchanged from the 2015 standards of care. For each mycological test, we include test-specific commentaries and accompanying tables, with expected turnaround times (sample collection to reporting). Based on recent evidence, new or stronger recommendations include use of Pneumocystis PCR; 1,3-β-D-glucan testing for suspected invasive candidiasis and Pneumocystis pneumonia; higher volume respiratory sample cultures; Aspergillus antigen or antibody-based testing in expanded clinically vulnerable populations, including patients in intensive care units and patients with chronic respiratory disease (including asthma); use of Candida PCR and Mucorales PCR in specific contexts; pan-fungal PCR and DNA sequencing for fungal identification from positive microscopy or histopathology specimens; and inclusion of posaconazole and isavuconazole in therapeutic antifungal monitoring recommendations. We discuss integration of diagnostic tests with antifungal stewardship and common clinical scenarios. Although recommendations focus on adults and UK practice, use in paediatric populations and worldwide applicability is discussed. Recommendations are presented as auditable standards to facilitate implementation and quality improvement measures. An emphasis on integration of combined diagnostics with antifungal stewardship and clinical pathways extends guideline relevance beyond microbiology laboratories to clinicians investigating patients with multimorbidity and suspected fungal disease within increasingly complex health-care systems.

### Bacterial and fungal infections in COVID-19 patients: a matter of concern [^11691NQT]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor — Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic. As of April 2, 2020, a total of 896,450 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported. The death toll from COVID-19 has soared quickly: 45,526 deaths have been reported globally, including 24,692 deaths in only a week (March 26, 2020, through April 2, 2020). Age, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, and D-dimer are the main prognostic factors of COVID-19 patients. The presence of bacterial and/or fungal secondary infection or coinfection is likely another important factor affecting mortality, and it has received inadequate attention.

Bacterial and fungal infections are common complications of viral pneumonia, especially in critically ill patients. They lead to increased need for intensive care and increased mortality. In influenza patients, bacterial coinfection occurs in ~0.5% of healthy young individuals and at least 2.5% of older individuals. A systematic review revealed that ~1 in 4 H1N1 patients during the 2009 pandemic had a bacterial or fungi infection infection. Data regarding the bacterial or fungi infection in viral pneumonia led by coronavirus are limited. According to the cohort study report by Zhong Nanshan et al,20 of 90 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients had secondary lower respiratory tract infections in 2003, which accounted for 70.6% of those critical SARS patients who underwent an invasive operation. The pathogens causing secondary infections in SARS patients were diverse: negative bacilli were the most common but Candida was also common. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis was another common complication secondary to influenza.

Bacterial and fungal infections in COVID-19 patients have been inadequately investigated and reported thus far. Among the hundreds of articles published with clinical data, only a few have reported secondary infection, mostly without detailed pathogens (Table 1). Even in studies for which secondary infection data are available, the antibiotics use rate (94%–100%) was much higher than the reported incidence of secondary infection (10%–15%). In addition, the complication of bacterial or fungal infection was not included in the prognosis analysis in most published papers. Moreover, most of the current infection control protocols aim to prevent the transmission and cross infection by SARS-CoV-2, missing the prevention of bacterial or fungal secondary infection. In fact, secondary infection was found in 50% of nonsurviving COVID-19 patients.

1 INTRODUCTION

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) is a novel β‐coronavirus, identified to consist the main pathogenic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), an ongoing pandemic, challenging the public health system worldwide. SARS‐CoV‐2 primarily affects the respiratory system and causes viral pneumonia, which can lead to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The involvement of extrapulmonary organs, during the course of the disease, has been also described in the literature.

Beyond the pathogenesis of SARS‐CoV‐2, respiratory coexisting infections with viruses, bacteria, and fungi have been reported, but their role in diagnosis, clinical presentation, and prognosis of the disease remains unclear. Preliminary evidence shows that microbial copathogens may increase the morbidity and mortality of COVID‐19, especially in critically ill patients. Thus, the difficulty to adjudicate in the presence of a respiratory superinfection, the clinical relevance of the identified microorganisms, and the antimicrobial treatment remains challenging.

### Fungal pneumonia in patients with hematologic malignancies: current approach and management [^117NUaML]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Fungal pneumonia is the most frequent presentation of invasive mold infections (IMIs) in patients with hematologic malignancies. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of fungal pneumonia and improvement in the outcome of such patients.

Recent Findings

The epidemiology of IMIs in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients has evolved in response to changes in conditioning regimens, increasing use of alternative sources of stem cells and antifungal prophylaxis, among other factors. PCR analysis and serologic tests, used in combination with imaging findings, have improved the timing and accuracy of diagnosis of these infections. Recent guidelines incorporated evidence-based treatment recommendations; however, application in real world situations is often difficult. A new treatment approach known as preemptive therapy, based on screening with biomarkers combined with early clinical and imaging findings, is being compared with the traditional empirical therapy in neutropenic patients with persistent or recurrent fever. The use of new triazoles and prompt diagnosis has contributed to improved outcomes in these patients. In addition, therapeutic drug monitoring may be useful when administering voriconazole.

Summary

Evidence-based diagnosis and treatment of fungal pneumonia in patients with hematologic malignancies are becoming increasingly institution-specific and patient-specific, integrating host factors, new diagnostic methods, and epidemiologic and pharmacologic considerations.

Coccidioidomycosis — multimodal diagnostic strategy. In patients with appropriate geographic exposure and illness compatible with infection or pneumonia due to coccidioidomycosis, we suggest using more than one diagnostic test, including direct visualization and culture of sputum BAL or other biopsy material, urine and serum antigen testing, and serology (serum antibody testing). The current evidence cannot support a single best test. The approach should be tailored on the basis of severity of illness, the clinical context, and the availability of tests (conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). In patients with suspected coccidioidomycosis, particularly in immunocompromised patients, we suggest performing urinary and serum antigen testing to aid in establishing the diagnosis (conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111XZfkL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Candida isolated from the respiratory tract — antifungal treatment guidance and diagnostic notes: Growth of Candida from respiratory secretions usually indicates colonization and rarely requires treatment with antifungal therapy (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Isolation from the respiratory tract is commonly encountered in ICU or tracheostomy patients and almost always reflects colonization of the airways and not infection. Candida pneumonia and lung abscess are very uncommon, and only rarely after aspiration of oropharyngeal material has primary Candida pneumonia or abscess been documented. When Candida is isolated from respiratory samples in a severely immunosuppressed patient, this should trigger a search for evidence of invasive candidiasis. Although isolation from a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimen can support the diagnosis, a firm diagnosis requires histopathological evidence of invasive disease.

### The epidemiological characteristics of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and risk factors for treatment failure: a retrospective study [^115sXv5t]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Aspergillus is widely found in nature and spreads through spores. Aspergillus infections in the lungs often cause Aspergillus pneumonia, which is the second most common fungal infection in hospitalized patients. Pulmonary aspergillosis (PA) is caused mainly by inhalation of Aspergillus and infection with Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger. PA mainly includes invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), subacute invasive aspergillosis (SAIA) and chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA). In recent years, reports of PA have increased in patients without neutropenia, including in patients with bronchiectasis, tuberculosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and cancer and those using glucocorticoids or immunosuppressants. The clinical symptoms and imaging findings of early PA are not typical, the diagnosis is difficult, and the misdiagnosis rate and mortality rate are high. Once symptoms appear, they develop into a more severe form of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Owing to the lack of specificity in the clinical manifestations of the disease, diagnosis is often delayed. In addition, owing to the presence of multiple virulence factors and complex pathogenic mechanisms of Aspergillus, the prognosis of Aspergillus is poor, and the mortality rate is as high as 30–95%.

The latest European Research and Treatment of Cancer Tissue and Mycosis Research Group (EORTC/MSG) guidelines suggest that in addition to the traditional galactomannan antigen (GM) test for Aspergillus culture, blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests can also be used for Aspergillus detection to further improve the diagnosis rate. The improvement of detection methods has continuously increased the clinical diagnosis rate of IPA and can also enable patients to receive early treatment.

We included patients who were diagnosed with IPA in our department over the past 6 years. The most common clinical features of IPA were analysed for early detection and diagnosis. To further evaluate the prognosis of IPA and explore the risk factors affecting prognosis, more powerful data for clinical treatment are needed. The included patients were all treated with voriconazole, efficacy was evaluated after 12 weeks of treatment, and risk factors affecting prognosis were also identified. The main objective was to determine these prognostic risk factors to achieve good treatment outcomes for patients.

### Fungal fog in viral storms: necessity for rigor in aspergillosis diagnosis and research [^116Xp9rj]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Imagine reading a study that investigates the incidence of myocardial infarction among smokers hospitalized for acute chest pain. The authors report that only a minority of the patients received cardiovascular work-up with at least an ECG. They observe a low incidence of myocardial infarction and consequently conclude that myocardial infarction is infrequent in that at-risk population.

We could even take it a step further: imagine the same study, but now the authors do not even mention how many patients received cardiovascular work-up; nonetheless, their conclusion remains the same.

What would you think of the validity of such studies? Presumably, in many research fields, such studies would not survive peer review. Common sense would require us to ask the authors to clearly report how many patients received the necessary work-up to establish a diagnosis, and to adapt their conclusions about disease incidence accordingly.

This common sense does not seem to apply to the research field of influenza- or coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA or CAPA). Indeed, the extreme variation in reported incidences of these fungal superinfections in patients with severe viral pneumonia have partly been attributed to variations in diagnostic approaches. This is a major issue because mycological diagnosis of IAPA and CAPA relies heavily on BAL sampling, given the limited sensitivity of serum galactomannan. Consequently, if one does not actively look for IAPA or CAPA, one will not find it. Not only the depth of fungal work-up differs, as we noted that in many observational studies essential information for calculating the incidence is missing, namely the proportion of patients who received BAL sampling.

### A case report of fungal infection associated acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonitis [^1176pygX]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Currently, corticosteroid therapy is the most common and effective treatment for AFOP, as in this case. There is no consensus on the dosage or duration of corticosteroids. Various regimens have been used depending on the severity and progression of the disease. The long-term effects of corticosteroids have not been established; therefore, monitoring the disease progression is recommended, and reassessments may be necessary. Although there are no standard treatment guidelines for patients with penicilliosis, the first-choice treatment regimen is 0.6 mg/kg/day amphotericin B for 2 weeks, followed by oral itraconazole for 10 weeks. Voriconazole should not be considered first-line for the empiric treatment of P. citrinum. The high MIC of P. citrinum isolate in our patient, which is consistent with previous reports, may partly explain why the initial administration of voriconazole was ineffective. Therefore, early antifungal susceptibility testing is essential for appropriate treatment to improve clinical outcomes. Significant relief of symptoms and improvement in radiological findings after the administration of corticosteroids and amphotericin B indicated that the patient received appropriate therapy. However, the patient was treated with corticosteroids and antifungal agents together, it is difficult to understand the effectiveness of antifungal administration.

In summary, we reported an unusual case of AFOP and fungal pneumonia. If clinical symptoms and chest imaging features are unresponsive to broad-spectrum antibiotics, a lung biopsy could be considered and timely performed. As this common "contaminant" can behave as a pathogen in an immunocompromised state, both clinicians and microbiologists should consider the presence of a serious and potentially fatal fungal infection on isolation of P. citrinum. Based on this case, it could be speculated that AFOP may occur in association with fungal infection including P. citrinum. Our speculation improves the understanding of AFOP. Whether or not P. citrinum infection is a risk factor of AFOP needs to be clarified with more investigations and further experiments.

### Diagnosis of invasive fungal disease in coronavirus disease 2019: approaches and pitfalls [^112CUaYy]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review will comment on the current knowledge for the diagnosis of the main causes of COVID-19-associated invasive fungal disease (IFD); it will discuss the optimal strategies and limitations and wherever available, will describe international recommendations.

Recent Findings

A range of secondary IFDs complicating COVID-19 infection have been described and while COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis was predicted, the presentation of significant numbers of COVID-19-associated candidosis and COVID-19-associated mucormycosis was somewhat unexpected. Given the range of IFDs and prolonged duration of risk, diagnostic strategies need to involve multiple tests for detecting and differentiating various causes of IFD. Although performance data for a range of tests to diagnose COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis is emerging, the performance of tests to diagnose other IFD is unknown or based on pre-COVID performance data.

Summary

Because of the vast numbers of COVID-19 infections, IFD in COVID-19 critical-care patients represents a significant burden of disease, even if incidences are less than 5%. Optimal diagnosis of COVID-19-associated IFD requires a strategic approach. The pandemic has highlighted the potential impact of IFD outside of the typical high-risk clinical cohorts, given the ever-increasing population at risk of IFD and enhanced surveillance of fungal infections is required.

Blastomycosis — multimodal diagnostic testing recommendation: In patients with appropriate geographic exposure and illness compatible with infection or pneumonia due to blastomycosis, we suggest using more than one diagnostic test (direct visualization and culture of sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or other biopsy material, urine antigen testing, and serum antibody testing), and tailoring the approach based on severity, clinical context, and test availability (conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). A technical remark states that microscopic visualization and culture are quite specific but lack sensitivity; adding serum antibody and urine antigen testing increases overall diagnostic yield.

Pneumonia and complicated pneumonia

Pneumonia is the main cause of death in children under 5 years worldwide. Pathogens include bacterial, viral, or fungal microorganisms. A presumptive diagnosis of the pathogens can be made based on the child's age and whether it was a community or nosocomial pneumonia (Table 3). Clinical symptoms include cough, fever, and shortness of breath, while neonates may present with symptoms resembling other conditions like TTN, RDS, or MAS. In community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), imaging is not required for the diagnosis, unless there is no response to outpatient treatment, which requires hospital admission due to suspected complications.

* Higher incidence of necrosis and empyema

Radiography helps in detecting nosocomial pneumonia and identifying radiological patterns. Typical CR and CT findings of lobar pneumonia, bronchopneumonia and interstitial pneumonia are shown in detail in Table 4. However, these patterns lack sensitivity and specificity for determining aetiology. A unique type of pneumonia seen only in children is round pneumonia, which presents as a round opacity on CR, typically in contact with the pleura, hilum, or pulmonary fissure. This form of pneumonia is most commonly caused by bacteria, with Streptococcus pneumoniae responsible for about 90% of cases. Round pneumonia predominantly affects children between the ages of 5 and 12 years, as the incomplete development of collateral ventilation predisposes this age group to the condition (Fig. 8).

### Non-metastatic causes of multiple pulmonary nodules [^115Wre5K]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Tuberculoma, which is a rare mass or nodule caused by TB, is often seen as a single nodule in the upper lobe and may contain calcification (Fig. 1), usually appearing as a sharp-edged and rounded opacity. Multiple bilateral noncavitated pulmonary macronodules of tuberculomas are highly unusual in pulmonary TB. This presentation is mostly seen in patients with impaired immune system age-affinity. Thus, the presence of multiple larger pulmonary nodules is considered metastases, especially in patients with primary cancer. Although TB with the presentation of multiple pulmonary nodules is rare, it should be considered during differential diagnosis in developing countries and in patients with impaired immune system. The presence of centrilobular or satellite micronodules around multiple larger nodules and the presence of nodules in typical locations, such as the apical and posterior segments of the upper lobes or superior segments of the lower lobes, are the major radiological findings for the differential diagnosis of TB nodules. Concomitant cavitation or calcification within nodules and clinical findings may also be useful for correct diagnosis.

Fungal infection

Fungal infection is a common condition in all populations. Lung involvement in fungal infection is common. The presentations of fungal infection vary between immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. Various fungi are the causative agents for pulmonary fungal infections. Pulmonary aspergillosis, candidiasis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, cryptococcosis, and mucormycosis are the most frequent fungal diseases. The most common fungal disease in immunocompromised individuals is pulmonary aspergillosis. The mortality rates of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis are high in immunocompromised patients. The clinical symptoms of these infections are nonspecific and can include dyspnea, fatigue, cough, and even hemoptysis. The diagnosis of the infection may be delayed due to the low sensitivity of laboratory tests and nonspecific symptoms, requiring a biopsy analysis. The immunological competence of the patient is correlated with the severity of fungal infections in pathological samples, which are characterized by necrotizing or non-necrotizing granulomas, cellular interstitial pneumonia, intra-alveolar foamy material, or minimal inflammatory alterations.

### Intensive care management of influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis [^116p8m8H]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe pulmonary infections are among the most common reasons for admission to intensive care units (ICU). Within the last decade, increasing reports of severe influenza pneumonia resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) complicated by Aspergillus infection were published.

Objectives

To provide a comprehensive review of management of influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis in patients with ARDS.

Sources

Review of the literature pertaining to severe influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis. PubMed database was searched for publications from the database inception to January 2019.

Content

In patients with lower respiratory symptoms, development of respiratory insufficiency should trigger rapid and thorough clinical evaluation, in particular in cases of suspected ARDS, including electrocardiography and echocardiography to exclude cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias and ischaemia. Bronchoalveolar lavage should obtain lower respiratory tract samples for galactomannan assay, direct microscopy, culture, and bacterial, fungal and viral PCR. In case of positive Aspergillus testing, chest CT is the imaging modality of choice. If influenza pneumonia is diagnosed, neuraminidase inhibitors are the preferred approved drugs. When invasive aspergillosis is confirmed, first-line therapy consists of isavuconazole or voriconazole. Isavuconazole is an alternative in case of intolerance to voriconazole, drug-drug interactions, renal impairment, or if a spectrum of activity including the majority of Mucorales is desired. Primary anti-mould prophylaxis with posaconazole is recommended in haematology patients at high-risk. It may be considered in newly diagnosed influenza and ARDS, but ideally in clinical trials.

Implications

The rising reports of influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis in patients with ARDS, who are otherwise not considered at risk for fungal pneumonia demands heightened clinical awareness. Tracheobronchitis and Aspergillus in respiratory tract samples should prompt suspicion of invasive fungal infection and further work-up. The management algorithm should comprise bronchoalveolar lavage, CT imaging, sophisticated ventilator-management, rescue extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and antifungal and antiviral therapy. To decrease the burden of influenza-related illness, vaccination is of utmost importance, specifically in patients with co-morbidities.

### Knowledge gaps and research priorities in immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^113BYKVa]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) pneumonitis — proposed reporting measures include demographic/baseline data, radiologic and pathologic terminology, clinical findings, infectious complications, and additional testing. Proposed components list demographic information (sex, age, and ethnicity), smoking history (categorical and quantitative [pack-years]), preexisting conditions (particularly interstitial lung disease, COPD, and systemic autoimmune diseases), tumor types, prior treatments, and type of ICI treatment and regimen, doses, and frequency. Radiologic reporting emphasizes use of common terminology and routine use of radiologic patterns, including COP pattern, AIP/ARDS pattern, NSIP pattern, and HP pattern, with modality: chest CT. Pathologic reporting specifies use of common terminology such as cellular interstitial pneumonia, fibrosing interstitial pneumonia, usual interstitial pneumonia, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, cellular and fibrosing interstitial pneumonia, organizing pneumonia, bronchiolitis, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia, diffuse alveolar damage, pleuritis, and noncaseating granulomas. Clinical findings include documenting both CTCAE grade and clinical signs and symptoms. Infectious complications to capture in ICI alone and in combination with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive medications include TB and listeria (PD-[L]1), Aspergillus, CMV, and PJP (CTLA-4), pneumonia (organism[s] when available), sepsis (organism[s] when available), and other bacterial, viral, and fungal infections. Additional testing domains include patient-reported functional assessments (Borg scale; FACT-L questionnaire), pulmonary function testing (spirometry and diffusing capacity [corrected for Hb], TLC, and comparison with pretreatment measures), 6-min-walk test, bronchoscopy (BAL) parameters and analyses, and lung biopsy details including type (TBBx, cryobiopsy, or wedge) and location, uniform histologic terminology, presence/absence of malignancy and evidence of infection, and complications.

### A 2010 working formulation for the standardization of definitions of infections in cardiothoracic transplant recipients [^116gR8Fm]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2011). Medium credibility.

Fungal pneumonia in cardiothoracic transplant recipients — definitions and criteria specify that proven infection may be based on histology or sterile tissue culture ALONE; OR with sign/symptoms + radiology + laboratory, and in the absence of biopsy categorize as probable; if histology shows both acute rejection and fungal invasion classify as acute rejection with proven fungal infection. Signs/symptoms require at least one of the following, including fever > 38°C or hypothermia < 36.5°C, leukopenia (< 4,000 WBC/mm3) or leukocytosis (≥ 12,000 WBC/mm3), new-onset or worsening cough, dyspnea, tachypnea, or pleural rub, rales or bronchial breath sounds, and worsening gas exchange with PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 240. Radiology requires chest radiograph with new or progressive and persistent infiltrate, consolidation, cavitation, or nodules, or CT scan with at least one of the same findings. Laboratory evidence includes single positive culture for mold BAL/blood or single positive PCR for mold BAL/blood or positive galactomannan in BAL; OR at least TWO positive sputum cultures/PCRs of fungal organisms (excluding Candida species). Isolation of non-pathogenic molds does not qualify for the "probable" category and should only be considered in the "proven" category, and mosaic appearance and ground-glass opacity may represent bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome or obliterative bronchiolitis.

### Case definition of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis in resource-constrained settings [^115MtdRt]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Features

Underlying Diseases

Most CPA patients have prior or concurrent underlying pulmonary disease. Possible risk factors for development of CPA are cavities in the lung caused by pulmonary TB, sarcoidosis, previous Pneumocystis pneumonia, bullae or lung cysts, lung abscess, pulmonary infarction, pulmonary fibrosis, healed abscess cavities, cavitary bronchogenic carcinoma, and infection by NTM (, –). In many countries, pulmonary TB is the most common disorder that precedes CPA. The most common differential diagnosis is pulmonary mycobacterial infection.

Duration

The duration of disease required to define CPA used by previous studies has been 1–6 months, usually 3 months. (Table 1). The expert panel consensus was to endorse a 3-month duration as a criterion for diagnosis of CPA. In patients with preexisting pulmonary disease, who often have chronic signs and symptoms, a change in pattern or severity of clinical presentation is considered the trigger point for the 3-month duration. In patients with few or unchanged signs and symptoms, documentation of 3-month duration may also be confirmed with radiographic findings of progression of cavitation, pericavitary infiltrates or fibrosis, development of a fungal ball (which takes weeks to form), or microbiological data.

Signs and Symptoms

Most patients with CPA experience clinical signs and symptoms, although some are asymptomatic and show progression radiologically only. The most distinctive and alarming sign is hemoptysis/hemosputum. Hemoptysis develops in ≈12%–43% of CPA patients and varies from blood streaking in sputum to massive and fatal hemoptysis. Hemoptysis may occur in patients with TB, but it is only streaking of sputum with blood and usually not severe. Another characteristic symptom is mild but persistent chest pain, discomfort, or tightness, experienced by up to 37% of patients. Weight loss and fatigue are also common, although not universal. Cough (usually productive) and dyspnea are common but not sufficiently distinctive to distinguish CPA from other pulmonary disorders, including pulmonary TB. Fever or pyrexia is uncommon in CPA patients and, if present, may indicate a concurrent or alternative diagnosis or subacute invasive aspergillosis. Night or day sweats are occasionally reported but are not discriminatory.

The consensus of the panel was that the diagnosis of CPA required the presence of > 1 symptoms persisting for 3 months and radiologic progression, a scenario present in most cases. Two other clinical scenarios that also qualify for the diagnosis of CPA are radiologic evidence of a simple aspergilloma (with or without symptoms) and characteristic radiologic appearance without symptoms but showing definite radiologic progression.

Asymptomatic coccidioidal cavity management — We recommend against the use of antifungal therapy for patients with an asymptomatic cavity (strong, low). Coccidioidal pneumonia can leave a thin-walled cavity as a residual in 5% of cases; in a patient who is asymptomatic and not immunosuppressed, periodic follow-up observation is recommended, and usually, periodic plain radiographs of the chest are adequate for monitoring; if cavities are very large or adjacent to the pleura, they may rupture, but this complication is surprisingly infrequent and antifungal treatment would not prevent this.

### Global, regional, and national burden of pulmonary fungal infections 1990–2021 [^112EL8Vs]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Viral Pneumonia and PFIs

Previous studies have identified neoplasms, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pulmonary tuberculosis as the most prevalent underlying conditions for PFIs. However, in recent years, viral pneumonia has emerged as an additional risk factor for such infections. Research has demonstrated that severe influenza viral pneumonia is an independent risk factor for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. COVID-19 can directly impair airway epithelial cells, facilitating fungal invasion into the respiratory tract. The hyperinflammatory state and cytokine release lead to the downregulation of CD4 and CD8 cells. In addition, conditions such as the use of glucocorticoids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, antibiotics with immunomodulatory properties (e.g. azithromycin), comorbidities, and mechanical ventilation contribute to the creation of an environment conducive to PFIs. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were consistent reports of invasive fungal infections (,–). Analysis of large-scale healthcare service databases in the United States revealed that 13.4% of hospitalizations due to fungal infections were COVID-19 related during the period of 2020–2021, with a higher mortality rate among patients hospitalized for COVID-19–related fungal infections (48.5%) compared with those with non–COVID-19–related fungal infections (12.3%). A multicenter retrospective study from France also demonstrated a higher mortality rate.

Coccidioidomycosis diagnostic testing — In patients with appropriate geographic exposure and illness compatible with infection or pneumonia due to coccidioidomycosis, we suggest using more than one diagnostic test, including direct visualization and culture of sputum, BAL, or other biopsy material; urine and serum antigen testing; and serology (serum antibody testing), and the current evidence cannot support a single best test with the approach tailored by illness severity, clinical context, and test availability (conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence); a technical remark notes that although microbiological culture or organism visualization is quite specific to identify Coccidioides organisms, it lacks overall sensitivity, and adding serum antibody testing plus urine and serum antigen testing increases overall diagnostic yield.

### Polymerase chain reaction on respiratory tract specimens of immunocompromised patients to diagnose Pneumocystis pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114nnFyP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

These data do not consider the burden of fungal disease as determined by an individual positive qPCR test, where higher burdens are generally associated with an increased likelihood of disease compared to colonization. The findings indicate that qPCR tests show very high diagnostic performance when used as screening tests for PCP in high-risk patient groups, where negativity of deeper respiratory tract specimens can be used to confidently exclude PCP. PCR positivity will likely require clinical interpretation, partially dependent on the strength of the PCR signal (indicative of fungal burden), the specimen type, and patient population tested. However, this multicomponent approach is commonplace in medical mycology, where near perfect diagnostic tests are rare with few exceptions and combining multiple laboratory diagnostic tests with clinical evidence typical of disease is common practice. Detection of serum (1–3)-β-glucan (BDG) may be combined with PCR to improve diagnostic accuracy, and PCP PCR positivity combined with a BDG > 200 pg/mL generated 100% specificity for the diagnosis of PCP.

### Global incidence and mortality of severe fungal disease [^112YJrWg]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Current estimates of fungal disease incidence and mortality are imprecise. Population at risk denominators were used to estimate annual incidence for 2019–21. Extensive literature searches from 2010 to 2023 were combined with over 85 papers on individual country and global disease burden. Crude and attributable mortality were estimated using a combination of untreated mortality, the proportion of patients who are treated, and percentage survival in treated patients. Awareness, guidelines, and accessibility of diagnostics and therapies informed the ratio of treated to untreated cases. Estimates do not include influenza or COVID-19 outbreaks. Data from more than 120 countries were included. Annually, over 2113000 people develop invasive aspergillosis in the context of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, intensive care, lung cancer, or haematological malignancy, with a crude annual mortality of 1801000 (85.2%). The annual incidence of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis is 1837272, with 340000 (18.5%) deaths. About 1565000 people have a Candida bloodstream infection or invasive candidiasis each year, with 995000 deaths (63.6%). Pneumocystis pneumonia affects 505000 people, with 214000 deaths (42.4%). Cryptococcal meningitis affects 194000 people, with 147000 deaths (75.8%). Other major life-threatening fungal infections affect about 300000 people, causing 161000 deaths (53.7%). Fungal asthma affects approximately 11.5 million people and might contribute to 46000 asthma deaths annually. These updated estimates suggest an annual incidence of 6.5 million invasive fungal infections and 3.8 million deaths, of which about 2.5 million (68%; range 35–90) were directly attributable.

We analyzed the clinical profile, management, and outcome of patients with CGD with fungal infection in our cohort from North India. The incidence of fungal infection was 40.4%, with the most common manifestation being pneumonia. This is in line with previously published literature on the same. Common clinical presentations include prolonged fever, respiratory symptoms, and weight loss. However, of note, 11% (4/35) of patients with fungal pneumonia had no respiratory symptoms at all. Similarly, Salvator et al. reported that in a cohort of adult CGD patients, 37% of patients with invasive fungal infection were asymptomatic and often required biopsies for diagnosis. This highlights the need to screen patients with CGD for underlying fungal infection in the presence of unexplained constitutional symptoms at every visit.

Patients with CGD are in clinical practice initiated on empirical antifungal therapy in the presence of inadequate response to broad-spectrum antimicrobials. However, isolation of the fungus is crucial for better management and outcome based on the drug sensitivity pattern. To isolate an organism, invasive procedures such as BAL, image-guided fine needle aspiration of the lung, or even open biopsy were needed (Table 2). Likewise, Cohen et al. have previously reported tissue biopsy leading to the correct diagnosis in most of the patients, with even repeated bronchoscopies and lung biopsies performed for isolation of fungus. In fact, Marciano et al. reported a higher positivity rate for organism isolation in lung biopsy (50%) in comparison to BAL (30%). Furthermore, we isolated fungi from lung tissue in 5 patients on autopsy. Interestingly, in 3 of these patients, there was no suspicion of fungal infection antemortem, one had blood culture positivity for fungus with no respiratory symptoms, and 1 had raised serum galactomannan; however, fungus could not be isolated antemortem. Hence, it is evident that the isolation of fungi can be difficult and often requires tissue analysis for diagnosis.

### Immunocompromised host pneumonia: definitions and diagnostic criteria: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^117R91bn]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society workshop — immunocompromised host pneumonia scope and rationale: Pneumonia imposes a significant clinical burden on people with immunocompromising conditions, and many individuals have compromised immunity due to cytotoxic cancer treatments, biological therapies, organ transplants, and immunodeficiencies. Despite awareness of increased infectious pneumonia risk, immunocompromised people are often excluded from pneumonia clinical guidelines and treatment trials. The report states that the absence of a widely accepted definition for immunocompromised host pneumonia hampers consistent clinical care and research, and describes an American Thoracic Society workshop with participants across pulmonary disease, infectious diseases, immunology, genetics, and laboratory medicine aiming to define this entity and its diagnostic criteria.

### Isolation of aspergillus spp. from the respiratory tract in critically ill patients: risk factors, clinical presentation and outcome [^112S8Zk3]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Aspergillus is a genus of mitosporic fungi, some species of which are known to cause infections in humans, particularly Aspergillus fumigatus (85% of cases) followed by A flavus and A niger. Aspergillus spp. are responsible for a broad spectrum of illnesses, from saprophytic colonization of the bronchial tree to rapidly invasive and disseminated diseases. Invasive aspergillosis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunosuppressed patients with profound granulocytopenia secondary to haematological malignancies, or solid organ and bone marrow transplantation. Outbreaks of aspergillosis in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) have been reported. Aspergillus spp. can also cause pneumonia in ICU patients without classical predisposing factors, as well as community-acquired pneumonia in otherwise immunocompetent healthy individuals.

Because the mortality rate with invasive aspergillosis remains high, even in the face of therapy, the work up must be prompt and aggressive. The diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is difficult because definitive diagnosis is based on histological documentation of typical hyphae and a culture positive for an Aspergillus sp. Uncertainty in disease definition is a key contributor to the controversy regarding the optimal method for establishing the diagnosis of invasive infection.

### COVID-19-associated fungal infections [^113MpCqD]. Nature Microbiology (2022). High credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated invasive fungal infections are an important complication in a substantial number of critically ill, hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Three groups of fungal pathogens cause co-infections in COVID-19: Aspergillus, Mucorales and Candida species, including Candida auris. Here we review the incidence of COVID-19-associated invasive fungal infections caused by these fungi in low-, middle- and high-income countries. By evaluating the epidemiology, clinical risk factors, predisposing features of the host environment and immunological mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of these co-infections, we set the scene for future research and development of clinical guidance.

Hospitalizations involving fungal infections increased 8.5% each year in the United States during 2019–2021. During 2020–2021, patients hospitalized with COVID-19-associated fungal infections had higher (48.5%) in-hospital mortality rates than those with non-COVID-19-associated fungal infections (12.3%). Improved fungal disease surveillance is needed, particularly during respiratory virus pandemics.

Coccidioidal pneumonia in patients not immunocompromised — initiation of antifungal therapy is specified as follows: "We recommend patient education, close observation, and supportive measures such as reconditioning physical therapy for patients who appear to have mild or nondebilitating symptoms, or who have substantially improved or resolved their clinical illness by the time of diagnosis (strong, low)". "We recommend initiating antifungal treatment for patients who, at the time of diagnosis, have significantly debilitating illness (strong, low)". "For patients at the time of diagnosis with extensive pulmonary involvement, with concurrent diabetes, or who are otherwise frail because of age or comorbidities, we recommend initiating antifungal treatment. Some experts would also include African or Filipino ancestry as indications for treatment (strong, low)". "If treatment is begun in nonpregnant adults, the treatment should be an orally absorbed azole antifungal (eg, fluconazole) at a daily dose of ≥ 400 mg (strong, low)".

Defining diagnostic criteria of immunocompromised host pneumonia emphasizes that "The definition of ICHP is predicated on a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia and host factors rather than on infectious etiology", while "pathogen identification is central to the appropriate management of ICHP". The report acknowledges that the definition is "limited by a lack of universally reportable markers of host immune dysfunction, [and] diagnostic criteria for ICHP are complicated by limitations in diagnostic tools", and notes that "The second part of the workshop focused on diagnostic criteria for ICHP", outlining that discussion of diagnostic technologies "is followed by a proposed diagnostic algorithm and clarifying statements".

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^114SmMQs]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis — clinical manifestations in people with HIV include four syndromes: focal pneumonia; diffuse pneumonia; extrathoracic involvement, including meningitis and osteoarticular infection; and positive coccidioidal serology tests without evidence of localized infection, and lack of viral suppression with CD4 count < 250 cells/mm3 is associated with increased severity. Focal pneumonia is most common when CD4 counts ≥ 250 cells/mm3 and can be difficult to distinguish from bacterial or viral community-acquired pneumonia, presenting with cough, fever, and pleuritic chest pain, while hilar or mediastinal adenopathy, upper lobe infiltrates, nodules, peripheral blood eosinophilia, or rash may point towards coccidioidomycosis, particularly with residence, prior residence, or travel to a known endemic area. Diffuse pneumonia and extrathoracic disease usually occur in more apparently immunocompromised patients; diffuse pulmonary disease presents with fever and dyspnea with a diffuse reticulonodular pattern on chest imaging and may be difficult to distinguish clinically from Pneumocystis pneumonia, and hypoxemia may be severe with serological tests possibly negative early. In meningitis, the cerebrospinal fluid profile demonstrates low glucose levels, elevated protein levels, and a lymphocytic pleocytosis, and eosinophils may also be present on cerebrospinal fluid analysis.

### NASPGHAN clinical report: surveillance, diagnosis, and prevention of infectious diseases in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease receiving tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors [^1161ZfrY]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2016). Medium credibility.

Cryptococcus spp. during anti–tumor necrosis factor-α (anti‑TNFα) therapy — epidemiology, manifestations, and diagnostic evaluation are summarized: Cryptococcosis has been reported most commonly in patients with rheumatologic conditions receiving anti‑TNFα, with estimated rates of 4.7 to 7 cases/100,000 patients receiving anti‑TNFα therapy. Although this fungus can be found worldwide, it is endemic in California, southwestern and pacific northwestern United States, and in British Columbia, Canada, Mexico, and Central and South America, and inhalation of fungal spores occurs with activities causing soil disruption. Pulmonary cryptococcosis is the most common clinical manifestation, presenting as fever, cough, and chest pain, and central nervous system (CNS) disease includes severe headache, enlarged ventricles or space‑occupying lesions, and symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure; meningitis may also follow an indolent course. Immunocompromised patients with cryptococcal pneumonia should be evaluated for disseminated disease with blood and CSF cultures and cryptococcal antigen testing, and a fundoscopic examination, neuroimaging, and measurement of CSF opening pressures are strongly recommended. Cryptococcal antigen detection in CSF has a diagnostic sensitivity of 94% for meningitis and is detected in the serum, 90% for lung disease, and CSF cell count, protein, and glucose may be normal despite a large organism load.

### Pralsetinib-associated pneumonia in RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer [^112vbb59]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Pathogens that cause opportunistic infections include bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa. Most opportunistic fungal infections are caused by Candida and Aspergillus. Our study shows that the common pathogen of infections is Pneumocystis yerinii. Pneumocystis pneumonia is the most common cause of pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients, especially in AIDS patients. Pneumocystis pneumonia is mainly caused by decreased CD4 + T cell count or functional deficiency, which further proves that the mechanism of pralsetinib-induced infection may be related to cellular immunity.

Pneumonia can appear about 2 months after taking pralsetinib, and its early diagnosis and timely treatment are particularly important. The diagnosis is based on laboratory, etiological, and imaging examination. In case of unexplained fever, the infection indicators and chest CT should be examined immediately. Once pneumonia is clear, if there is no exogenous infection factor, it can be considered as pralsetinib-related infection. Then, oral pralsetinib should be suspended, or the dosage should be reduced under close monitoring. Initial empirical therapy with antimicrobial agents should be initiated as soon as possible before microbiological findings are detected, given the possibility of immunosuppression in the patient. If patients have a history of steroid use, they should be alert to the possibility of opportunistic infections, especially fungal infections, and antifungal drugs can be used.

### Burden of serious fungal infections in Spain [^113sy92o]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Estimates of the incidence and prevalence of serious fungal infections, based on epidemiological data, are essential in order to inform public health priorities given the lack of resources dedicated to the diagnosis and treatment of these serious fungal diseases. However, epidemiology of these infections is largely unknown, except for candidaemia and cryptococcosis. The aim of this work is to calculate the burden of serious fungal infections in Spain. All published epidemiology papers reporting fungal infection rates from Spain were identified. Where no data existed, we used specific populations at risk and fungal infection frequencies in those populations to estimate national incidence or prevalence, depending on the condition. Around 8.1 million people suffer a fungal infection every year. Most of them are skin or mucosal infections causing no deaths. Candidaemia is more common than in other European countries and has risen by 1.88-fold in frequency in the last decade (8.1 cases × 100,000). Good estimates of invasive aspergillosis (2.75 cases × 100,000) and mucormycosis (0.04 × 100,000) are available. Fungal infections with a high mortality such as invasive aspergillosis, candidaemia, Pneumocystis pneumonia and mucormycosis are not numerous in Spain, but they affect those with severe underlying diseases and are therefore linked to poor outcomes. Additional studies are required, especially for high burden diseases such as recurrent thrush in women (∼9000 cases × 100,000 women), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (126 cases × 100,000) and severe asthma with fungal sensitisation (198 cases × 100,000).

### Immunocompromised host pneumonia: definitions and diagnostic criteria: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^111ahL4k]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Inborn errors of immunity (IEI) and primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) — these disorders comprise diseases caused by inborn errors of immunity or specific genetic mutations that confer susceptibility to infections and other complications, and fungal pneumonia in otherwise healthy individuals has led to discovery of single-gene IEI. Germline variants affecting oxidative burst, cytoskeleton/actin polymerization, cytokine signaling, C-type lectin receptor signaling, or transcription factors underlie PID syndromes such as chronic granulomatous disease, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and hyper-IgE syndrome, with examples including CYBB/gp91phox [X-linked], NCF1/p47phox [autosomal recessive], WAS/WASP [X-linked], IL6ST gp130 [autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant], IL6R/IL-6R [autosomal recessive], and STAT3/STAT3 [autosomal dominant]; these variants impair immune or lung epithelial function and predispose to severe viral, bacterial, disseminated mycobacterial, and fungal infections, and acquired anti-cytokine autoantibodies to IFNγ, IFNα, and GM-CSF are an expanding set of PID mimics.

### Fungal pathogens and COVID-19 [^111NfE2k]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2023). Medium credibility.

COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the complications of secondary fungal infections that occurred globally in severe cases of coronavirus disease managed in the intensive care units. Furthermore, varied underlying host factors, such as preexisting immunosuppression, the use of immunomodulatory agents, and invasive procedures predisposing lung tissues to fungal colonization and proliferation, caused increased susceptibility to fungal infections in COVID-19 patient populations. These invasive fungal infections directly impact the overall length of hospitalization and mortality. The most commonly reported fungal infections in patients with COVID-19 include aspergillosis, invasive candidiasis, and mucormycosis. An overall worldwide increase in the prevalence of candidiasis and aspergillosis was observed in COVID-19 patients, whereas outbreaks of mucormycosis were mainly recorded from India. Diagnostic challenges and limited antifungal treatment options make secondary fungal infections among COVID-19 patients more burdensome, which results in improper management and increased mortality.

### Histoplasmosis [^113uwkAq]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2010). Low credibility.

Histoplasmosis is the most prevalent endemic fungal infection in North America. The clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic, self-limited illness to a life-threatening progressive disseminated disease. Chronic manifestations of healed infection can also be problematic. Clinical presentation depends on the infectious load, underlying immune status, and lung function. The preferred diagnostic methods and treatment options vary with clinical scenario and severity of illness. New diagnostic tools and treatment options are now available in clinical practice. We present an overview of this important endemic mycosis with emphasis on diagnosis and treatment recommendations for the different clinical syndromes of histoplasmosis.

### About histoplasmosis… [^116jrckV]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Histoplasmosis is a lung infection, or pneumonia, caused by breathing in spores of the fungus Histoplasmafrom the environment.
- It is often misdiagnosed or diagnosed late.
- Infection can be mild to severe and can even lead to meningitis.
- Early testing and antifungal treatment helps prevent severe infections. Overview Histoplasmosis is a lung infection caused by breathing in Histoplasma, a fungus. Histoplasma lives in the environment in parts of the United States and the world. Most of the time when people breathe in the fungal spores, they do not get sick. However, Histoplasmosis can cause mild to life-threatening symptoms of pneumonia. Histoplasmosis is often misdiagnosed or diagnosed late because the symptoms are similar to more common pneumonias caused by bacteria or viruses.

Symptoms Symptoms of histoplasmosis include:

- Fever
- Cough
- Fatigue
- Chills
- Headache
- Chest pain
- Body aches These symptoms usually appear 3 to 17 days after breathing in the fungus. Learn more about symptoms of histoplasmosis. Severe infections Histoplasmosis can develop into a long-term lung infection, specifically among people with weakened immune systems. In rare cases, it can spread to other parts of the body, including the brain and spinal cord. Causes Histoplasmosis is caused by breathing in fungal spores from Histoplasma, a fungus that lives in soil. It also spreads in bird and bat droppings that mix in soil. In the United States, the fungus mainly lives in the central and eastern states. Histoplasmosis does not spread between people or between people and pets. Keep Reading: Histoplasmosis: Causes and How It Spreads. Treatment and recovery Symptoms sometimes go away on their own without treatment.

Prescription antifungal medication is needed to treat:

- Severe or chronic lung infections
- Infections that spread to other parts of hte body and meningitis. Itraconazole is one type of antifungal medication that's commonly used to treat histoplasmosis. Amphotericin B is another medication that might be needed in severe histoplasmosis. Treatment can range from 3 months to one year. The length of treatment depends on severity of the infection and immune status.
