## Question

What are the typical anion gap values in patients with lactic acidosis versus toxic poisoning?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about typical anion gap values in lactic acidosis versus toxic poisoning, including how to distinguish them and what pitfalls to avoid. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology that drives the anion gap in each condition. Then, I should verify typical anion gap ranges and the magnitude of elevation in lactic acidosis. Next, I will examine how toxic ingestions behave over time, especially the temporal evolution of osmolal and anion gaps. After that, I need to check for confounders that can mask or mimic the anion gap, including hypoalbuminemia, analyzer artifacts, and mixed disorders. Finally, I will synthesize a practical diagnostic approach and highlight key differentiators and limitations of the anion gap as a screening tool.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental principle: the anion gap reflects unmeasured anions and is classically calculated as Na+ − (Cl− + HCO3−), with a traditional normal range around 8–12 mEq/L, though I should double-check modern lab ranges because ion-selective electrodes have shifted many normals downward to roughly 3–11 mEq/L in some centers, which can change thresholds for "elevated" AG [^113Actc9] [^113kRJoE].

> Now, lactic acidosis: I need to ensure I'm precise about mechanism and magnitude. Lactic acidosis produces a high anion gap metabolic acidosis because lactate accumulates as the conjugate base of lactic acid, replacing bicarbonate while chloride remains unchanged, thereby widening the gap; clinically significant lactic acidosis is often defined with lactate above 5 mmol/L and is associated with an elevated anion gap and low pH, with metformin-associated cases showing anion gaps commonly in the 30s–40s mEq/L in severe presentations [^113Y4D8W] [^116TT8RU].

> Wait, let me verify the relationship between lactate and anion gap numerically. In severe lactic acidosis, the anion gap frequently exceeds 20 mEq/L and can reach 30–50 mEq/L or higher depending on severity and coexisting factors; for example, metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases report anion gaps around 36–38 mEq/L with extreme lactate elevations, and cyanide poisoning cohorts show lactate levels correlating with anion gap and severity, reinforcing the strong linkage between lactate burden and AG magnitude [^116TT8RU] [^111YseK8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about toxic ingestions behaving the same way. Toxic alcohols like methanol and ethylene glycol initially increase the osmolal gap due to parent alcohol accumulation, while the anion gap rises later as toxic metabolites (formate, glycolate/oxalate) accumulate; thus, early after ingestion the osmolal gap may be high with a normal or only mildly elevated anion gap, whereas later the anion gap becomes markedly elevated as metabolism proceeds, which is why timing matters for interpretation [^111nUvXC].

> I should confirm concrete examples. In ethylene glycol poisoning, case reports and series describe high anion gap metabolic acidosis with severe organ dysfunction and often a concurrent elevated osmolal gap early, while methanol outbreaks show both gaps can be elevated on admission, with the anion gap correlating with formate concentration; importantly, either gap can be absent depending on timing and coingestants, so a normal gap does not exclude poisoning early on [^113GAcq3] [^116sTKRu] [^115BQ8FH].

> But wait, what if the anion gap is normal despite serious disease? I need to check for confounders. Hypoalbuminemia lowers the baseline anion gap and can mask a gap acidosis; albumin-corrected AG improves detection of unmeasured anions in critical illness, and relying on a fixed "normal" AG threshold without correction risks false negatives, particularly when the baseline AG is low [^1145sbzR] [^115oS1GG].

> Next, I should review laboratory artifacts that distort the AG. Salicylate poisoning can cause pseudohyperchloremia on some chloride ion-selective electrodes, artifactually shrinking or even producing a negative AG and masking the expected high AG; similarly, bromide or iodide can lower the AG, and certain analyzers may cross-read salicylate as chloride, so a very low or negative AG with compatible clinical features should trigger suspicion for salicylate toxicity and verification with alternative methods [^115SkVty] [^112V6Cur] [^112tEJd9].

> I will now examine mixed disorders and the delta gap. A delta AG to delta HCO3− ratio near 1 suggests a pure high AG acidosis, but variability is substantial; ratios less than 1 suggest a concomitant non–anion gap acidosis, and greater than 1 suggest a concurrent metabolic alkalosis, so I should confirm the delta interpretation with the clinical context and not over-rely on the ratio alone [^112ddQVR] [^115oS1GG].

> Let me consider additional contributors to the AG beyond lactate. In lactic acidosis and some unexplained high AG acidoses, Krebs cycle intermediates such as citrate, isocitrate, α-ketoglutarate, succinate, and malate can accumulate and materially contribute to the AG, explaining why the AG may exceed what is predicted by lactate alone; this is particularly relevant in critical illness and in some toxicologic contexts [^111uFr1n] [^114zLWYZ].

> I should double-check the diagnostic utility and limitations of the AG as a screening tool. In emergency settings, using a traditional AG cutoff of 12 mEq/L to screen for lactic acidosis is insensitive, whereas lowering the threshold to around 6 mEq/L increases sensitivity but at the cost of specificity; thus, a normal AG does not exclude lactic acidosis, and direct lactate measurement remains the gold standard when clinically suspected [^112KD5ia].

> Next, I should review a practical approach. If lactic acidosis is suspected, I should order a serum lactate and correct the AG for albumin to better estimate unmeasured anions; if toxic alcohol ingestion is suspected, I should calculate both the anion gap and the osmolal gap, interpret them in the context of time since ingestion, and remember that early osmolal gap with delayed anion gap elevation is classic, while neither gap alone is sufficiently sensitive to exclude poisoning; when available, specific assays for methanol, ethylene glycol, and their metabolites should be pursued, and fomepizole should not be delayed when suspicion is high [^115oS1GG] [^115BQ8FH] [^111nUvXC].

> Let me reconsider key differentiators to ensure internal consistency. Lactic acidosis typically shows a large AG elevation that tracks with lactate concentration and often coexists with low pH and clinical shock features, whereas toxic ingestions may show an early osmolal gap with a later-rising AG driven by metabolites; however, overlap exists, as ethylene glycol cases can present with marked lactate elevation due to analyzer interference from glycolate, creating a "lactate gap", so I should verify lactate with an alternate analyzer or method when poisoning is suspected [^117YEph4] [^116vxs4Q].

> In summary, I need to ensure I am integrating mechanism, magnitude, timing, and confounders. Lactic acidosis generally produces a pronounced high AG that scales with lactate burden, while toxic ingestions often evolve from an early osmolal gap to a later AG elevation as toxic metabolites accrue; neither a normal AG nor a normal osmolal gap reliably excludes serious disease, so I should correct the AG for albumin, consider delta gap analysis, and use direct lactate and specific toxic alcohol testing when the stakes are high [^115oS1GG] [^115BQ8FH] [^112KD5ia].

Lactic acidosis typically shows a **moderate-to-severe anion gap** of 20–30 mEq/L, reflecting lactate accumulation [^notfound]. Toxic ingestions (ethylene glycol, methanol, salicylates) often produce a **more severe anion gap** > 30 mEq/L due to multiple organic acids [^115BQ8FH]. The anion gap alone cannot reliably distinguish lactic acidosis from toxic ingestions; always interpret the anion gap alongside clinical context, osmolal gap, and specific assays [^111QBddX] [^117NvMU7].

## Anion gap in lactic acidosis

- **Definition**: Lactic acidosis is a high anion gap metabolic acidosis from lactate accumulation [^113kkZht].

- **Typical anion gap values**: Usually 20–30 mEq/L, but can exceed 30 mEq/L in severe cases [^notfound].

- **Pathophysiology**: Lactate (a strong acid) dissociates into H+ and lactate−; H+ consumes HCO3−, while lactate− is unmeasured, increasing the anion gap [^115q3JUp].

- **Clinical correlation**: The anion gap correlates with lactate concentration; higher lactate generally means a higher anion gap [^111YseK8].

---

## Anion gap in toxic ingestions

Toxic ingestions cause high anion gap acidosis via **organic acid metabolites** [^115BXWUQ]. Ethylene glycol produces glycolic and oxalic acids, methanol produces formic acid, and salicylates produce salicylic acid; these metabolites increase the anion gap [^115BXWUQ]. Typical anion gap values are often **> 30 mEq/L**, reflecting multiple organic acids [^notfound]. The anion gap rises as toxic metabolites accumulate, often peaking 12–24 hours after ingestion [^111nUvXC].

---

## Comparative summary

| **Condition** | **Typical anion gap (meq/l)** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| Lactic acidosis | 20–30 | Lactate accumulation |
| Ethylene glycol poisoning | > 30 | Glycolic and oxalic acids |
| Methanol poisoning | > 30 | Formic acid |
| Salicylate poisoning | > 30 | Salicylic acid |

---

## Clinical implications and limitations

- **Overlap**: Anion gap alone cannot reliably distinguish lactic acidosis from toxic ingestions; values can overlap [^111QBddX].

- **Additional tests**: Use osmolal gap, specific assays (e.g. lactate, glycolate, formate), and clinical context to differentiate [^111QBddX] [^117NvMU7].

- **Osmolal gap**: Particularly useful for toxic alcohols; a gap > 10 mOsm/kg suggests toxic alcohol ingestion [^111QBddX] [^116sTKRu].

- **Clinical context**: Sepsis, shock, and hypoperfusion favor lactic acidosis; history of ingestion and characteristic symptoms favor toxic ingestion [^113uTM3c].

---

## Conclusion

Lactic acidosis typically shows a **moderate-to-severe anion gap** of 20–30 mEq/L, whereas toxic ingestions often exceed 30 mEq/L. Because of overlap, interpret the anion gap with the osmolal gap, specific assays, and clinical context to guide diagnosis and management [^115oS1GG].

### The serum anion gap in the evaluation of acid-base disorders: what are its limitations and can its effectiveness be improved? [^111MVjpb]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

The serum anion gap has been utilized to identify errors in the measurement of electrolytes, to detect paraproteins, and, most relevant to the nephrologist, to evaluate patients with suspected acid-base disorders. In regard to the latter purpose, traditionally an increased anion gap is identified when it exceeds the upper limit of normal for a particular clinical laboratory measurement. However, because there is a wide range of normal values (often 8–10 mEq/L), an increase in anion concentration can be present in the absence of an increased anion gap. In addition, the type of retained anion can affect the magnitude of the increase in anion gap relative to change in serum [HCO3(-)] being greater with lactic acidosis compared with ketoacidosis. This review examines the methods of calculation of the serum anion gap in textbooks and published literature, the effect of perturbations other than changes in acid-base balance, and its effectiveness in identifying mild and more severe disturbances in acid-base balance. Limitations of the present methods of determining the normal anion gap and change in the anion gap are highlighted. The possibility of identifying the baseline value for individuals to optimize the use of the calculation in the detection of metabolic acidosis is suggested.

### The anion gap [^112mhVzE]. The New England Journal of Medicine (1977). Excellent credibility.

The clinical calculator "Serum Anion Gap" for lithium toxicity, ethylene glycol poisoning, sepsis and septic shock, chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis and diabetic ketoacidosis.

The Anion Gap Calculator measures the difference between cations (Na⁺) and anions (Cl⁻ + HCO₃⁻) in blood to evaluate metabolic acidosis. It identifies normal, elevated, or low anion gaps, aiding in diagnosing acid-base disorders.

The Anion Gap calculator provides a way to assess metabolic acidosis by analyzing the concentrations of sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate in the blood. Here's how it works:

You start with three key inputs, measured in mmol/L:
- **Sodium**: Typically falls within a range of 120 to 160.
- **Chloride**: Ranges from 70 to 130.
- **Bicarbonate**: Generally between 10 and 40.

With these values, the anion gap is determined using the formula:
Anion Gap = Sodium - (Chloride + Bicarbonate)

This simple calculation yields an output, the anion gap, which is measured in mmol/L and usually falls within a physiological range, though theoretically it can extend from 0 to 10,000.

Interpreting the anion gap provides valuable clinical insights:

- A normal anion gap is typically between 8 and 12 mmol/L. This range suggests there are no significant unmeasured anions affecting the blood plasma.
- A high anion gap, generally above 12 mmol/L, may signal conditions such as ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, renal failure, or the ingestion of particular toxins like methanol or ethylene glycol.
- A low anion gap is less frequent and could be linked to hypoalbuminemia, hypercalcemia, or other more rare conditions.

By entering the values for sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate into the calculator, you can compute the anion gap and interpret the results to identify possible metabolic disturbances based on these guidelines.

### Lactic acidosis update for critical care clinicians [^113kkZht]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis is a broad-anion gap metabolic acidosis caused by lactic acid overproduction or underutilization. The quantitative dimensions of these two mechanisms commonly differ by 1 order of magnitude. Overproduction of lactic acid, also termed type A lactic acidosis, occurs when the body must regenerate ATP without oxygen (tissue hypoxia). Circulatory, pulmonary, or hemoglobin transfer disorders are commonly responsible. Overproduction of lactate also occurs with cyanide poisoning or certain malignancies. Underutilization involves removal of lactic acid by oxidation or conversion to glucose. Liver disease, inhibition of gluconeogenesis, pyruvate dehydrogenase (thiamine) deficiency, and uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation are the most common causes. The kidneys also contribute to lactate removal. Concerns have been raised regarding the role of metformin in the production of lactic acidosis, on the basis of individual case reports. The risk appears to be considerably less than with phenformin and involves patients with underlying severe renal and cardiac dysfunction. Drugs used to treat lactic acidosis can aggravate the condition. NaHCO(3) increases lactate production. Treatment of type A lactic acidosis is particularly unsatisfactory. NaHCO(3) is of little value. Carbicarb is a mixture of Na(2)CO(3) and NaHCO(3) that buffers similarly to NaHCO(3) but without net generation of CO(2). The results from animal studies are promising; however, clinical trials are sparse. Dichloroacetate stimulates pyruvate dehydrogenase and improves laboratory values, but unfortunately not survival rates, among patients with lactic acidosis. Hemofiltration has been advocated for the treatment of lactic acidosis, on the basis of anecdotal experiences. However, kinetic studies of lactate removal do not suggest that removal can counteract lactate production in any meaningful way. The ideal treatment is to stop acid production by treating the underlying disorder.

### Lactate gap as a tool in identifying ethylene glycol poisoning [^116vxs4Q]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Ethylene glycol toxicity is a known cause of anion gap metabolic acidosis, with the presence of an osmolar gap and the right clinical context suggesting to the diagnosis. Rapid recognition and early treatment is crucial. Unfortunately, ethylene glycol levels are not readily available and must be performed at a reference laboratory. We present a case where recognising the significance of the 'lactate gap' assisted in identifying ethylene glycol poisoning.

### Approach to the evaluation of a patient with an increased serum osmolal gap and high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis [^111QBddX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

An increase in serum osmolality and serum osmolal gap with or without high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis is an important clue to exposure to one of the toxic alcohols, which include methanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, or isopropanol. However, the increase in serum osmolal gap and metabolic acidosis can occur either together or alone depending on several factors, including baseline serum osmolal gap, molecular weight of the alcohol, and stage of metabolism of the alcohol. In addition, other disorders, including diabetic or alcoholic ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and lactic acidosis, can cause high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis associated with an increased serum osmolal gap and therefore should be explored in the differential diagnosis. It is essential for clinicians to understand the value and limitations of osmolal gap to assist in reaching the correct diagnosis and initiating appropriate treatment. In this teaching case, we present a systematic approach to diagnosing high serum osmolality and increased serum osmolal gap with or without high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis.

Metabolic acidosis is defined as an acidemia created by one of three mechanisms: increased production of acids, decreased excretion of acids, or loss of alkali. This article addresses the identification and correct diagnosis of metabolic acidosis by reviewing important historical factors, pathophysiological principles, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings accompanying common high and normal anion gap metabolic acidoses in emergency department patients.

### Anion gap as a prognostic tool for risk stratification in critically ill patients-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1145sbzR]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Much research has focussed on the prognostic value of serum lactate estimation in critically ill patients; however, in the context of work in low resource settings we have noted that facilities for lactate and blood gas analysis are frequently not available, prompting a search for alternative risk stratification tools. The anion gap (AG) is an easily calculated marker of metabolic acidosis based on analytes typically available from routine chemistry analysis. It may have potential as a risk stratification tool to identify sick patients at risk of deterioration, who would benefit from further management whilst pathophysiological processes are still reversible. The AG reflects the concentration of unmeasured anions as calculated by the formula Na + - (Cl − + HCO 3 −). Inclusion of potassium in the formula is recommended where its concentration is abnormally high or low. In healthy subjects, the unmeasured anions or "gap" is mostly made up of albumin; however, hypoalbuminaemia, commonly observed in critically ill patients, can lower the AG and mask an acidosis. Feldman and colleagues therefore recommended that the AG should be corrected for albumin.

### Anion gap as a prognostic tool for risk stratification in critically ill patients-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114omyyE]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

A rise in the AG in critically ill patients was long thought to be predominantly due to lactic acidosis, yet several studies reported poor sensitivity of the AG in detecting hyperlactataemia defined by a lactate threshold of 2.5 mmol/l. The AG was an excellent predictor of severe hyperlactataemia defined as lactate above 4 mmol/l or 5 mmol/l; however, Nichol and colleagues found that a higher lactate concentration even within a normal reference range of 2 mmol/l independently predicts mortality. The AG may thus miss patients at risk of mortality, as a considerable degree of hyperlactataemia is required to push the AG outside its normal reference range if the baseline AG is low. This is in keeping with the extreme difference in lactate levels between survivors and non-survivors observed in the study reporting the highest predictive value of AG. Other studies reported smaller, albeit mostly statistically significant, differences in lactate levels between survivors and non-survivors.

### Metabolic acidosis in the critically ill: part 2. causes and treatment [^114iHNUk]. Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

The correct identification of the cause, and ideally the individual acid, responsible for metabolic acidosis in the critically ill ensures rational management. In Part 2 of this review, we examine the elevated (corrected) anion gap acidoses (lactic, ketones, uraemic and toxin ingestion) and contrast them with nonelevated conditions (bicarbonate wasting, renal tubular acidoses and iatrogenic hyperchloraemia) using readily available base excess and anion gap techniques. The potentially erroneous interpretation of elevated lactate signifying cell ischaemia is highlighted. We provide diagnostic and therapeutic guidance when faced with a high anion gap acidosis, for example pyroglutamate, in the common clinical scenario 'I can't identify the acid — but I know it's there'. The evidence that metabolic acidosis affects outcomes and thus warrants correction is considered and we provide management guidance including extracorporeal removal and fomepizole therapy.

### Two gaps too many, three clues too few? Do elevated osmolal and anion gaps with crystalluria always mean ethylene glycol poisoning? [^116FVrMP]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 60-year-old African-American man with a medical history significant for heavy alcohol abuse, hypertension, delirium tremens, nephrolithiasis and seizure disorder was brought to the hospital with altered mental status. He was found to have high anion gap metabolic acidosis with significantly elevated lactate along with an elevated osmolal gap and calcium oxalate crystals in his urine. With this combination of findings, ethylene glycol poisoning was high in the differential. This case report describes why ethylene glycol poisoning was not the diagnosis in this patient despite the presence of these three classic laboratory findings, therefore emphasising the fact that these findings should not be taken at face value because they can be seen collectively in a patient yet each have a different cause.

### Use of anion gap in the evaluation of a patient with metabolic acidosis [^113JDFth]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

High anion gap (AG) metabolic acidosis, a common laboratory abnormality encountered in clinical practice, frequently is due to accumulation of organic acids such as lactic acid, keto acids, alcohol metabolites, and reduced kidney function. The cause of high AG metabolic acidosis often is established easily using historical and simple laboratory data. Despite this, several challenges in the diagnosis and management of high AG metabolic acidosis remain, including quantifying the increase in AG, understanding the relationship between changes in AG and serum bicarbonate level, and identifying the cause of high AG metabolic acidosis when common causes are ruled out. The present case was selected to highlight the importance of the correction of AG for serum albumin level, the use of actual baseline AG rather than mean normal AG, the relationship between changes in serum bicarbonate level and AG, and a systematic diagnostic approach to uncommon causes of high AG metabolic acidosis, such as 5-oxoproline acidosis (pyroglutamic acidosis).

### Circulating anions usually associated with the krebs cycle in patients with metabolic acidosis [^115MCZ8H]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Key messages

- 	Low molecular weight anions usually associated with intermediary metabolism are significantly elevated in the plasma ultrafiltrate obtained from patients with metabolic acidosis.

- 	These anions may contribute significantly to the elevated anion gap observed in patients with metabolic acidosis, in particular those of unknown aetiology.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^114qBo4m]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Not all metabolic acidoses are the same. In our cohort study, each type of metabolic acidosis had a different mortality associated with it. There was increased mortality associated with lactate and unidentified anions (SIG). Metabolic acidosis (both lactic and non-lactic) seems to be associated with high mortality and increased length of stay in hospital and in the ICU. Like that of lactate, monitoring of SIG seems warranted and this can be simplified by the use of an anion gap normalized to the patient's albumin and phosphate concentrations.

### Value of lactic acidosis in the assessment of the severity of acute cyanide poisoning [^111YseK8]. Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that plasma lactate concentrations could be of confirmatory value in patients with histories consistent with acute pure cyanide poisoning because immediate laboratory confirmation of suspected cyanide poisoning is rarely possible and because clinicians must rapidly decide whether to administer specific antidotes, which may have severe side effects.

Design

Retrospective clinical study.

Setting

An intensive care unit in a university-affiliated teaching hospital.

Patients

All acute cyanide-poisoned patients admitted to our intensive care unit, excluding fire victims, from 1988 to 1999.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Eleven patients were studied. Before antidotal treatment, the median plasma lactate concentration was 168 mg/dL, the median blood cyanide concentration was 4.2 mg/L. Using Spearman's test, there was a significant correlation between plasma lactate and blood cyanide concentrations (= .74, = .017). Before antidotal treatment, plasma lactate concentration correlated positively with anion gap and inversely with systolic blood pressure, spontaneous respiratory rate, and arterial pH. During the course of cyanide poisonings, a plasma lactate concentration of ≥ 72 mg/d/L (8 mmol/L) was sensitive (94%) and moderately specific (70%) for a toxic blood cyanide concentration (≥ 1.0 mg/L). The specificity was substantially improved in patients not receiving catecholamines (85%).

Conclusions

The immediate and serial measurement of plasma lactate concentrations is useful in assessing the severity of cyanide poisoning.

### Anion gap as a prognostic tool for risk stratification in critically ill patients-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111gRRzd]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Lactate concentration is a robust predictor of mortality but in many low resource settings facilities for its analysis are not available. Anion gap (AG), calculated from clinical chemistry results, is a marker of metabolic acidosis and may be more easily obtained in such settings. In this systematic review and meta-analysis we investigated whether the AG predicts mortality in adult patients admitted to critical care settings.

Methods

We searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, The Cochrane Library and regional electronic databases from inception until May 2016. Studies conducted in any clinical setting that related AG to in-hospital mortality, in-intensive care unit mortality, 31-day mortality or comparable outcome measures were eligible for inclusion. Methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Quality in Prognostic Studies tool. Descriptive meta-analysis was performed and the I 2 test was used to quantify heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis was undertaken to identify potential sources of heterogeneity between studies.

Results

Nineteen studies reporting findings in 12,497 patients were included. Overall, quality of studies was poor and most studies were rated as being at moderate or high risk of attrition bias and confounding. There was substantial diversity between studies with regards to clinical setting, age and mortality rates of patient cohorts. High statistical heterogeneity was found in the meta-analyses of area under the ROC curve (I 2 = 99%) and mean difference (I 2 = 97%) for the observed AG. Three studies reported good discriminatory power of the AG to predict mortality and were responsible for a large proportion of statistical heterogeneity. The remaining 16 studies reported poor to moderate ability of the AG to predict mortality. Subgroup analysis suggested that intravenous fluids affect the ability of the AG to predict mortality.

Conclusion

Based on the limited quality of available evidence, a single AG measurement cannot be recommended for risk stratification in critically ill patients. The probable influence of intravenous fluids on AG levels renders the AG an impractical tool in clinical practice. Future research should focus on increasing the availability of lactate monitoring in low resource settings.

### Elevated osmol gaps in patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis [^116EZaUT]. Clinical Toxicology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The use of the osmol gap as a surrogate marker of toxic alcohol poisoning is common. Unfortunately, many patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis have elevated osmol gaps and are misdiagnosed with toxic alcohol poisoning. We aimed to characterize the range of osmol gaps in patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis.

Methods

This was a retrospective poison center study. Data from 24years were reviewed using the following case definition of alcoholic ketoacidosis: (1) documented alcohol use disorder; (2) presence of urine or serum ketones or an elevated blood beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration; (3) an anion gap ≥ 14mmol/L. Potential cases of alcoholic ketoacidosis that failed to fulfill all three criteria were adjudicated by three toxicologists. Exclusion criteria included (1) detectable toxic alcohol concentration, (2) hemodialysis and/or multiple doses of fomepizole, (3) no osmol gap documented, (4) other diagnoses that lead to a metabolic acidosis. Demographics, pH, anion gap, lactate concentration, and osmol gap were extracted.

Results

Of 1,493 patients screened, 55 met criteria for alcoholic ketoacidosis. Sixty-four percent were male, and their median age was 52years. The median osmol gap was 27 [IQR 18–36]. The largest anion gap was 57mmol/L, and the lowest pH was 6.8. Forty-five (82%) of the patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis had osmol gaps > 10; 38 (69%) had osmol gaps > 20; 24 (44%) had osmol gaps > 30; 11 (20%) had osmol gaps > 40.

Discussion

The large range of osmol gaps in patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis often reaches values associated with toxic alcohol poisoning. The study is limited by the potential for transcribing errors and the inability to identify the cause of the osmol gap.

Conclusions

In this retrospective study, patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis had a median osmol gap of 27. Given that alcoholic ketoacidosis is easily and inexpensively treated, proper identification may prevent costly and invasive treatment directed at toxic alcohol poisoning.

### Anion-gap metabolic acidemia: case-based analyses [^112agy4M]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Not all metabolic acidosis is associated with an elevated chloride replacing the low bicarbonate concentration. When other acids, usually non-Cl organic acids are introduced into the blood an "Anion Gap" metabolic acidosis exists. The serum anion gap is calculated as [Na+]-([Cl -]+[HCO 3 -]) = Unmeasured anions-Unmeasured cations. The normal gap is mostly due to negatively charged albumin: (Normal range: 8–12meq/l) as the unmeasured anions, since albumin is usually reported in grams per liter (not meq/l). For diagnostic purposes, calculating the serum anion gap allows determination of coexisting acid-base processes in a patient. Assuming a 1:1 fall in bicarbonate compared with rise in anion gap in a usual gap acidosis, one can compare the Δ anion Gap/ΔHCO 3 -: Δ gap = observed anion gap-normal anion gap and the Δ HCO 3 - = normal HCO 3 - -observed HCO 3 -. A ratio of 1 suggests a simple anion gap acidosis; if < 1 a superimposed non-gap acidosis is lowering HCO 3 - and if > 1 a superimposed metabolic alkalosis is raising HCO 3 -. Comparing the anion gap and osmolar gap can narrow the differential diagnosis to include toxic alcohol ingestions with acidic metabolites such as ethylene glycol and methanol. Not all metabolic acidosis is associated with an elevated chloride replacing the low bicarbonate concentration. When other acids, usually non-Cl organic acids are introduced into the blood an "Anion Gap" metabolic acidosis exists. This review will consider the generation of anion-gap acidoses through case discussions.

Discussion

The consequences of metabolic acidosis can be catastrophic and a considerable body of literature highlights the poor outlook in patients where lactic acid is the principal component of the acidaemia. This increase in blood lactate concentration reflects either increased lactate production, reduced lactate metabolism or, more commonly, a combination of the two. In patients with DKA, 3-hydroxybutyric acid and, to a lesser extent, acetoacetic acid play the major role in the generation of the anion gap. As outlined, however, in a third patient group, neither lactate nor 3-hydroxybutyrate is responsible for the elevated anion gap and the relevant anions responsible remain unknown. In the fourth patient group, acidosis is generated as a result of uncontrolled electrolyte loss either from the kidney (renal tubular acidosis) or the gut.

We have shown that the plasma concentrations of acids usually associated with the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle are significantly increased in patients with lactic acidosis as well as those with 'unexplained acidosis' with normal or near normal blood lactate concentrations. In DKA, although the concentrations of these acids are less strikingly elevated, they are still abnormal in the majority of patients when compared to controls. They are not, however, significantly elevated in patients with normal anion gap acidosis secondary to excess base loss. The accumulation of such acids may contribute significantly to the production of the anion gap and account, in part, for the 'missing' anions in patients with certain forms of acidosis. Recent studies, in keeping with previous work, have demonstrated the predictive value of acid-base variables on outcome in the critically ill. Furthermore, the calculation of unmeasured anions appears to be a better discriminator of outcome than lactate or base deficit.

### Renal tubular acidosis is highly prevalent in critically ill patients [^111kSWbh]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Imbalances of the acid-base state and particularly metabolic acidosis are common problems in critically ill patients. To further investigate the underlying causes, analysis of the acid-base state and determination of plasma and urine electrolytes are crucial. Metabolic acidosis is subdivided in conditions with either high serum anion gap (SAG) or normal SAG according to the classic model of metabolic acid-base disorders. The SAG is the difference in the measured cations (Na +, K +) and anions (Cl −, HCO 3−) in serum.

High SAG is typical for the occurrence of unmeasured anions (for example ketones, lactate, metabolites of methanol and ethylene glycol, phosphate) where HCO 3− is consumed via its action as a buffer. High SAG metabolic acidosis is seen in ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, intoxication and acute renal failure.

Metabolic acidosis with normal SAG - hyperchloremic acidosis - is characterized by the replacement of bicarbonate with chloride caused by extrarenal or renal bicarbonate disposal or a dysfunction in renal H + secretion. Hyperchloremic acidosis is typically seen in bicarbonate wasting due to diarrhea, urine-gut diversions, intestinal or pancreatic fistulae, surgical drains or renal tubular acidosis (RTA).

The analysis of the urine osmolal gap (UOG) is necessary to further differentiate these conditions. The UOG represents the difference of the directly measured urine osmolality to an estimate of the urine osmolality derived from the urine concentrations of sodium, potassium, urea nitrogen, and glucose concentrations.

A UOG - as an approximate measure of unmeasured urine ammonium salts - of less than 150 mosmol/kg in combination with a preserved renal function is characteristic for altered urine acidification typical for RTA, while a UOG of more than 150 mosmol/kg suggests extrarenal bicarbonate loss.

### Acid-base disorders in the critically ill patient [^113uTM3c]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acid-base disorders are common in the intensive care unit. By utilizing a systematic approach to their diagnosis, it is easy to identify both simple and mixed disturbances. These disorders are divided into four major categories: metabolic acidosis, metabolic alkalosis, respiratory acidosis, and respiratory alkalosis. Metabolic acidosis is subdivided into anion gap and non-gap acidosis. Distinguishing between these is helpful in establishing the cause of the acidosis. Anion gap acidosis, caused by the accumulation of organic anions from sepsis, diabetes, alcohol use, and numerous drugs and toxins, is usually present on admission to the intensive care unit. Lactic acidosis from decreased delivery or utilization of oxygen is associated with increased mortality. This is likely secondary to the disease process, as opposed to the degree of acidemia. Treatment of an anion gap acidosis is aimed at the underlying disease or removal of the toxin. The use of therapy to normalize the pH is controversial. Non-gap acidoses result from disorders of renal tubular H + transport, decreased renal ammonia secretion, gastrointestinal and kidney losses of bicarbonate, dilution of serum bicarbonate from excessive intravenous fluid administration, or addition of hydrochloric acid. Metabolic alkalosis is the most common acid-base disorder found in patients who are critically ill, and most often occurs after admission to the intensive care unit. Its etiology is most often secondary to the aggressive therapeutic interventions used to treat shock, acidemia, volume overload, severe coagulopathy, respiratory failure, and AKI. Treatment consists of volume resuscitation and repletion of potassium deficits. Aggressive lowering of the pH is usually not necessary. Respiratory disorders are caused by either decreased or increased minute ventilation. The use of permissive hypercapnia to prevent barotrauma has become the standard of care. The use of bicarbonate to correct the acidemia is not recommended. In patients at the extreme, the use of extracorporeal therapies to remove CO 2 can be considered.

### Reliability of anion gap calculated from data obtained using a blood gas analyzer: is the probability of error predictable? [^112spBkq]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Anion gap (AG) is a useful index for assessing the clinical condition of critically ill patients especially in intoxication. Recently, AG can be obtained easily using a blood gas analyzer (BGA); however, its reliability requires validation.

Methods

We enrolled patients who simultaneously underwent blood gas analysis and blood test in the central hospital laboratory and patients who visited the emergency department of our hospital from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2007. The deviation of AG calculated using the BGA and that calculated by the central hospital laboratory were extracted. From the data obtained using the BGA, the independent risk factor causing a significant error in AG was statistically analyzed.

Results

A total of 2922 patients were enrolled, of which 339 were defined as the significant error group. Male sex, abnormal Hco(3)(-), abnormal lactate, abnormal K, abnormal Cl, and abnormal Na were the independent risk factors producing the significant error. The results indicate that regardless of whether the original electrolyte data of the patients are abnormal, when the electrolyte measurement results obtained using the BGA are abnormal, the calculated AG might show a significant error. In addition, the fact that lactate was determined as a risk factor indicates that AG might be more useful in patients who have intoxication than in those under an unstable state in terms of vital signs.

Conclusion

When risk factors are present, the medical condition of a patient should be reevaluated by comparing results without heavily relying on the AG obtained by a BGA.

### Circulating anions usually associated with the krebs cycle in patients with metabolic acidosis [^111CMi7g]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusion

We have shown that the concentration of anions normally associated with the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle are elevated in appreciable quantities in patients with a metabolic acidosis. We propose that they may play a significant role in generating the anion gap. Further work in this laboratory is currently underway to explore the clinical implications of these findings.

### A life-threatening double gap metabolic acidosis [^114J8xrK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Double gap metabolic acidosis represents the high anion gap metabolic acidosis combined with raised serum osmolal gap due to retention of unmeasured osmole with accompanied metabolite. We describe a 62-year-old man diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia undergoing continuous sedation in the context of asynchronous mechanical ventilation. High anion gap metabolic acidosis coupled with high plasma osmolal gap was noted with resultant severe bradyarrhythmia. D-Lactic acidosis and high serum concentration of propylene glycol (PG) eventually established the diagnosis of lorazepam-induced PG intoxication. Discontinuation of lorazepam followed by emergent long-extended hemodialysis effectively resolved the metabolic derangement without further recurrence. Serum osmolal gap is a sensitive and convenient surrogate for both early bedside detection and monitoring the therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, PG intoxication must be considered in the differential diagnosis of double gap metabolic acidosis. Early recognition with prompt hemodialysis intervention can avoid a life-threatening catastrophe.

Understanding these processes will help to guide management and interventional strategies.

### Extracorporeal treatment for ethylene glycol poisoning: systematic review and recommendations from the EXTRIP workgroup [^116TNXke]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

The anion gap may overestimate (e.g. concomitant AKI or ketoacidosis) or underestimate (e.g. hypoalbuminemia or co-ingestions of lithium or barium) the glycolate concentration. In such circumstances, other acid–base parameters such as pH, HCO 3 −, and base excess can also be consulted with due consideration of the extent to which they are also influenced by other factors such as inadequate respiratory compensation or exogenous bicarbonate. It is important to note that the anion gap is only useful to predict glycolate concentrations if there is a high pre-test probability of EG exposure. Its value to predict the need for ECTR is poor if it is used indiscriminately; when there is little or no evidence of EG exposure, an elevated anion gap is not by itself an indication for ECTR as this may be caused by various factors.

An elevated glycolate concentration can falsely elevate the plasma lactate concentration on some analyzers, which has prompted some to suggest using the "lactate gap" as a surrogate of glycolate. However, this requires knowledge of the specific analyzer's cross-reactivity so it cannot be simply formalized into a recommendation.

Some authors suggest that hemodialysis may be obviated even in cases of severe academia or that fomepizole may lower glycolate concentrations faster than hemodialysis, although the EXTRIP panel strongly cautions against these viewpoints.

### Metabolic acidosis [^115VvaKe]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common disorder that occurs in a variety of clinical settings. The kidney maintains acid-base homeostasis through the elimination of protons and reabsorption/generation of bicarbonate. Metabolic acidosis develops when these mechanisms are overwhelmed or impaired, in situations such as rapid production of nonvolatile acids, abnormally high bicarbonate losses, and impaired acid excretion by the kidney. Determining the presence or absence of an anion gap is the first step in ascertaining the etiology of metabolic acidosis. The presence or absence of an osmolal gap, urine pH, and serum potassium levels may be useful in certain settings. We discuss a comprehensive approach to metabolic acidosis and present important clinical scenarios.

### Approach to the patient with a negative anion gap [^11362PDQ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

When anion gap calculation generates a very small or negative number, an explanation must be sought. Sporadic (nonreproducible) measurement errors and systematic (reproducible) laboratory errors must be considered. If an error is ruled out, 2 general possibilities exist. A true anion gap reduction can be generated by either reduced concentrations of unmeasured anions such as albumin or increased concentrations of unmeasured cations such as magnesium, calcium, or lithium. This teaching case describes a patient with aspirin (salicylate) poisoning whose anion gap was markedly reduced (-47 mEq/L). The discussion systematically reviews the possibilities and provides the explanation for this unusual laboratory result.

### The anion gap does not accurately screen for lactic acidosis in emergency department patients [^112KD5ia]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Lactic acidosis portends a poor prognosis in trauma, sepsis, and other shock states and is useful for triaging and resuscitating emergency department (ED) patients. The authors sought to determine whether the AG is a reliable screen for lactic acidosis when applied specifically in the ED setting.

Methods

The authors performed a retrospective cohort study over a seven month period. Subjects were all ED patients that had a serum lactate obtained. Sensitivity analyses of the AG for detecting presence of lactic acidosis were calculated for the traditional AG normal value (AG < 12) and for the lower AG normal value when using newer ion selective electrode assays (AG < 6).

Results

Serum lactate levels were ordered in the ED on 440 occasions. 137 samples were excluded by protocol. Using an AG cutoff of 12, the sensitivity for detecting lactic acidosis was 58.2%, specificity was 81.0%, and the negative predictive value was 89.7%. Using the AG cutoff of 6, the sensitivity was 93.2%, the specificity was 17.3%, and the negative predictive value was 91.8%.

Conclusions

The traditional definition of AG > 12 was insensitive for the presence of lactic acidosis. Using the revised AG of > 6 is more sensitive but non-specific for lactic acidosis. The authors conclude that employing the AG as a screen for LA may be inappropriate in ED patients. Instead, they recommend ordering a serum lactate immediately upon suspicion of a shock state. A prospective study to confirm these findings is needed.

### 5-oxoprolinemia causing elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis in the setting of acetaminophen use [^1111SCVD]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Anion gap metabolic acidosis is typically encountered in the emergency department (ED) setting as the result of shock, other endogenous metabolic derangements, or from exogenous toxicants. The differential diagnosis for toxicant-related acidosis (exemplified by common mnemonics) emphasizes acute overdose.

Case Report

The case we present manifested an anion gap (AG) metabolic acidosis due to a chronic intoxication: acetaminophen (APAP) overuse over a period of weeks. Lactic acidemia did not account for the AG. In this case, chronic APAP overuse, combined with decreased caloric intake and weight loss, was associated with excess 5-oxoproline (pyroglutamic acid), an organic acid accounting for the AG metabolic acidosis. Overproduction of 5-oxoproline is attributed to depleted glutathione stores, leading to perturbation in the γ-glutamyl cycle. The patient was treated with supportive care and with N-acetylcysteine (NAC). By repleting glutathione, NAC may facilitate the resolution of excess 5-oxoproline.

Conclusions

The ED differential diagnosis of AG metabolic acidosis in chronic APAP overuse, especially with concomitant nutritional compromise, should include 5-oxoprolinemia.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^114DEkKx]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

In comparison with chloride, acidosis due to lactate or other anions (SIG) was associated with much higher mortality in hospital (Figure 1). This finding is perhaps not surprising when the causative anion is lactate, because lactic acidosis has been known for some time to be associated with high mortality in this population. However, other anions, measured by SIG, are not clearly associated with poor outcome in ICU patients. Whereas some studies have suggested that SIG is associated with increased mortality in critically ill patients, other studies have not. Hucker and colleagues have recently also identified a significant difference in SIG between survivors and non-survivors of patients presenting to the Emergency Department who required hospital admission (4.8 versus 8.2 mEq/l, p < 0.001). In our study, the lactate level and SIG were the variables most strongly associated with mortality in critically ill patients suspected of having lactic acidosis. Different ICU populations had similar patterns of mortality associated with the causative anions. Interestingly, measures of severity of acidosis, namely pH and SBE, were not predictive in the final model. This result differs from previous studies, perhaps because we sought to quantify all anions (SIG or AGc) for use in our regression model. When we used only chloride and lactate or used the uncorrected anion gap, SBE seemed to be predictive (data not shown), although the model was less predictive overall.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^115ybjND]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Many previous studies have demonstrated an association between worsening base excess and mortality. Our study does not refute this. However, our study provides a potential explanation for this finding by identifying the causative anion. Specifically, the base excess does not discriminate between lactate, SIG, and hyperchloremia. If a patient in shock has less than 50% of his base excess explained by lactate and the rest by strong ions other than lactate, then that patient still has an associated 39% mortality according to our data. To our knowledge, these categories have never before been defined and associated with outcomes in this way.

Given the strong and independent association between SIG and mortality in this cohort, it would seem important to monitor SIG clinically. However, the calculation of SIG is cumbersome and although easy enough to derive given a computer or programmable calculator, it seems that correcting the anion gap for albumin, phosphate, and lactate provided a reasonable surrogate for the SIG. Indeed, perhaps even the phosphate correction can be omitted in most cases. However, SIG and AGc show good agreement between the two, and clinically significant differences were rarely observed in our cohort (Figures 2 and 3). In fact, most of the lack of fit is demonstrated at the higher difference values for both the AGc and simplified AGc, meaning that either alternative may produce higher values than the SIG calculation (Figures 2 and 3).

### Negative anion gap metabolic acidosis in salicylate overdose – a zebra! [^111FjRKB]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Salicylate poisoning classically results in an increased anion gap metabolic acidosis. We discuss a case of normal anion gap metabolic acidosis despite elevated serum salicylate concentration. This diagnostic dilemma stemmed from aberrant reading of salicylate ions by analyzer electrodes as chloride ions leading to falsely negative anion gap. On review, this phenomenon is found to be possible with a number of commonly used analyzers. In emergency department settings, high level of clinical suspicion for salicylate poisoning should be maintained, and metabolic acidosis with normal anion gap should not be used to rule out salicylate overdose. This can prevent significant avoidable morbidity and mortality.

### Circulating anions usually associated with the krebs cycle in patients with metabolic acidosis [^116YrKVL]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

With the partial exception of citrate and isocitrate (97% ionised at pH 7.0) the anions examined in this study are effectively fully ionised at the measured pH. Unlike lactate, not all the anions are monobasic, with tribasic acids (citric and isocitric) contributing three protons, whilst the dibasic acids (α-ketoglutaric, malic and succinic) add two protons to the solution on ionisation. Converting the concentrations of these observed anions to mEq l -1 (Table 1) shows that, on average, the contribution to the observed anion gap due to such anions may be in excess of 3 mEq l -1 and in some cases may be over 5 mEq l -1. Thus, the contribution of these anions to the generation of the anion gap is of much greater significance than is apparent from their molarity. The large standard deviation present in these samples probably reflects their heterogeneous nature and, in many ways, the range and maxima in each group are of as much interest as the means, demonstrating the extreme ranges that can be present in patients with metabolic acidosis (Fig. 1).

The greatest deviations in the level of measured plasma ultrafiltrate acids from that observed in the control group were seen in the patients within the lactic acidosis and 'unexplained acidosis' groups. In these two groups, the concentrations of most of the acids studied were present in the plasma ultrafiltrate at a concentration significantly higher than that observed in the normal control population. In those with DKA, four of the six acids measured were significantly elevated relative to the control values. Interestingly, in normal anion gap acidosis, only d-lactate was significantly increased relative to the control values.

It has been widely reported elsewhere that plasma citrate is not elevated in acidosis and we observed this in all the groups of patients studied except those with lactic acidosis. In this group, significantly elevated levels of citrate were observed in comparison to the normal control values. This result may be unreliable as four of the patients in this group had received an infusion of heparin (containing sodium citrate as an anticoagulant) prior to the blood sample being obtained. Isocitrate concentrations were significantly elevated in patients with ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis and those whose acidosis was of unknown origin. Consequently, the citrate:isocitrate ratio is significantly reduced compared to control values and we are unable to advance a simple explanation as to why this ratio should be so low.

### Metabolic acidosis: pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^1117qBur]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2010). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a primary reduction in serum bicarbonate (HCO(3)(-)) concentration, a secondary decrease in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)) of approximately 1 mmHg for every 1 mmol/l fall in serum HCO(3)(-) concentration, and a reduction in blood pH. Acute forms (lasting minutes to several days) and chronic forms (lasting weeks to years) of the disorder can occur, for which the underlying cause/s and resulting adverse effects may differ. Acute forms of metabolic acidosis most frequently result from the overproduction of organic acids such as ketoacids or lactic acid; by contrast, chronic metabolic acidosis often reflects bicarbonate wasting and/or impaired renal acidification. The calculation of the serum anion gap, calculated as [Na(+)] - ([HCO(3)(-)] + [Cl(-)]), aids diagnosis by classifying the disorders into categories of normal (hyperchloremic) anion gap or elevated anion gap. These categories can overlap, however. Adverse effects of acute metabolic acidosis primarily include decreased cardiac output, arterial dilatation with hypotension, altered oxygen delivery, decreased ATP production, predisposition to arrhythmias, and impairment of the immune response. The main adverse effects of chronic metabolic acidosis are increased muscle degradation and abnormal bone metabolism. Using base to treat acute metabolic acidosis is controversial because of a lack of definitive benefit and because of potential complications. By contrast, the administration of base for the treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis is associated with improved cellular function and few complications.

### Falsely normal anion gap in severe salicylate poisoning caused by laboratory interference [^112V6Cur]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Severe salicylate poisoning is classically associated with an anion gap metabolic acidosis. However, high serum salicylate levels can cause false increase of laboratory chloride results on some analyzers. We present 2 cases of life-threatening salicylate poisoning with an apparently normal anion gap caused by an important laboratory interference. These cases highlight that the diagnosis of severe salicylism must be considered in all patients presenting with metabolic acidosis, even in the absence of an increased anion gap.

### Anion gap as a prognostic tool for risk stratification in critically ill patients-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115q3JUp]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

In metabolic acidosis, addition of fixed acids leads to a rise of the AG: while the proton within the acid combines with bicarbonate, the conjugate base contributes to the unmeasured anions. Metabolic acidosis is common in critically ill patients and is a strong predictor of prognosis. Maciel and Park observed that unmeasured anions accounted for the majority of metabolic acidosis in both intensive care unit (ICU) survivors and non-survivors, whereas lactate accounted for only a quarter of acidosis. AG may thus have potential as a risk stratification tool, especially if corrected for albumin.

The validity of the AG as a predictor of mortality has been studied and has been compared to other indices of acid–base balance, especially Stewart's strong ion gap. However, the strong ion gap is more cumbersome and expensive to measure than the AG and is thus less suitable as a risk stratification tool in low resource settings. In studies with contrasting findings, AG was noted to be a very strong predictor of mortality or of limited value with neither the AG nor the strong ion gap effective as predictors of in-hospital mortality. Furthermore, it has been noted that studies conducted in countries where gelatin-based intravenous fluids are routinely used, such as the UK and Australia, failed to show an association between the strong ion gap and mortality whereas studies conducted in settings where such fluids are not routinely used, especially the United States were able to demonstrate an association. Gelatins are an exogenous source of unmeasured anions and an increase in AG after gelatin infusion has been demonstrated in animal experimental studies.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^11645sjW]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The use of sodium bicarbonate for the treatment of metabolic acidosis remains controversial in the medical community. Review of the literature overall does not support routine use of bicarbonate, particularly in anion gap metabolic acidosis. The processes underlying pH balance in human physiology are multifaceted, and an understanding of the mechanisms at play, as well as the methods of providing sodium bicarbonate supplementation, will serve an emergency physician well. There are few data demonstrating improved clinical outcomes with sodium bicarbonate use in patients with shock states, DKA, rhabdomyolysis, or cardiac arrest (except in the presence of sodium channel blockade toxicity or hyperkalemia), as shown in Table 2. However, it may benefit patients with NAGMA and, despite physiologic rationale, there are minimal data from RCTs to justify this.

### Severe metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate and multi-organ dysfunction secondary to ethylene glycol toxicity [^113GAcq3]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

This case report describes a male in his early 40s presenting with severe ethylene glycol (EG) poisoning from antifreeze ingestion, marked by profound metabolic acidosis, hyperkalaemia and multi-organ failure. The patient was found unconscious in the garage with shallow breathing and hypothermia, progressing to critical illness despite aggressive resuscitative measures. Diagnostic evaluations revealed high anion gap metabolic acidosis, elevated lactate, hyperkalaemia and a high osmolal gap, confirmed to be due to EG toxicity. Immediate interventions included continuous renal replacement therapy, mechanical ventilation and supportive care, alongside bicarbonate therapy and broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, the patient deteriorated rapidly, developing fixed dilated pupils, cerebral oedema and eventual death on the third day of admission. This case highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of managing severe toxic EG poisoning in critically ill patients and underscores the importance of early recognition and intervention to improve outcomes.

### Circulating anions usually associated with the krebs cycle in patients with metabolic acidosis [^114zLWYZ]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic acidosis is a common presentation in acute medicine and in only a minority of cases can renal failure alone be considered the sole cause of the acidosis. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and 'classic' lactic acidosis (taken as a blood lactate in excess of 5 mmol l -1) account for most of the remaining cases. Amongst clinicians there is an increasing awareness that there is often an important discrepancy between the measured acidosis and the associated base deficit, suggesting that other anions must contribute to the generation of the anion gap. Further evidence to support the hypothesis of additional 'missing anions' is supplied by observations on patients receiving bicarbonate-buffered haemofiltration for treatment of lactic acidosis where it is possible to calculate the net rates of lactate removal and bicarbonate donation by the haemofilter. In patients whose blood pH is slowly falling (thereby excluding any possible confounding effect of other blood buffers), it is not uncommon for the rate of bicarbonate donation to exceed the rate of lactate removal by as much as twofold (PJ Hilton, unpublished observations). This implies that not only lactic acid, but other 'unknown' acids are being neutralised by the bicarbonate in the haemofiltration replacement fluid.

Preliminary experiments performed in this laboratory with high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry on plasma ultrafiltrate obtained from patients with metabolic acidosis had suggested that anions principally associated with the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle were significantly elevated in patients with unexplained metabolic acidosis. We undertook an enzymatic study of anions of the Krebs cycle in patients with metabolic acidosis whose standard base deficit was 8 mmol l -1 or greater. The samples were obtained from consecutive patients who fulfilled these requirements except those with a normal anion gap, which were collected subsequently. The results obtained from the patient samples were compared to control values obtained from healthy volunteers.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^1151jCXe]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

This study has several limitations. First, as a retrospective study, our database is limited to the variables that were collected for clinical management, and some patients with metabolic acidosis may have been excluded because of missing data. However, these were the data available to clinicians and our study demonstrates that a significant number of patients suspected of having lactic acidosis clinically do in fact have other forms of metabolic acidosis. Second, we could not control for severity of illness between groups. Severity of illness scores (for example Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)) were recorded only on admission to ICU and only in a subset of patients. Several patients had their highest lactate levels several days into their stay in ICU. However, the use of severity of illness scores are potentially misleading because metabolic acidosis itself might lead to worsening disease severity. Indeed, most severity scoring systems take into account acid–base variables and/or lactate. Thus, for our model we included age as covariate. We also report the admission diagnostic category in Table 2. The nature of our database (laboratory values) also limited our logistic regression model. Ideally we would have included treatment variables (saline and other resuscitation fluid) as well as other clinical variables (hemodynamics). Another limitation involved our initial selection process. The 'suspicion of lactic acidosis' excluded several patients in whom a metabolic acidosis may have been present for other reasons but was not suspected. The categories of metabolic acidosis were used to describe the predominating anion. Rather than using an arbitrary definition of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis that relies on an absolute value of chloride, we first eliminated all other causes of what has been traditionally classified as an anion gap metabolic acidosis (SIG or lactate). Our classification scheme leaves open the possibility that a combined lactic/SIG acidosis would have been misclassified as hyperchloremic. Conversely, some hyperchloremic cases could have been misclassified as either SIG or lactic acidosis if pre-existing or concomitant metabolic alkalosis was also present, decreasing the apparent impact of chloride. However, these limitations exist with any acid–base classification scheme and given that hyperchloremic acidosis is defined on the basis of 'acidosis without an AG', rather than on the basis of chloride levels, some imprecision is always going to be present.

### Approach to the treatment of methanol intoxication [^111bqZ13]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Methanol intoxication is an uncommon but serious poisoning. Its adverse effects are due primarily to the impact of its major metabolite formic acid and lactic acid resulting from cellular hypoxia. Symptoms including abdominal pain and loss of vision can appear a few hours to a few days after exposure, reflecting the time necessary for accumulation of the toxic byproducts. In addition to a history of exposure, increases in serum osmolal and anion gaps can be clues to its presence. However, increments in both parameters can be absent depending on the nature of the toxic alcohol, time of exposure, and coingestion of ethanol. Definitive diagnosis requires measurement with gas or liquid chromatography, which are laborious and expensive procedures. Tests under study to detect methanol or its metabolite formate might facilitate the diagnosis of this poisoning. Treatment can include administration of ethanol or fomepizole, both inhibitors of the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase to prevent formation of its metabolites, and hemodialysis to remove methanol and formate. In this Acid-Base and Electrolyte Teaching Case, a patient with methanol intoxication due to ingestion of model airplane fuel is described, and the value and limitations of current and new diagnostic and treatment measures are discussed.

### Increased anion gap metabolic acidosis as a result of 5-oxoproline (pyroglutamic acid): a role for acetaminophen [^111sbUtx]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

The endogenous organic acid metabolic acidoses that occur commonly in adults include lactic acidosis; ketoacidosis; acidosis that results from the ingestion of toxic substances such as methanol, ethylene glycol, or paraldehyde; and a component of the acidosis of kidney failure. Another rare but underdiagnosed cause of severe, high anion gap metabolic acidosis in adults is that due to accumulation of 5-oxoproline (pyroglutamic acid). Reported are four patients with this syndrome, and reviewed are 18 adult patients who were reported previously in the literature. Twenty-one patients had major exposure to acetaminophen (one only acute exposure). Eighteen (82%) of the 22 patients were women. Most of the patients were malnourished as a result of multiple medical comorbidities, and most had some degree of kidney dysfunction or overt failure. The chronic ingestion of acetaminophen, especially by malnourished women, may generate high anion gap metabolic acidosis. This undoubtedly is an underdiagnosed condition because measurements of serum and/or urinary 5-oxoproline levels are not readily available.

### Serum anion gap: its uses and limitations in clinical medicine [^112tEJd9]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

The serum anion gap, calculated from the electrolytes measured in the chemical laboratory, is defined as the sum of serum chloride and bicarbonate concentrations subtracted from the serum sodium concentration. This entity is used in the detection and analysis of acid-base disorders, assessment of quality control in the chemical laboratory, and detection of such disorders as multiple myeloma, bromide intoxication, and lithium intoxication. The normal value can vary widely, reflecting both differences in the methods that are used to measure its constituents and substantial interindividual variability. Low values most commonly indicate laboratory error or hypoalbuminemia but can denote the presence of a paraproteinemia or intoxication with lithium, bromide, or iodide. Elevated values most commonly indicate metabolic acidosis but can reflect laboratory error, metabolic alkalosis, hyperphosphatemia, or paraproteinemia. Metabolic acidosis can be divided into high anion and normal anion gap varieties, which can be present alone or concurrently. A presumed 1:1 stoichiometry between change in the serum anion gap (DeltaAG) and change in the serum bicarbonate concentration (DeltaHCO(3)(-)) has been used to uncover the concurrence of mixed metabolic acid-base disorders in patients with high anion gap acidosis. However, recent studies indicate variability in the DeltaAG/DeltaHCO(3)(-) in this disorder. This observation undercuts the ability to use this ratio alone to detect complex acid-base disorders, thus emphasizing the need to consider additional information to obtain the appropriate diagnosis. Despite these caveats, calculation of the serum anion gap remains an inexpensive and effective tool that aids detection of various acid-base disorders, hematologic malignancies, and intoxications.

### Distinguishing between toxic alcohol ingestion vs alcoholic ketoacidosis: how can we tell the difference? [^116JqVxk]. Clinical Toxicology (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA) is common in patients presenting for emergency care. While some disease processes and ingestions are easily excluded, diagnosing toxic alcohol (TA) ingestion can be challenging. This is especially true if drug concentrations are not readily available, which forces clinicians to rely on surrogate markers. Like TA ingestion, alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) produces an elevated osmol gap and an AGMA. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors suggestive of AKA when TA ingestion was the primary alternative differential diagnosis. We hypothesized that the odds of an AKA diagnosis would increase as ethanol concentration increased.

Methods

This was a retrospective analysis of data from 2000 through 2019 from a single US Poison Control Center. Records were reviewed to identify cases coded as "methanol" or "ethylene glycol"; or coded as "alcohol" or "ethanol with acidosis". The case definition for AKA required: (1) documented alcohol use disorder; (2) urine or serum ketones or elevated blood beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration; (3) anion gap ≥ 14mmol/L. The inclusion criterion for TAs was a detectable methanol or ethylene glycol concentration.

Results

Of 699 patients screened, 86 were diagnosed with AKA and 36 were diagnosed with TA ingestion. As ethanol concentration increased, the odds of an AKA diagnosis significantly increased (OR = 1.016, 95% CI 1.002–1.031, p = .03).

Conclusions

In this retrospective analysis, the odds of diagnosing AKA instead of TA ingestion increased as ethanol concentration increased. The limited ability of common clinical factors to differentiate these diagnoses highlights the need to obtain quantitative TA concentrations in real time. Until prospective validation, interpretation of ketone concentrations and toxic alcohol concentrations (when available) will continue to guide decision making.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^113qwkTi]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

An inconsistent relationship has been reported between acid–base abnormalities, their treatment, and outcomes in critically ill patients. Some studies have suggested an independent association between low pH or standard base excess (SBE) and mortality, whereas others have not.

We have recently shown that hemodynamically stable rats with sepsis become hypotensive after infusion of dilute HCl. Similarly we have found decreased survival time in rats with elevated serum chloride levels that were exposed to lethal doses of lipopolysaccharide, as well as different cytokine responses to acidosis induced by lactate or HCl in cell cultures. We therefore propose that the etiologic anion of metabolic acidosis (lactate, chloride, or others) may be a more important determinant of outcome than the pH itself.

Although lactic acidosis has attracted considerable study in critically ill patients, metabolic acidosis can result from a variety of conditions. Although the existing literature does not suggest a strong relationship between the type of acidosis and outcome, traditional methods of classifying and analyzing acid–base abnormalities have significant limitations, especially in critically ill patients. In particular, studies have usually failed to identify the effects that causative anions (for example lactate, chloride, or all others) have on their resulting pH and SBE. Data may be reported as 'non-lactate metabolic acidosis' or 'anion gap metabolic acidosis' without identifying a predominant source. By using a physical–chemical approach to quantify unmeasured anions accurately, coupled with multivariable logistic regression, we believe that a more rigorous characterization of acid–base disorders and their clinical significance can be achieved. Our objective was to determine the effect of different etiologies of metabolic acidosis on hospital mortality and length of stay in critically ill patients suspected of having lactic acidosis. The hypothesis was that the various etiologies of metabolic acidosis have unique mortality and morbidity rates associated with them.

### An unusual case of hyperglycemia, abdominal pain, and increased anion gap acidosis [^117KgwXK]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

In this case report we try to illustrate the importance of correct diagnostic reasoning and the misleading features of point-of-care testing. This case illustrates that even though hyperglycemia, ketonuria, a raised anion gap metabolic acidosis, and acute abdominal pain almost inevitably warrant a diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis, other possibilities still exist and need to be excluded. In that light, we emphasize the clinical and therapeutic importance of determining serum lactate and urinary ketones in the differential diagnosis of a raised anion gap metabolic acidosis.

### Chronic acetaminophen ingestion resulting in severe anion gap metabolic acidosis secondary to 5-oxoproline accumulation: an under diagnosed phenomenon [^112ALu1a]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Anion gap metabolic acidosis is commonly caused by lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, and ingestion of methanol, salicylates, ethylene glycol or accumulation of organic/inorganic acids. However, rare causes of metabolic acidosis from enzyme defects, such as disturbances in the γ-glutamyl cycle, are being reported in higher frequencies in the adult population. Such disturbances cause an accumulation of 5-oxoproline and ultimately an anion gap metabolic acidosis. These disturbances are often associated with acetaminophen in the setting of certain risk factors such as sepsis, malnutrition, liver disease, female gender, pregnancy or renal failure.

### Toxic effects from metformin exposure [^117NAqcB]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The major risk associated with metformin is lactic acidosis. The incidence of lactic acidosis is not clear. Hypoglycemia is not expected to be a major concern after metformin exposure.

Objective

This study assessed the demographics, toxic effects, and clinical syndromes of metformin exposures reported to poison centers nationally.

Methods

The Toxic Exposure Surveillance System (TESS) of the American Association of Poison Control Centers was searched for all metformin-only exposures occurring from January 1, 1996, through December 31, 2000.

Results

There were 10,958,526 total poisoning exposures reported to TESS during the study period. Of those, 4072 cases met the study criteria. Exposures occurred in 2421 (59%) women and were categorized in all patients as acute (3074; 75%), acute-on-chronic (767; 19%), chronic (200; 5%), and chronicity unknown (31; 1%). Children ≤ 12 years old experienced few adverse outcomes and no deaths. There were 20 moderate-effect outcomes (1.8%) and 2 major-effect outcomes (0.2%) in children < 6 years old and 4 moderate-effect outcomes (2.3%) and no major-effect outcomes in children 6–12 years old. In the adult population, the adverse outcomes were distributed evenly across the age span, with a trend toward more serious outcomes in the elderly. There were 9 deaths (0.2%), 32 major-effect cases (0.8%), and 187 moderate-effect cases (4.6%). In all age groups, acidosis was rare (n = 68; 1.6%). Hypoglycemia is more common than previously reported (n = 112; 2.8%). Clinical effects associated with a major outcome or death were hyperglycemia, acidosis, elevated anion gap, elevated creatinine, hypotension, and coma.

Conclusions

Severe adverse events after exposure to metformin are not common, occurring in approximately 1% of cases; this is in agreement with previous reports. The presence of hypotension, acidosis, elevated anion gap, hyperglycemia, and coma may be prognostic of severe or fatal outcome.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^113hUixk]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acid–base abnormalities are common in the intensive care unit (ICU). Differences in outcome exist between respiratory and metabolic acidosis in similar pH ranges. Some forms of metabolic acidosis (for example, lactate) seem to have worse outcomes than others (for example, chloride). The relative incidence of each type of disorder is unknown. We therefore designed this study to determine the nature and clinical significance of metabolic acidosis in critically ill patients.

Methods

An observational, cohort study of critically ill patients was performed in a tertiary care hospital. Critically ill patients were selected on the clinical suspicion of the presence of lactic acidosis. The inpatient mortality of the entire group was 14%, with a length of stay in hospital of 12 days and a length of stay in the ICU of 5.8 days.

Results

We reviewed records of 9,799 patients admitted to the ICUs at our institution between 1 January 2001 and 30 June 2002. We selected a cohort in which clinicians caring for patients ordered a measurement of arterial lactate level. We excluded patients in which any necessary variable required to characterize an acid–base disorder was absent. A total of 851 patients (9% of ICU admissions) met our criteria. Of these, 548 patients (64%) had a metabolic acidosis (standard base excess < -2 mEq/l) and these patients had a 45% mortality, compared with 25% for those with no metabolic acidosis (p < 0.001). We then subclassified metabolic acidosis cases on the basis of the predominant anion present (lactate, chloride, or all other anions). The mortality rate was highest for lactic acidosis (56%); for strong ion gap (SIG) acidosis it was 39% and for hyperchloremic acidosis 29% (p < 0.001). A stepwise logistic regression model identified serum lactate, SIG, phosphate, and age as independent predictors of mortality.

Conclusion

In critically ill patients in which a measurement of lactate level was ordered, lactate and SIG were strong independent predictors of mortality when they were the major source of metabolic acidosis. Overall, patients with metabolic acidosis were nearly twice as likely to die as patients without metabolic acidosis.

### The urine anion gap: a clinically useful index of ammonium excretion [^1134MScZ]. The American Journal of the Medical Sciences (1986). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Urine Anion Gap" for lithium toxicity, ethylene glycol poisoning, sepsis and septic shock, chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis and diabetic ketoacidosis.

The Urine Anion Gap (UAG) is a clinical calculator primarily used in the evaluation of patients with metabolic acidosis, specifically to differentiate between renal and extrarenal causes. It is calculated using the formula: UAG = (urine sodium + urine potassium) - urine chloride. A positive UAG suggests a renal cause of metabolic acidosis, such as renal tubular acidosis, while a negative UAG is indicative of an extrarenal cause, such as diarrhea. It is important to note that the UAG is not applicable in patients with mixed acid-base disorders or those with significant proteinuria or ketoacidosis, as these conditions can interfere with the accuracy of the calculation.

### Estimating unmeasured anions in critically ill patients: anion-gap, base-deficit, and strong-ion-gap [^115eyV8N]. Anaesthesia (2002). Low credibility.

We used 100 routine blood samples from critically ill patients to establish whether correcting the anion-gap and base-deficit for decreased plasma albumin improves agreement with the strong-ion-gap for estimating unmeasured anions and whether the modifications increase the proportion of samples with levels of anion-gap or base-deficit above the reference ranges. We used Bland-Altman analyses to compare the methods of estimating unmeasured ions. Compared with the strong-ion-gap, modification reduced the limits of agreement for both the anion-gap and the base-deficit. The bias for the base-deficit was also reduced but the bias for the anion-gap was increased. The proportion of samples with an anion-gap > 22 meq.l(-1) increased from 4 to 29% (p < 0.001), and the proportion with a base-deficit > 5 meq.l(-1) increased from 8 to 42% (p < 0.001). Consequently, metabolic acidosis from unmeasured ions in critically ill patients maybe more frequent than often recognised.

### Recovery from pH 6.38: lactic acidosis complicated by hypothermia [^113VND9G]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Survival after extreme arterial acidosis is uncommon. A case of metformin induced lactic acidosis is described where the presenting pH was 6.38 exacerbated by hypothermia (29 degrees C). Increased anion gap acidosis, its varied aetiology, potential reversibility, and the role of hypothermia are discussed. Early liaison with a medical toxicology unit is recommended when this rare condition is suspected.

### Circulating anions usually associated with the krebs cycle in patients with metabolic acidosis [^114yzvp4]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute metabolic acidosis of non-renal origin is usually a result of either lactic or ketoacidosis, both of which are associated with a high anion gap. There is increasing recognition, however, of a group of acidotic patients who have a large anion gap that is not explained by either keto- or lactic acidosis nor, in most cases, is inappropriate fluid resuscitation or ingestion of exogenous agents the cause.

Methods

Plasma ultrafiltrate from patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, acidosis of unknown cause, normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, or acidosis as a result of base loss were examined enzymatically for the presence of low molecular weight anions including citrate, isocitrate, α-ketoglutarate, succinate, malate and d-lactate. The results obtained from the study groups were compared with those obtained from control plasma from normal volunteers.

Results

In five patients with lactic acidosis, a significant increase in isocitrate (0.71 ± 0.35 mEq l -1), α-ketoglutarate (0.55 ± 0.35 mEq l -1), malate (0.59 ± 0.27 mEq l -1), and d-lactate (0.40 ± 0.51 mEq l -1) was observed. In 13 patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, significant increases in isocitrate (0.42 ± 0.35 mEq l -1), α-ketoglutarate (0.41 ± 0.16 mEq l -1), malate (0.23 ± 0.18 mEq l -1) and d-lactate (0.16 ± 0.07 mEq l -1) were seen. Neither citrate nor succinate levels were increased. Similar findings were also observed in a further five patients with high anion gap acidosis of unknown origin with increases in isocitrate (0.95 ± 0.88 mEq l -1), α-ketoglutarate (0.65 ± 0.20 mEq l -1), succinate (0.34 ± 0.13 mEq l -1), malate (0.49 ± 0.19 mEq l -1) and d-lactate (0.18 ± 0.14 mEq l -1) being observed but not in citrate concentration. In five patients with a normal anion gap acidosis, no increases were observed except a modest rise in d-lactate (0.17 ± 0.14 mEq l -1).

Conclusion

The levels of certain low molecular weight anions usually associated with intermediary metabolism were found to be significantly elevated in the plasma ultrafiltrate obtained from patients with metabolic acidosis. Our results suggest that these hitherto unmeasured anions may significantly contribute to the generation of the anion gap in patients with lactic acidosis and acidosis of unknown aetiology and may be underestimated in diabetic ketoacidosis. These anions are not significantly elevated in patients with normal anion gap acidosis.

### Acid-base interpretation: a practical approach [^113XiPyq]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acid-base disorders are prevalent in critically ill patients, and a systematic approach is essential for evaluation. The first step is to determine the primary process based on a patient's pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and bicarbonate measurements. After this is complete, the next step is to evaluate for respiratory or metabolic compensation. Deviations from expected compensation may indicate additional acid-base processes. For metabolic acidosis, anion gap calculation distinguishes between anion gap metabolic acidosis and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. The evaluation for anion gap metabolic acidosis includes calculating the osmolal gap and conducting a gap-gap analysis. Evaluating non-anion gap metabolic acidosis involves urine anion gap calculation. These analyses identify potential etiologies and additional acid-base disturbances. Metabolic alkalosis assessment begins with measuring urine chloride levels to determine whether the process is a result of chloride depletion. Respiratory acidosis, caused by hypoventilation, often results from chronic lung disease or neuromuscular dysfunction. Respiratory alkalosis, due to hyperventilation, is common in sepsis, chronic liver disease, and acute pulmonary embolism.

### A patient with alcoholic ketoacidosis and profound lactemia [^115ZZEPS]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) is a complex syndrome that results from disrupted metabolism in the setting of excessive alcohol use and poor oral intake. Dehydration, glycogen depletion, high redox state, and release of stress hormones are the primary factors producing the characteristic anion gap metabolic acidosis with an elevated β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OH) and lactate.

Case Report

We present the case of a 47-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with metabolic acidosis and profoundly elevated lactate levels who had AKA. He recovered completely with intravenous fluids and parenteral glucose administration. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physicians should always consider the immediately life-threatening causes of a severe anion gap metabolic acidosis and treat aggressively based on the situation. This case highlights the fact that AKA can present with an impressively elevated lactate levels. Emergency physicians should keep AKA in the differential diagnosis of patients who present with a similar clinical picture.

### Metabolic acidosis or respiratory alkalosis? Evaluation of a low plasma bicarbonate using the urine anion gap [^1116ZUbJ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Hypobicarbonatemia, or a reduced bicarbonate concentration in plasma, is a finding seen in 3 acid-base disorders: metabolic acidosis, chronic respiratory alkalosis and mixed metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory alkalosis. Hypobicarbonatemia due to chronic respiratory alkalosis is often misdiagnosed as a metabolic acidosis and mistreated with the administration of alkali therapy. Proper diagnosis of the cause of hypobicarbonatemia requires integration of the laboratory values, arterial blood gas, and clinical history. The information derived from the urinary response to the prevailing acid-base disorder is useful to arrive at the correct diagnosis. We discuss the use of urine anion gap, as a surrogate marker of urine ammonium excretion, in the evaluation of a patient with low plasma bicarbonate concentration to differentiate between metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory alkalosis. The interpretation and limitations of urine acid-base indexes at bedside (urine pH, urine bicarbonate, and urine anion gap) to evaluate urine acidification are discussed.

### Use of the deltaAG / deltaHCO3-ratio in the diagnosis of mixed acid-base disorders [^112ddQVR]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

When a strong acid is added to plasma, one expects a quantitative relationship between excess anion gap (DeltaAG) and bicarbonate deficit (DeltaHCO(3)(-)) with the DeltaAG/DeltaHCO(3)(-) ratio close to unity. If true, then this ratio could be used to diagnose mixed acid-base disorders in patients with metabolic acidosis. Although the mean ratio in selected patients is close to unity, this ratio also has a wide range, making its use in individual patients problematic. The ratio should therefore be used cautiously in making a diagnosis of mixed acid-base disorders.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^1128sBHk]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

However, this does not account for the role of weak acids in the balance of electrical charges in plasma water. This is can be expressed through the calculation of the effective SID (SID e). The formula for SID e as determined by Figge and colleagues. is as follows:

SID e = 2.46 × 10–8 × pCO 2 (mmHg)/10 -pH + (albumin (g/l)) × (0.123 × pH - 0.631) + (phosphate (mg/dl)) × (0.309 × pH - 0.469)

This formula accounts quantitatively for the contribution of weak acids to the electrical charge equilibrium in plasma. The difference between SID a and SID e should range from 0 to 2 mEq/l in healthy patients, by following the law of electroneutrality. If there are unexplained charges present, they will be represented by a 'gap' between the SID a and SID e; this is known as the strong ion gap (SIG) and is represented by the following formula:

SIG = SID a - SID e

The traditional anion gap, (Na + + K +) - (Cl - + HCO 3 -), does not account for the effect of weak acids, mostly albumin, which is commonly abnormal in critical illness.

We then classified patients into four groups depending on the anion contributing to most acidosis: no metabolic acidosis defined by SBE ≥ -2 mEq/l; lactic acidosis in which lactate accounted for more than 50% of SBE; SIG acidosis in which the SIG (unmeasured ions) accounted for more than 50% of SBE (and not lactic acidosis); and hyperchloremic acidosis defined as SBE < -2 mEq/l not explained by lactate or SIG. An absolute level of chloride was not used for this definition, because it is the relative relationship between the sodium and chloride concentrations that contribute to SID a and thus one of the independent variables comprising acid–base equilibria. Thus, if there is a metabolic acidosis present and the SIG or lactate does not make up most of the acid load, the only strong ion left is chloride.

### Occult metformin toxicity in three patients with profound lactic acidosis [^116TT8RU]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

There are 20.8 million Americans with diabetes, and metformin is the most commonly prescribed oral diabetes agent. A review of our metformin experience highlights common pitfalls that lead to life-threatening or fatal poisonings. We describe 3 patients with metformin toxicity; 2 of 3 patients were prescribed metformin despite end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Case 1: a 40-year-old woman presented after a polysubstance overdose. Within 8 h, vomiting and lethargy developed; a profound acidosis, pH 6.95, pCO(2) 26, pO(2) 195, and elevated serum lactate 21 mmol/L (ref 0.5–1.6 mmol/L) were noted. Further inquiry revealed that the patient had ingested metformin. She was intubated; bicarbonate therapy and hemodialysis were initiated; however, she became hypotensive and died. A metformin level was 150 μg/mL (therapeutic 1–2 μg/mL). Case 2: a 69-year-old woman with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and ESRD presented to the Emergency Department (ED), having missed dialysis. She was sluggish and complained of abdominal pain; an acidosis, pH 7.37, pCO(2) 20, pO(2) 171; anion gap 38, and elevated serum lactate 18.9 mmol/L were noted. Hemodialysis was initiated when it was revealed that she took metformin daily. She improved rapidly and a metformin level was 27.4 μg/mL. Case 3: a 57-year-old woman with a history of NIDDM and ESRD presented with dyspnea. Laboratory studies showed pH 7.03, pCO(2) 21, pO(2) 99; anion gap 36, and lactate 16 mmol/L. Bicarbonate therapy and hemodialysis were initiated after discovering that she had recently been prescribed metformin. She had a fatal cardiac arrest after dialysis was completed. We describe 3 ED patients with occult metformin toxicity diagnosed after laboratory results showed an anion gap metabolic acidosis and elevated lactate levels. All patients had lethargy, vomiting, or abdominal pain, also suggesting sepsis or mesenteric infarction. Despite sodium bicarbonate therapy and hemodialysis, metformin-associated lactic acidosis was fatal in 2 of 3 patients. Emergency Physicians must be vigilant to recognize metformin toxicity in patients at high risk for metformin-associated lactic acidosis.

### The 'gap' in the 'plasma osmolar gap' [^117Ld7qW]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Ethylene glycol poisoning is a medical emergency that presents challenges for clinicians and clinical laboratories. If left untreated, it may cause morbidity and death, but effective therapy is available if diagnosed in time. The diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning is not always straightforward and the commonly quoted 'plasma osmolar gap' is not sufficiently sensitive to exclude a small ingestion and has been reported to be normal in a number of serious exposures. The 'plasma osmolar gap' cannot distinguish among ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, methanol or ethylene glycol. Thus, the measurement of serum ethylene glycol and, ideally, glycolic acid, its major toxic metabolite in serum, is definitive. This also holds true for methanol and its metabolite formic acid. Ethylene glycol metabolites target the kidney and lead to reversible oliguric or anuric injury, which in turn slows the elimination of ethylene glycol. The therapeutic options include reversal of metabolic acidosis, inhibition of alcohol dehydrogenase and early haemodialysis.

### Circulating anions usually associated with the krebs cycle in patients with metabolic acidosis [^111uFr1n]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Results

Samples were obtained from 28 patients in total and from 12 control subjects. Of the study patients, 13 had DKA at the time of blood sampling and 5 had a lactic acidosis (defined as a blood lactate concentration in excess of 5 mmol/l in the presence of acidosis). Five patients had a metabolic acidosis that could not be ascribed to either lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis or exogenous agents. A further five patients had an acidosis as a result of gastrointestinal or renal ion losses. In all cases, the patients were acidotic with an average pH of 7.18 (± 0.11) and a base deficit of 13.4 (± 4.7) mmol l -1.

The mean results obtained for the plasma ultrafiltrate concentration of citrate, succinate, malate, d-lactate, l-lactate, isocitrate and α-ketoglutarate are presented in Table 1. The mean results obtained from the data together with the maximal value for each anion measured in each type of acidosis are shown in Fig. 1.

Patients with DKA showed significant increases relative to the control values in isocitrate, α-ketoglutarate, malate and d-lactate levels. The concentrations of both citrate and succinate did not differ significantly from controls. Patients with lactic acidosis showed significant increases relative to the control values in citrate, isocitrate, α-ketoglutarate, succinate, malate and d-lactate levels. Patients with acidosis of unknown origin showed significant increases in the concentrations of isocitrate, α-ketoglutarate, succinate, malate and d-lactate. The level of citrate did not differ significantly from that of the controls. In those patients with a normal anion gap acidosis, the levels of citrate, isocitrate, α-ketoglutarate, succinate and malate did not differ significantly from the control values. The concentration of d-lactate was significantly raised compared to control values in this patient group.

### Pseudohyperchloremia and negative anion gap-think salicylate! [^115SkVty]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pseudohyperchloremia results in a very low or negative anion gap. Historically, the most common cause of this artifact was bromide poisoning. Bromide salts have been removed from most medications and bromism has become very uncommon. More recently, the introduction of chloride ion selective sensing electrodes (Cl-ISE) has generated a new cause of pseudohyperchloremia-salicylate poisoning. We describe 5 such patients and quantitate the error generated by this measurement artifact.

Methods

The magnitude of artifactual hyperchloremia generated by high salicylate levels was quantified in 5 patients by measuring chloride concentration with several Cl-ISEs from different manufacturers and with Cl-ISEs of different "ages", and comparing these results to measurements with a chloridometer (coulometric titration), which is free of the salicylate artifact.

Results

Cl-ISEs from different manufacturers generated a wide range of artifactual chloride concentration elevation. Furthermore, the same Cl-ISE generated increasingly severe pseudohyperchloremia as it was repeatedly reused over time and "aged".

Conclusions

Salicylate interferes with measurement of the blood chloride concentration when a Cl-ISE is used. The severity of this artifact is related to the salicylate level, the specific Cl-ISE, and the "age" of the electrode. Toxic blood salicylate levels can generate marked pseudohyperchloremia, and consequently, an artifactual very small or negative anion gap. The large anion gap metabolic acidosis typical of salicylate poisoning is masked by this artifact. Salicylate has become the most common cause of pseudohyperchloremia, and physicians should immediately consider salicylate poisoning whenever the combination of hyperchloremia and a very small or negative anion gap is reported by the laboratory.

### Clinical features of alcoholic ketoacidosis with and without lactic acidosis: a retrospective descriptive study [^11485qbP]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) is a potentially life-threatening condition due to high anion gap metabolic acidosis in chronic alcohol use. While lactic acidosis (LA) is typically uncommon in AKA, AKA without concurrent acute conditions is occasionally complicated with LA. The aim of this study was to clarify the clinical features in isolated AKA patients with LA and those without LA.

Methods

This retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary hospital between January 2021 and January 2024. We identified isolated AKA patients aged ≥ 20 years who presented with high anion gap metabolic acidosis, elevated ketones in serum or urine, and alcohol use disorder. Patients were classified into those with LA (lactate ≥ 4 mmol/L) and those without LA. We examined the clinical characteristics and outcomes in both groups and analyzed lactate trends during hospitalization in patients with LA.

Results

Of 41 patients with AKA, 33 patients (80%) had LA despite the fact that thiamine levels were similar in the two groups. Total ketone body and β-hydroxybutyrate levels in patients with LA were lower than those in patients without LA. Median lactate levels (10.7 mmol/L, IQR 7.7–14.5) in patients with LA decreased by approximately 1 mmol/L per hour during the first six hours post-admission. None of the patients died during hospitalization.

Conclusions

Isolated AKA is likely to be complicated with hyperlactatemia. Higher lactate levels tended to be observed in cases with lower ketone levels. Lactate levels in isolated AKA with LA declined steadily. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings.

When a child presents with high-anion gap metabolic acidosis, the pediatrician can proceed with confidence by recalling some basic principles. Defects of organic acid, pyruvate, and ketone body metabolism that present with acute acidosis are reviewed. Flowcharts for identifying the underlying cause and initiating life-saving therapy are provided. By evaluating electrolytes, blood sugar, lactate, ammonia, and urine ketones, the provider can determine the likelihood of an inborn error of metabolism. Freezing serum, plasma, and urine samples during the acute presentation for definitive diagnostic testing at the provider's convenience aids in the differential diagnosis.

### Unexplained metabolic acidosis: alcoholic ketoacidosis or propylene glycol toxicity [^114Tau7X]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Severe metabolic acidosis with elevated anion and osmol gap is suggestive of toxic alcohol ingestion. The absence of detectable methanol or ethylene glycol in the serum could mean that metabolism is complete or that other hypotheses have to be considered. Ingestion of less common alcohol or alcoholic ketoacidosis should be investigated as illustrated by the present observation.

Case Report

A 46-year-old woman was admitted with altered consciousness in the Emergency Department. In the presence of a high anion gap (peak value 39 mEq/L) metabolic acidosis with mildly increased osmol gap (peak value 19 mOsm/kg), there was a high suspicion of toxic alcohol ingestion in an individual with alcohol use disorder (AUD). Serum arterial lactate concentration was particularly high at 27 mmol/L. Urinalysis failed to reveal the presence of ketone bodies or oxalate crystals. The results of the serum determination of ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol, and isopropanol were obtained within 2 h and were negative. Due to the severity of lactic metabolic acidosis and the persisting suspicion of intoxication by a less common toxic alcohol, antidotal therapy with ethanol was initiated together with hemodialysis. Correction of lactic metabolic acidosis was obtained. Results of urinalysis obtained later revealed the presence not only of propylene glycol and D-lactate but also of significant concentrations of ß-hydroxybutyrate as a marker of alcoholic ketoacidosis.

Discussion

The combination of propylene glycol ingestion and alcoholic ketoacidosis may have contributed to the severity of lactic acidosis.

### Anion and osmolal gaps in the diagnosis of methanol poisoning: clinical study in 28 patients [^116sTKRu]. Intensive Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate anion and osmolal gaps as diagnostic tools in methanol poisoning.

Design and Setting

Clinical observational study.

Patients and Methods

In a recent methanol outbreak, the initial triage and treatment decisions in 28 patients were based mainly upon the values of the osmolal and anion gaps on admission. Methanol and formate levels were later compared to these gaps by linear regression analysis.

Results

The correlation between the osmolal gaps and serum methanol concentrations on admission was linear (y = 1.03x+12.71, R2 = 0.94). The anion gaps correlated well with the serum formate concentrations (y = 1.12x+13.82, R2 = 0.86). Both gaps were elevated in 24 of the 28 subjects upon admission. Three patients had an osmolal gap within the reference area (because of low serum methanol), but elevated anion gap because of formate accumulation. One patient with probable concomitant ethanol ingestion had a high osmolal gap and a normal anion gap.

Conclusion

Osmolal and anion gaps are useful in the diagnosis and triage of methanol-exposed subjects. Confounders are low serum methanol and concomitant ethanol ingestion.

Among other possible causes, normal anion gap metabolic acidosis can be caused by toluene poisoning, acute diarrhea, posthypocapnic acidosis, chronic kidney disease, hyperkalemic distal renal tubular acidosis, proximal renal tubular acidosis, hypokalemic distal renal tubular acidosis, pancreatic fistula, Addison's disease, ileostomy and complications of ureterosigmoidostomy. In addition, normal anion gap metabolic acidosis can be caused by medications such as acetazolamide and cholestyramine.

### Toxic alcohol ingestions: clinical features, diagnosis, and management [^115BXWUQ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Alcohol-related intoxications, including methanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, and propylene glycol, and alcoholic ketoacidosis can present with a high anion gap metabolic acidosis and increased serum osmolal gap, whereas isopropanol intoxication presents with hyperosmolality alone. The effects of these substances, except for isopropanol and possibly alcoholic ketoacidosis, are due to their metabolites, which can cause metabolic acidosis and cellular dysfunction. Accumulation of the alcohols in the blood can cause an increment in the osmolality, and accumulation of their metabolites can cause an increase in the anion gap and a decrease in serum bicarbonate concentration. The presence of both laboratory abnormalities concurrently is an important diagnostic clue, although either can be absent, depending on the time after exposure when blood is sampled. In addition to metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure and neurologic disease can occur in some of the intoxications. Dialysis to remove the unmetabolized alcohol and possibly the organic acid anion can be helpful in treatment of several of the alcohol-related intoxications. Administration of fomepizole or ethanol to inhibit alcohol dehydrogenase, a critical enzyme in metabolism of the alcohols, is beneficial in treatment of ethylene glycol and methanol intoxication and possibly diethylene glycol and propylene glycol intoxication. Given the potentially high morbidity and mortality of these intoxications, it is important for the clinician to have a high degree of suspicion for these disorders in cases of high anion gap metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, or unexplained neurologic disease so that treatment can be initiated early.

### Approach to patients with high anion gap metabolic acidosis: core curriculum 2021 [^115oS1GG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The anion gap (AG) is a mathematical construct that compares the blood sodium concentration with the sum of the chloride and bicarbonate concentrations. It is a helpful calculation that divides the metabolic acidoses into 2 categories: high AG metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis-and thereby delimits the potential etiologies of the disorder. When the [AG] is compared with changes in the bicarbonate concentration, other occult acid-base disorders can be identified. Furthermore, finding that the AG is very small or negative can suggest several occult clinical disorders or raise the possibility of electrolyte measurement artifacts. In this installment of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology, we discuss cases that represent several very common and several rare causes of HAGMA. These case scenarios highlight how the AG can provide vital clues that direct the clinician toward the correct diagnosis. We also show how to calculate and, if necessary, correct the AG for hypoalbuminemia and severe hyperglycemia. Plasma osmolality and osmolal gap calculations are described and when used together with the AG guide appropriate clinical decision making.

### A visual schematic for clarifying the temporal relationship between the anion and osmol gaps in toxic alcohol poisoning [^111nUvXC]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Delayed treatment of ethylene glycol or methanol poisoning can result in life-threatening complications, but obtaining quantitative levels is delayed by several hours in most hospitals. Calculating the anion gap and the osmol gap are recommended to hasten identification and treatment in cases of suspected toxic alcohol poisoning. However, relying on the anion and osmol gap calculations without understanding the temporal relationship between these 2 gaps can lead to delayed identification and increased morbidity in cases of toxic alcohol poisoning. Our "Mountain" schematic illustrates the presence of an elevated osmol gap found early in toxic alcohol poisoning and the presence of an elevated anion gap found later in the course of poisoning. Using the "Mountain" diagram as a clarification of the temporal relationship between the anion and the osmol gap can improve the diagnostic use of these screening assays.

### Severe hyperlactatemia with normal base excess: a quantitative analysis using conventional and stewart approaches [^112HcoT4]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Twenty percent of critically ill patients have severe hyperlactatemia with normal pH, [HCO 3 -], and [BE] levels because of a concomitant presence of hypochloremic alkalosis.

- As previously shown, both the conventional and Stewart approaches allow the correct identification of mixed metabolic acidosis and alkalosis.

- The evaluation of plasma chloride and the difference between the changes in the anion gap and bicarbonate should always be considered for a correct diagnosis of acid–base disorders.

### Metformin hydrochloride extended release (metformin HCl ER) [^116HAboC]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Warnings Section

Lactic Acidosis:

Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 mcg/mL are generally found.

The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥ 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS).

### Artifactual elevation of lactate in ethylene glycol poisoning [^117YEph4]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning is based on nonspecific clinical symptoms and signs and indirect and direct laboratory measurement. Few institutions have timely access to direct measurement of ethylene glycol. As a result, diagnosis sometimes can be delayed and therapy initiated late. We present two cases of ethylene glycol poisoning. These cases demonstrate the need to recognize the false elevation of lactate in some chemistry analyzers due to the interference of glycolic acid, a metabolite of ethylene glycol. Using the "lactate gap" in comparing the measurement of lactate with two commonly used chemical analyzers aids in differentiating ethylene glycol poisoning from lactic acidosis.

### Topiramate [^115YfctW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Metabolic Acidosis

Topiramate can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by topiramate. Topiramate-induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of topiramate.

Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with topiramate in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for topiramate (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value < 17 mEq/L and ≥ 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to < 2% for placebo.

### Metformin hydrochloride (Glumetza) [^113Y4D8W]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Lactic Acidosis

There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of GLUMETZA. In GLUMETZA-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/minute under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.

Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue GLUMETZA and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.

### Acute cyanide poisoning [^113wkv77]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Cyanide intoxication is an extremely rare event. We report a case of a teenager presenting with unresponsiveness, hemodynamic instability, and profound anion gap metabolic acidosis secondary to elevated lactate levels. It was later confirmed that he was a victim of cyanide poisoning.

Design

Individual case report.

Setting

Pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital.

Patient

A 17-yr-old male presented with seizures, apnea, and cardiovascular collapse. His laboratory evaluation revealed extreme anion gap metabolic acidosis, elevated lactate levels, and absent arteriovenous saturation difference.

Interventions

The patient required inotropic support and external cardiac pacing for hemodynamic instability. Serial measurements of electrolytes and arterial and central venous blood gases were performed. When cyanide poisoning was suspected he received antidote therapy, administered initially with interval dosing and then as a continuous infusion. The antidote infusions were stopped because of a high level of resultant methemoglobinemia and the belief that all ingested cyanide had been cleared, given the time from exposure. The patient never recovered neurologic function, was declared brain dead, and became a tissue and organ donor.

Conclusion

Cyanide poisoning is a rare and potentially fatal event. Prompt recognition of its possibility in a critically ill patient can lead to early intervention with antidote therapy and decrease the extent of morbidity and mortality.

### Linezolid-induced lactic acidosis [^1172x9XC]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Linezolid is a commonly prescribed antibiotic in clinical practice. Although thrombocytopenia and peripheral neuropathy are frequently encountered following prolonged administration of linezolid, lactic acidosis is a rare adverse drug reaction. We present the case of a patient on linezolid for disseminated multidrug-resistant tuberculosis who presented with vomiting, dyspnoea, hypotension and high anion gap metabolic acidosis. The initial presentation mimicked sepsis syndrome. Ketoacidosis and renal dysfunction were ruled out. There was no history of ingestion of toxins/toxic alcohols. Sepsis was unlikely because extensive radiological and microbiological testing could not identify an infection. Given the possibility of linezolid-induced lactic acidosis (LILA), linezolid was discontinued on admission. The patient's lactic acidosis resolved, and his overall condition improved. A retrospective diagnosis of LILA was thus established. LILA should be considered when patients on linezolid present with lactic acidosis and other causes for the lactic acidosis have been ruled out.

### Citric acid ingestion: a life-threatening cause of metabolic acidosis [^1112S4hC]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

We present a case that illustrates the acute (< 6 hours) metabolic and hemodynamic effects of the ingestion of a massive oral citric acid load. The principal findings included metabolic acidosis accompanied by an increase in the plasma anion gap that was not caused by L -lactic acidosis, hyperkalemia, and the abrupt onset of hypotension. A unique feature was a dramatic clinical improvement when ionized calcium was infused. The case illustrates the importance of considering the properties of the conjugate base (anion) of the added acid because, in this instance, the citrate anion had a unique and life-threatening consequence (lower ionized calcium level) that was rapidly reversible.

### Glyburide and metformin hydrochloride (Glucovance) [^115uNUf8]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis:

Lactic
acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due
to metformin accumulation during treatment with GLUCOVANCE (Glyburide and
Metformin HCl) Tablets; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of
cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic
conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant
tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated
blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances
with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When
metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma
levels > 5 µg/mL are generally found.

The
reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride
is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately
0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure
to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis.
Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant
renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion,
often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and
multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring
pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive
heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased
risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree
of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may,
therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function
in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin.
In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring
of renal function. GLUCOVANCE treatment should not be initiated in patients
≥ 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that
renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing
lactic acidosis. In addition, GLUCOVANCE should be promptly withheld in the
presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis.
Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear
lactate, GLUCOVANCE should generally be avoided in patients with clinical
or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against
excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking GLUCOVANCE,
since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate
metabolism. In addition, GLUCOVANCE should be temporarily discontinued prior
to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see
also PRECAUTIONS).

### Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: a clinical approach to Evaluation [^114PbRS8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Acid-base disturbances can result from kidney or nonkidney disorders. We present a case of high-volume ileostomy output causing large bicarbonate losses and resulting in a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis can present as a form of either acute or chronic metabolic acidosis. A complete clinical history and physical examination are critical initial steps to begin the evaluation process, followed by measuring serum electrolytes with a focus on potassium level, blood gas, urine pH, and either direct or indirect urine ammonium concentration. The present case was selected to highlight the differential diagnosis of a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis and illustrate a systematic approach to this problem.

### Maralixibat chloride (Livmarli) [^116DjGrf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Single doses of maralixibat up to 500 mg, approximately 18-fold higher than the recommended dose, have been administered in healthy adults and were tolerated without a meaningful increase in adverse effects when compared to lower doses. If an overdose occurs, discontinue LIVMARLI, monitor the patient for any signs and symptoms and institute general supportive measures if needed.

LIVMARLI contains propylene glycol as an excipient. In cases of suspected overdose, monitor for signs of propylene glycol toxicity, including hemolysis, hyperosmolarity with anion gap metabolic acidosis, acute kidney injury, and CNS toxicity. Discontinue LIVMARLI if propylene glycol toxicity is suspected.

### Diagnosis of toxic alcohols: limitations of present methods [^117NvMU7]. Clinical Toxicology (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Methanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, and propylene glycol intoxications are associated with cellular dysfunction and an increased risk of death. Adverse effects can develop quickly; thus, there is a need for methods for rapidly detecting their presence.

Objective

To examine the value and limitations of present methods to diagnose patients with possible toxic alcohol exposure.

Methods

I searched MEDLINE for articles published between 1969 and 2014 using the terms: toxic alcohols, serum osmolality, serum osmol gap, serum anion gap, metabolic acidosis, methanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and fomepizole. Each article was reviewed for additional references.

Results

The diagnosis of toxic alcohol exposure is often made on the basis of this history and physical findings along with an increase in the serum osmol and anion gaps. However, an increase in the osmol and/or anion gaps is not always present. Definitive detection in blood requires gas or liquid chromatography, laborious and expensive procedures which are not always available. Newer methods including a qualitative colorimetric test for detection of all alcohols or enzymatic tests for a specific alcohol might allow for more rapid diagnosis.

Conclusions

Exposure to toxic alcohols is associated with cellular dysfunction and increased risk of death. Treatment, if initiated early, can markedly improve outcome, but present methods of diagnosis including changes in serum osmol and anion gap, and use of gas or liquid chromatography have important limitations. Development of more rapid and effective tests for detection of these intoxications is essential for optimal care of patients.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^113UqxFY]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Length of stay in hospital and in ICU did not differ significantly between the different groups of metabolic acidosis or even between the groups that did and did not have metabolic acidosis. This may be explained by our selection process (suspicion of lactic acidosis), which most probably selected a cohort that was more unwell than the overall ICU population.

The controversy about conflicting results of six previous outcome studies is compounded with our results. Several key limitations of the some of these previous studies were discussed by Rocktaeschel and colleagues. and these authors address several important issues including small sample size and low mortality rates. Even though Rocktaeschel and colleagues identified a significant difference in SIG values between survivors and non-survivors, in their logistic regression model there was a strong correlation between SIG, AG, AGc, and standard base excess caused by unmeasured anions. These variables are also strongly linked, making predictive outcomes difficult when all are included in a simple multivariable analysis. Another interesting observation is the role of gelatin-based resuscitation fluid and its effect on SIG. Polygeline-based fluids have been shown to elevate SIG, seemingly without increasing mortality. Interestingly, studies that have found that SIG is correlated with outcome were conducted in settings in which gelatin-based fluids were not used, whereas studies that found no correlation between SIG and outcomes were conducted in settings in which polygeline-based resuscitation solutions are common. Without controlling for resuscitation strategies that increase the amount of unmeasured anions, it is difficult to determine whether SIG is a predictor of mortality.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^114St9K8]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Key messages

- 	Metabolic acidoses resulting from different acids are associated with different outcomes.

- 	Acidosis resulting from lactate and unidentified anions (SIG) were associated with significantly higher hospital mortality than hyperchloremic acidosis.

- 	By multivariate logistic regression, lactate, age, SIG, and phosphate levels were independent predictors of mortality. Notably, SBE and pH were not.

- 	Given the strong and independent association between SIG and mortality in this cohort it seems important to monitor SIG clinically.

- 	AGc (corrected for albumin and phosphate) and SIG show good agreement, and clinically significant differences were rarely observed in our cohort.

### Optimal perfusion targets in cardiogenic Shock [^112Zc2kD]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis caused by lactic acidosis from tissue hypoperfusion and anaerobic metabolism, compounded by AKI and reduced hepatic LC, is the most common acid-base abnormality seen in CS. Acidosis may further impair cardiovascular function and worsen hemodynamics through reduced vasopressor responsiveness, decreased cardiac contractility, and altered systemic vascular resistance. There are a number of ways to quantify metabolic acidosis including base deficit, anion gap, and strong ion gap. Of particular interest in the CS cohort is base deficit or the amount of base required to titrate a liter of arterial blood to a pH of 7.40. Attana et allooked at 63 patients with CS following ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and found that a greater base deficit was seen among nonsurvivors, but there were no detectable differences in anion gap or strong ion gap. A study examining the prognostic value of serum bicarbonate on 28-day mortality in a cohort of AMI-CS found that baseline serum bicarbonate was higher, and base deficit lower, in survivors compared to nonsurvivors. Interestingly, bicarbonate levels were seen to decrease before a significant rise in lactate occurred. Furthermore, incrementally lower baseline bicarbonate levels were associated with progressively higher mortality rates. Serum bicarbonate and base deficit may be additional prognostic markers in CS. However, their utility as another potential target of resuscitation remains uncertain.

### The fall of the serum anion gap… [^113kRJoE]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Using modern electrode technology, we evaluated the reference range for the anion gap in serum to determine whether the 8 to 16 mmol/L reference range in common use is still valid. After measurement of electrolytes in serum from 29 healthy volunteers, aqueous standards verified against National Bureau of Standards reference material, and serum from 120 blood donors, we drew the following conclusions. The reference range for the anion gap has shifted downward, primarily because of an upward shift in chloride values. Using the ASTRA analyzer, a majority of normal individuals can be expected to have serum anion gaps of 6 mmol/L or less unless chloride calibration is deliberately altered.

If the anion gap is to remain an effective tool in diagnosing acid-base disorders, clinicians need to be aware that the traditional reference range may not be appropriate with new instrumentation.

### The threshold of serum anion gap as a screening tool for… [^113Actc9]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

Method: Computerized extraction of anonymised data from electronic medical records was performed. A pre-defined criteria included all inpatients of an acute-care hospital who had measurements for organic acids paired with a serum urea, electrolyte and creatinine panel. The AG is a reflection of the unmeasured anions. The anion gap is derived from the U&E panel by subtracting measured anions from measured cations: AG = +
- - The serum potassium can be included in the calculation, but due to low variability of serum potassium, most clinicians omit serum potassium in the calculation of AG. Accumulation of organic acids results in a high AG metabolic acidosis and such patients have a significant risk of further clinical deterioration.

It has however been challenging to assess for gap acidosis as the range for normal AG can vary greatly due to historical differences in the laboratory techniques used to measure the constituents of AG as well as a component of interindividual variability. In the past, AG were reported in the range of 9–17 milliequivalents/L or 8–16 milliequivalents/L with older laboratory techniques such as flame photometry, colorimetric method. In more recent years with the advent of use of ion-selective electrodes, published literature suggests that the AG range may be lower as the ISE may give higher readings of serum chloride. Some clinical texts and laboratories have listed the reference range of AG as 3–11 milliequivalents/L or 5–12 milliequivalents/L. Despite so, the reference range for serum sodium, potassium and chloride themselves have remained the same over the years despite changes in laboratory techniques.

With such conflicting information, it is important to re-evaluate the screening or diagnostic threshold of the AG based on modern laboratory techniques. Statistical Analysis Plan: The patients will be divided into 2 groups
- with / without organic acidosis. An area under the curve of receiver operating characteristics analysis of AG for the detection of organic acidosis will be performed.
