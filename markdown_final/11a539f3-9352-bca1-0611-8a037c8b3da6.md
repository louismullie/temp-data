## Question

What are the indications for cardioversion in atrial fibrillation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the indications for cardioversion in atrial fibrillation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching clinical contexts that drive cardioversion decisions. Then, I should verify the hemodynamic stability framework and when immediate electrical cardioversion is indicated. Next, I will examine indications in stable patients, including symptom-driven rhythm control and diagnostic or prognostic uses. After that, I need to check special scenarios like pre-excitation, postoperative AF, and pregnancy. Finally, I should review anticoagulation requirements and practical modifiers that influence timing and modality, and close with a concise synthesis of indications by category.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts that frame cardioversion decisions. Cardioversion is considered in two broad buckets: acute management of new-onset or ongoing AF, and elective management of persistent AF as part of a rhythm-control strategy, with the decision influenced by symptoms, hemodynamics, AF duration, and patient preferences, and both electrical and pharmacologic methods are acceptable depending on the scenario [^9bd193a0] [^1c1e0395].

> Now, I will examine hemodynamic instability, because this is the clearest indication for immediate action. Wait, let me verify the threshold for "unstable". Guidelines converge on immediate synchronized electrical cardioversion when AF causes hypotension, acute heart failure, ongoing myocardial ischemia, or pre-excitation with very rapid ventricular response, and this applies regardless of AF duration or prior anticoagulation status, with the caveat that post-shock anticoagulation should be addressed promptly if AF duration is longer than 48 hours or unknown [^7cdd3d35] [^144baa2f] [^3cddd17d] [^6fc410d1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stable patients. I should confirm the indications in hemodynamically stable AF. In stable patients, cardioversion is reasonable for symptom relief when AF-related symptoms are unacceptable or quality of life is impaired, when adequate rate control cannot be achieved or is not tolerated, or when rhythm control is preferred for patient-specific reasons; importantly, cardioversion can be electrical or pharmacologic, and electrical cardioversion has higher immediate success but requires sedation, whereas pharmacologic cardioversion avoids sedation but is slower and less effective in some settings [^9bd193a0] [^528618e3] [^70c3efd0].

> I need to check whether cardioversion is ever used diagnostically or prognostically. Yes, in selected cases of persistent AF with uncertainty about the value of restoring sinus rhythm, electrical cardioversion can be used to assess symptom improvement or to evaluate recovery of left ventricular function, which can guide long-term rhythm strategy decisions; this is a recognized, though less common, indication [^3b1d646a].

> Next, I should review special scenarios that modify urgency or modality. Pre-excited AF with very rapid ventricular response warrants immediate synchronized cardioversion due to hemodynamic compromise and malignant arrhythmia risk; postoperative AF that is poorly tolerated beyond 48 hours should be cardioverted with attention to anticoagulation and, if needed, imaging to exclude thrombus; and in pregnancy, direct-current cardioversion is considered safe for mother and fetus when clinically indicated, with standard synchronization and pad placement precautions [^3cddd17d] [^f66de50d] [^fe4471f7].

> Let me consider anticoagulation, because this is where errors often occur. For AF of 48 hours or longer, or of unknown duration, I should confirm that therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 3 weeks before and 4 weeks after cardioversion is recommended, or alternatively a TEE-guided strategy with abbreviated preprocedural anticoagulation if no thrombus is seen, followed by 4 weeks of anticoagulation; DOACs are preferred over VKAs when not contraindicated, and for AF less than 48 hours, anticoagulation is still advised around cardioversion in many patients, with risk stratification by CHA2DS2-VASc informing decisions, especially as risk rises with longer symptom duration even within 48 hours [^8145c17a] [^229585dc] [^e85b184d] [^88c3f75f] [^510d5285].

> But wait, what if the patient presents with very recent-onset AF and minimal stroke risk. I should double-check the nuance here. Even when AF is less than 48 hours, thromboembolic risk is not uniformly low, and observational data show increasing events with longer time-to-cardioversion within 48 hours; thus, many guidelines still recommend peri-cardioversion anticoagulation unless the patient is very low risk and the duration is clearly very short, and some recommend imaging even in sub-48-hour AF when risk is elevated, so I need to individualize rather than assume safety without anticoagulation [^88c3f75f] [^11a39f0b] [^14e3e20e].

> I will now examine modality selection and practical modifiers. Electrical cardioversion is more effective than pharmacologic conversion and is preferred when rapid restoration is needed or when drugs fail, but it requires sedation; pharmacologic cardioversion is reasonable in stable patients when sedation is undesirable or unavailable, with ibutilide, flecainide, propafenone, and amiodarone as key agents selected by LV function and comorbidities, and pill-in-the-pocket flecainide or propafenone appropriate for carefully selected patients after in-hospital safety testing [^9bd193a0] [^70c3efd0] [^a65c6492].

> Let me synthesize the indications succinctly. Immediate electrical cardioversion is indicated for hemodynamic instability attributable to AF, including hypotension, acute heart failure, ongoing myocardial ischemia, or pre-excited AF with very rapid ventricular response. In hemodynamically stable patients, cardioversion is indicated for unacceptable AF-related symptoms despite rate control, failure or intolerance of rate control, or patient preference for rhythm control, and it can be used diagnostically to assess symptom or LV function improvement. Special contexts include postoperative AF beyond 48 hours when poorly tolerated and pregnancy, where cardioversion is safe when indicated. Across all scenarios, anticoagulation rules must be applied based on AF duration and stroke risk, with DOACs preferred when appropriate and TEE-guided strategies considered to expedite care when clinically justified [^7cdd3d35] [^144baa2f] [^9bd193a0] [^3b1d646a] [^f66de50d] [^fe4471f7] [^8145c17a] [^e85b184d].

Cardioversion is indicated in atrial fibrillation (AF) to restore sinus rhythm when **symptoms are severe or hemodynamics are compromised** [^9bd193a0]. Immediate electrical cardioversion is indicated for **hemodynamic instability** (hypotension, acute heart failure, ischemia, or pre-excitation with rapid ventricular response) [^7cdd3d35] [^144baa2f]. In stable patients, cardioversion is indicated for **persistent symptomatic AF** — especially if symptoms persist despite rate control or if rhythm control is preferred — and for **recent-onset AF** (< 48 hours) when rapid restoration of sinus rhythm is desired [^9bd193a0] [^c15b7566]. For AF ≥ 48 hours or unknown duration, anticoagulation for ≥ 3 weeks or TEE to exclude thrombus is required before cardioversion [^8145c17a] [^229585dc]. Pharmacologic cardioversion is reasonable in stable patients without structural heart disease, whereas electrical cardioversion is preferred when rapid conversion is needed or pharmacologic therapy fails [^70c3efd0] [^528618e3].

## Indications for cardioversion in atrial fibrillation

### Hemodynamic instability

Immediate electrical cardioversion is indicated for **hemodynamic instability** attributable to AF, including:

- **Hypotension**: Systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg or signs of shock [^notfound].

- **Acute heart failure**: Pulmonary edema or severe dyspnea [^notfound].

- **Ischemia**: Ongoing myocardial ischemia or infarction [^3cddd17d].

- **Pre-excitation**: Rapid ventricular response with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^3cddd17d].

---

### Symptomatic atrial fibrillation

In hemodynamically stable patients, cardioversion is indicated for **significant symptoms** attributable to AF, such as:

- **Palpitations**: Severe or persistent palpitations affecting quality of life [^9bd193a0].

- **Dyspnea**: Exertional dyspnea or orthopnea due to loss of atrial kick [^9bd193a0].

- **Fatigue**: Significant fatigue or reduced exercise tolerance [^9bd193a0].

- **Dizziness or syncope**: Due to inadequate cardiac output [^notfound].

---

### Recent-onset atrial fibrillation

Cardioversion is indicated for **recent-onset AF** (< 48 hours), particularly when:

- **Rapid restoration**: Rapid restoration of sinus rhythm is desired [^c15b7566].

- **Symptom relief**: Symptom relief is prioritized over rate control [^9bd193a0].

- **Low risk**: Low thromboembolic risk (CHA2DS2-VASc score 0–1) [^notfound].

---

### Persistent atrial fibrillation

For persistent AF, cardioversion is indicated when:

- **Symptom control**: Symptoms persist despite adequate rate control [^9bd193a0].

- **Rhythm control**: Rhythm control is preferred over rate control [^9bd193a0].

- **Structural benefit**: Potential improvement in left ventricular function or symptoms is anticipated [^3b1d646a].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Cardioversion is contraindicated or requires caution in the following scenarios:

- **Digitalis toxicity**: Contraindicated due to risk of malignant arrhythmias [^3cddd17d].

- **Electrolyte imbalance**: Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia should be corrected before cardioversion [^14b73fc5].

- **Left atrial thrombus**: Exclude with TEE if AF duration is ≥ 48 hours or unknown [^14e3e20e].

- **Severe structural heart disease**: Use caution with pharmacologic cardioversion [^e84ec181].

---

## Anticoagulation requirements

Anticoagulation is essential to prevent thromboembolism:

| **Af duration** | **Anticoagulation strategy** |
|-|-|
| < 48 hours | - Anticoagulation at presentation <br/> - Continue ≥ 4 weeks post-cardioversion [^a95ca8ec] |
| ≥ 48 hours or unknown | - ≥ 3 weeks anticoagulation before cardioversion <br/> - Or TEE-guided strategy <br/> - Continue ≥ 4 weeks post-cardioversion [^8145c17a] [^229585dc] |

---

## Choice of cardioversion method

Electrical cardioversion is preferred for **rapid restoration**, hemodynamic instability, or failed pharmacologic therapy, whereas pharmacologic cardioversion is reasonable in stable patients without structural heart disease or when sedation is undesirable [^9bd193a0] [^70c3efd0].

---

Cardioversion is indicated in AF for **hemodynamic instability**, **significant symptoms**, or **recent-onset AF** when rapid restoration is desired. Anticoagulation and careful patient selection are essential to minimize risks and maximize benefits.

Pharmacological versus electrical cardioversion—effectiveness, timing, and anticoagulation considerations: Cardioversion may be achieved by means of drugs or electrical shocks, and although drug use has increased, disadvantages include the risk of drug-induced torsades de pointes; pharmacological cardioversion is less effective than direct-current cardioversion when biphasic shocks are used, while electrical cardioversion requires conscious sedation or anesthesia. There is no evidence that the risk of thromboembolism or stroke differs between pharmacological and electrical methods, and recommendations for anticoagulation are therefore the same for both methods. Pharmacological cardioversion seems most effective when initiated within 7 d after the onset of an episode of atrial fibrillation; a large proportion of patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation experience spontaneous cardioversion within 24 to 48 h, whereas spontaneous conversion is less frequent with longer than 7-d duration and efficacy of drug cardioversion is markedly reduced. Pharmacological therapy may accelerate restoration of sinus rhythm but the advantage over placebo is modest after 24 to 48 h and is much less effective in persistent atrial fibrillation, and some drugs have a delayed onset with conversion not occurring for several days after initiation. Antiarrhythmic drugs can interact with vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants when added or withdrawn, and when anticoagulation is initiated for elective cardioversion, adding an antiarrhythmic may perturb the intensity of anticoagulation beyond the intended therapeutic range, raising the risk of bleeding or thromboembolic complications.

Cardioversion of atrial fibrillation—basis for cardioversion indicates that cardioversion may be performed electively to restore sinus rhythm in patients with persistent AF, may be immediate when the arrhythmia is the main factor responsible for acute heart failure, hypotension, or worsening angina in coronary artery disease, and carries a risk of thromboembolism unless anticoagulation prophylaxis is initiated before the procedure, with risk greatest when the arrhythmia has been present for longer than 48 h.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Prevention of thromboembolism during cardioversion in atrial fibrillation—For atrial fibrillation (AF) of 48-h duration or longer or unknown duration, anticoagulation with an international normalized ratio (INR) 2.0 to 3.0 is recommended for at least 3 wk prior to and 4 wk after cardioversion. For AF of more than 48-h duration with hemodynamic instability requiring immediate cardioversion, heparin should be administered concurrently by an initial intravenous bolus followed by a continuous infusion to prolong activated partial thromboplastin time to 1.5 to 2 times the reference control value; thereafter, oral anticoagulation (INR 2.0 to 3.0) should be provided for at least 4 wk, and limited data support subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin in this indication. For AF of less than 48-h duration associated with hemodynamic instability, cardioversion should be performed immediately without delay for prior initiation of anticoagulation. During the first 48 h after onset of AF, the need for anticoagulation before and after cardioversion may be based on the patient’s risk of thromboembolism. As an alternative to preprocedural anticoagulation, it is reasonable to perform transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to search for thrombus in the left atrium (LA) or left atrial appendage (LAA); if no thrombus is identified, cardioversion is reasonable immediately after unfractionated heparin with activated partial thromboplastin time 1.5 to 2 times the control value until a vitamin K antagonist achieves an INR equal to or greater than 2.0, followed by oral anticoagulation (INR 2.0 to 3.0) for at least 4 wk. For patients with thrombus identified by TEE, oral anticoagulation (INR 2.0 to 3.0) is reasonable for at least 3 wk prior to and 4 wk after restoration of sinus rhythm.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Direct-current cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and flutter—recommendations: When a rapid ventricular response does not respond promptly to pharmacological measures in AF with ongoing myocardial ischemia, symptomatic hypotension, angina, or HF, immediate R-wave synchronized direct-current cardioversion is recommended (Level of Evidence: C). Immediate direct-current cardioversion is recommended for AF with preexcitation when very rapid tachycardia or hemodynamic instability occurs (Level of Evidence: B). Cardioversion is recommended in patients without hemodynamic instability when AF symptoms are unacceptable, and in case of early relapse after cardioversion, repeated direct-current attempts may be made following administration of antiarrhythmic medication (Level of Evidence: C). As Class IIa, direct-current cardioversion can be useful to restore sinus rhythm as part of a long-term management strategy in AF (Level of Evidence: B), and patient preference is a reasonable consideration for infrequently repeated cardioversions in symptomatic or recurrent AF (Level of Evidence: C). As Class III, frequent repetition of direct-current cardioversion is not recommended when periods of sinus rhythm are relatively short after multiple procedures despite prophylactic antiarrhythmic drug therapy (Level of Evidence: C), and electrical cardioversion is contraindicated in patients with digitalis toxicity or hypokalemia (Level of Evidence: C).

### Best evidence topic report. anticoagulation before cardioversion of acute atrial fibrillation in the emergency department [^79d8486b]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

A short cut review was carried out to establish whether anticoagulation is indicated prior to emergency department cardioversion of a patient with acute onset atrial fibrillation. 54 papers were found using the reported search, of which none presented any evidence to answer the clinical question. It is concluded that there is no evidence available to answer this question. Further research is needed.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter—pericardioversion anticoagulation: Anticoagulation is recommended for 3 wk prior to and 4 wk after cardioversion for patients with AF of unknown duration or with AF for more than 48 h, and when acute AF produces hemodynamic instability, immediate cardioversion should not be delayed, but intravenous unfractionated heparin or subcutaneous injection of a low-molecular-weight heparin should be initiated before cardioversion. Pooled data indicate that 98% of clinical thromboembolic events occur within 10 d, supporting administration of an anticoagulant for at least 4 wk after cardioversion and that continuation for a considerably longer period may be warranted even after apparently successful cardioversion. In a multicenter randomized study (n=1222), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-guided and conventional strategies using anticoagulation 3 wk before and 4 wk after cardioversion showed comparably low risks of stroke (0.81% with the TEE approach and 0.50% with the conventional approach). For patients with atrial flutter undergoing cardioversion, anticoagulation should be considered with either strategy, and anticoagulation can be beneficial according to the recommendations as for patients with AF.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/ESC atrial fibrillation—newly discovered atrial fibrillation: When AF persists, one option is to accept progression to permanent AF with antithrombotic therapy and control of the ventricular rate, and the diagnosis of AF in a patient with risk factors for thromboembolism should prompt long-term anticoagulation. Although it may seem reasonable to make at least one attempt to restore sinus rhythm, the AFFIRM study showed no difference in survival or quality of life with rate-control compared with rhythm-control strategies, so the decision to attempt restoration of sinus rhythm should be based on the severity of arrhythmia-related symptoms and the potential risk of antiarrhythmic drugs, with anticoagulation and rate control important before cardioversion. In patients with AF present for more than 3 mo, early recurrence is common after cardioversion, and antiarrhythmic medication may be initiated before cardioversion (after adequate anticoagulation) to reduce the likelihood of recurrence, with the duration of drug therapy brief (e.g., 1 mo).

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^9bd193a0]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation—electrical and pharmacological cardioversion overview is described as follows: Cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm is a mode of acute rhythm control and can be achieved electrically or pharmacologically. Electrical cardioversion, given rapidity and efficacy, is the treatment of choice for patients with hemodynamic instability attributable to AF, and cardioversion should also be considered for hemodynamically stable AF intolerant of atrioventricular dyssynchrony, loss of atrial kick, or unable to achieve adequate rate control. In stable AF, both electrical and pharmacological cardioversion are acceptable, safe, and efficacious; electrical cardioversion is more effective than pharmacological cardioversion alone but involves the trade-off of anesthesia or sedation. Thromboembolic risks and considerations for anticoagulation apply to both pharmacological and electrical cardioversion.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation—pharmacological management of recurrent persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation is organized by symptoms and rhythm strategy. Minimal or no symptoms are managed with anticoagulation and rate control as needed, while disabling symptoms in AF proceed from anticoagulation and rate control to electrical cardioversion as needed, followed by continuation of anticoagulation as needed and therapy to maintain sinus rhythm; consider ablation for severely symptomatic recurrent AF after failure of greater than or equal to 1 AAD plus rate control. For permanent AF, anticoagulation and rate control as needed are used. Initiate drug therapy before cardioversion to reduce the likelihood of early recurrence of AF, and AAD indicates antiarrhythmic drug.

### Controversies in atrial fibrillation [^dd73c500]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, and contributes greatly to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Many aspects of the management of atrial fibrillation remain controversial. We address nine specific controversies in atrial fibrillation management, briefly focusing on the relations between mechanisms and therapy, the roles of rhythm and rate control, the definition of optimum rate control, the need for early cardioversion to prevent remodelling, the comparison of electrical with pharmacological cardioversion, the selection of patients for long-term oral anticoagulation, the roles of novel long-term anticoagulation approaches and ablation therapy, and the potential usefulness of upstream therapy targeting substrate development. The background of every controversy is reviewed and our opinions expressed. Here, we hope to inform physicians about the most important controversies in this specialty and stimulate investigators to address unresolved issues.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation—short-term and long-term treatment goals: For patients with symptomatic AF lasting many weeks, initial therapy may be anticoagulation and rate control, while the long-term goal is to restore sinus rhythm. When cardioversion is contemplated and the duration of AF is unknown or exceeds 48 h, patients who do not require long-term anticoagulation may benefit from short-term anticoagulation. Early cardioversion may be necessary if AF causes hypotension or worsening HF, making the establishment of sinus rhythm a combined short- and long-term therapeutic goal. In contrast, amelioration of symptoms by rate control in older patients may steer the clinician away from attempts to restore sinus rhythm. In some circumstances, when the initiating pathophysiology of AF is reversible, as for instance in the setting of thyrotoxicosis or after cardiac surgery, no long-term therapy may be necessary.

### Cardioversion of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (...) [^8fa8f099]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Symptoms of uncontrolled atrial fibrillation include palpitations and poor cardiac performance, with resultant worsening of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and possible sudden death. Patients presenting with new-onset atrial fibrillation are usually admitted to the hospital for evaluation of cardiac pathology and to monitor for complications. Anti-arrhythmic therapy may require extended cardiac monitoring because of proarrhythmic complications. Cardioversion is generally safe if patients present within 48 hours of the start of atrial fibrillation. With a longer duration of symptoms, patients should undergo three weeks of anticoagulation therapy before cardioversion is attempted. Recently, the need for hospitalization in low-risk patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation has been questioned. Michael and associates reviewed the postcardioversion management of low-risk patients who presented with symptoms of atrial fibrillation lasting for less than 48 hours.

During the 18-month study period, 168 low-risk patients made 289 visits to the emergency department. Atrial fibrillation was one of the discharge diagnoses in all of the study subjects. The average age of the participants was 64 years. Seventy-two percent had a previous history of atrial fibrillation. Seventy-five percent of the patients who received medication to control heart rate had a rate reduction to less than 120 beats per minute, with diltiazem providing the highest rate of success and adenosine and digoxin being least helpful. Ninety of 180 attempts at chemical cardioversion were successful. Intravenous procainamide was used in 98 percent of these cases. Ninety-nine percent of the patients who had a successful chemical cardioversion were discharged home from the emergency department. Eighty patients underwent electric cardioversion; in most of these patients, chemical cardioversion had failed. Patients who were successfully converted were discharged home.

Ten percent of patients unexpectedly returned to the emergency department within seven days, although none of the patients had complications associated with cardioversion. The authors conclude that, assuming patients presenting with new-onset atrial fibrillation are at low risk, most patients treated in the emergency department with either heart rate control, chemical cardioversion or electric cardioversion do not require hospitalization. Rates of short-term complications appear to be very low, but long-term complications require further study.

Atrial fibrillation (AF)—antiarrhythmic pretreatment around cardioversion and safety: Antiarrhythmic medications may be initiated out of hospital or in hospital immediately prior to direct-current cardioversion, but risks include paradoxically increasing the defibrillation threshold with flecainide, accelerating the ventricular rate when class IA or IC drugs are given without an atrioventricular (AV) nodal blocking agent, and inducing ventricular arrhythmias. Prophylactic drug therapy to prevent early recurrence of AF should be considered individually for each patient; pretreatment with pharmacological agents is most appropriate in patients who fail to respond to direct-current cardioversion and in those who develop immediate or subacute recurrence of AF. In patients with late recurrence and those undergoing initial cardioversion of persistent AF, pretreatment is optional. Antiarrhythmic drug therapy is recommended in conjunction with a second cardioversion attempt, particularly when early relapse has occurred, whereas additional cardioversion, beyond a second attempt, is of limited value and should be reserved for carefully selected patients; infrequently repeated cardioversions may be acceptable in patients who are highly symptomatic upon relapse to AF.

Atrial fibrillation (AF)—permanent AF is defined as cases in which sinus rhythm cannot be sustained after cardioversion of AF or when the patient and physician have decided to allow AF to continue without further efforts to restore sinus rhythm. For all patients in this category, it is important to maintain control of the ventricular rate and to use antithrombotic therapy.

Electrical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (AF)—key recommendations are as follows: In patients with hemodynamic instability attributable to AF, immediate electrical cardioversion should be performed to restore sinus rhythm. In patients with AF who are hemodynamically stable, electrical cardioversion can be performed as an initial rhythm-control strategy or after unsuccessful pharmacological cardioversion. In patients with AF undergoing electrical cardioversion, energy delivery should be synchronized to the QRS to reduce the risk of inducing ventricular fibrillation (VF). For elective electrical cardioversion in AF, use of biphasic energy of at least 200 J as initial energy can be beneficial to improve success of the initial electrical shock. When AF duration is longer or the initial shock is unsuccessful during elective cardioversion, optimization of electrode vector, use of higher energy, and pretreatment with antiarrhythmic drugs can facilitate success. In patients with obesity and AF, manual pressure augmentation and/or further escalation of electrical energy may be beneficial to improve success of electrical cardioversion.

### Cardioversion of atrial fibrillation: the use of antiarrhythmic drugs [^e84ec181]. Heart (2010). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the commonest atrial arrhythmia and represents a large burden on modern health services. Large multicentre randomised trials have demonstrated that a rhythm control strategy (using antiarrhythmic drugs and direct current (DC) cardioversion) has no morbidity or mortality advantage over rate control. Therefore, for most patients, attempts to cardiovert AF to sinus rhythm (SR) should be reserved for those patients who are symptomatic despite adequate rate control. For recent-onset AF (<24 h) the use of agents like flecainide can be highly successful to pharmacologically cardiovert AF, although caution should be exercised in patients who have the potential for structural or coronary artery disease because of the risk of proarrhythmia. If there any is doubt as to the suitability of a patient for pharmacological cardioversion then DC cardioversion is the safer option. Owing to the high recurrence rate of AF after cardioversion (71-84% at 1 year), the use of antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain SR is recommended. The irreversible side effects of amiodarone mean that it should be avoided whenever possible for long-term maintenance treatment, although it is useful in short courses (8 weeks-6 months), particularly for patients who had a successfully treated secondary cause for AF. Other agents like flecainide and sotalol are also useful but should not be used for patients with structural heart disease. Data supporting the use of newer agents like dronedarone are at present limited.

Atrial fibrillation—management of implanted cardiac devices during cardioversion emphasizes interrogation/reprogramming and external pad positioning to minimize device effects. To ensure appropriate function, the implanted device should be interrogated and, if necessary, reprogrammed before and after cardioversion, and the paddles used for external cardioversion should be positioned as distantly as possible, preferably in the anterior-posterior configuration. The risk of exit block is greater when one paddle is positioned near the impulse generator and the other over the cardiac apex, and lower with the anterior-posterior electrode configuration and with bipolar electrode systems; low-energy internal cardioversion does not interfere with pacemaker function in patients with electrodes positioned in the RA, coronary sinus, or left pulmonary artery.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common outpatient arrhythmia. The recent ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines outline a variety of approaches to the management of AF, but their implementation into clinical practice requires multi-faceted patient evaluations and assessments for optimizing patient care. Using a case-based approach, issues such as rate versus rhythm control, anticoagulation, cardioversion, pharmacological and catheter ablation for maintenance of sinus rhythm, and the pathophysiology of AF are discussed. These data were originally presented at a satellite symposium titled Case Studies with the Experts: Management Decisions in AF, held on May 10, 2007, during the annual Heart Rhythm Society meeting.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) direct-current cardioversion—procedural aspects and energy selection: Cardioversion should be performed with the patient under adequate general anesthesia in a fasting state, and the electric shock should be synchronized with the QRS complex triggered by monitoring the R wave on an electrocardiogram (ECG). The initial energy may be low for atrial flutter but higher energy is required for AF; energy has traditionally been increased in increments of 100 J to a maximum of 400 J, and to avoid myocardial damage some have suggested that the interval between consecutive shocks should be at least 1 min. In 64 patients assigned to initial monophasic energies of 100, 200, or 360 J, immediate success rates were 14%, 39%, and 95%, respectively, leading to the conclusion that an initial energy of 200 J or greater is recommended, with a similar recommendation to start with 200 J for biphasic waveforms. For AF, rectilinear biphasic waveform cardioversion was more effective than monophasic sinusoidal (99.1% vs 92.4%), and the median successful energy level was 100 J with the biphasic waveform compared with 200 J with the monophasic waveform.

Atrial fibrillation—pharmacological enhancement of direct-current cardioversion recommendations are as follows. Class IIa: Pretreatment with amiodarone, flecainide, ibutilide, propafenone, or sotalol can be useful to enhance the success of direct-current cardioversion and prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation. (Level of Evidence: B) In patients who relapse to AF after successful cardioversion, it can be useful to repeat the procedure following prophylactic administration of an antiarrhythmic medication. (Level of Evidence: C) Class IIb: For patients with persistent AF, administration of beta blockers, disopyramide, diltiazem, dofetilide, procainamide, or verapamil may be considered, although the efficacy of these agents to enhance the success of direct-current cardioversion or to prevent early recurrence of AF is uncertain. (Level of Evidence: C) Out-of-hospital initiation of antiarrhythmic medications may be considered in patients without heart disease to enhance the success of cardioversion of AF. (Level of Evidence: C) Out-of-hospital administration of antiarrhythmic medications may be considered to enhance the success of cardioversion of AF in patients with certain forms of heart disease once the safety of the drug has been verified for the patient.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) pericardioversion anticoagulation rationale—early experience and trial data support timing and modality: “This led to an empiric recommendation for 3 weeks of anticoagulation before cardioversion in the prospective, randomized, multicenter ACUTE … study of patients with >2 days’ duration of AF.” “Precardioversion anticoagulation of at least 3 weeks may be accomplished via either therapeutic anticoagulation with VKAs or DOACs,” and “Cardiac computed tomography … has emerged as an alternate imaging modality to exclude intracardiac thrombus.” Justification includes that anticoagulation is continued “for the subsequent 4 weeks after cardioversion,” with risks driven by “elevated thromboembolic risks … high early recurrence of AF, and observation of atrial dysfunction 2–5 days.” Risks are “elevated around the time of cardioversion, especially within the 30 days after cardioversion,” with recovery of atrial systole “over the ensuing 1 month.”

Atrial fibrillation cardioversion (documented duration 48 h or less)—elective cardioversion: we suggest starting anticoagulation at presentation (low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin at full venous thromboembolism treatment doses) and proceeding to cardioversion rather than delaying cardioversion for 3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation or a TEE-guided approach (Grade 2C). After successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm, we recommend therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks rather than no anticoagulation, regardless of baseline stroke risk (Grade 2C), and decisions about long-term anticoagulation after cardioversion should be made in accordance with our risk-based recommendations for long-term antithrombotic therapy in section 2.1.

Cardioversion of atrial fibrillation—recommendations for pharmacological cardioversion state that administration of flecainide, dofetilide, propafenone, or ibutilide is recommended for pharmacological cardioversion of AF (Level of Evidence: A). Administration of amiodarone is a reasonable option for pharmacological cardioversion of AF (Level of Evidence: A). A single oral bolus dose of propafenone or flecainide (pill-in-the-pocket) can be administered to terminate persistent AF outside the hospital once treatment has proved safe in hospital for selected patients without sinus or AV node dysfunction, bundle-branch block, QT-interval prolongation, the Brugada syndrome, or structural heart disease, and before antiarrhythmic medication is initiated, a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist should be given to prevent rapid AV conduction in the event atrial flutter occurs (Level of Evidence: C). Administration of amiodarone can be beneficial on an outpatient basis in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF when rapid restoration of sinus rhythm is not deemed necessary (Level of Evidence: C). Administration of quinidine or procainamide might be considered for pharmacological cardioversion of AF, but the usefulness of these agents is not well established (Level of Evidence: C). Digoxin and sotalol may be harmful when used for pharmacological cardioversion of AF and are not recommended (Level of Evidence: A). Quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, and dofetilide should not be started out of hospital for conversion of AF to sinus rhythm (Level of Evidence: B).

### The 2018 European Heart Rhythm Association practical guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation [^310cf6d5]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The current manuscript is the second update of the original Practical Guide, published in 2013 [Heidbuchel et al. European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of new oral anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2013;15:625-651; Heidbuchel et al. Updated European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2015;17:1467-1507]. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are an alternative for vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and have emerged as the preferred choice, particularly in patients newly started on anticoagulation. Both physicians and patients are becoming more accustomed to the use of these drugs in clinical practice. However, many unresolved questions on how to optimally use these agents in specific clinical situations remain. The European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) set out to coordinate a unified way of informing physicians on the use of the different NOACs. A writing group identified 20 topics of concrete clinical scenarios for which practical answers were formulated, based on available evidence. The 20 topics are as follows i.e., (1) Eligibility for NOACs; (2) Practical start-up and follow-up scheme for patients on NOACs; (3) Ensuring adherence to prescribed oral anticoagulant intake; (4) Switching between anticoagulant regimens; (5) Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions of NOACs; (6) NOACs in patients with chronic kidney or advanced liver disease; (7) How to measure the anticoagulant effect of NOACs; (8) NOAC plasma level measurement: rare indications, precautions, and potential pitfalls; (9) How to deal with dosing errors; (10) What to do if there is a (suspected) overdose without bleeding, or a clotting test is indicating a potential risk of bleeding; (11) Management of bleeding under NOAC therapy; (12) Patients undergoing a planned invasive procedure, surgery or ablation; (13) Patients requiring an urgent surgical intervention; (14) Patients with AF and coronary artery disease; (15) Avoiding confusion with NOAC dosing across indications; (16) Cardioversion in a NOAC-treated patient; (17) AF patients presenting with acute stroke while on NOACs; (18) NOACs in special situations; (19) Anticoagulation in AF patients with a malignancy; and (20) Optimizing dose adjustments of VKA.

### Cardioversion for atrial fibrillation | NEJM resident 360 (...) [^4b437af6]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Literature From Pages to Practice Published January 5, 2022 As a cardiology fellow, I receive consultation requests for management of atrial fibrillation on a daily basis from both inpatient and outpatient settings. AF accounts for 0. 5% of U. S. emergency department visits, and our ED colleagues commonly ask whether a patient should undergo cardioversion, admission, or both. Patients may present with acute symptoms of shortness of breath, palpitations, and exertional fatigue or even with congestive heart failure. Others may be asymptomatic and have had AF detected incidentally in the outpatient office. For symptomatic patients, restoration of sinus rhythm via cardioversion can quickly resolve symptoms, but cardioversion is by no means a benign process. At my institution in the U. S. , electrical cardioversion is generally the preferred method, and the requirement for sedation comes with its own cost and risk.

Alternatively, pharmacologic cardioversion still requires the expertise and availability of a cardiologist and the resources for monitoring afterwards. We know that regardless of cardioversion methods, the procedure can trigger thromboembolic complications in the absence of anticoagulation, even if duration of AF is short. Although cardioversion may be an effective solution for acute-onset AF, it only addresses one moment in the management of what is often a chronic condition. Many patients develop self-limited episodic AF before progressing to recurrent and more–persistent disease. For a first episode, rates of spontaneous conversion of AF to sinus rhythm are quite high. Given the costs and risks of cardioversion and uncertain long-term benefits, investigators of the RACE 7 ACWAS trial examined whether delaying cardioversion in the acute management of symptomatic AF is as effective and safe as immediate cardioversion in the ED.

They compared a wait-and-see approach with an immediate cardioversion approach on presentation to the ED. The wait-and-see approach was found to be noninferior to immediate cardioversion for the primary outcome of sinus rhythm 4 weeks later. Further observations from the trial confirmed that recent-onset AF is indeed paroxysmal: 69% of patients in the delayed-cardioversion group had spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm within 48 hours and 29% of patients in the early-cardioversion group had recurrent AF within 4 weeks of the index visit. Overall, both approaches were safe with timely administration of anticoagulation to high-risk patients. The following NEJM Journal Watch summary provides more details of the trial and findings.

For achieving sinus rhythm within 4 weeks and avoiding cardiovascular complications, immediate cardioversion in the emergency department was no better than cardioversion at 48 hours. Atrial fibrillation is a common presentation in the emergency department, but it's not always clear whether a patient with new-onset AF should undergo cardioversion immediately or be allowed some time for spontaneous conversion. Patients with marked AF symptoms certainly have no luxury to wait, but what about patients whose symptoms are less dramatic. At two EDs in the Netherlands, investigators randomized 437 adults with hemodynamically stable, symptomatic AF of recent onset to undergo cardioversion either early or after a delay. The primary analysis included 427 patients. About 40% were taking an anticoagulant at enrollment; another 29% started anticoagulation during the index visit.

### Acute management of atrial fibrillation: part I. rate and rhythm control [^f20a4056]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the arrhythmia most commonly encountered in family practice. Serious complications can include congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and thromboembolism. Initial treatment is directed at controlling the ventricular rate, most often with a calcium channel blocker, a beta blocker, or digoxin. Medical or electrical cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm is the next step in patients who remain in atrial fibrillation. Heparin should be administered to hospitalized patients undergoing medical or electrical cardioversion. Anticoagulation with warfarin should be used for three weeks before elective cardioversion and continued for four weeks after cardioversion. The recommendations provided in this two-part article are consistent with guidelines published by the American Heart Association and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

### Management of newly detected atrial fibrillation: a clinical practice guideline from the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians [^d7feb4c2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The Joint Panel of the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians, in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Evidence-based Practice Center, systematically reviewed the available evidence on the management of newly detected atrial fibrillation and developed recommendations for adult patients with first-detected atrial fibrillation. The recommendations do not apply to patients with postoperative or post-myocardial infarction atrial fibrillation, patients with class IV heart failure, patients already taking antiarrhythmic drugs, or patients with valvular disease. The target physician audience is internists and family physicians dedicated to primary care. The recommendations are as follows: RECOMMENDATION 1: Rate control with chronic anticoagulation is the recommended strategy for the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation. Rhythm control has not been shown to be superior to rate control (with chronic anticoagulation) in reducing morbidity and mortality and may be inferior in some patient subgroups to rate control. Rhythm control is appropriate when based on other special considerations, such as patient symptoms, exercise tolerance, and patient preference. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 2: Patients with atrial fibrillation should receive chronic anticoagulation with adjusted-dose warfarin, unless they are at low risk of stroke or have a specific contraindication to the use of warfarin (thrombocytopenia, recent trauma or surgery, alcoholism). Grade: 1A. RECOMMENDATION 3: For patients with atrial fibrillation, the following drugs are recommended for their demonstrated efficacy in rate control during exercise and while at rest: atenolol, metoprolol, diltiazem, and verapamil (drugs listed alphabetically by class). Digoxin is only effective for rate control at rest and therefore should only be used as a second-line agent for rate control in atrial fibrillation. Grade: 1B. RECOMMENDATION 4: For those patients who elect to undergo acute cardioversion to achieve sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation, both direct-current cardioversion (Grade: 1C+) and pharmacological conversion (Grade: 2A) are appropriate options. RECOMMENDATION 5: Both transesophageal echocardiography with short-term prior anticoagulation followed by early acute cardioversion (in the absence of intracardiac thrombus) with postcardioversion anticoagulation versus delayed cardioversion with pre- and postanticoagulation are appropriate management strategies for those patients who elect to undergo cardioversion. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 6: Most patients converted to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation should not be placed on rhythm maintenance therapy since the risks outweigh the benefits. In a selected group of patients whose quality of life is compromised by atrial fibrillation, the recommended pharmacologic agents for rhythm maintenance are amiodarone, disopyramide, propafenone, and sotalol (drugs listed in alphabetical order). The choice of agent predominantly depends on specific risk of side effects based on patient characteristics. Grade: 2A.

Internal atrial defibrillators—A transvenous atrial cardioverter delivering a 3/3-ms biphasic waveform shock required relatively high energy in persistent atrial fibrillation (mean 3.5 J). An implantable device with atrial sensing/cardioversion and ventricular sensing/pacing was evaluated in 290 patients with mean left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 50% who had not responded to 4 antiarrhythmic drugs; across 614 AF episodes treated with 1497 shocks (mean 2.4 shocks per episode), conversion to sinus rhythm was 93%. These units accurately record AF and provide valuable measurement of AF control, but patient tolerability limits routine use because most patients find discharge energies over 1 J uncomfortable and the mean cardioversion threshold is approximately 3 J, making such devices unacceptable for routine clinical use.

### Management of atrial fibrillation in the emergency department [^3758743c]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Although atrial fibrillation remains the most common cardiac arrhythmia, the treatment and disposition remain varied. An accept-able standard of practice requires an evidence-based approach. This approach has revealed that half of the patients who present with acute atrial fibrillation will convert to sinus rhythm without intervention. In the hemodynamically stable subset, ascertaining the on-set of atrial fibrillation within 48 hours is critical because this period dictates when and if anticoagulation should be instituted and if and where electrical or chemical cardioversion needs be performed. The hemodynamically unstable patient, however, requires emergent cardioversion, irrespective of the chronicity of atrial fibrillation. An evidence-based approach may serve to optimize treatment and obviate the need for unnecessary hospital admissions.

### What characterizes episodes of atrial fibrillation requiring cardioversion? Experience from patients with an implantable atrial cardioverter [^92536773]. American Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation may cause disabling symptoms. Asymptomatic episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation are, however, more common than symptomatic episodes. The aim of the study was to investigate whether episodes of atrial fibrillation for which the patient requires cardioversion differ from those in which the patient does not seek this therapy.

Methods

We studied 21 patients with atrial fibrillation treated with an implanted atrial cardioverter. The device displayed intracardiac electrograms from episodes of atrial fibrillation in which the patient received cardioversion and from episodes that did not lead to a hospital visit or cardioversion. The heart rate (mean, highest, and lowest) and the degree of ventricular interval irregularity were analyzed with these electrograms.

Results

There were 132 episodes of atrial fibrillation available for analysis, of which 73 led to cardioversion and 58 did not. Episodes leading to hospital/clinic visits and therapy had a higher maximum ventricular rate (130 vs 115/min, P =.0004) than episodes that did not cause the patients to seek therapy. This difference in heart rate was most prominent at the beginning of the episode, but tended to become more similar during the episode. There were no differences in ventricular cycle length irregularity between the 2 types of episodes. Moreover, treated episodes also had a significantly longer duration (mean duration 33 vs 9 hours, P =.002).

Conclusions

Episodes of atrial fibrillation that cause the patient to seek cardioversion are characterized by a high initial ventricular rate and a longer duration than those that go untreated.

### Management of atrial fibrillation: guidelines from the American (...) [^366f4807]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS FOR PRACTICE • Percutaneous occlusion of the left atrial appendage reduces stroke risk and mortality with similar effectiveness as warfarin. • Surgical exclusion of the left atrial appendage during cardiac surgery reduces stroke risk with continued anticoagulation. • Electrical cardioversion is more effective for acute rhythm control than medications. • Catheter ablation reduces symptoms of AF, but it recurs in up to 40% of patients. From the AFP Editors Atrial fibrillation is expected to impact 12 million people by 2030 and increase mortality risk by at least 1. 5 times. It is a chaotic, irregular atrial rhythm caused by ectopic sources in the pulmonary veins of the left atrium or in response to reentrant cardiac conduction activity from interstitial fibrosis. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association released guidelines for managing patients with AF.

EVALUATION Clinical evaluation of newly diagnosed AF should include transthoracic echocardiography. Testing for cardiac ischemia and pulmonary embolism is recommended only if suggested by clinical presentation. SubscribeFrom $180

### Time to cardioversion for acute atrial fibrillation and thromboembolic complications (...) [^510d5285]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Nuotio I, Hartikainen JEK, Grönberg T, Biancari F, Airaksinen KEJ. Time to Cardioversion for Acute Atrial Fibrillation and Thromboembolic Complications. JAMA. 2014; 312: 647–649. doi:
10. 1001/jama.
2014. 3824. In 1995, practice guidelines recommended a limit of 48 hours after the onset of atrial fibrillation for cardioversion without anticoagulation. 1-3 Whether the risk of thromboembolic complications is increased when cardioversion without anticoagulation is performed in less than 48 hours is unknown. In the retrospective Finnish CardioVersion study, 4 all patients with a primary diagnosis of AF, aged 18 years or older, with successful cardioversion in the emergency department within the first 48 hours of AF, and residence in the catchment areas of Turku and Kuopio university hospitals from 2003 to 2010 and Pori central hospital during 2010 were included.

Clinical details and the occurrence of thromboembolic complications within 30 days after cardioversion were retrospectively collected from medical reports. The primary outcome, a thromboembolic event, was defined as a clinical stroke or systemic embolism confirmed by computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, surgery, or autopsy. Time to cardioversion was determined as the difference between the beginning of arrhythmic symptoms to the exact time of cardioversion. If the duration of arrhythmia was uncertain, the cardioversion was excluded. Procedures were divided into groups according to the time to cardioversion: less than 12 hours, 12 hours to less than 24 hours, and 24 hours to less than 48 hours. The protocol was approved by the ethics committees of the Hospital District of Southwest Finland and the National Institute for Health and Welfare, with a waiver of informed consent.

Bivariable comparisons between groups were performed with the χ2 test, the Fisher exact test, or the Wilcoxon nonparametric test. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with a repeated-measures model was conducted to evaluate risk factors for thromboembolic complications, including comparisons between groups 2 and 1 and between groups 3 and 1. Clinical features with independent predictive value for thromboembolic complications were used as covariates in the multivariate analysis based on our previous work. 4 Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.
3. Two-sided differences at P <. 05 were considered significant. Of 2481 patients with acute AF, 5116 successful cardioversions were performed without anticoagulation. The mean age was 61. 0 years, 1638 were female, and 2434 had more than 1 risk factor for stroke. Thirty-eight thromboembolic events occurred in 38 patients; 31 were strokes. The incidence of thromboembolic complications increased from 0. 3% in group 1 to
1. 1% in group 3. The incidence of thromboembolic complications according to the time to cardioversion in subgroups is presented in Table
1. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, time to cardioversion longer than 12 hours was an independent predictor for thromboembolic complications. Stroke is the most serious complication of AF. After the recommended 3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation, the stroke risk in elective cardioversion of AF ranges from 0. 3% to
0. 8%. 1 In our study, the risk of thromboembolic complications was 0. 7% when cardioversion was performed without anticoagulation within 48 hours of AF onset.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology of thrombus formation in atrial fibrillation centers on the left atrial appendage (LAA) and cardioversion-related stunning. Thrombotic material associated with AF arises most frequently in the LAA, and Doppler transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a more sensitive and specific method to assess LAA function and to detect thrombus formation. Although clinical management presumes continuation of AF for approximately 48 h for thrombus formation, thrombi have been identified by TEE within shorter intervals. Atrial stunning is at a maximum immediately after cardioversion with improvement within a few days but sometimes as long as 3 to 4 wk; following cardioversion, more than 80% of thromboembolic events occur during the first 3 d and almost all occur within 10 d. Accordingly, anticoagulation is recommended during cardioversion in all patients with AF lasting longer than 48 h or of unknown duration, including lone AF except when anticoagulation is contraindicated.

A simplified approach to rhythm control therapy in patients with symptomatic AF

There are no major changes to the recommendations for rate control therapy. Rhythm control therapy continues to be indicated to improve AF-related symptoms, usually on top of management of concomitant conditions, stroke prevention therapy and rate control therapy. The indications for antiarrhythmic drug therapy have not changed. The new guidelines provide more detailed information about the ECG changes that are warning signs for proarrhythmia. Catheter ablation targeting isolation of the pulmonary veinsis a valid rhythm control therapy option and should be discussed with patients in need for rhythm control therapy. When AF recurs and further rhythm control therapy is warranted, ‘hybrid therapy’ (eg, combining antiarrhythmic drugs with catheter ablation) will often help: in patients who need further rhythm control therapy despite antiarrhythmic drug therapy, catheter ablation is often effective. Patients who need a third attempt to rhythm control therapy should be discussed with an AF Heart Team including consideration of AF surgery.

The new guidelines suggest a very similar approach to rhythm control in patients with paroxysmal (self-terminating) and persistent AF: the flow charts are not different by AF pattern. This simplification is supported by two observations: the time in sinus rhythm as assessed by an implanted device is not that different between patients who are clinically classified as ‘paroxysmal’ or ‘persistent’ AF.Furthermore, the available controlled trials suggest that catheter ablation is more effective than antiarrhythmic drugs and cardioversion in patients with persistent AF,similar to paroxysmal AF.

Cardioversion of atrial fibrillation (AF) of short duration—risk stratification within <48 hours: The safety of cardioversion without further assessment of or periprocedural anticoagulation in patients with AF duration of <48 hours has been challenged, with concerns that emerging data demonstrate that thromboembolic risks in patients with <48 hours of AF were not homogeneously low. Time to cardioversion >12 hours has been reported as an independent predictor for thromboembolic complications. In a single-center observational study of AF cardioversion with <48 hours duration, no thromboembolic events were observed in patients with CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0 or 1 or in patients with postoperative AF, but differential thromboembolic rates were noted in CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥2. Larger studies similarly demonstrated that among patients with <48 hours of AF, postcardioversion thromboembolic risks increased with increasing CHA2DS2-VASc.

### Is early cardioversion for atrial fibrillation safe in patients with spontaneous echocardiographic contrast? [^a2bc7ccc]. Clinical Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

The 2006 American Heart Association guidelines for management of patients with atrial fibrillation state "For patients with no identifiable thrombus in the left atrium (LA) or left atrial appendage (LAA), cardioversion (CV) is reasonable immediately after anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin. Thereafter, continuation of oral anticoagulation is reasonable for an anticoagulation period of at least 4 weeks". For patients with thrombus identified by transesophageal echocardiography, guidelines recommend therapeutic oral anticoagulation for 3 weeks prior to and 4 weeks after elective cardioversion. Patients with spontaneous echo contrast (SEC) identified by TEE have a high risk of thromboembolic events,1-8 however, the guidelines do not address whether patients with SEC without thrombus can be safely cardioverted. This paper reviews the literature describing the pathogenesis of SEC, how it is detected, and whether elective cardioversion is safe. On the basis of our review, we believe that the risk of cardioembolic stroke after cardioversion of a patient with SEC is low, regardless of anticoagulation. The safe conclusion is that patients with SEC on TEE should receive therapeutic anticoagulation prior to cardioversion if possible and early cardioversion is not contraindicated.

### Cardioversion and subsequent quality of life and natural history of atrial fibrillation [^f18011f1]. American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Cardioversion is a class I procedure for patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) pursuing rhythm control. There are few contemporary reports on quality of life and outcomes after cardioversion.

Methods

Using the nationwide prospective ORBIT-AF registry, cardioversion patients were propensity matched 3:1 to noncardioverted patients and Cox proportional hazards modeling evaluated hospitalization at 1 year in those with and without cardioversion. Cardiovascular outcomes, AF progression, and quality of life were evaluated for the matched cohorts with and without cardioversion.

Results

Among 9,642 patients, 817 patients (8%) underwent 906 cardioversions during a median follow-up of 12 (interquartile range 6-18) months. Among matched cardioverted and noncardioverted patients, 1-year cardiovascular hospitalization rates were 43% vs 21% (adjusted hazard ratio 2.2, 95% CI 1.8-2.8, P<.001), and sinus rhythm at both first and second follow-ups was 36% vs 27% (P=.042), respectively. Findings were similar among first-time cardioversion patients. Matched cardioversion patients did not exhibit greater symptom improvement (34% vs 42%) or less symptomatic progression (15% vs 4%) by European Heart Rhythm Association scores. Cardioversion was associated with AF progression with an odds ratio of 1.6 (95% CI 1.2-2.2, P=.001) after cardioversion and 2.7 (P<.001) after first cardioversion vs matched noncardioversion patients. After cardioversion, only 18% of patients not previously on an antiarrhythmic started one, less than 5% underwent ablation, and 22% stopped their antiarrhythmic.

Conclusions

Cardioversion was not associated with improved AF-related quality of life or less progression. Many patients who undergo cardioversion do not receive adjunctive rhythm control therapies. These findings may help to better inform therapeutic decision making.

### Investigating the efficacy of chest pressure for direct current cardioversion in atrial fibrillation: a randomised control trial protocol (pressure-AF) [^b8625d03]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common persistent arrythmia worldwide and a significant contributor to poor quality of life.Currently, there are an estimated 37 million individuals with AF globally. Projections to the year 2050 indicate a 60% absolute increase in AF prevalence.Given the huge burden of disease, measures to prevent and optimally treat AF are of great importance. Recently, there has been renewed interest in the benefit of rhythm control in those with AF.Direct current cardioversion is an elective procedure commonly used to terminate arrhythmias and plays an important role in rhythm control for AF.

Rhythm control for AF

Initial trials comparing rate and rhythm control for AF showed no difference in outcomes, and perhaps increased hospitalisations with rhythm control.Despite this, recent trials have shown benefit to rhythm control in select populations. In those with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and persistent ventricular dysfunction despite medical therapy, mortality reduction is seen with catheter ablation.Moreover, in younger patients with early AF, there may be small improvements in cardiovascular endpoints with rhythm control.Clearly, a tailored approach to AF management is needed. Therapeutic strategies are dependent on patient preference, symptoms, the presence of structural heart disease and risks associated with interventions.

In those whom rhythm control is felt to be appropriate, electrical cardioversion offers a promising means of restoring sinus rhythm. The limitation of electrical cardioversion is that initial restoration of sinus rhythm does not ensure maintenance of sinus rhythm. Patients generally also require longer term antiarrhythmic therapy and lifestyle modification. Early success of cardioversion for AF was low, around 75%.Over the past decades, numerous techniques have been implemented to improve restoration of sinus rhythm. With these methods, sinus rhythm is achieved in over 90% of cases.

### Part 9: adult advanced life support: 2025 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^6fc410d1]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation/flutter cardioversion—indications and anticoagulation: Unstable patients or those with ongoing cardiac ischemia caused or exacerbated by atrial fibrillation/flutter require prompt cardioversion. Clinicians should consider whether the arrhythmia is causative or secondary to rapid ventricular response to guide initial pharmacologic stabilization; the hemodynamic benefits of successful cardioversion have been documented and risk of hypotension and hypoperfusion with negative inotropes has been demonstrated even in normotensive patients. Depending on the clinical scenario, patients cardioverted from atrial fibrillation/flutter of greater than 48 hours' duration are candidates for anticoagulation, and hemodynamically unstable patients and those with ongoing cardiac ischemia are likely to benefit from immediate restoration of sinus rhythm and avoidance of hypotension caused by pharmacological therapies.

### Apixaban compared to heparin / vitamin K antagonist in patients with atrial fibrillation scheduled for cardioversion: the EMANATE trial [^217f1f3e]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Managing patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation (AF) involves controlling rate, finding reversible causes, preventing stroke, and often restoring sinus rhythm by electrical or pharmacological cardioversion. The risk of periprocedural thromboembolism in patients undergoing cardioversion may exceed 5% when anticoagulation is inadequate. Anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for at least 3 weeks prior to cardioversion, during the procedure, and for a minimum of 4 weeks afterwards to allow restoration of atrial mechanical function reduces the risk to less than 1%.In post hoc analyses of cardioversions in the trials that led to regulatory approval of the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, event rates were low.A limitation of translating these data to clinical practice was the prolonged period of anticoagulation preceding cardioversion.

To accelerate cardioversion in clinical practice, a strategy of imaging by computerized tomography (CT) or transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) may be used to exclude left atrial thrombus. Randomized open-label trials comparing rivaroxaban and edoxaban to heparin/VKA in patients undergoing elective cardioversion found stroke and major bleeding rates at or below 1% in patients randomized to the factor Xa inhibitors. Apixaban, an orally active, reversible, direct inhibitor of factor Xa, reduced stroke and systemic embolism (SE), major bleeding, and death in patients with AF compared to warfarin in a large randomized double-blind trial, but has not been evaluated prospectively in patients undergoing cardioversion.

Pharmacological cardioversion for atrial fibrillation—recommendations and agents—is outlined as follows: For patients with AF, pharmacological cardioversion is reasonable as an alternative to electrical cardioversion for those who are hemodynamically stable or in situations when electrical cardioversion is preferred but cannot be performed (COR 2a, LOE C‑LD). For patients with AF, ibutilide is reasonable for pharmacological cardioversion for patients without depressed LV function (LVEF <40%) (COR 2a, LOE A). For patients with AF, intravenous amiodarone is reasonable for pharmacological cardioversion, although time to conversion is generally longer than with other agents (8-12 hours) (COR 2a, LOE A). For patients with recurrent AF occurring outside the hospital, the “pill‑in‑the‑pocket” approach with a single oral dose of flecainide† or propafenone,‡ with a concomitant atrioventricular nodal blocking agent,† is reasonable for pharmacological cardioversion if previously tested in a monitored setting (COR 2a, LOE A). For patients with AF, use of intravenous procainamide may be considered for pharmacological cardioversion when other intravenous agents are contraindicated or not preferred (COR 2b, LOE B‑R). Ibutilide works rapidly for pharmacological cardioversion of AF but is associated with QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes, particularly in patients with HFrEF.

Atrial fibrillation and flutter—rhythm control emphasizes that severely haemodynamically compromised atrial fibrillation (AF) patients “should undergo emergency external electrical cardioversion,” whereas in haemodynamically stable AF patients elective cardioversion is performed to improve symptoms with the mode “based on the clinical setting.” Electrical cardioversion is described as having a “greater immediate success rate … and shorter hospitalization,” while pharmacological cardioversion may avoid general anaesthesia/deep sedation and “may prevent early AF recurrence.” Observational data report pharmacological cardioversion use “in >50% of patients” with paroxysmal (52.1%) or persistent AF (65.2%). Controlled trials show spontaneous restoration of sinus rhythm (SR) within 48 h in 76–83% of recent-onset AF cases (10–18% within 3 h; 55–66% within 24 h). Reported pharmacological cardioversion success rates “range from 10% to 80%, depending on AF duration.”

### Cardioversion in patients with newly diagnosed non-valvular atrial fibrillation: observational study using prospectively collected registry data [^cbdf68fc]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

After anticoagulation treatment for stroke prevention has been prescribed to appropriate patients (those with increased risk of stroke), there are two main treatment approaches for atrial fibrillation. One approach is to try and restore sinus rhythm, which can be achieved by direct current or pharmacological cardioversion. Rhythm control can potentially relieve symptoms and prevent progression of atrial fibrillationand left atrial remodelling.The other treatment option is to allow atrial fibrillation to continue but to control the ventricular rate (rate control). Several randomised controlled trials have shown that this treatment strategy is non-inferior to rhythm control when considering endpoints such as stroke rates and mortality.Previous studies also indicate that rates of hospital admission for rate control are lower than those for rhythm control.Guidelines in Europe and America support both strategies but stress the need for better knowledge about their efficacy and safety.However, the recently reported Early Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation for Stroke Prevention Trial (EAST-AFNET 4)showed that early rhythm control was superior to guideline mandated management, which consisted largely of rate control until or unless symptoms became refractory.

The Global Anticoagulant Registry in the FIELD-AF (GARFIELD-AF) is a worldwide prospective study of adult patients with newly diagnosed non-valvular atrial fibrillation.The registry includes information on baseline patient characteristics, rate of interventions such as cardioversions, and clinical outcomes. Only patients with first time onset of atrial fibrillation within six weeks were included, and so a high proportion might be eligible for an early rhythm control strategy. These data assess the use of cardioversion in daily clinical practice and might provide important information for clinicians treating patients with recent onset non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

In the current study, we aimed to investigate the characteristics of patients who received cardioversion treatment at baseline versus those who did not, and to assess types of cardioversion performed. We also describe the associations between cardioversion and clinical outcomes in a large dataset of patients presenting with recent onset non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

Atrial fibrillation—risks and precautions of direct-current cardioversion are primarily thromboembolism and arrhythmias, with thromboembolic events reported in 1% to 7% of patients not given prophylactic anticoagulation before cardioversion. Various benign arrhythmias may occur and subside spontaneously, but more dangerous arrhythmias can arise with hypokalemia, digitalis intoxication, or improper synchronization; serum potassium should be in the normal range. Magnesium supplementation does not enhance cardioversion. Cardioversion is contraindicated in digitalis toxicity; it is not routinely necessary to interrupt digoxin before elective cardioversion of AF, but clinicians should exclude signs of digitalis excess and delay cardioversion until corrected, which usually requires withdrawal of digoxin for longer than 24 h. In long-standing AF, cardioversion can unmask sinus node dysfunction; a slow ventricular response without AV nodal–slowing drugs may indicate intrinsic conduction disease, and a transvenous or transcutaneous pacemaker can be used prophylactically.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to rhythm control, electrical cardioversion, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider using manual pressure augmentation and/or further escalation of electrical energy to improve the success of electrical cardioversion in patients with AF and obesity.

### Early risk of stroke in patients undergoing acute versus elective cardioversion for atrial fibrillation [^6e586662]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia. Many patients with AF experience disabling symptoms and AF is associated with significant health care consumption including frequent emergency department (ED) visits.Rhythm control therapies like antiarrhythmic drugs and catheter ablation are associated with substantial recurrence rates and not suitable in all patients.Therefore, cardioversion remains an essential tool to restore sinus rhythm in routine AF management.

Electrical cardioversion (ECV) is known to be more effective than medical cardioversion for symptomatic AF. Irrespective of the mode, cardioversion is complicated by thromboembolic complications.Thromboembolic risk can be reduced by adequate anticoagulation treatmentor transesophageal ultrasound guided exclusion of left atrial thrombus transesophageal echocardiogram before conversion and by continued anticoagulation 4 weeks afterwards.Non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have replaced warfarin to a large extent in clinical practice.NOACs have a rapid onset of anticoagulation effect, fewer drug and food interactionsand facilitate shorter waiting times to cardioversion than warfarin.

In some situations, an emergency cardioversion must be performed in patients with AF who are hemodynamically unstable regardless of prior oral anticoagulant (OAC) treatment. However, in the past decade there has been a shift in the European guidelines on acute ECV for hemodynamically stable AF. In 2010, acute ECV for rhythm control was indicated without prior OAC even in the presence of risk factors for stroke if the onset was <48 hours or after a transesophageal echocardiography without a sign of thrombus in the patient with an onset of ≥48 hours.According to the more cautious current European Society of Cardiology guidelines, acute ECV can be considered in patients without prior OAC treatment in AF if the onset was <12 hours and the patient has no history of thromboembolism or within 48 hours if the patient has a low risk for stroke according to CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc (≤1 for men and ≤2 for women).

Interestingly, the risk of thromboembolic complications associated with acute versus elective conversion of AF has not been studied in greater detail and current data to inform decisions on acute or elective cardioversion from the NOAC era is lacking. We sought to investigate the incidence of ischemic or unspecified stroke and to compare the risk of stroke during the first 30 days in patients who underwent acute ECV compared with elective ECV.

Post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF)—cardioversion and anticoagulation consensus statements: for stable patients with POAF of 48-h duration or longer, anticoagulation is recommended for at least 3 weeks prior to and 4 weeks after cardioversion; transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) guided cardioversion may be considered as an alternative to 3 weeks preprocedural anticoagulation and such an approach has to be followed by 4 weeks of anticoagulation or anticoagulation at long-term in patients with conventional indications; for any patient with POAF, the indication for long-term anticoagulation has to follow the same approach as that in patients presenting with AF outside of a post-surgical context; during the first 48 h after the onset of POAF, anticoagulation before and after cardioversion has to take into consideration the patient’s risk of thromboembolism (CHA2DS2-VASc score), the need for long-term anticoagulation, and the risk of post-operative bleeding; and when initiating anticoagulation, attention to modifiable bleeding risk factors should be prioritized with use of the HAS-BLED score to identify those at high bleeding risk for more regular review and follow-up.

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in atrial fibrillation—diagnostic role and cardioversion guidance—indicates that TEE is a sensitive and specific technique for detection of left atrial (LA) and left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombus, permits superior evaluation for other causes of cardiogenic embolism and measurement of LA function, and identifies features associated with thromboembolism, including thrombus, reduced flow velocity, spontaneous echocardiographic contrast (SEC) in the LA or LAA, and atheromatous disease of the aorta. Detection of LA/LAA thrombus stands as a contraindication to elective cardioversion of AF, the absence of a detectable thrombus does not preclude stroke after cardioversion in the absence of anticoagulation therapy, and a TEE‑guided strategy for elective cardioversion yielded comparable thromboembolism and death outcomes to conventional anticoagulation for 3 w before and 4 w after cardioversion.

Atrial flutter—appendage flow and anticoagulation around cardioversion mirror atrial fibrillation patterns. LAA flow velocities are lower in patients with atrial flutter than are usually seen during sinus rhythm but higher than in AF. As in AF, atrial flutter is associated with low appendage emptying velocities following cardioversion with the potential for thromboembolism, and anticoagulation is similarly recommended.

### Early or delayed cardioversion in recent-onset atrial fibrillation [^262c9464]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation commonly undergo immediate restoration of sinus rhythm by pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion. However, whether immediate restoration of sinus rhythm is necessary is not known, since atrial fibrillation often terminates spontaneously.

Methods

In a multicenter, randomized, open-label, noninferiority trial, we randomly assigned patients with hemodynamically stable, recent-onset (<36 hours), symptomatic atrial fibrillation in the emergency department to be treated with a wait-and-see approach (delayed-cardioversion group) or early cardioversion. The wait-and-see approach involved initial treatment with rate-control medication only and delayed cardioversion if the atrial fibrillation did not resolve within 48 hours. The primary end point was the presence of sinus rhythm at 4 weeks. Noninferiority would be shown if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the between-group difference in the primary end point in percentage points was more than -10.

Results

The presence of sinus rhythm at 4 weeks occurred in 193 of 212 patients (91%) in the delayed-cardioversion group and in 202 of 215 (94%) in the early-cardioversion group (between-group difference, -2.9 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -8.2 to 2.2; P=0.005 for noninferiority). In the delayed-cardioversion group, conversion to sinus rhythm within 48 hours occurred spontaneously in 150 of 218 patients (69%) and after delayed cardioversion in 61 patients (28%). In the early-cardioversion group, conversion to sinus rhythm occurred spontaneously before the initiation of cardioversion in 36 of 219 patients (16%) and after cardioversion in 171 patients (78%). Among the patients who completed remote monitoring during 4 weeks of follow-up, a recurrence of atrial fibrillation occurred in 49 of 164 patients (30%) in the delayed-cardioversion group and in 50 of 171 (29%) in the early-cardioversion group. Within 4 weeks after randomization, cardiovascular complications occurred in 10 patients and 8 patients, respectively.

Conclusions

In patients presenting to the emergency department with recent-onset, symptomatic atrial fibrillation, a wait-and-see approach was noninferior to early cardioversion in achieving a return to sinus rhythm at 4 weeks.

### Pharmacologic cardioversion for atrial fibrillation and flutter (...) [^c1477c0d]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical Scenario A 70-year-old man comes to the clinic for routine follow-up of hypertension and is found to have new atrial fibrillation of unknown duration. Clinical Question Should antiarrhythmic medications be used to restore sinus rhythm for patients with atrial fibrillation. Evidence-Based Answer There is no evidence that rhythm control in older patients with atrial fibrillation is more effective than rate control for improving patient-oriented outcomes.
1. Practice Pointers Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of mortality and stroke. Furthermore, diminished atrial filling of the ventricles and irregular ventricular contraction can reduce cardiac output, leading to palpitations, dyspnea, and dizziness.

Whereas rate-control strategies for managing atrial fibrillation advocate medically slowing ventricular response to the fibrillating atrium and using anticoagulation to reduce stroke risk, rhythm-control strategies involve medical or electrical conversion to sinus rhythm to improve hemodynamics and symptoms and, theoretically, reduce stroke risk. The two studies 2, 3 evaluated in this Cochrane review 1 showed that in patients older than 60 years, use of a number of different medications for pharmacologic cardioversion of atrial fibrillation—including amiodarone, quinidine, sotalol, disopyramide, and flecainide —did not improve mortality rates or stroke rates compared with rate control using calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, or digoxin, alone or in combination.

Moreover, 50 percent of strokes in patients receiving antiarrhythmics occurred while they were in sinus rhythm, and long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm was achieved in only 56 to 62 percent of patients. Thus, cardioversion of a fibrillating atrium to reduce stroke risk and eliminate the need for warfarin therapy does not seem to be a reliable solution; long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm is difficult, and those who have successful cardioversion appear to need long-term anticoagulation. Although concern has been raised that the use of antiarrhythmic medications for atrial fibrillation will increase the risk of malignant dysrhythmias, these were uncommon with rate-control and rhythm-control strategies in the two studies. 2, 3 reviewed.

Results of one of the studies 2 suggested there may be an increased mortality risk with rhythm control in patients without heart failure, but the numbers of patients with heart failure were low, and definitive data on management of atrial fibrillation in the setting of heart failure are lacking. The same study 2 also showed that older patients and those with coronary artery disease may be at higher risk of death with rhythm control compared with rate control. This review 1 provides further evidence in support of recent guidelines on the management of atrial fibrillation. The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association note that there is a paucity of evidence indicating restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm is more beneficial than rate control, and that the data available suggest no definite advantage of one approach over the other.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to anticoagulant therapy, pericardioversion, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to administer therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 3-6 weeks, followed by repeat imaging before cardioversion in patients with AF if cardioversion is deferred due to LAA thrombus detected on pre-cardioversion imaging.

### Cardioversion in patients with newly diagnosed non-valvular atrial fibrillation: observational study using prospectively collected registry data [^5429d5e9]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this study of a large sample of patients with recent onset atrial fibrillation who were followed up for two years, a small number received cardioversion at baseline. Importantly, we found that patients treated with baseline cardioversion appeared to have a significantly lower mortality risk during follow-up after adjustment for known confounders (event rates per 100 patient years 2.52 v 3.87, weighted hazard ratio 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 0.85, P<0.001). Our analyses show that most patients treated with cardioversion receive a direct current approach. Event rates for all cause mortality in these patients, given differences in baseline risk, appear similar to those for patients who received pharmacological cardioversion.

Of the 44 201 patients included in the analysis of cardioversion versus no cardioversion at baseline, an attempt was made to restore sinus rhythm in only 14.9%. Given that the study population consisted of patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation, this number seems low. Studies suggest that recent onset atrial fibrillation responds favourably to rhythm controlbecause a long duration of atrial fibrillation could make cardioversion less likely to succeed.Additionally, patients may experience symptom relief after rhythm control even when not obviously symptomatic before cardioversion.Therefore, international guidelines suggest a rhythm control strategy should be considered with the aim of reducing atrial fibrillation related symptoms and improving quality of life.However, several randomised controlled trials comparing rate control and rhythm control strategies have not found significant differences in mortality rates or other adverse outcomes, but a higher hospital rate has been reported for rhythm control.In the recently published EAST-AFNET 4that included patients diagnosed one year or less before enrolment, a rhythm control strategy was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular outcomes and a similar hospital admission rate compared with usual care among patients with early atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular conditions. Our observations support a rhythm control strategy being beneficial for patients with recent onset non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, cardioversion, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to perform direct current cardioversion in pregnant patients with AF in the same manner as in nonpregnant patients, as it is safe for the patient and fetus.

### Role of transesophageal echocardiography-guided cardioversion of patients with atrial fibrillation [^8a429e3b]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Electrical cardioversion of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is frequently performed to relieve symptoms and improve cardiac performance. Patients undergoing cardioversion are treated conventionally with therapeutic anticoagulation for three weeks before and four weeks after cardioversion to decrease the risk of thromboembolism. A transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-guided strategy has been proposed as an alternative that may lower stroke and bleeding events. Patients without atrial cavity thrombus or atrial appendage thrombus by TEE are cardioverted on achievement of therapeutic anticoagulation, whereas cardioversion is delayed in higher risk patients with thrombus. The aim of this review is to discuss the issues and controversies associated with the management of patients with AF undergoing cardioversion. We provide an overview of the TEE-guided and conventional anticoagulation strategies in light of the recently completed Assessment of Cardioversion Using Transesophageal Echocardiography (ACUTE) clinical trial. The two management strategies comparably lower the patient's embolic risk when the guidelines are properly followed. The TEE-guided strategy with shorter term anticoagulation may lower the incidence of bleeding complications and safely expedite early cardioversion. The inherent advantages and disadvantages of both strategies are presented. The TEE-guided approach with short-term anticoagulation is considered to be a safe and clinically effective alternative to the conventional approach, and it is advocated in patients in whom earlier cardioversion would be clinically beneficial.

### External electrical and pharmacological cardioversion for atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter or atrial tachycardias: a network meta-analysis [^38e5f523]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent sustained arrhythmia. Cardioversion is a rhythm control strategy to restore normal/sinus rhythm, and can be achieved through drugs (pharmacological) or a synchronised electric shock (electrical cardioversion).

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological and electrical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (AF), atrial flutter and atrial tachycardias.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S) and three trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and ISRCTN) on 14 February 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) at the individual patient level. Patient populations were aged ≥ 18 years with AF of any type and duration, atrial flutter or other sustained related atrial arrhythmias, not occurring as a result of reversible causes.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology to collect data and performed a network meta-analysis using the standard frequentist graph-theoretical approach using the netmeta package in R. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence which we presented in our summary of findings with a judgement on certainty. We calculated differences using risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) as well as ranking treatments using a P value. We assessed clinical and statistical heterogeneity and split the networks for the primary outcome and acute procedural success, due to concerns about violating the transitivity assumption.

Main Results

We included 112 RCTs (139 records), from which we pooled data from 15,968 patients. The average age ranged from 47 to 72 years and the proportion of male patients ranged from 38% to 92%. Seventy-nine trials were considered to be at high risk of bias for at least one domain, 32 had no high risk of bias domains, but had at least one domain classified as uncertain risk, and one study was considered at low risk for all domains. For paroxysmal AF (35 trials), when compared to placebo, anteroapical (AA)/anteroposterior (AP) biphasic truncated exponential waveform (BTE) cardioversion (RR: 2.42; 95% CI 1.65 to 3.56), quinidine (RR: 2.23; 95% CI 1.49 to 3.34), ibutilide (RR: 2.00; 95% CI 1.28 to 3.12), propafenone (RR: 1.98; 95% CI 1.67 to 2.34), amiodarone (RR: 1.69; 95% CI 1.42 to 2.02), sotalol (RR: 1.58; 95% CI 1.08 to 2.31) and procainamide (RR: 1.49; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.97) likely result in a large increase in maintenance of sinus rhythm until hospital discharge or end of study follow-up (certainty of evidence: moderate). The effect size was larger for AA/AP incremental and was progressively smaller for the subsequent interventions. Despite low certainty of evidence, antazoline may result in a large increase (RR: 28.60; 95% CI 1.77 to 461.30) in this outcome. Similarly, low-certainty evidence suggests a large increase in this outcome for flecainide (RR: 2.17; 95% CI 1.68 to 2.79), vernakalant (RR: 2.13; 95% CI 1.52 to 2.99), and magnesium (RR: 1.73; 95% CI 0.79 to 3.79). For persistent AF (26 trials), one network was created for electrical cardioversion and showed that, when compared to AP BTE incremental energy with patches, AP BTE maximum energy with patches (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.55) likely results in a large increase, and active compression AP BTE incremental energy with patches (RR: 1.14, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.131) likely results in an increase in maintenance of sinus rhythm at hospital discharge or end of study follow-up (certainty of evidence: high). Use of AP BTE incremental with paddles (RR: 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09; certainty of evidence: low) may lead to a slight increase, and AP MDS Incremental paddles (RR: 0.95, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.05; certainty of evidence: low) may lead to a slight decrease in efficacy. On the other hand, AP MDS incremental energy using patches (RR: 0.78, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.87), AA RBW incremental energy with patches (RR: 0.76, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.88), AP RBW incremental energy with patches (RR: 0.76, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.86), AA MDS incremental energy with patches (RR: 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.86) and AA MDS incremental energy with paddles (RR: 0.68, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.83) probably result in a decrease in this outcome when compared to AP BTE incremental energy with patches (certainty of evidence: moderate). The network for pharmacological cardioversion showed that bepridil (RR: 2.29, 95% CI 1.26 to 4.17) and quindine (RR: 1.53, (95% CI 1.01 to 2.32) probably result in a large increase in maintenance of sinus rhythm at hospital discharge or end of study follow-up when compared to amiodarone (certainty of evidence: moderate). Dofetilide (RR: 0.79, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.44), sotalol (RR: 0.89, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.18), propafenone (RR: 0.79, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.25) and pilsicainide (RR: 0.39, 95% CI 0.02 to 7.01) may result in a reduction in this outcome when compared to amiodarone, but the certainty of evidence is low. For atrial flutter (14 trials), a network could be created only for antiarrhythmic drugs. Using placebo as the common comparator, ibutilide (RR: 21.45, 95% CI 4.41 to 104.37), propafenone (RR: 7.15, 95% CI 1.27 to 40.10), dofetilide (RR: 6.43, 95% CI 1.38 to 29.91), and sotalol (RR: 6.39, 95% CI 1.03 to 39.78) probably result in a large increase in the maintenance of sinus rhythm at hospital discharge or end of study follow-up (certainty of evidence: moderate), and procainamide (RR: 4.29, 95% CI 0.63 to 29.03), flecainide (RR 3.57, 95% CI 0.24 to 52.30) and vernakalant (RR: 1.18, 95% CI 0.05 to 27.37) may result in a large increase in maintenance of sinus rhythm at hospital discharge or end of study follow-up (certainty of evidence: low). All tested electrical cardioversion strategies for atrial flutter had very high efficacy (97.9% to 100%). The rate of mortality (14 deaths) and stroke or systemic embolism (3 events) at 30 days was extremely low. Data on quality of life were scarce and of uncertain clinical significance. No information was available regarding heart failure readmissions. Data on duration of hospitalisation was scarce, of low quality, and could not be pooled.

Authors' Conclusions

Despite the low quality of evidence, this systematic review provides important information on electrical and pharmacological strategies to help patients and physicians deal with AF and atrial flutter. In the assessment of the patient comorbidity profile, antiarrhythmic drug onset of action and side effect profile versus the need for a physician with experience in sedation, or anaesthetics support for electrical cardioversion are key aspects when choosing the cardioversion method.

### Selection of drugs in pursuit of a rhythm control strategy [^0c8560e3]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

A rhythm control strategy based on a combination of antiarrhythmic drugs and electrical cardioversion(s) has emerged as a viable alternative for treatment of atrial fibrillation, particularly when the arrhythmia is associated with symptoms, which may be poorly tolerated, or with congestive heart failure. Several classes of antiarrhythmic drugs are available to restore sinus rhythm by chemical cardioversion and to help maintain it once it has been achieved. In our discussion, we will detail aspects of their efficacy and safety, and attempt to outline a pragmatic clinical approach to their use. Some newer drugs are currently under investigation and hold promise for improved efficacy and/or more favorable side effect profile and will be mentioned in this article.

### Cardioversion in patients with newly diagnosed non-valvular atrial fibrillation: observational study using prospectively collected registry data [^f08c2443]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

In this large dataset of patients with recent onset non-valvular atrial fibrillation, a small proportion were treated with cardioversion. Direct current cardioversion was performed twice as often as pharmacological cardioversion. No major difference in outcome events was observed for these two cardioversion modalities. For the overall cardioversion group, after adjusting for confounders, a significantly lower risk of mortality was found in patients who received cardioversion at baseline compared with those who did not receive this treatment at baseline.
