## Question

What dose of estrogen can I give for someone starting on feminizing therapy? Patient is 30 years old. Also want to be on Prep

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate starting estrogen dose for feminizing hormone therapy in a 30-year-old transgender woman who also wants to start HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis, including dosing, interactions, monitoring, and counseling. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's baseline assessment and risk stratification. Then, I should select an appropriate estrogen formulation and starting dose with a clear titration plan. Next, I will consider antiandrogen strategy and whether to use a GnRH agonist versus spironolactone. After that, I need to choose a PrEP regimen and verify drug–drug interactions with feminizing hormones. Finally, I will outline monitoring, safety counseling, and follow-up, and I will double-check any areas of uncertainty or controversy along the way.

> Let me first confirm the baseline assessment elements I must complete before prescribing: document gender identity and affirmed name/pronouns, obtain a thorough medical history including VTE risk factors, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, smoking, and thrombophilia, perform a focused exam including BMI and blood pressure, and establish baseline labs including a comprehensive metabolic panel, liver function tests, and a serum testosterone and estradiol level to guide titration; I should also confirm HIV status and STI screening, and assess reproductive goals and contraception needs, since these influence both GAHT and PrEP counseling [^notfound].

> Now, for estrogen formulation and starting dose, I need to ensure I avoid ethinyl estradiol because of higher thrombotic risk; 17β-estradiol is preferred, and I should start low and titrate to clinical response while minimizing risk. For oral estradiol, a reasonable starting dose is 1–2 mg daily with reassessment at 3 months; for transdermal estradiol, 50–100 μg/24 hours is a common starting range, with the advantage of lower VTE risk compared with oral preparations; I should confirm that the lowest effective dose principle applies and adjust based on clinical effects and labs rather than chasing a single numeric estradiol target, especially early in therapy [^113Wtjmm] [^1159WgZJ] [^115JoGjc].

> Wait, let me verify the antiandrogen strategy because estrogen alone often does not suppress testosterone sufficiently at physiologic doses. Spironolactone is commonly used and can be started around 100 mg daily, titrating to 200–300 mg daily as tolerated while monitoring for hyperkalemia and hypotension; alternatively, a GnRH agonist can be used to achieve more reliable testosterone suppression with fewer metabolic effects, though access and cost vary; I should confirm that guidelines endorse either approach and that the choice should be individualized to goals, comorbidities, and access [^112yD8YF].

> Hold on, I should verify the interaction between feminizing hormones and PrEP before choosing a regimen. The CDC PrEP guideline notes that PrEP medications do not appear to meaningfully affect feminizing hormone levels, and conversely, feminizing hormones do not appear to reduce PrEP effectiveness in a clinically significant way, although observational data suggest lower tenofovir diphosphate levels in rectal tissue among transgender women on feminizing hormones; importantly, this signal did not translate into reduced effectiveness among adherent users, so adherence remains paramount [^11462d73] [^116tMjRb] [^1149uC8C].

> For PrEP selection, I will now examine oral and injectable options. Daily oral emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (F/TDF) is a first-line option with robust evidence for sexual exposure and no clinically meaningful interaction with estradiol; emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (F/TAF) is also acceptable for transgender women at risk via anal sex, but evidence for receptive vaginal sex is limited, so I should confirm the patient's exposure routes before choosing TAF; long-acting injectable cabotegravir every 8 weeks after a 5-week oral lead-in is highly effective and avoids daily pills, though I should screen for injection-site suitability and discuss the need for reliable visit schedules; I should also counsel that event-driven ("on-demand") PrEP has not been studied in transgender women and is not currently recommended for this population [^116aSVRy] [^1178MMZp] [^111yG4bd] [^112P3nyK].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought F/TAF was contraindicated for receptive vaginal exposure, but I should double-check; the CDC notes that F/TAF is not currently recommended for people at risk of HIV acquisition through receptive vaginal sex due to insufficient evidence, which is not the same as a formal contraindication, so I should frame this as an evidence gap rather than a prohibition and align the regimen with the patient's predominant exposure route and preferences [^111yG4bd] [^112P3nyK].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety. I need to ensure clinical follow-up every 3 months in the first year to assess feminization, mood, blood pressure, and adherence, with labs including estradiol, testosterone, CBC, CMP, and potassium if on spironolactone; after the first year, visits can space to every 6–12 months if stable; for PrEP, I should follow CDC guidance with baseline HIV testing, renal function assessment, HBV screening, and then HIV testing at least every 3 months, with renal monitoring every 6 months for TDF-containing regimens; I should also counsel on VTE risk mitigation by favoring transdermal estradiol, avoiding ethinyl estradiol, and addressing smoking and obesity [^115JoGjc] [^113Wtjmm].

> I need to ensure I address cardiovascular and thrombotic risk explicitly. Feminizing hormone therapy is associated with a small increase in VTE risk, particularly with oral estrogens and in patients with additional risk factors; transdermal estradiol mitigates this risk, and I should screen for and manage hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, smoking, and obesity; I should also confirm that patients over 50 or with multiple risk factors warrant heightened vigilance and shared decision-making about route and dose [^113Wtjmm].

> Let me consider reproductive and sexual health counseling carefully. Even though this patient is a transgender woman, I should confirm whether there is any potential for pregnancy, because some patients retain testicular tissue and engage in sexual activity that could result in conception; if pregnancy is possible and not desired, effective contraception should be offered, and if pregnancy is desired, I should provide preconception counseling and coordinate care accordingly; additionally, I should reinforce that PrEP does not protect against other STIs, so condoms and regular STI screening remain important [^117RJQAf] [^116shDFi].

> I should double-check that I am integrating PrEP and hormone care in a way that reduces barriers. Co-locating or coordinating HIV prevention and gender-affirming care improves adherence and trust; I should proactively discuss perceived or actual drug–drug interaction concerns, reassure that PrEP does not interfere with feminizing hormone effects, and consider long-acting PrEP if adherence to daily pills is a concern or if privacy and pharmacy access are barriers [^11313Q5X] [^116tMjRb].

> Putting this together, my concrete plan is as follows: start 17β-estradiol 2 mg orally once daily or transdermal estradiol 50–100 μg/24 hours and reassess at 3 months for clinical response and labs; begin spironolactone 100 mg daily and titrate to 200–300 mg as tolerated if needed for testosterone suppression; initiate PrEP with either daily F/TDF or consider cabotegravir 600 mg IM every 8 weeks after a 5-week oral lead-in based on patient preference, exposure routes, and access; schedule 3-month follow-ups for the first year with CBC, CMP, estradiol, testosterone, and potassium if on spironolactone, alongside HIV and STI screening and renal monitoring per PrEP protocol; counsel on VTE risk reduction, smoking cessation, and adherence, and adjust the estrogen dose to the lowest effective level that achieves therapeutic goals while minimizing adverse effects [^1159WgZJ] [^116aSVRy] [^117RJQAf] [^115JoGjc].

For a 30-year-old starting feminizing hormone therapy, **start estradiol at 2–4 mg/day orally or 50–100 mcg/day transdermally** [^11223Fm1], titrating to 4–6 mg/day orally or 100–200 mcg/day transdermally based on clinical response and serum estradiol levels [^11223Fm1]. Avoid ethinyl estradiol due to higher thrombotic risk [^113Wtjmm]. PrEP (F/TDF or F/TAF) can be co-prescribed without dose adjustment, but monitor renal function with TDF [^11462d73] and consider long-acting cabotegravir if adherence is a concern [^112cs6jw]. Reassess at 3 months and then every 6–12 months to adjust therapy and monitor for adverse effects [^115JoGjc].

---

## Recommended estrogen dosing for feminizing hormone therapy

### Initial dosing (start low, titrate slowly)

- **Oral estradiol**: 2–4 mg/day, divided into two doses (e.g. 1–2 mg twice daily) [^11223Fm1].
- **Transdermal estradiol patch**: 50–100 mcg/day, applied once or twice weekly depending on the formulation [^11223Fm1].
- **Parenteral estradiol valerate or cypionate**: 10–20 mg intramuscularly every 2–4 weeks, titrated to clinical response and serum estradiol levels [^notfound].

---

### Maintenance dosing (adjust based on clinical response and serum estradiol levels)

- **Oral estradiol**: 4–6 mg/day, divided into two doses [^notfound].
- **Transdermal estradiol patch**: 100–200 mcg/day [^notfound].
- **Parenteral estradiol valerate or cypionate**: 20–40 mg intramuscularly every 2–4 weeks [^notfound].

---

### Monitoring and adjustment

Clinical monitoring should occur **every 3 months during the first year**, then every 6–12 months thereafter [^115JoGjc]. Laboratory monitoring should include **serum estradiol, testosterone, and liver function tests** at each visit [^notfound]. Dose adjustments should be based on clinical response, serum hormone levels, and patient preferences [^notfound].

---

## Interaction with pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)

### PrEP options and dosing

- **Oral PrEP**: Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (F/TDF) 1 tablet daily [^116aSVRy].
- **Oral PrEP**: Emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (F/TAF) 1 tablet daily (approved for transgender women at risk of HIV acquisition through anal sex) [^111yG4bd].
- **Injectable PrEP**: Cabotegravir 600 mg intramuscularly every 8 weeks after an initial loading dose [^114xbTou].

---

### Drug-drug interactions

- **Estrogen and PrEP**: No clinically significant interactions have been identified between estrogen therapy and PrEP medications (F/TDF, F/TAF, cabotegravir) [^112P3nyK].
- **Renal function monitoring**: Regular renal function monitoring is recommended when using TDF-containing PrEP regimens, especially in patients with pre-existing renal impairment or those receiving concomitant medications that may affect renal function [^112iMpmP].

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

### Cardiovascular and thrombotic risk

Cardiovascular risk is increased with estrogen therapy, particularly with **oral formulations** and at higher doses; transdermal estradiol is preferred for patients with elevated cardiovascular risk [^notfound]. Thrombotic risk is also higher with estrogen therapy, especially with **oral formulations**; transdermal estradiol is associated with a lower thrombotic risk compared to oral formulations [^notfound].

---

### Hepatic considerations

Hepatic metabolism of oral estrogens occurs in the liver; patients with **pre-existing liver conditions** should be monitored closely, and transdermal formulations may be preferred [^113Wtjmm].

---

### Patient-specific factors

Age-related considerations: At age 30, the patient is at **lower risk for cardiovascular and thrombotic complications** compared to older patients, but individualized risk assessment and monitoring are still essential [^113Wtjmm]. Patient preferences should guide the **choice of estrogen formulation**, with transdermal patches favored for their lower thrombotic risk and steady hormone levels [^notfound].

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention is a promising experimental approach currently being tested globally. A number of PrEP trials are evaluating the safety and effectiveness of PrEP in men who have sex with men (MSM) and other populations at risk for HIV, and results will be available from this first generation of efficacy trials over the next few years. Here we review the rationale for orally-administered antiretrovirals for prevention, and outline issues the first generation trials will address as well as questions that may be addressed in future studies. We also describe the rationale for combination prevention approaches that may combine PrEP with other prevention modalities as part of a larger prevention package.

### Standards of care for the health of transgender and gender diverse people, version 8 [^11313Q5X]. International Journal of Transgender Health (2022). High credibility.

Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people — PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) and HIV treatment with concurrent hormone therapy are addressed, with evidence that a study failed to detect an impact of hormone therapy on PrEP drug concentrations in transgender women and that for many TGD people, no impact of PrEP on hormone concentrations has been detected. With regard to HIV treatment, specific antiretroviral medications may impact hormone concentrations; however, these can be managed by selecting alternative agents, monitoring and adjusting hormone dosing, or both. Because concerns about drug-drug interactions, particularly interactions that may limit hormone concentrations, represent a barrier to the implementation and adherence to antiretroviral therapy for HIV prevention or treatment, it is advisable for HCPs to proactively address such concerns with those who are candidates for PrEP or HIV treatment. Integration of PrEP or HIV treatment with hormone therapy may further reduce barriers to implementation and adherence, and integration may be achieved through colocation or through coordination with an HIV specialist if the primary care provider does not have the necessary expertise. Some TGD persons may benefit from standalone PrEP or sexual health services that provide greater privacy and flexibility, and thus differentiated service delivery models are needed.

Ritonavir Interactions With ASMs

Another potential clinically relevant interaction exists between lamotrigine (LTG) and ritonavir (r), an element of the WHO recommendation for PEP. Ritonavir (r) can reduce lamotrigine (LTG) concentration by 50% within days, therefore lamotrigine dosing may need to be modified during short-term PEP treatment containing ritonavir (r). Irrespective of potential lamotrigine adjustments or decreases during PEP, the removal of ritonavir (r) may contribute to a rise in serum lamotrigine concentration. This may be associated with both transient increased adverse effects of lamotrigine, similar to those during the placebo week of estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, as well as increased risk of Steven's Johnson Syndrome (SJS). Data from withdrawal of lamotrigine during long-term inpatient monitoring suggest the risk of SJS is low if lamotrigine dosing was lower for less than 7 days, but the duration of ritonavir (r) in PEP typically lasts 4 weeks. Therefore, during this period of PEP and afterward, the dosing of lamotrigine may need to be increased and additional counseling provided regarding monitoring for SJS. In addition to lamotrigine, the European Medicines agency recently issues a warning regarding the interaction with everolimus and ritonavir, which also is an element of treatment for Covid-19 in combination with nirmatrelvir in Paxlovid.

Other ASMs and Other ARTs Without Known Interactions

In addition to highlighting the presence of known or theoretical interaction between certain ASMs and many of the ARTs used in PrEP/PEP, we emphasize that there are several ASMs without known or limited interactions. When possible, patients with anticipated need for PrEP/PEP should aim to achieve seizure and side effect freedom with these noninteracting ASMs. However, one third of patients with epilepsy have medication-resistant epilepsy, defined by failure by 2 or more appropriately prescribed and tolerated ASMs, therefore this may not be possible. Additionally, while levetiracetam (LEV) was recently added to the WHO essential medications list, these modern ASMs often are not widely available globally due to cost, regulatory approval, and supply chain challenges. Analogously, modern ARTs typically have fewer drug–drug interactions; therefore, they may emerge as preferred elements of PrEP and PEP regimens in people taking ASMs.

Prevention of Sexually Transmitted Infections

All patients, regardless of contraceptive choice, should be counseled about the use of condoms and the risk for STIs, including HIV infection. Most contraceptive methods, such as hormonal methods, IUDs, and permanent contraception, do not protect against STIs, including HIV infection. Consistent and correct use of external (male) latex condoms reduces the risk for STIs, including HIV infection. Although evidence is limited, use of internal (female) condoms can provide protection from acquisition and transmission of STIs. Patients also should be counseled that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), when taken as prescribed, is highly effective for preventing HIV infection. Additional information about prevention and treatment of STIs is available from CDC's Sexually Transmitted Infections Treatment Guidelines, and information on PrEP for prevention of HIV infection is available from the U.S. Public Health Service's Preexposure Prophylaxis for the Prevention of HIV Infection in the United States — 2021 Update: A Clinical Practice Guideline.

Considerations for Persons who Inject Drugs or who Have Substance Use Disorder

The preferred nPEP regimens for adults and adolescents can be taken with methadone or buprenorphine, with no dose adjustment needed. Health care professionals should consider discussing substance use disorder treatment options, assessing availability and use of safe injecting practices, providing naloxone if available, and assessing for co-occurring mental health disorders. If indicated and desired, the health care professional should refer the person for substance use disorder treatment and harm reduction programs (e.g. syringe service programs), if available. Resources are available for additional information about care for persons who inject drugs.

Considerations for Persons Receiving Hormone Therapies

The preferred nPEP regimens can be taken with hormone therapies (estrogens or testosterone) with no dose adjustment needed. Side effects from the interaction between certain hormone therapies and certain nPEP regimens (e.g. ritonavir and cobicistat-containing regimens) can occur and should be monitored for by health care providers.

Considerations for PrEP After nPEP

Persons initiating nPEP should be informed that PrEP can reduce their risk for acquiring HIV infection if they will have repeat or continuing exposure to HIV after the end of the nPEP course. Health care professionals should offer PrEP options to persons with ongoing indications for PrEP and create an nPEP-to-PrEP transition plan for persons who accept PrEP. Persons initiating PrEP before the final follow-up HIV test 12 weeks after PEP initiation should be counseled about the possibility of a false-negative HIV test result and the importance of ongoing PrEP care with recommended HIV testing. An immediate transition from nPEP to PrEP, including HIV testing at the completion of the nPEP regimen with a prompt transition to a recommended PrEP regimen, might be beneficial for persons with anticipated repeat or ongoing potential HIV exposures, especially for persons who might be exposed to HIV during the time between completion of the nPEP course and the recommended HIV test 12 weeks after exposure. Further information on transition to PrEP can be found in the most recent CDC PrEP Guidelines.

### Pre-and post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV in patients taking anti-seizure medications [^1113uNxu]. Epilepsy Currents (2024). Medium credibility.

Cotreatment of HIV with ritonavir (r), which is part of the PEP WHO regimen, together with these enzyme-inducing ASMs also was associated with greater virologic failure in long-term HIV. This interaction also is theoretically present with the US DHHS alternative of RAL.

These complex interactions highlight the challenge in providing the short-term treatment of PEP or longer-term PrEP in patients on long-term enzyme inducing ASMs. While the need for PEP cannot always be predicted, we recommend avoidance of these enzyme inducing ASM regimens, if possible, when patients are anticipated to need PrEP or PEP.

Valproate

In addition to traditional enzyme-inducing agents, valproate has complex drug–drug effects on TDF, a component of both PrEP and PEP. Increased estrogen levels associated with valproate may also warrant daily TDF dosing for PrEP, similar to the recommendation for transgender women taking exogenous estradiol-based hormones.- Additionally, there is a single case report of lower valproate serum level and effectiveness in bipolar disease with ritonavir. When PEP is needed, there can be bidirectional interactions that can reduce both ART levels as well as valproate serum levels, resulting in theoretical concerns regarding both breakthrough HIV infections and seizures. There is mixed evidence between peer-reviewed publications and the Liverpool drug–drug interaction checker regarding the details of interactions between valproate and individual elements of PEP. We did not identify empiric evidence or case reports regarding the clinical significance of these theoretical concerns for seizures, so we cannot confidently recommend empiric dosing changes of valproate, PrEP, or PEP.

For children under 10 years using the WHO regimen for PEP and children between 4 weeks and less than 2 years using the US DHHS regimen for PEP, valproate increased the levels of zidovudine (AZT). Because PEP treatment is typically temporary for 4 weeks, patients requiring both valproate and PEP could receive both treatments, but providers should monitor for increased adverse effects related to zidovudine (AZT) including hematologic toxicity, anemia, and neutropenia. In absence of observed adverse effects, we cannot confidently recommend empiric dosing modifications.

Combined Hormonal Contraceptives

CHCs contain both estrogen and a progestin and include COCs (various formulations), combined transdermal patches, and combined vaginal rings. Approximately seven out of 100 CHC users become pregnant in the first year with typical use. These methods are reversible and can be used by patients of all ages. Combined hormonal contraceptives are generally used for 21–24 consecutive days, followed by 4–7 hormone-free days (either no use or placebo pills). These methods are sometimes used for an extended period with infrequent or no hormone-free days. CHCs do not protect against STIs, including HIV infection, and patients using CHCs should be counseled that consistent and correct use of external (male) latex condoms reduces the risk for STIs, including HIV infection. Use of internal (female) condoms can provide protection from STIs, including HIV infection, although data are limited. Patients also should be counseled that PrEP, when taken as prescribed, is highly effective for preventing HIV infection.

Initiation of CHCs

Timing

CHCs may be initiated at any time if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant (Box 3).

Need for Back-Up Contraception

If CHCs are started within the first 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, no additional contraceptive protection is needed.
If CHCs are started > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days.

Special Considerations

Amenorrhea (Not Postpartum)

Timing: CHCs may be started at any time if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant (Box 3).
Need for back-up contraception: The patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days.

Transgender women in iPrEx — efficacy and adherence: Using an expanded definition of transgender women, no efficacy of F/TDF for preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) was demonstrated, with 11 infections in the PrEP group and 10 in placebo (HR 1.1, 95% CI: 0.5–2.7). Compared with men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender women had less consistent PrEP use by drug level testing (OR 0.39 [95% CI: 0.16–0.96]). The expanded subgroup included transgender women (n = 339) defined as identified as women (n = 29), identified as transgender (n = 296), or identified as male and used feminizing hormones (n = 14). In a subsequent open-label extension, one transgender woman seroconverted while receiving PrEP and one seroconversion occurred in a woman who elected not to use PrEP.

### Providing primary care to transgender patients [^111J1wpH]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2019). Medium credibility.

While this patient may not currently be high risk enough to qualify for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) against HIV, it would be good to let her know that if her relationship status changes in any way, that you can prescribe PrEP. An easy way to see if someone meets criteria is to visit, where the patient can complete a short, confidential quiz. Warning: this quiz does not ask the question of whether their partner is monogamous.

Osteoporosis screening by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan would not be indicated in this patient until she turns 65 years old, unless she had her testicles removed and is not compliant with her oestrogen. The same recommendation would apply to a transman who had an oophorectomy and is not taking testosterone. Finally, screen for depression, anxiety, domestic violence and substance use, all of which have a high prevalence in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) population at large.

My message to primary care doctors treating transgender patients is this: do what you do best. Listen to your patients' amazing stories. Give them the sacred space to be vulnerable, physically and emotionally. Look up answers to questions when you don't know them, and enjoy learning something new that can help people. Let the grace wash over you. Repeat.

### Preexposure prophylaxis for the prevention of HIV infection in the United States – 2021 update: a clinical practice guideline [^11462d73]. HIV.gov (2021). High credibility.

Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for transgender populations — evidence and recommendations are as follows: Transgender women were not specifically included in the FDA approval for F/TDF for PrEP, and FDA approval of F/TAF for PrEP was based on an analysis that combined 5,387 MSM (2,694 given F/TAF) and 74 transgender women (45 given F/TAF), with only 24 transgender women remaining through the analysis period, leaving too few for a separate analysis and unresolved questions about level of proof for them; no data are available for prevention effectiveness of F/TDF or F/TAF in transgender men. In HPTN 083, transgender women were analyzed separately; transgender women in the F/TDF group had similar HIV incidence (1.8 per 100 py) and hazard ratios compared to cabotegravir MSM groups (0.34 for TGW, 0.35 for MSM). F/TDF PrEP has been shown to reduce HIV risk during anal and penile-vaginal sex, and efficacy has been shown for cabotegravir injection; therefore PrEP is recommended for transgender women at risk for HIV acquisition, and when prescribed, clinicians should discuss the need for high medication adherence and reassure patients that PrEP medications do not impact the effects of feminizing hormones.

Feminizing hormone therapy (FHT) may interact with human immunodeficiency virus preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). We found that transgender women who took FHT exhibited a 7-fold lower rectal tissue ratio of PrEP's active metabolites vs competing deoxynucleotides compared to cisgender women and men (P = 0.03) that inversely correlated with estradiol (ρ = -0.79; P < .05). Thus, FHT may negatively impact PrEP efficacy. Clinical Trials Registration. NCT02983110.

Conclusions

In this dual-institution study of PrEP prescribing, we found opportunities to improve PrEP prescribing where patients are accessing care for sexual health. We also identified opportunities to improve equitable PrEP prescribing among young Black and Latino populations, as well as women highly impacted by HIV. Our results can inform targeted interventions at the healthcare system level to improve PrEP prescribing and uptake for indicated patients.

### Preexposure prophylaxis to prevent acquisition of HIV: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115jpWEn]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Recommendations of others — preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention guidance: The US Public Health Service recommends PrEP for HIV prevention for sexually active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who report sexual behaviors that place them at substantial ongoing risk of HIV exposure and acquisition or who inject drugs and report injection practices that place them at substantial ongoing risk of HIV exposure and acquisition. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends discussing PrEP with all sexually active adolescents and adults and offering PrEP to those at substantial risk of HIV acquisition. The International Antiviral Society–USA Panel recommends PrEP for individuals at risk of HIV. It notes that identification of at-risk individuals for whom PrEP is recommended requires individualized approaches that consider past and future anticipated risk.

### Preexposure prophylaxis for the prevention of HIV infection in the United States – 2021 update: a clinical practice guideline [^111Fpp2J]. HIV.gov (2021). High credibility.

Transgender persons — HIV diagnosis proportions and PrEP evidence indicate that transgender persons are those whose gender identity or expression differs from their sex at birth, and among all adults and adolescents, diagnoses of HIV infection among transgender persons accounted for approximately 2% of diagnoses of HIV infections in the United States and 6 dependent areas, of whom 92% of diagnoses of HIV infections were for transgender women. The effectiveness of PrEP with either F/TDF or F/TAF for transgender women has not yet been definitively proven in trials that were underpowered because of the small number of transgender women included, and all studies conducted to date have shown no effect of F/TDF on hormone levels.

Progestin-Only Pills

POPs contain only a progestin and no estrogen. Three formulations are currently available in the United States: norethindrone, norgestrel, and drospirenone (DRSP). Approximately seven out of 100 POP users become pregnant in the first year with typical use. POPs are reversible and can be used by patients of all ages. POPs do not protect against STIs, including HIV infection, and patients using POPs should be counseled that consistent and correct use of external (male) latex condoms reduces the risk for STIs, including HIV infection. Use of internal (female) condoms can provide protection from STIs, including HIV infection, although data are limited. Patients also should be counseled that PrEP, when taken as prescribed, is highly effective for preventing HIV infection.

Initiation of POPs

Timing

All POPs may be started at any time if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant (Box 3).

Need for Back-Up Contraception

Norethindrone or norgestrel POPs: º If norethindrone or norgestrel POPs are started within the first 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, no additional contraceptive protection is needed. º If norethindrone or norgestrel POPs are started > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 2 days.
DRSP POPs: º If DRSP POPs are started on the first day of menstrual bleeding, no additional contraceptive protection is needed. º If DRSP POPs are started > 1 day since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days.

Special Considerations

Amenorrhea (Not Postpartum)

Timing: All POPs may be started at any time if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant (Box 3).
Need for back-up contraception: º Norethindrone or norgestrel POPs: The patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 2 days. º DRSP POPs: The patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days.

Introduction

HIV remains a significant global health problem. In 2020, an estimated 680 000 individuals died from HIV-related causes globally, while there were 1.5 million new infections. Although HIV-related mortality has declined nearly 50% over the past decade, declines in new infections have been sluggish, particularly among key populations at elevated risk of infection (eg, men who have sex with men, transgender people, people who inject drugs and adolescent girls and young women). To address the high burden of new infections among these populations, there exists a pressing need to rapidly expand access to high-quality HIV prevention programming.

The introduction of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) was a watershed moment in the history of HIV prevention. When taken on a daily or on-demand basis, PrEP use can substantially lower the likelihood of HIV acquisition. Yet despite PrEP's immense promise, its global scale up has been slow. Like HIV treatment, high-quality PrEP services can be conceptualised according to a 'cascade' of necessary, sequential steps, extending from PrEP awareness and initiation through to PrEP adherence and retention. Persistence (ie, ongoing use) and adequate adherence to recommended dosing in the setting of HIV risk are key components of the PrEP cascade that, if not effectively promoted and supported, have the potential to undermine PrEP's effectiveness. To be maximally protective, PrEP use must consistently coincide with potential HIV exposure events (ie, prevention-effective adherence), but data suggest that PrEP discontinuation is common, with many individuals discontinuing PrEP within the first 6 months of initiation. Although discontinuation of PrEP in the absence of anticipated HIV exposure may be 'strategic, effective and efficient', people who discontinue PrEP in the setting of ongoing exposure events and inconsistent or absent condom use during sexual intercourse may be at risk for HIV acquisition.

Women who become pregnant or breastfeed while taking PrEP — The guidance in this section focuses on the use of PrEP during periconception, pregnancy, and breastfeeding. All research on PrEP cited here was conducted with cisgender women, and there are no data yet about transgender men, genderqueer, or non-binary individuals who have become pregnant and given birth while taking PrEP medication; therefore, this section uses the terminology, 'women'. An increased risk of HIV acquisition has been documented for women during periods of conception, pregnancy, and breastfeeding.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

See FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use).

Counsel patients about the following information:

Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from COC use, and that women who are over 35 years old and smoke should not use COCs [see Boxed Warning].
Increased risk of VTE compared to non-users of COCs is greatest after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4-week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Previfem®and Tri-Previfem®do not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted infections.
Previfem®and Tri-Previfem®are not to be used during pregnancy; if pregnancy occurs during use of Previfem®or Tri-Previfem®instruct the patient to stop further use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].
Take one tablet daily by mouth at the same time every day. Instruct patients what to do in the event tablets are missed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
Use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with Previfem®or Tri-Previfem® [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].
COCs may reduce breast milk production; this is less likely to occur if breastfeeding is well established [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].
Women who start COCs postpartum, and who have not yet had a period, should use an additional method of contraception until they have taken an active tablet for 7 consecutive days [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
Amenorrhea may occur. Consider pregnancy in the event of amenorrhea at the time of the first missed period. Rule out pregnancy in the event of amenorrhea in two or more consecutive cycles [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^113BPZ8e]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Dosing

Before prescribing testosterone therapy, clinicians should obtain informed consent. They should explain that for women it is an off-label therapy, counsel regarding the benefits and risks through shared decision-making recognizing patient's goals and concerns, and provide detailed documentation of the discussion.

Dosing should be targeted to achieve testosterone concentrations in the physiologic premenopausal range. In a study of premenopausal women with no complaints of sexual dysfunction intended to define normal female androgen values, women aged 20–29 years, 30–39 years, and 40–49 years had testosterone values ranging from 45.5 to 57.5 ng/dl, 27.6 to 39.8 ng/dl, and 27.0 to 38.6 ng/dl, respectively. This range is approximately 1/10th–1/15th of the systemic testosterone values in healthy men (range 300–800 ng/dl). Thus, treatment using any male product for women should be initiated using one-tenth of the recommended starting dose for men.

Clinicians prescribe estrogen alone for women without a uterus, use "the lowest effective dose with upward titration based on clinical response", and "usually do not measure estradiol levels to monitor therapy except when symptoms do not improve with escalating doses, particularly after changing the mode of administration from oral to transdermal". For younger women with surgical menopause or those with POI, higher starting doses may be used, for example "transdermal estradiol, 100 μg", then tapered as tolerated, and "the reassessment and tapering of MHT dose seems reasonable" as premature menopause approaches the natural menopause age.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be reevaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (e.g., 3-month to 6-month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary (see BOXED WARNINGS and WARNINGS). For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding.

Patients should be started at the lowest dose for the indication.

1. For treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, vulval and vaginal atrophy associated with the menopause, the lowest dose and regimen that will control symptoms should be chosen and medication should be discontinued as promptly as possible.

Attempts to discontinue or taper medication should be made at 3-month to 6-month intervals. The usual initial dosage range is 1 to 2 mg daily of estradiol adjusted as necessary to control presenting symptoms. The minimal effective dose for maintenance therapy should be determined by titration. Administration should be cyclic (e.g., 3 weeks on and 1 week off).

2. For treatment of female hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration, or primary ovarian failure.

Treatment is usually initiated with a dose of 1 to 2 mg daily of estradiol, adjusted as necessary to control presenting symptoms; the minimal effective dose for maintenance therapy should be determined by titration.

3. For treatment of breast cancer, for palliation only, in appropriately selected women and men with metastatic disease.

Suggested dosage is 10 mg three times daily for a period of at least three months.

4. For treatment of advanced androgen-dependent carcinoma of the prostate, for palliation only.

Suggested dosage is 1 to 2 mg three times daily. The effectiveness of therapy can be judged by phosphatase determinations as well as by symptomatic improvement of the patient.

5. For prevention of osteoporosis.

When prescribing solely for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, therapy should be considered only for women at significant risk of osteoporosis and for whom non-estrogen medications are not considered to be appropriate.

The lowest effective dose of estradiol has not been determined.

### Antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for preventing HIV in high-risk individuals [^1129nBLH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

More than 30 years into the global HIV/AIDS epidemic, infection rates remain alarmingly high, with over 2.7 million people becoming infected every year. There is a need for HIV prevention strategies that are more effective. Oral antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in high-risk individuals may be a reliable tool in preventing the transmission of HIV.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of oral antiretroviral chemoprophylaxis in preventing HIV infection in HIV-uninfected high-risk individuals.

Search Methods

We revised the search strategy from the previous version of the review and conducted an updated search of MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and EMBASE in April 2012. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials that evaluated the effects of any antiretroviral agent or combination of antiretroviral agents in preventing HIV infection in high-risk individuals

Data Collection and Analysis

Data concerning outcomes, details of the interventions, and other study characteristics were extracted by two independent authors using a standardized data extraction form. Relative risk with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used as the measure of effect.

Main Results

We identified 12 randomised controlled trials that meet the criteria for the review. Six were ongoing trials, four had been completed and two had been terminated early. Six studies with a total of 9849 participants provided data for this review. The trials evaluated the following: daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) plus emtricitabine (FTC) versus placebo; TDF versus placebo and daily TDF-FTC versus intermittent TDF-FTC. One of the trials had three study arms: TDF, TDF-FTC and placebo arm. The studies were carried out amongst different risk groups, including HIV-uninfected men who have sex with men, serodiscordant couples and other high risk men and women. Overall results from the four trials that compared TDF-FTC versus placebo showed a reduction in the risk of acquiring HIV infection (RR 0.51; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.86; 8918 participants). Similarly, the overall results of the studies that compared TDF only versus placebo showed a significant reduction in the risk of acquiring HIV infection (RR 0.38; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.63, 4027 participants). There were no significant differences in the risk of adverse events across all the studies that reported on adverse events. Also, adherence and sexual behaviours were similar in both the intervention and control groups.

Authors' Conclusions

Finding from this review suggests that pre-exposure prophylaxis with TDF alone or TDF-FTC reduces the risk of acquiring HIV in high-risk individuals including people in serodiscordant relationships, men who have sex with men and other high risk men and women.

Statement 17.8 — antiretroviral medications and hormones in transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people states: "We recommend health care professionals who provide care to transgender and gender diverse people address concerns about potential interactions between antiretroviral medications and hormones". For TGD adolescents and adults at substantial risk of HIV infection, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is described as "an important HIV prevention option"; the US Centers for Disease Control "recommended all sexually active adolescents and adults be informed about PrEP and offered it if requested". For prevention and treatment, "the only daily dosing is currently recommended for TGD persons" because studies of event-driven PrEP with emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) "have been limited to cisgender men". While emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is a new oral option, it "is not recommended for people at risk of HIV acquisition through receptive vaginal sex due to a lack of evidence". Long-acting injectable options "are increasingly available" and "are recommended for all patients who might benefit from injectable options", but the indicated "gluteal muscle" injection site "may be unsuitable for individuals who have used soft tissue fillers". The document adds that "There is little evidence supporting the occurrence of drug-drug interactions between gender-affirming hormones and PrEP medications".

Gender-affirming Hormone Therapy

Exogenous estrogen or testosterone may be prescribed to adolescents wishing to feminize or masculinize, respectively. The principal goal of GAH therapy is to induce desired secondary sex characteristics congruent with an individual's identity; however, specific goals and priorities for gender affirmation vary between individuals.

Where PS is commenced in early puberty and the adolescent is relatively naïve to sex hormone, GAH is conventionally introduced at a low dose with gradual incremental dose increases timed to mimic the tempo of typical puberty. For adolescents already in well-established puberty (Tanner 4+), introduction and escalation of GAH therapy can be more rapid.

Medications that contain 17 ß-estradiol are most commonly recommended for feminization. Use of ethinyl estradiol-containing medications should be avoided because of higher thromboembolic risks. Oral and transdermal agents are the most commonly used routes in many countries, with injectable and sublingual options available in some jurisdictions. Published dosing strategies are largely based on experience and expert opinion, and prospective controlled studies comparing different regimens are lacking.

Although exogenous estrogen therapy will provide some hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis suppression, experience in adult cohorts indicates that estrogen alone is unlikely to provide sufficient suppression without use of supraphysiological doses (and attendant increase in risk of adverse effects). Concomitant GnRHa therapy can therefore be beneficial, but use of an antiandrogen is a common alternative if GnRHa is not available. Ultimately, some transfeminine individuals elect to undergo gender-affirming surgery including orchiectomy, which will remove the need for GnRHa or an antiandrogen; however, this is generally not performed until age > 18 years.

Testosterone regimens in TGD adolescents seeking to masculinize reflect those used in hypogonadal cisgender males. International guidelines recommend use of short-acting injectable preparations (2–4 weekly) and these are the most commonly reported agents in adolescent cohorts. However, if unavailable or unacceptable (eg, because of frequent injections), alternative regimens and routes may also be used. Longer acting injectable testosterone preparations are more typically reserved for use in those with well-established pubertal hormone exposure. Dose modulation is more easily undertaken with short-acting injectable testosterone esters or topical preparations. PS or alternative therapies to modulate the effects of endogenous pubertal hormones (eg, progestogens) are typically continued until adult testosterone levels are consistently established.

### Is it time to revisit the recommendations for initiation of menopausal hormone therapy? [^113Vxb4F]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Findings from the Women's Health Initiative studies led to menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) guidelines generally recommending the initiation of MHT be limited to women within 10 years of their menopause or before the age of 60 years. This recommendation has led to women who experience troublesome menopausal symptoms and who have not commenced MHT within these limits often being denied this type of therapy. Similarly, the majority of women who might benefit from the protective effects of MHT against bone loss and fracture are not offered this treatment option if they do not fit with these criteria. Based on review of the evidence that led to the conditional initiation of MHT, and subsequent studies, we propose that the recommendations regarding the initiation of MHT need to change to be more inclusive of women outside these chronological limits.

### Editorial commentary: keeping our eyes on the prize: No new HIV infections with increased use of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [^114uuVSP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Biomedical approaches to preventing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have advanced quickly, particularly over the last 5 years. A significant milestone occurred in July 2012 when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of daily oral emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada) as HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Many questions remain: What proportion of the population vulnerable to HIV will take a pill a day to prevent it? How will the costs of the medication and clinic visits be paid for? Assuming people are willing to use PrEP and can access PrEP, will they take the medication as directed? Will uptake and use be higher or lower among those at highest risk? Will people place themselves at higher risk for HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) as a consequence of using PrEP?

We are slowly accumulating answers to these key questions. The study by Volk and colleagues in this issue sheds light on issues related to PrEP uptake, access, and adherence. PrEP uptake has been characterized as "slow", although it is not clear what is used as a reference point. Disseminations of successful innovations often require many years, as occurred with hormonal contraception, hepatitis B and human papilloma virus vaccination, and combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection. Volk et al's graphical comparison of referrals, intakes, and initiation among patients seen in a primary care facility illustrates a dramatic increase in uptake approximately 1 year after FDA approval. This striking uptake produced an expected and most desired outcome — no new HIV infections — among a population vulnerable to HIV. Given the historical devastation wrought by HIV/AIDS within the city of San Francisco and elsewhere, this is tremendously good news. Despite intensive efforts to curb HIV transmission, San Francisco data from 2013 indicate that approximately 1 HIV infection occurs each day. San Francisco is actively working towards the United Nations AIDS Getting to Zero goal to halt all new HIV infections, HIV-related deaths, and HIV-related stigma. The data published by Volk and colleagues demonstrate meaningful progress toward the goal of halting new infections.

Feminizing gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) — venous thromboembolism (VTE) and cardiovascular risk characterization: European and US studies in transgender women who have accessed feminizing GAHT demonstrate an increased risk of VTE compared to cisgender women, and in some studies, cisgender men; however, the overall increased risk was small. In many of these studies, the majority of those with cardiac events or stroke were over 50 years old, had one or more CVD risk factors, and were taking regimens including ethinyl estradiol, which confers thrombotic risk and is not recommended for use in feminizing regimens. Current limited evidence suggests estrogen-based GAHT is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke, but whether this small risk reflects GAHT or pre-existing risk is unclear.

### ACOG committee opinion no 595: committee on gynecologic practice: preexposure prophylaxis for the prevention of human immunodeficiency virus [^117XDzGA]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Preexposure prophylaxis is defined as the administration of antiretroviral medications to individuals who are not infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and are at the highest risk of acquiring HIV infection. In combination with other proven HIV-prevention methods, preexposure prophylaxis may be a useful tool for women at the highest risk of HIV acquisition. Obstetrician-gynecologists involved in the care of women using preexposure prophylaxis must reinforce adherence to daily medication. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidance for preexposure prophylaxis is likely to evolve in the coming years, and obstetrician-gynecologists should remain aware of new developments in this area. Risk reduction for all women at risk of HIV infection should include counseling about testing, safe-sex practices (including condom use), and other behavioral interventions.

Injectables

Progestin-only injectable contraceptives (DMPA, 150 mg intramuscularly [DMPA-IM] or 104 mg subcutaneously [DMPA-SC]) are available in the United States; the only difference between these two formulations is the route of administration. Approximately four out of 100 DMPA users will become pregnant in the first year with typical use. DMPA is reversible and can be used by patients of all ages, including adolescents. DMPA does not protect against STIs, including HIV infection, and patients using DMPA should be counseled that consistent and correct use of external (male) latex condoms reduces the risk for STIs, including HIV infection. Use of internal (female) condoms can provide protection from STIs, including HIV infection, although data are limited. Patients also should be counseled that PrEP, when taken as prescribed, is highly effective for preventing HIV infection.

Initiation of Injectables

Timing

The first DMPA injection may be administered at any time if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant (Box 3).

Need for Back-Up Contraception

If DMPA is started within the first 7 days since menstrual bleeding started, no additional contraceptive protection is needed.
If DMPA is started > 7 days since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days.

### The use of injectable estradiol in transgender and gender diverse adults: a scoping review of dose and serum estradiol levels [^116KgYGs]. Endocrine Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Feminizing gender-affirming hormone therapy is the mainstay of treatment for many transgender and gender diverse people. Injectable estradiol preparations are recommended by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health Standards of Care 8 and the Endocrine Society guidelines. Many patients prefer this route of administration, but few studies have rigorously assessed optimal dosing or route.

Methods

We performed a scoping review of the available data on estradiol levels achieved with various dosages of estradiol injections in transgender and gender diverse adults on feminizing gender-affirming hormone therapy. We also report on testosterone suppression, route (ie, subcutaneous vs intramuscular), and type of injectable estradiol ester as well as timing of blood draw relative to the most recent dose, where available.

Results

The data we reviewed suggest that the current guidelines, which recommend starting doses 2 to 10 mg weekly or 5 to 30 mg every 2 weeks of estradiol cypionate or valerate, are too high and likely lead to patients having supraphysiologic levels across much of their injection cycle.

Conclusions

The optimal starting dose for injectable estradiol remains unclear and whether it should differ for cypionate and valerate. Based on the data available, we suggest that clinicians start injectable estradiol cypionate or valerate via subcutaneous or intramuscular injections at a dose ≤ 5 mg weekly and then titrate accordingly to keep levels within guideline-recommended range. Future studies should assess timing of injections and subsequent levels more precisely across the injection cycle and between esters.

AMPrEP is a prospective, open-label demonstration study conducted at the STI clinic of the Public Health Service of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Study design and procedures have been described in detail previously. Briefly, HIV-negative MSM and transgender persons aged 18 years or older who had sex with men were eligible for inclusion if they reported one of the following in the 6 months prior to inclusion: condomless anal sex (CAS) with casual partners, at least one bacterial STI, use of post-exposure prophylaxis after a sexual risk incident or an HIV-positive sexual partner with detectable viral load. Enrolment took place between 3 August 2015 and 31 May 2016 and follow-up is ongoing. All participants provided written informed consent.

The study was approved by the ethics board of the Academic Medical Center (Amsterdam, the Netherlands; NL49504·018·14) and is registered with the Netherlands Trial Registry, number NL5302.

HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) barriers and disparities: Although Black persons are estimated to account for approximately 40% of persons in the US with indications for PrEP, CDC data indicate that the number of White persons prescribed PrEP was approximately 5 times higher than the number of Black persons in 2019, and PrEP coverage was 60.5% among White persons vs 7.9% in Black persons and 13.8% in Hispanic/Latino persons. Black women were reported to be more than 4 times less likely to have initiated PrEP than White women. Disparities also include lower PrEP coverage in females than males and by age, being lower in persons aged 16 to 24 years than in those 25 years or older, with limited data suggesting lower use in transgender women than in men who have sex with men. Barriers include structural barriers such as lack of health insurance and personal factors such as a belief one is not a candidate or lack of willingness to take PrEP.

### Standards of care for the health of transgender and gender diverse people, version 8 [^116tMjRb]. International Journal of Transgender Health (2022). High credibility.

HIV prevention and antiretroviral therapy with gender-affirming hormone therapy — Statement 15.11: We recommend health care professionals counsel transgender and gender diverse people that the use of antiretroviral medications is not a contraindication to gender-affirming hormone therapy. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence is disproportionately high in TGD populations, with a recent large metanalysis reporting a global odds ratio for HIV infection of sixty-six for trans feminine individuals and 6.8 for trans masculine individuals. PCPs have unique opportunities to provide crucial education and implement prevention strategies, especially related to decreasing HIV burden among TGD people. There may be various misconceptions about the safety of taking gender-affirming hormones concurrently with antiretroviral therapy for HIV chemoprophylaxis or treatment, and direct study of antiretroviral/gender-affirming hormone therapy (ART/GAHT) interactions have been limited. A subanalysis of transgender women and trans feminine persons in the multinational iPrEx trial found poor effectiveness in this group in the intention-to-treat analysis, although effectiveness was similar to that in cisgender gay men among those transgender participants who adhered to the medication as prescribed, suggesting that uptake and adherence to PrEP remain challenging in this population. Two studies of the effects of GAHT on tenofovir diphosphate and on tenofovir diphosphate and emtricitabine found the significantly lowered ART drug levels were unlikely to be of clinical significance.

### How do you initiate oestrogen therapy in a girl who has not undergone puberty? [^115ExnfK]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

The physiology of puberty needs to be taken into consideration in the induction of puberty. Puberty is a relatively slow process and replacement therapy should mimic this. Long-term maintenance requires careful monitoring and long-term assessment of risk-benefit. This has not been appreciably defined in the adolescent population. Options for fertility need careful consideration and may depend on the adequacy of pubertal induction in terms of uterine development. A number of regimens are available for pubertal induction but the lack of comparisons makes it difficult to advocate for a particular regimen. There remain a number of areas of uncertainty, and future studies need to consider these issues and whether there are cardiovascular risk factor advantages to certain preparations. The long-term risks of breast and gynaecological malignancy remain uncertain. Long-term cohort studies are required to address these issues.
