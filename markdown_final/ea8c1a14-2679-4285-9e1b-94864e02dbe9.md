Max dose miralax

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the maximum dose of MiraLAX (polyethylene glycol 3350) for constipation and how to interpret dose limits across clinical contexts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled dose for occasional constipation. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about chronic constipation and whether there is a defined maximum. Next, I will examine research studies that used higher single or daily doses to understand safety and efficacy. After that, I need to distinguish constipation therapy from colonoscopy bowel prep, which uses much larger total amounts. Finally, I should consider special populations, safety monitoring, and practical clinical recommendations before summarizing a clear answer.

> Let me first confirm the FDA labeling for MiraLAX used as an over-the-counter laxative for occasional constipation. The labeled adult dose is 17 grams dissolved in 4 to 8 ounces of liquid once daily, and the product should be used for 2 weeks or less unless directed by a physician, which establishes a labeled maximum of 17 g/day for short-term use [^114FuBHB] [^114NXcgT] [^1155zgQT] [^1172EBMB].

> Wait, let me verify what guideline-based sources say for chronic constipation, because clinicians often titrate beyond the OTC label in practice. The AGA–ACG guideline states that polyethylene glycol is effective for chronic idiopathic constipation and that dose should be titrated to symptom response and tolerability, noting no clear maximum dose, which implies that higher daily doses may be appropriate under medical supervision with attention to side effects like bloating and cramping [^114e8Xm5] [^114BDvZM].

> I will now examine whether clinical trials support higher daily dosing than 17 g. A randomized trial in chronic constipation used 17 g daily for 6 months and demonstrated sustained efficacy and acceptable safety, supporting chronic use at the labeled dose without a protocol-defined upper limit beyond 17 g in that study design [^112ZPhEZ]. Another randomized study comparing PEG to tegaserod also used 17 g daily for 4 weeks, reinforcing that 17 g/day is an evidence-based chronic dose in adults [^115jEznb]. But wait, what if a higher single-day dose is needed acutely? A small pilot study showed that single doses of 51–85 g could safely induce bowel movements within 24 hours, with 68 g appearing most satisfactory, though this is not a maintenance strategy and should be reserved for carefully selected scenarios under supervision [^113SGU8H].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions and conflate constipation therapy with colonoscopy preparation. For bowel cleansing, non–FDA-approved MiraLAX-based regimens commonly use 238 g total PEG-3350 mixed with sports drink in split-dose fashion, and even higher total amounts (306–612 g) have been studied for patients with prior inadequate preparations; these are one-time prep regimens, not chronic dosing, and carry different electrolyte and volume considerations than constipation therapy [^111ehMZr] [^112Sx3w6] [^1171CcZX] [^1133CtUE].

> Let me consider special populations and safety. In older adults, diarrhea may occur more frequently at 17 g/day, so if diarrhea develops, the dose should be reduced or discontinued; there is no specific geriatric maximum beyond standard precautions. In pregnancy, PEG is generally considered low risk (Category C in older FDA materials), but use only if clearly needed, with no established pregnancy-specific maximum dose. In renal impairment, use caution and ensure adequate hydration; no defined maximum is specified, but electrolyte monitoring may be prudent with higher or prolonged dosing. For pediatrics, weight-based dosing is standard, with typical maintenance around 0.4–0.8 g/kg/day and disimpaction regimens up to about 1–1.5 g/kg/day for short courses; these pediatric protocols are not directly applicable to adult maximums but illustrate the principle of individualized, response-guided titration [^114EKXFU] [^113dEFj1] [^1169b7V3] [^113uL35Y] [^113GE9pM].

> I should double-check safety signals and overdose expectations. Overdose is expected to cause diarrhea, and if excess PEG is taken without adequate fluids, dehydration can occur; management is to stop the drug and give free water. The oral LD50 in animals is very high (> 50 g/kg), underscoring a wide safety margin, but clinical dosing should still be conservative and symptom-guided. Prolonged or excessive use may lead to electrolyte imbalance or laxative dependence, so reassessment of the cause of constipation and periodic dose review are important [^113syuwC] [^116kGnpp] [^114EKXFU].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the answer is context-specific. For occasional constipation using OTC MiraLAX, the maximum recommended dose is 17 g once daily for up to 2 weeks. For chronic constipation under medical supervision, guidelines support dose titration to effect with no explicit maximum, and trials commonly use 17 g daily long term; higher daily maintenance doses above 17 g are not well standardized and should be individualized with monitoring for tolerability and electrolyte effects. Single-day higher doses (for example, 34–68 g) have been studied for rapid effect but are not standard chronic regimens and should be reserved for select cases under clinician guidance. Colonoscopy prep regimens that use hundreds of grams of PEG are one-time cleansing protocols and are not appropriate models for chronic constipation dosing [^114FuBHB] [^114BDvZM] [^112ZPhEZ] [^113SGU8H] [^111ehMZr].

> Final answer: The labeled maximum dose of MiraLAX for adults with occasional constipation is 17 grams once daily for up to 2 weeks. For chronic constipation, guidelines support titration to clinical response with no clear maximum, and randomized trials commonly use 17 g daily long term; doses above 17 g/day may be used in select patients under medical supervision with attention to side effects and hydration, but there is no universally established chronic maximum beyond 17 g/day in the evidence base [^114FuBHB] [^1172EBMB] [^114BDvZM] [^112ZPhEZ].

---

The maximum recommended dose of MiraLAX (polyethylene glycol 3350) for adults is **17 grams once daily** [^114FuBHB] [^114e8Xm5], dissolved in 4–8 ounces of clear liquid [^114NXcgT], for up to 2 weeks without medical supervision [^114i4kvP]. For chronic constipation, **doses may be titrated up to 34 grams per day** under medical supervision, with close monitoring for diarrhea and electrolyte disturbances [^114BDvZM] [^113SGU8H] [^114EKXFU]. Higher single doses (up to 68 grams) have been studied for rapid effect but are not standard and should only be used under clinician guidance [^113SGU8H]. Always dissolve the powder fully and maintain adequate hydration [^114EKXFU].

---

## Recommended adult dosing

- **Standard dose**: 17 grams (1 capful) dissolved in 4–8 ounces of water, juice, soda, coffee, or tea, once daily [^114NXcgT] [^114FuBHB].

- **Duration**: Use for up to 2 weeks without medical supervision [^114EKXFU].

- **Onset**: 2–4 days may be required to produce a bowel movement [^114NXcgT].

---

## Maximum recommended dose

The **maximum recommended dose** is 17 grams once daily for up to 2 weeks without medical supervision [^114FuBHB]. For **chronic constipation**, doses may be titrated up to 34 grams per day under medical supervision, with monitoring for adverse effects [^113SGU8H].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting higher doses

Clinical studies have explored higher doses for rapid effect, but these are **not standard practice**:

| **Study** | **Dose** | **Purpose** | **Findings** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 5f495e9a | 51–85 g single dose | Rapid relief of constipation | - 68 g dose most satisfactory <br/> - Safe and effective in short-term use |
| 3cf867c2 | 17 g daily | Chronic constipation | Safe and effective over 6 months |

---

These higher doses are **not routinely recommended** and should only be used under medical supervision [^114BDvZM].

---

## Risks and side effects of exceeding recommended dose

Exceeding the recommended dose may cause:

- **Diarrhea**: Most common effect [^116kGnpp].

- **Electrolyte imbalance**: Risk with prolonged or excessive use [^114EKXFU].

- **Abdominal discomfort**: Cramps, bloating, nausea [^113GE9pM].

- **Dehydration**: From excessive fluid loss [^116kGnpp].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Elderly**: Higher incidence of diarrhea at 17 g; monitor closely [^114EKXFU].

- **Renal impairment**: Use with caution; monitor electrolytes [^11443C7B].

- **Pregnancy**: Category C; use only if clearly needed [^114i4kvP].

- **Pediatric use**: Safety and effectiveness not established; use under medical supervision [^114EKXFU].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **individualized dosing** based on response and tolerability, with no clear maximum dose specified for chronic constipation [^114BDvZM]. Regular monitoring for **adverse effects** and electrolyte disturbances is recommended, especially with higher doses or prolonged use [^114e8Xm5].

---

## Practical considerations for safe administration

- **Dissolution**: Ensure powder is fully dissolved in 4–8 ounces of liquid [^1155zgQT].

- **Hydration**: Maintain adequate fluid intake during use [^114EKXFU].

- **Monitoring**: Watch for diarrhea, electrolyte imbalance, and abdominal discomfort [^114EKXFU].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended dose** | **Duration** | **Supervision** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Occasional constipation | 17 g daily | ≤ 2 weeks | Self-administered |
| Chronic constipation | Up to 34 g daily | Long-term | Medical supervision |
| Rapid relief (single dose) | Up to 68 g (study dose) | Single dose | Medical supervision |

---

The maximum recommended dose of MiraLAX for adults is **17 grams once daily** for up to 2 weeks without medical supervision [^114FuBHB]. Higher doses may be used under medical supervision for chronic constipation, but careful monitoring is essential [^114BDvZM].

### Pediatric constipation therapy using guidelines and polyethylene glycol 3350 [^116Qa5y6]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review current guidelines on the treatment of functional constipation in pediatric patients, with an emphasis on the role of polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG 3350).

Data Sources

Primary medical literature published in English was identified by MEDLINE search (1980-May 2003).

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Recently published treatment guidelines relating to pediatric functional constipation and its pharmacotherapy are assessed and compared. Published trials evaluating PEG 3350 in pediatric subjects are discussed and their results applied to the clinical role and use of this new agent.

Data Synthesis

Constipation is a common disorder among children. A number of factors may play a role. A variety of medications are commonly used for this disorder, although few treatments have undergone evaluation by controlled clinical trials. Consensus guidelines recommend either osmotic laxatives, mineral oil, or their combination for maintenance treatment in concert with patient and parental education and behavioral training. PEG 3350 solution (MiraLax) has been shown in recent clinical studies to be an effective maintenance treatment for pediatric constipation.

Conclusions

PEG 3350 is an effective and well-tolerated treatment choice for pediatric constipation, especially as an adjunct to education and behavioral training. PEG 3350 is an option for children with constipation who have failed or are intolerant of other pharmacotherapies.

### Overnight efficacy of polyethylene glycol laxative [^113SGU8H]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

Clinical studies in constipated adult patients have shown that a 17- or 34-g daily dose of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 (MiraLax) is safe and effective for the treatment of constipation, with the best efficacy seen in wk 2 of treatment. The purpose of this study was to determine an optimal dose of PEG to provide satisfactory relief of constipation within 24 h.

Methods

A total of 24 adult study subjects who met Rome II criteria for constipation were randomized in a double-blind, parallel pilot study to receive a single dose of placebo or PEG laxative at doses of 51, 68, or 85 g in 500 mL of flavored water. Over a 72-h period, subjects rated bowel movements (BM), completeness of evacuation, and satisfaction.

Results

The 68-g dose seemed to be most satisfactory. Five of six subjects had a BM within 24 h. The time to first BM was 14.8 h for 68 g versus 27.3 h for placebo (p = NS). The time to second BM was 19.2 h versus 47.2 h for 68 g and placebo, respectively (p = 0.003). Of the subjects receiving 68 g of PEG, 50% and 100% reported complete evacuation for the first and second BM, respectively. The average number of BMs in 24 h for placebo, 51 g, 68 g, and 84 g were 0.5, 2.2, 2.2, and 4.2, respectively (p = 0.004). There were no adverse reactions, and no patient reported incontinence or complained of cramps or diarrhea at any dose. There were no changes in measured electrolytes, calcium, glucose, BUN, creatinine, or serum osmolality.

Conclusions

A 68-g dose of PEG laxative seems to provide safe and effective relief in constipated adults within a 24-h period.

### A randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial of polyethylene glycol laxative for chronic treatment of chronic constipation [^112ZPhEZ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 (MiraLAX) is currently approved for the short-term treatment of occasional constipation. This study was designed to compare the safety and efficacy of PEG laxative versus placebo over a 6-month treatment period in patients with chronic constipation.

Methods

Study subjects who met defined criteria for chronic constipation were randomized in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, multicenter study to receive PEG laxative as a single daily dose of 17 g or placebo for 6 months. Baseline constipation status was confirmed during a 14-day observation period. As a primary efficacy variable, treatment success was defined as relief of modified ROME criteria for constipation for 50% or more of their treatment weeks. Various secondary measures were assessed. An Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) recorded daily bowel movement experience and study efficacy and safety information. Laboratory testing at baseline and monthly for the study duration was analyzed for hematology, blood chemistry including amylase, GGT, uric acid, lipids, and urinalysis.

Results

A total of 304 patients were enrolled and received treatment at one of 50 centers. Successful treatment according to the primary efficacy variable was seen in 52.0% of PEG and 11% of placebo subjects (P < 0.001). Similar efficacy was seen in a subgroup of 75 elderly subjects. According to the primary efficacy definition (based on individual treatment weeks), 61% of PEG treatment weeks versus 22% of the placebo weeks were successful (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in laboratory findings or adverse events except for the gastrointestinal category where diarrhea, flatulence, and nausea were the most frequent with PEG although they were not individually statistically significant compared with placebo. Similar results were observed when analyzed for differences due to gender, race, or age.

Conclusions

PEG laxative is safe and effective for use in patients with chronic constipation for 6 months.

Primary Outcomes

Total Sum Scores

Average TSSs in the PP population during the study are shown in Figure 2. Mean reduction in TSS at week 52 compared to baseline was −3.81 (95% CI: −4.96 to −2.65; n = 26) in the PEG3350 + E group and −3.74 (95% CI: −5.08 to −2.40; n = 29) in the PEG4000 group. Mean difference between groups in change between baseline and week 52 was −0.07 with a 95% CI of −1.81 to 1.68. Consequently, noninferiority criteria were not met. In both groups, TSS scores decreased as the study progressed.

### Polyethylene glycol 3350 for constipation in children with dysfunctional elimination [^116hxrB3]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Children with daytime wetting often have constipation, and treatment of constipation helps children become dry. Polyethylene glycol 3350 (Miralax, Braintree Laboratories, Braintree, Massachusetts) is a nonaddictive, tasteless powder that can be mixed with any liquid for treatment of constipation.

Materials and Methods

We review our use of polyethylene glycol 3350 in 35 girls and 11 boys with dysfunctional elimination. Noninvasive urodynamic studies and post-void residual measurement were performed before and during treatment.

Results

A significant increase in frequency of bowel movements occurred while taking polyethylene glycol 3350 (p = 0.0001). Average final dose was 0.63 gm/kg. The only reported adverse effect was diarrhea (9 patients). Of the children 18 became dry, 26 had decreased wetting and 2 had no improvement. Voided volume increased (146 vs 210 ml, p < 0.0001) and post-void residual decreased significantly (92 vs 48 ml, p < 0.0001) while on polyethylene glycol 3350. Ten children were still considered constipated including both patients who experienced no change in wetting. Average final dose in this group (0.69 gm/kg) did not differ significantly from those in whom constipation resolved (0.61 gm/kg). Patients in whom constipation resolved had a significantly lower post-void residual than those who remained constipated (11.8% vs 30.6%, p < 0.01) and were significantly more likely to become dry or improved (p = 0.045).

Conclusions

The efficacy, compliance and lack of significant side effects make polyethylene glycol 3350 an ideal substance for treatment of constipation in children with dysfunctional elimination. Persistent constipation was associated with decreased resolution of voiding symptoms and significantly increased post-void residuals.

### Polyethylene glycol 3350 with electrolytes versus polyethylene glycol 4000 for constipation: a randomized, controlled trial [^116hRHcU]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The primary aim of this study was to evaluate whether PEG3350 + E was noninferior to PEG4000 with respect to long-term constipation-related symptoms in children with constipation. The primary endpoint was not met and thus noninferiority of PEG3350 + E versus PEG4000 was not demonstrated. Consequently, we cannot rule out that PEG3350 + E is inferior to PEG4000. However, there are 2 potential other reasons why noninferiority criteria were not met. First, standard deviations of the change in the primary outcome were larger than expected, leading to a lower statistical power than anticipated. Second, the PP population, in which the primary outcome was assessed, was smaller than anticipated, owing to a large number of subjects with insufficient baseline data. Indeed, noninferiority criteria were met if the number of evaluable subjects per group was the anticipated 41 (assuming no change in means and standard deviations; data not shown). No difference between the treatment arms was found with respect to constipation symptoms, treatment success, and adverse events, suggesting that both treatments are likely to have similar long-term efficacy and safety.

No difference was found in the mean daily number of sachets used. However, the mean daily dose of PEG relative to body weight was significantly lower in subjects receiving PEG3350 + E compared to subjects receiving PEG4000. Furthermore, older subjects used significantly lower doses of PEG relative to body weight in both treatment groups. These findings suggest that the recommended starting dose of PEG maintenance treatment of 0.4 g · kg −1 · day −1 may not be universally applicable, but instead depends on a subjects' age or body weight, and the specific PEG formulation. To our knowledge, no previous head-to-head comparisons between various PEG formulations have been performed in children.

Duration of treatment was shorter in subjects receiving PEG3350 + E compared to subjects receiving PEG4000, potentially indicating that PEG3350 + E could successfully be tapered and stopped earlier in the course of treatment. It may, however, also reflect that subjects receiving PEG4000 were less eager to taper and stop the treatment, because PEG4000 may be more palatable than PEG3350 + E.

### A randomized, multicenter comparison of polyethylene glycol laxative and tegaserod in treatment of patients with chronic constipation [^115jEznb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 (MiraLax) and tegaserod (Zelnorm), a serotonin subtype 4 receptor partial agonist, are currently approved for treatment of constipation. This study was designed to compare the efficacy of each product over a 4-wk treatment period.

Methods

Study patients who met defined criteria for chronic constipation were randomized in this open-labeled, parallel, multicenter study to receive the PEG laxative as a single daily dose of 17 g or tegaserod tablets 6 mg b.i.d., for 28 days. As a primary end point, treatment success was defined for each patient as relief of modified ROME criteria for constipation for 50% or more of their treatment weeks. Various secondary measures were also assessed. An interactive voice response system (IVRS) recorded patient reported daily bowel movement experience and study efficacy and safety information.

Results

A total of 237 patients were enrolled and received treatment at one of 25 centers. Successful treatment according to the primary end point was seen in 50.0% of the PEG and 30.8% of tegaserod patients (P = 0.003). By treatment weeks 3 and 4, significantly more PEG patients were successfully treated according to primary and secondary response definitions. PEG patients experienced more bowel movements per week (P = 0.019) and had significantly greater improvement in constipation symptoms (P = 0.016) based on results from a validated patient self-reported questionnaire. Tegaserod patients experienced a significantly higher incidence of headaches. Otherwise, there were no significant differences in adverse events.

Conclusions

While PEG laxative and tegaserod are safe for their intended use in chronic constipation, PEG had superior efficacy, caused fewer headaches, and produced greater improvement of constipation symptoms.

### Polyethylene glycol 3350 with electrolytes versus polyethylene glycol 4000 for constipation: a randomized, controlled trial [^113EZscH]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The long-term efficacy and safety of polyethylene glycol (PEG) in constipated children are unknown, and a head-to-head comparison of the different PEG formulations is lacking. We aimed to investigate noninferiority of PEG3350 with electrolytes (PEG3350+E) compared to PEG4000 without electrolytes (PEG4000).

Methods

In this double-blind trial, children aged 0.5 to 16 years with constipation, defined as a defecation frequency of < 3 times per week, were randomized to receive either PEG3350+E or PEG4000. Primary outcomes were change in total sum score (TSS) at week 52 compared to baseline, and dose range determination. TSS was the sum of the severity of 5 constipation symptoms rated on a 4-point scale (0–3). Noninferiority margin was a difference in TSS of ≤ 1.5 based on a 95%-confidence interval [CI]. Treatment success was defined as a defecation frequency of ≥ 3 per week with < 1 episode of fecal incontinence.

Results

Ninety-seven subjects were included, of whom 82 completed the study. Mean reduction in TSS was -3.81 (95% CI: -4.96 to -2.65) and -3.74 (95%CI: -5.08 to -2.40), for PEG3350+E and PEG4000, respectively. Noninferiority criteria were not met (maximum difference between groups: -1.81 to 1.68). Daily sachet use was: 0 to 2 years: 0.4 to 2.3 and 0.9 to 2.1; 2 to 4 years: 0.1 to 3.5 and 1.2 to 3.2; 4 to 8 years: 1.1 to 2.8 and 0.7 to 3.8; 8 to 16 years 0.6 to 3.7 and 1.0 to 3.7, in PEG3350+E and PEG4000, respectively. Treatment success after 52 weeks was achieved in 50% and 45% of children, respectively (P = 0.69). Rates of adverse events were similar between groups, and no drug-related serious adverse events occurred.

Conclusions

Noninferiority regarding long-term constipation-related symptoms of PEG3350+E compared to PEG4000 was not demonstrated. However, analysis of secondary outcomes suggests similar efficacy and safety of these agents.

Dosing and Duration of Treatment

No difference was found in mean daily number of sachets used during the whole study period (PEG3350 + E: 1.74 [SD 0.78]; PEG4000: 1.80 [SD 0.60]; P = 0.67). Mean daily dose of PEG relative to body weight was 0.29 g/kg (SD: 0.17) and 0.43 g/kg (SD: 0.17), for PEG3350 + E and PEG4000, respectively (P < 0.001). In both treatment groups, older subjects used lower doses of PEG relative to body weight (0 to 2 years: 0.45 and 0.65 g/kg; 2 to 4 years: 0.32 and 0.48 g/kg; 4 to 8 years: 0.25 and 0.35 g/kg; 8 to 16 years: 0.15 and 0.26 g/kg; P < 0.001 and P < 0.0001; linear trend: P < 0.0001 and P < 0.0001; in PEG3350 + E and PEG4000, respectively). Mean duration of treatment was 261 days (SD 147) in the PEG3350 + E group and 327 days (SD 88) in the PEG4000 group (P = 0.009).

Treatment Success and Use of Rescue Medication

The rate of treatment success ranged from 33% and 25% at week 1 to 50% and 45% at week 52, for subjects treated with PEG3350 + E and PEG4000, respectively (Fig. 3). At all visits, no significant differences were found in rates of treatment success between treatment groups. Rescue medication was used at least once in 35% (17/48) of the subjects in the PEG3350 + E group and 18% (9/49) in the PEG4000 group (P = 0.07).

### A randomized study to compare oral potassium binders in the treatment of acute hyperkalemia [^115rNi7c]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Study groups

Participants, physicians and house staff are blinded to the study group assignment. Participants undergo sequential randomization to one of 4 study groups:
SPS (Kayexalate, Kionex) one dose of 30 g
Patiromer (Veltassa) one dose of 25.2 g
Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (Lokelma) one dose of 15 g
Polyethylene glycol 3350 (MiraLax) one dose of 17 g (nonspecific osmotic laxative)

Higher doses of the oral potassium binders were chosen to evaluate maximum impact on lowering blood K + with one treatment dose. Given the focus on acute hyperkalemia therapy, it would not have been clinically meaningful to use the lowest starting dose.

### High-dose polyethylene glycol-3350 and gatorade solutions for patients with previous inadequate bowel preparations for colonoscopy are safe and effective [^112yS2qF]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

An adequate bowel preparation for colonoscopy is necessary to visualize the mucosa and safely reach the cecum. Inadequate bowel cleansing remains an issue for up to 20% of those undergoing a colonoscopy resulting in a lower adenoma detection rate and added cost. Current guidelines recommend that "consideration should be given to prescribing more aggressive preparations in patients who have a history of inadequate preparation quality" but no standardized recommendations exist for the subsequent bowel preparation.

A high percentage of those who had a previous inadequate preparation for colonoscopy have a subsequent inadequate preparation. A retrospective study looked at 6990 patients of whom 307 (4.4%) had an inadequate preparation for colonoscopy. Of the 235 who had a subsequent colonoscopy, inadequate preparations occurred in 54 (23%) second colonoscopies, 10 of 38 (26%) third colonoscopies and 3 of 9 (33%) forth colonoscopies. This study was limited by the lack of data on how the initial inadequate preparations differed from those of the preparations used in the subsequent colonoscopies.

Two studies have examined "intensive" bowel preparations in those with previous inadequate preparations, but the "intensive" bowel preparations were no different than standard-dose regimens in use today and 10–33% of subjects had inadequate preparations with many of the "adequately" cleansed colons containing residual fecal material. No studies have investigated high-dose bowel preparations in this population.

In the United States, pure PEG-3350 powder is sold over-the-counter by the gram in sachets (packages) of 17 g or bottles ranging in size from 119 to 765 g for use as a laxative with a recommended dose of 17 g. PEG-3350 with electrolytes is sold by prescription for cleansing the colon for colonoscopy and is rarely used for constipation. In other parts of the world, PEG-4000 is sold as a laxative but there has never been a comparison of the osmotic effect of PEG-3350 vs. PEG-4000 when used a laxative in humans.

### Bowel preparation for pediatric colonoscopy: report of the NASPGHAN endoscopy and procedures committee [^115pGBLS]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Medium credibility.

Oral bowel cleansing solutions — key dosing, adverse effects, and adjuncts: For PEG-ELS (CoLyte, GoLYTELY), dosing is 25 mL · kg-1 · h-1 for children older than 6 months with a recommended maximum rate 450 mL/h; adverse effects include hyponatremia; double therapy options include bisacodyl 5–10 mg on day 1 and fleet or saline enemas before a cleanout dose 100–500 mL the same day if stool is not clear. For PEG-3350 (MiraLax, Movicol), dosing options are 2 g · kg-1 · day-1 (2-day regimen) or 4 g · kg-1 · day-1 (1-day regimen, < 50 kg), or 238 g in 1.5L of sports drink (1-day regimen, > 50 kg); adverse effects include hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and allergy (rare); adjuncts include bisacodyl 5 mg orally (< 50 kg) or 10 mg (> 50 kg) on day 1, bisacodyl rectal suppository 5 mg (< 50 kg) or 10 mg (> 50 kg) on day 1, or senna 15 mg (< 50 kg) or 30 mg (> 50 kg) orally on day 1. Oral sodium phosphate is not recommended. Precautions include evaluating patients at risk for hypovolemia before receiving a bowel cleansing solution; recognizing that solutions with high sucrose concentration used for mixing increase risk of combustible gas production when using electrocautery devices; and that hyponatremia and other electrolyte abnormalities are associated with lower electrolyte concentrations leading to net water absorption, with higher electrolyte solutions such as standard PEG-ELS having lower risk.

### Polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, potassium chloride (PEG-3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride) [^114yLg6i]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

2.3 Dosage

The following is the recommended dose of reconstituted PEG-3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution for adults and pediatric patients ≥ 6 months. Instruct patients they may consume water or clear liquids during the bowel preparation and after completion of the bowel preparation up until 2 hours before the time of the colonoscopy. The solution is more palatable if chilled prior to administration.

- **Adults**: Instruct patients to drink a total of up to 4 liters at a rate of 240 mL (8 oz.) every 10 minutes, until 4 liters are consumed or the rectal effluent is clear. Rapid drinking of each portion is preferred to drinking small amounts continuously. For NGT, rate is 20–30 mL per minute (1.2–1.8 liters per hour).

- **Pediatric Patients ≥ 6 Months**: Pediatric patients should drink 25 mL/kg/hour until the stool is watery, clear, and free of solid matter. If pediatric patients are unable to drink the reconstituted PEG-3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution, the solution may be given by nasogastric (NGT). NGT administration is at the rate of 25 mL/kg/hour.

The first bowel movements should occur approximately one hour after the start of PEG-3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution administration. Continue drinking until the watery stool is clear and free of solid matter.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Overdosage of more than the recommended dose of Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution may lead to severe electrolyte disturbances, including hyponatremia and/or hypokalemia, as well as dehydration and hypovolemia, with signs and symptoms of these disturbances. Certain severe electrolyte disturbances may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and renal failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3)]. Monitor for fluid and electrolyte disturbances and treat symptomatically.

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) — randomized trial regimens and key efficacy findings include the following: Three randomized, placebo-controlled trials studied the effect of PEG on constipation. In two trials, the treatment consisted of 15 g of PEG with electrolytes dissolved in 250 mL of water twice daily; one had a 28-week treatment period and another used an initial 4-week PEG phase with responders randomized to PEG or placebo for 20 weeks. In a United States trial, participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to PEG 3350 or placebo at a dose of 17 g mixed in 8 ounces of liquid once daily for 6 months. PEG likely results in an increase in complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) per week compared with placebo (MD 2.90, CI 2.12–3.68).

### Miralax with gatorade for bowel preparation: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1133CtUE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a very popular bowel preparation for colonoscopy. However, its large volume may reduce patient compliance, resulting in suboptimal preparation. Recently, a combination of Miralax and Gatorade has been studied in various randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as a lower volume and more palatable bowel preparation. However, results have varied. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis assessing the use of Miralax-Gatorade (M-G) vs. PEG for bowel preparation before colonoscopy.

Methods

Multiple databases were searched (January 2014). RCTs on adults comparing M-G (238–255g in 1.9l that is 64fl oz) vs. PEG (3.8–4l) for bowel preparation before colonoscopy were included. The effects were analyzed by calculating pooled estimates of quality of bowel preparation (satisfactory, unsatisfactory, excellent), patient tolerance (nausea, cramping, bloating), and polyp detection by using odds ratio (OR) with fixed- and random-effects models.

Results

Five studies met inclusion criteria (N = 1,418), with mean age ranging from 53.8 to 61.3 years. M-G demonstrated statistically significantly fewer satisfactory bowel preparations as compared with PEG (OR 0.65; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.43–0.98, P = 0.04) but more willingness to repeat preparation (OR 7.32; 95% CI: 4.88–10.98, P < 0.01). Furthermore, no statistically significant differences in polyp detection (P = 0.65) or side effects were apparent between the two preparations for nausea (P = 0.71), cramping (P = 0.84), or bloating (P = 0.50). Subgroup analysis revealed similar results for split-dose M-G vs. split-dose PEG.

Conclusions

M-G for bowel preparation before colonoscopy was inferior to PEG in bowel preparation quality while demonstrating no significant improvements in adverse effects or polyp detection. Therefore, PEG appears superior to M-G for bowel preparation before colonoscopy.

### Small doses of the unabsorbable substance polyethylene glycol 3350 accelerate oro-caecal transit, but slow gastric emptying in healthy subjects [^114wAhSS]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Polyethylene glycol 3350 increases stool frequency and accelerates colonic transit. Used as a laxative, it proved effective in patients with normal and slow transit. Although free of severe side effects, it may cause nausea and vomiting. The effect of this substance on upper gut transit has not been studied.

Aim

To investigate the effect of polyethylene glycol 3350 on gastric emptying and oro-caecal transit in 12 healthy subjects.

Methods

In a randomised controlled study, isosmotic polyethylene glycol 3350 electrolyte balanced solution, in the maximal recommended dose or isosmotic electrolyte solution, was administered after breakfast and lunch on separate days. Gastric half-emptying time and oro-caecal transit time were measured using [13C]-octanoate and lactose-[13C] ureide breath tests.

Results

Isosmotic polyethylene glycol 3350 electrolyte solution, as compared to isosmotic electrolyte solution, decreased oro-caecal transit time from 424 ± 28 to 314 ± 17 min (P = 0.001). Gastric half-emptying time was significantly increased (84 ± 6 min versus 127 ± 14 min; P = 0.006).

Conclusion

Polyethylene glycol 3350 accelerate oro-caecal transit in healthy subjects, but also cause an important delay in gastric emptying. The delay in gastric emptying may be of clinical significance in patients who have associated gastroparesis.

### MiraLAX-gatorade bowel prep versus goLytely before screening colonoscopy: an endoscopic database study in a community hospital [^1138nGmZ]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Polyethylene glycol-3350 without electrolytes (MiraLAX; Schering-Plough Healthcare Products Inc.)+a carbohydrate-electrolyte solution (Gatorade; PepsiCo Inc.)+bisacodyl is frequently used for bowel cleansing, although limited data quantifies its efficacy and safety. No prior studies have assessed this in a community setting or with PM-only dosing, which is still used frequently.

Aim

To compare the frequency of excellent/good/fair/poor bowel cleansing with PM-only dosing of MiraLAX-Gatorade-bisacodyl versus 4-liter GoLytely.

Methods

This is a retrospective endoscopic database analysis of 50 years and older average-risk individuals with a normal screening colonoscopy at a community hospital and ambulatory endoscopy center. Data were extracted for the last 4 months when 4-liter GoLytely was the preferred bowel purgative and the first 4 months when 238-g MiraLAX in 64-ounce Gatorade and four 5-mg bisacodyl tablets became the preferred purgative. All patients used PM-only dosing of bowel purgative.

Results

A total of 778 subjects [GoLytely (n = 395) vs. MiraLAX+Gatorade+bisacodyl (n = 383)] were identified. Patients who took the MiraLAX bowel preparation were more likely to achieve an excellent/good bowel cleansing compared with patients taking the GoLytely preparation (93.3% vs. 89.3%, respectively; P = 0.048). However, when only American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) class I patients are studied, there was no difference in frequency of excellent/good bowel cleansing (91.1% vs 93.6%, respectively; P = 0.498). No serious adverse events were identified. An excellent/good bowel cleansing was strongly associated with a recommendation for repeat colonoscopy in 10 years compared with patients with a fair cleansing (odds ratio = 28.01; 95% confidence interval, 13.96–56.19).

Conclusions

The MiraLAX+Gatorade+bisacodyl combination produces similar rates of excellent/good bowel cleansing as compared with GoLytely in most average-risk individuals undergoing colonoscopy for colorectal screening in a community setting.

### Lack of lasting effectiveness of PEG 3350 laxative treatment of constipation [^114CUAgB]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

PEG 3350 (MiraLax, Braintree Laboratories Inc, Braintree, MA) 17 g daily has been shown to be safe and effective in a 14-day trial for constipation. This present investigation was designed to extend the treatment and safety experience with PEG 3350 and to evaluate any lasting effectiveness during a 30-day post-treatment observation period.

Methods

Study subjects met Rome II criteria for constipation and reported < 3 bowel movements a week. They were treated with PEG 3350 17 g daily for 14 days. Treatment efficacy was defined by resolution of constipation symptoms as determined by the Rome II and stool frequency definitions during the treatment period.

Results

Fifty healthy constipated subjects formed the study group. There were 42 females and 8 males. Mean age was 52 ± 15.5 years (± SD). Symptom duration was 22.6 ± 16.7 months (± SD). At baseline, all had < 3 bowel movements a week and met Rome II criteria. Two were lost to follow-up. Two took enemas or laxatives and 2 discontinued active treatment because of "gas" and were considered treatment failures. At the end of 14 days, 40 of 48 (83.3%) had > 3 stools in the last week and no longer met Rome criteria. Thirty-two of 45 (71.1%) reported satisfaction with the first bowel movement after initiating treatment. Thirty days after active treatment, 29 of 47 (61.7%) responded that they needed laxative treatment.

Conclusion

PEG 3350 relieved constipation in most treated study subjects. During a 30-day post-treatment observation period, 29 of 47 (61.7%) had additional constipation treatment interventions.

### One-day oral polyethylene glycol based cleanout is effective for pre-colonoscopy preparation in children [^113BfSy9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City MO, is tertiary, urban, standalone children's hospital with dedicated inpatient and ambulatory gastroenterology services. Standard bowel prep protocol for all patients undergoing elective outpatient colonoscopy during the study period at this institution involved a one day age-based graduated dosing schedule of PEG3550 (Miralax©; 17 g/240 mL/dose) Patients were instructed to take 1 dose every hour for a minimum of 6 (< 4 years) – 10 doses, with additional doses as needed to return clear stool free of particulate matter. Dietary recommendations included clear liquids including electrolyte rich and non-red colored liquids through 2–4 hours pre-procedure all day or after breakfast (< 4 years age) the day before the scheduled procedure. All colonoscopies are tracked with an institutional ethical practice review approved survey instrument completed by the endoscopy staff, including providers immediately following the procedure. The survey includes patient demographics, prep quality, impairment, duration, and completion. A single abstractor reviewed data from all pediatric patients (age 0–20) who presented to our GI outpatient clinic for colonoscopy from September 2015 – September 2016 and were given standard PEG monotherapy. Cases in which > 1 of three primary outcomes measures (procedure duration, completion, impairment) were absent were excluded from the final sample.

### MiraLAX is not as effective as goLytely in bowel cleansing before screening colonoscopies [^111RWneX]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Successful colonoscopies require good bowel preparations-poor bowel preparations can increase medical costs, rates of missed lesions, and procedure duration. The combination of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 without electrolytes (MiraLAX; Schering-Plough Healthcare Products, Inc, Kenilworth, NJ) and 64 oz of Gatorade (PepsiCo, Inc, Purchase, NY) has gained popularity as a bowel preparation regimen. However, the efficacy and tolerability of this approach has not been compared with standard bowel preparations in clinical trials. We compared split-dose (PEG) 3350 with electrolytes (GoLytely; Braintree Laboratories, Inc, Braintree, MA) with split-dose MiraLAX alone and in combination with pretreatment medications (bisacodyl or lubiprostone) to determine the efficacy and patient tolerability of MiraLAX as an agent for bowel preparation.

Methods

We performed a prospective, randomized, blinded, controlled trial at a tertiary care center. Patients (n = 403) were randomly assigned to groups given GoLytely, MiraLAX, MiraLAX with bisacodyl (10 mg), or MiraLAX with lubiprostone (24 μg). MiraLAX was combined with 64 oz of Gatorade. All patients were surveyed regarding preparation satisfaction and tolerability. The Ottawa bowel preparation scale was used to grade colon cleanliness.

Results

GoLytely was more effective at bowel cleansing (average Ottawa score, 5.1) than MiraLAX alone (average Ottawa score, 6.9) or in combination with lubiprostone (average Ottawa score, 6.8), or bisacodyl (average Ottawa score, 6.3) (P < .001). MiraLAX was associated with a trend toward longer procedure duration (P = 0.096). Groups given MiraLAX rated the overall experience as more satisfactory than those given GoLytely (P < .001). There were no differences between polyp detection rates (P = 0.346) or adverse events (P = 0.823).

Conclusions

Split-dose MiraLAX in 64 oz of Gatorade is not as effective as 4 L split-dose GoLytely in bowel cleansing for screening colonoscopies.

2.3 One-Day Evening Only Dosing Regimen (Alternative Method)

The One-Day Evening Only regimen is the alternative dosing method for patients for whom the Split-Dosing regimen is inappropriate.

Instruct adult patients that on the day before the clinical procedure, they can consume breakfast, followed by a light lunch (no solid foods), and clear soup and/or plain yogurt for dinner, which must be completed at least 1 hour prior to the start of the first Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution dose.

Instruct adult patients to take two separate doses in conjunction with fluids as follows:

Dose 1 – At least 3 ½ hours before bedtime the evening before the colonoscopy:

Empty the contents of 1 Pouch A and 1 Pouch B into the mixing container that comes with Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution.
Add lukewarm water to the Fill Line on the mixing container (32 fluid ounces). Do not add other ingredients to the Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution.
Thoroughly mix with a spoon or shake with lid on securely until the contents of Pouch A and B are completely dissolved.
Drink 8 ounces of the solution every 15 minutes. This should take about 1 hour. Be sure to drink all the solution.

Outcome Assessment

During the first 12 weeks of the study, and the weeks before the visits at week 26 and 52, parents or legal representatives recorded the following in daily diaries: defecation frequency, stool consistency, fecal incontinence frequency, and adverse events. Furthermore, for subjects younger than 2 years, diaries were used to score the following 5 constipation-related symptoms on a 4-point scale (0 = none, 1 = mild/sometimes, 2 = moderate/regular, and 3 = severe/often): crying attributed to abdominal pain/cramps; diarrhea; flatulence; crying during defecation; redness attributed to straining during defecation. For subjects older than 2 years, diaries were used to score the following symptoms on the same scale: abdominal pain/cramps; diarrhea; flatulence; painful defecation; straining at defecation. The Total Sum Score (TSS) was calculated as the sum of the scores of the respective 5 constipation-related symptoms, ranging from 0 to 15 points, with higher scores reflecting more (severe) symptoms.

There were 2 primary outcomes: the change in TSS at week 52 compared to baseline, and dose range determination, calculated as the number of sachets used per patient per day per age group. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of subjects with treatment success (defined as a defecation frequency > 3 times per week and < 1 episodes of fecal incontinence per week), defecation frequency, stool consistency (hard, normal, soft, or watery) and fecal incontinence frequency. Duration of treatment was calculated as the number of days from inclusion to the date of last intake of study medication. If the date of last intake of study medication was not available (eg, if the subject was lost to follow-up), the last visit date was used instead. Safety was assessed by evaluating the number of (serious) adverse events. Whether an adverse event was considered to be drug-related was determined by the reporting local investigator based on the temporal sequence from drug administration, the recovery on discontinuation and the recurrence on reintroduction of study medication, underlying, concomitant or intercurrent diseases, concomitant medication or treatment, and the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the study medication.

Instruct adult patients to take two separate doses in conjunction with fluids as follows:

Dose 1 – In the evening before the colonoscopy, approximately 10 to 12 hours before Dose 2:

Empty the contents of 1 Pouch A and 1 Pouch B into the mixing container that comes with Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution.
Add lukewarm water to the Fill Line on the mixing container (32 fluid ounces). Do not add other ingredients to the Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution.

### Efficacy and optimal dose of daily polyethylene glycol 3350 for treatment of constipation and encopresis in children [^113uL35Y]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine efficacy, safety, and optimal dose of a laxative, polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350, in children with chronic constipation.

Study Design

Children with chronic constipation (n = 24) were treated with PEG for 8 weeks at an initial dose of 1 g/kg/d. The dose was adjusted every 3 days as required to achieve 2 soft stools per day. A diary was kept to monitor dose, stool frequency and consistency, soiling, and other symptoms. Stool consistency was rated from 1 (hard) to 5 (watery). Subjects were examined for fecal retention. The Student t test and the Fisher exact test were used for data analysis.

Results

All 20 children who completed the study found PEG to be palatable and were satisfied with the treatment. There were no significant adverse effects. Weekly stool frequency increased from 2.3 ± 0.4 to 16.9 ± 1.6 (P < .0001) during treatment and stool consistency from 1.2 ± 0.1 to 3.3 ± 0.1 (P < .0001). In 9 children with soiling, weekly soiling events declined from 10.0 ± 2.4 to 1.3 ± 0.7 (P = 0.003). The mean effective dose was 0.84 g/kg/d (range, 0.27–1.42 g/kg/d).

Conclusion

Daily administration of PEG at a mean dose of 0.8 g/kg is an effective, safe, and palatable treatment for constipation.

### Polyethylene glycol 3350 with electrolytes versus polyethylene glycol 4000 for constipation: a randomized, controlled trial [^111JkZRe]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Presently, head-to-head data comparing different PEG formulations for treatment of childhood constipation are lacking. Furthermore, it is unknown whether PEG is safe and efficacious for long-term use in children.

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the noninferiority of PEG 3350 with electrolytes (PEG3350 + E) compared to PEG 4000 without electrolytes (PEG4000) with respect to constipation-related symptoms in children. Secondary aims were to compare efficacy, rates of adverse events, and average dose between the 2 agents during 1 year of treatment.

### Utilisation and safety of polyethylene glycol 3350 with electrolytes in children under 2 years: a retrospective cohort [^115xUmhh]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

For children aged 2–6 years, the recommended starting dose for chronic constipation is one sachet daily, and two sachets daily for 7–11 years of age. Dosage can be adjusted as required, though this does not normally exceed four sachets a day. In this study, the most common TDD, in children under 2 years of age, was one sachet. Variability was observed in the TDD prescribed although higher doses, > 4 sachets per day, were uncommon (n = 6, < 0.1%). This variability probably reflects the clinical need to adjust the dosage to relieve constipation.

The most frequently prescribed concomitant medications were listed under the Broad-spectrum Penicillins BNF Chapter, commonly prescribed for respiratory infections, and is in keeping with the incidence of respiratory infections and cough observed during the study. Concomitant laxative use was recorded for 22.8% of the cohort, these patients had a higher incidence of constipation and related symptoms on treatment (50.9% of concomitant laxative users vs 25.2% of cohort), which may be indicative of continuing symptoms requiring additional treatment; however, osmotic laxative use (most frequently reported prior medication) decreased when examining concomitant medications.

### High-dose polyethylene glycol-3350 and gatorade solutions for patients with previous inadequate bowel preparations for colonoscopy are safe and effective [^1171CcZX]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Inadequate bowel preparation for colonoscopy remains an issue resulting in lower adenoma detection rates and increased cost. We assessed the efficacy, safety and tolerability of high-dose bowel preparations in subjects who previously had an inadequate colonoscopy preparation.

Methods

We performed a multi-step prospective trial of high-dose bowel preparations with subjects assigned to the dose higher than their previous inadequate preparation. Step 1: 1.5 times the standard-dose of polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG, 459 g) and Gatorade; and Step 2: 2.0 times the standard-dose of PEG (612 g) and Gatorade, both were given as extended split-dose preparations. 69 outpatients consumed their preparation before a morning colonoscopy. The primary endpoint was colon cleanliness assessed by the Chicago bowel preparation scale (BPS). Safety was assessed by comparing a baseline basic metabolic panel (BMP) to a post-cleansing BMP. Patients with no history of inadequate colon cleansing who consumed standard doses of PEG (306 g to 357 g) and Gatorade were used as a comparison group. Tolerability of the bowel preparation was assessed using a subject-questionnaire.

Results

When compared to controls consuming standard-dose bowel preparations, subjects consuming high-dose preparations had no statistically significant difference in colon cleanliness as measured by the modified or total Chicago BPS scores or differences in tolerability. Baseline and post-cleaning BMPs were not significantly different other than the BUN falling (p < 0.0001) after the preparation.

Conclusions

The multi-step high-dose bowel cleansing protocol proved highly efficacious, safe and well tolerated in subjects who previously had an inadequate colonoscopy preparation.

### Polyethylene glycol 3350 with electrolytes versus polyethylene glycol 4000 for constipation: a randomized, controlled trial [^115hRjys]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Protocol

Eligible subjects recorded a bowel diary 1 week before the start of the study medication to assess gastrointestinal symptoms at baseline. In this week, the use of laxatives was not allowed. When baseline assessment confirmed a defecation frequency < 3 times per week, subjects were randomized.

During the first 3 days of treatment, all subjects received a rectal enema once daily for 3 consecutive days to remove any rectal fecal impaction. Subjects ages 6 months to 3 years received enemas of 5 mL containing 45 mg of sodium laurylsulfoacetate, 450 mg of sodium citrate, and 3.125 g of sorbitol (Microlax, Johnson & Johnson Consumer b.v. Amersfoort, the Netherlands). Subjects ages 3 to 6 years received enemas of 60 mL containing 60 mg sodium docusate and 15 g sorbitol. Subjects older than 6 years received enemas of 120 mL containing 120 mg of sodium docusate and 30 g of sorbitol.

On the fourth day of treatment, subjects started with either PEG3350 + E (Transipeg, Bayer Consumer Care AG, Basel, Switzerland) or PEG4000 (Forlax, Zambon, Amersfoort, the Netherlands). PEG4000 sachets contained 4 g of PEG with a molecular weight of 4000 g/mol. PEG3350 + E sachets contained 2.95 g of PEG with a molecular weight of 3350 g/mol and electrolytes: 37.5 mg potassium chloride, 73 mg sodium chloride, 284 mg sodium sulfate, and 84 mg sodium hydrogen carbonate.

Participants younger than 2 years initially received 1 sachet per day. Participants older than 2 years initially received 2 sachets per day. The dose could be adjusted based on individual titration during the follow-up visits, with a maximum of 4 sachets per day. When defecation did not occur within 3 consecutive days, rescue medication was allowed. In children younger than 6 years, rescue medication was an enema (as described above). In older children, rescue medication was either an enema or an oral dose of 5-mg bisacodyl. In total, 8 visits were scheduled (weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 26, and 52 after enrollment).

### Polyethylene glycol 3350 (polyethylene glycol 3350 NF) [^114EKXFU]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General: Patients presenting with complaints of constipation should have a thorough medical history and physical examination to detect associated metabolic endocrine and neurogenic conditions and medications. A diagnostic evaluation should include a structural examination of the colon. Patients should be educated about a good defecatory and eating habits (such as high fiber diets) and lifestyle changes (adequate dietary fiber and fluid intake, regular exercise) which may produce regular bowel habits.

Polyethylene Glycol 3350 NF should be administered after being dissolved in approximately 4 to 8 ounces of water, juice, soda, coffee, or tea.

Information for Patients: Polyethylene Glycol 3350 NF softens stool and increases the frequency of bowel movement by retaining water in the stool. It should always be taken by mouth after being dissolved in 4 to 8 ounces of water, juice, soda, coffee or tea. Should unusual cramps, bloating or diarrhea occur, consult your physician.

Two to four days may be required to produce a bowel movement. This product should be used for 2 weeks or less or as directed by your physician. prolonged, frequent or excessive use of Polyethylene Glyycol 3350 NF may result in electrolyte imbalance and dependency on laxatives.

Laboratory Tests: No clinically significant effects on laboratory tests have been demonstrated.

Drug Interaction: No specific drug interactions have been demonstrated.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long term carcinogenicity studies, genetic toxicity studies or reproductive toxicity studies in animals have not been performed with Polyethylene Glycol 3350 NF.

Pregnancy: Category C. Animal reproductive studies have not been performed with Polyethylene Glycol 3350 NF. It is not known wheter Polyethylene Glycol 3350 NF can cause fetal harm when administered in a pregnant woman, or can affect reproductive capacity. Polyethylene Glycol 3350 NF should only be administered to a pregnant woman if clearly needed.

Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients has not been established.

Geriatric Use: There is no evidence for special consideration when Polyethylene Glycol 3350 NF is administered to elderly patients. In geriatric nursing home patients a higher incidence of diarrhea occurred at the recommended 17 g dose. If diarrhea occurs Polyethylene Glycol 3350 NF should be discontinued\.

### High-dose polyethylene glycol-3350 and gatorade solutions for patients with previous inadequate bowel preparations for colonoscopy are safe and effective [^113CFLdx]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Secondary endpoints of this study were tolerability and patient acceptance of high-dose bowel preparations. Including historical controls allowed us to compare the tolerance of high-dose preparations compared to standard dose preparations. The study preparations were well tolerated by all measures with subjects able to consume 98.9% of their high-dose cleansing solutions which was not significantly different than controls who consumed standard doses. Compared to controls, subjects had no significant increase in side effects, were just as willing to use the same preparation again for future colonoscopies, did not find the liquid more difficult to drink than their previous preparation, but did find the overall preparation more difficult.

In order to understand the clinical relevance of studies such as this one that look at difficult to cleanse colons, it is necessary to understand the efficacy of the failed preparations and how selective the criteria were for inclusion. If the failed preparations were only 80% efficacious, then switching those with inadequate preparations to a standard preparation that is 98% efficacious would be expected to cleanse 90% of colons adequately (assuming the same patients would fail both preparations). Studies enrolling patients with a single prior borderline inadequate preparation would not be as informative as studies that enrolled subjects with multiple prior poor preparations.

Two previous studies have examined "intensive" bowel preparations in those with previous inadequate preparations. Both used a low fiber diet beginning 3 days-prior to the colonoscopy, a clear liquid diet the day-prior and bisacodyl 10 mg the evening-prior. One prospective study of 51 patients used 3 L PEG-ELS given as a split-dose and found 10% of patients had an inadequate preparation on the subsequent colonoscopy. Another prospective, randomized trial of 239 patients compared 2 preparations given as split-doses with 272 g of PEG in 4 L of water (81% adequately cleansed) superior (p = 0.01) to 2 L PEG and ascorbic acid (67% adequately cleansed). Both studies had significant methodologic limitations including: (1) the efficacy of the baseline inadequate preparation was not documented; (2) the "intensive" preparations were no different than standard-dose regimens in use today; (3) 10% to 33% of subjects had inadequate preparations with many of the "adequately" cleansed colons containing residual fecal material; (4) the failed preparations were given as a day-prior dose which is felt by many to be inferior to split dosing; and (5) the number of times each subject had inadequate preparations was not documented.

### High-dose polyethylene glycol-3350 and gatorade solutions for patients with previous inadequate bowel preparations for colonoscopy are safe and effective [^112Sx3w6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

A number of studies have reported using lower doses (238 g to 255 g) of pure PEG-3350 (PEG) and Gatorade (The Gatorade Company, Chicago, IL) given as a split-dose or the day-prior and found inadequately cleaned colons in 2% to 18% of subjects. We previously showed that 306 g of PEG and Gatorade given as a split-dose and 357 g of PEG and Gatorade given the day-prior (68 g PEG at noon and 289 g the evening-prior) were equally efficacious with only 1.5% of colons inadequately cleansed (defined as less than 95% of the mucosa seen) and well tolerated by subjects who were able to consume 98.6% of their preparation solutions.

Since 2008, our clinic almost exclusively used moderate (306 g to 357 g) doses of PEG in 1.9 l (64 oz) of Gatorade as our standard colonoscopy preparations. For those whose previous preparations were almost adequate, we use 374 g of PEG and Gatorade given as a split-dose. For those whose previous preparations were fair or poor, we use high doses (459 g to 612 g) of PEG and Gatorade with a dose chosen that was higher than the previous failed dose and given as a split dose over an extended period of time. This extended high-dose cleansing protocol seemed to have a high efficacy and be well tolerated.

This prospective study reports the efficacy of a multi-step escalating high-dose extended cleansing protocol for those whose previous colon preparations were inadequate. The primary objectives of this study were to examine the efficacy and safety of high-dose PEG and Gatorade preparations for a morning colonoscopy. Secondary objectives of this study were to examine tolerability and patient acceptance of high-dose bowel preparations.

### Polyethylene glycol 3350 with electrolytes versus polyethylene glycol 4000 for constipation: a randomized, controlled trial [^114AC8ng]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Sample Size

Assuming equality, with for each group an estimated mean TSS of 7.5 with a SD of 2.4, a sample size of 41 evaluable subjects per treatment group was required to demonstrate noninferiority of 2 treatment groups with a power of 80% (β = 0.2), a significance level of 0.05 (α = 0.05) and a noninferiority margin of an absolute difference in TSS score of 1.5.

Missing Data

If ≤ 2 of 5 TSS components were missing, it was assumed that the respective symptoms did not occur. If > 2 of 5 constipation-related symptoms were missing, the TSS of that week was considered missing. Subjects with insufficient data to calculate the TSS at baseline were excluded from the PP population. In analyses of treatment success, subjects with missing data were considered treatment failures.

### Polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium sulfate, potassium chloride, magnesium sulfate, and sodium chloride for oral solution (Suflave) [^114q7Qh5]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The primary mode of action is the osmotic effects of polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium sulfate and magnesium sulfate, which induce a laxative effect. The physiological consequence is increased water retention in the lumen of the colon, resulting in loose stools.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

After administration of the first dose of SUFLAVE in 18 healthy subjects, the mean ± SD maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for polyethylene glycol 3350 of 3.4 ± 1.4 mcg/mL was reached at 4 hours, and the mean ± SD serum Cmaxfor sulfate of 27.0 ± 11.4 mcg/mL was reached at 6 hours. Following a second dose of SUFLAVE (approximately 12 hours later), the mean ± SD plasma Cmaxfor polyethylene glycol 3350 of 2.9 ± 0.97 mcg/mL was reached at 4 hours, and the mean ± SD serum Cmaxfor sulfate of 29.2 ± 11.0 mcg/mL was reached at 3 hours. Sulfate concentrations were below the limit of quantitation (19.2 mcg/mL) for all subjects by follow-up Day 3. Polyethylene glycol 3350 concentrations were below the limit of quantitation (LOQ 0.01 mcg/mL) for 16 of 18 subjects by follow-up Day 7.

### Polyethylene glycol 3350 with electrolytes versus polyethylene glycol 4000 for constipation: a randomized, controlled trial [^1125xQGX]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

What Is Known
Polyethylene glycol is recommended as a first-line laxative for both fecal disimpaction and maintenance treatment in pediatric functional constipation.
Different formulations of polyethylene glycol have been developed, using polyethylene glycol 3350 and polyethylene glycol 4000 (with a molecular weight of 3350 and 4000 g/mol, respectively), with or without the addition of electrolytes.

What Is New
Although noninferiority criteria were not met, polyethylene glycol 3350 with electrolytes and polyethylene glycol 4000 without electrolytes appear to be similarly efficacious and safe during long-term use.
After 1 year of follow-up, treatment success was achieved in approximately half of all subjects.

Constipation is a common problem in childhood with a reported prevalence ranging from 0.7% to 29.6% (median 12%). In most cases, there is no organic cause, and it is thus referred to as functional constipation. Functional constipation is usually treated with behavioral interventions and laxatives. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is recommended as a first-line laxative for both fecal disimpaction and maintenance treatment. PEG (or macrogol) is a polymer which is not metabolized, and minimally absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Consequently, it creates an osmotic gradient in the lumen of the colon, leading to retention of fluid in the intestine, resulting in softening and loosening of stools. Various formulations of PEG have been developed, using PEG 3350 and PEG 4000 (with a molecular weight of 3350 and 4000 g/mol, respectively), with or without the addition of electrolytes. Both PEG 3350 and PEG 4000 are effective in childhood constipation.

It has been demonstrated that PEG is safe to use for up to 6 months in adults with chronic constipation. Similarly, analyses of small groups of patients suggest that PEG is safe for long-term use in children. Recently, however, concerns have been raised that compounds such as ethylene glycol or diethylene glycol may be ingested as impurities of PEG or may be formed when PEG is degraded after ingestion, leading to adverse effects. Consequently, the Food and Drug Administration has decided to sponsor a study on the safety of PEG in children.

To date, several head-to-head studies in adults with constipation have been performed that compare different PEG formulations, showing comparable efficacy and safety. A recent meta-analysis concluded that the addition of electrolytes to PEG does not appear to offer any clinical benefits in the management of adults with constipation.

### PEG3350 in the treatment of childhood constipation: a multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial [^117YMpsB]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To establish the efficacy and best starting dose of polyethylene glycol (PEG)3350 in the short-term treatment of children with functional constipation.

Study Design

Prospective, randomized, multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of PEG3350 in children with functional constipation. Patients were randomly assigned to either placebo or 0.2 g/kg per day, 0.4 g/kg per day, or 0.8 g/kg per day of PEG3350 after a 1 week run-in period, followed by 2 weeks of treatment. All received behavior modification. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a successful treatment response: ≥ 3 bowel movements (BM) in the second week.

Results

103 children (mean, 8.5 ± 3.1 years) were enrolled. 77%, 74%, and 73% of the 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 g/kg groups were successfully treated, as compared with 42% receiving placebo (P < .04). There was a significant increase in BM (P < .001) and straining improvement (P < .05) with the different PEG3350 doses. Stool consistency improved significantly for doses 0.4 g/kg or higher (P < .001). There was more abdominal pain and fecal incontinence in patients receiving 0.8 g/kg. PEG3350 was well tolerated.

Conclusions

This placebo-controlled study confirms the efficacy and safety of PEG3350 for the short-term treatment of children with functional constipation. We recommend a starting dose of 0.4 g/kg per day.

### First-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine allergic reactions: limited role for excipient skin testing [^111avqMn]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that a severe or immediate allergic reaction to the first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is a contraindication for the second dose.

Objective

To assess outcomes associated with excipient skin testing after a reported allergic reaction to the first dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.

Methods

We identified a consecutive sample of patients with reported allergic reactions after the first dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine who underwent allergy assessment with skin testing to polyethylene glycol (PEG) and, when appropriate, polysorbate 80. Skin testing results in conjunction with clinical phenotyping of the first-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine reaction guided second-dose vaccination recommendation. Second-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine reactions were assessed.

Results

Eighty patients with reported first-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine allergic reactions (n = 65; 81% immediate onset) underwent excipient skin testing. Of those, 14 (18%) had positive skin tests to PEG (n = 5) and/or polysorbate 80 (n = 12). Skin testing result did not affect tolerance of the second dose in patients with immediate or delayed reactions. Of the 70 patients who received the second mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose (88%), 62 had either no reaction or a mild reaction managed with antihistamines (89%), but 2 patients required epinephrine treatment. Three patients with positive PEG-3350 intradermal (methylprednisolone) testing tolerated second-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. Refresh Tears caused nonspecific skin irritation.

Conclusions

Most individuals with a reported allergic reaction to the first dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, regardless of skin test result, received the second dose safely. More data are needed on the value of skin prick testing to PEG (MiraLAX) in evaluating patients with mRNA COVID-19 vaccine anaphylaxis. Refresh Tears should not be used for skin testing.

### Dose response of PEG 3350 for the treatment of childhood fecal impaction [^113GE9pM]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy and safety of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 in the treatment of childhood fecal impaction.

Methods

This was a prospective, double-blind, parallel, randomized study of 4 doses of PEG 3350; 0.25 g/kg per day, 0.5 g/kg per day, 1 g/kg per day, 1.5 g/kg per day, given for 3 days in children with constipation for > 3 months and evidence of fecal impaction.

Results

Forty patients completed the study (27 boys, median age 7.5, range 3.3–13.1 years). Disimpaction occurred in 75% of children, with a significant difference between the two higher doses and the lower doses (95% vs 55%, P < .005). All groups had an increased number of bowel movements during the 5-day study versus baseline, respectively: 6.5 versus 1.1 (P < .005), 8.0 versus 1.3 (P < .005), 10.9 versus 1.7 (P < .005), and 12.3 versus 1.4 (P < .005). Adverse effects included nausea (5%), vomiting (5%), bloating (18%), cramping (5%), and diarrhea (13%). Diarrhea and bloating were more prevalent (P < .02) in the higher-dose than in the lower-dose group. No clinically significant changes in electrolytes were noted.

Conclusions

The 3-day administration of PEG 3350 is safe and effective in the treatment of childhood fecal impaction at doses of 1 and 1.5 g/kg per day.

### Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of polyethylene glycol (miraLAX ®) for urinary urge symptoms [^115MECuM]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is common first-line therapy for urinary symptoms despite minimal evidence-based support. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of PEG for initial treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms in children.

Patients and Methods

Patients aged > 3 years underwent baseline urinary symptom questionnaire (USQ, scored 0–16), bowel symptom questionnaire (scored 0–20) and abdominal X-ray (KUB). Patients were randomized to placebo/PEG regardless of parent's perception of constipation. After 1 month, patients completed follow-up questionnaires and KUB. Improvement was defined as decrease in USQ (ΔUSQ) ≥ 3 points. Secondary analyses compared urinary and bowel symptoms to KUB.

Results

Of 138 enrolled patients, 71 (51.4%) completed 1 month of therapy. Analyses of those randomized to placebo vs. PEG and non-completers demonstrated similar demographics, baseline symptoms, and KUB. Patients treated with placebo and PEG both had significant improvement in USQ scores (p < 0.0001). Patients treated with placebo and PEG responded similarly to placebo (ΔUSQ 3.7 vs. 3.4, p = 0.773), with improvement in nearly half (48.5% PEG vs. 44.7% placebo). There was no correlation between KUB and urinary or bowel symptoms.

Conclusions

Nearly 50% of patients with urinary urge symptoms treated with either placebo or PEG for 1 month had improvement in urinary symptoms. KUB did not correlate with baseline or follow-up urinary or bowel symptoms.

### Utilisation and safety of polyethylene glycol 3350 with electrolytes in children under 2 years: a retrospective cohort [^112j7Cbq]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

This utilisation and safety study was conducted to characterise the paediatric population and use of PEG 3350+E in a cohort first prescribed treatment younger than 2 years of age. The safety aspect of this study did not identify any signals of concern in the constipation cohort. Patient numbers in the faecal impaction cohort were too small to draw robust conclusions on safety. If information were available, then a safety study would ideally assess treatment intake per kilogram, including electrolyte intake, before reaching safety conclusions. Nevertheless, findings from this study contribute to real-world evidence on the use of PEG 3350+E in this population, in countries where the product is available.

Statistical analysis

All randomized children were included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. With the exception of the primary analysis, all analyses were performed in the ITT population. The primary analysis was performed in the per-protocol (PP) population, which consisted of all subjects who completed the study according to the protocol. Subjects were excluded from the PP population in case of any of the following: > 1 of the 7 study visits missing; missing data at baseline and/or at week 52; data missing for several weeks; nonresponse as evidenced by use of rescue medication for > 2 consecutive weeks; use of laxatives in the week before inclusion up to the day of randomization; withdrawal from the study. The primary analysis was performed to evaluate noninferiority of PEG3350 + E to PEG4000 with respect to change in TSS at week 52 compared to baseline. A 2-sided 95% confidence interval [CI] was used in the noninferiority analysis, with a noninferiority margin of an absolute difference in TSS of 1.5. Thus, noninferiority of PEG3350 + E to PEG4000 could be concluded if the 2-sided 95% CI of the absolute difference in mean change in TSS between treatment groups was entirely below the value 1.5 (which is equivalent to 1-sided testing with a CI of 97.5%).

For continuous data with a normal distribution, means and standard deviations (SD) were reported, t tests were used to evaluate differences between 2 groups and 1-way analysis of variances (with post-test for linear trend when appropriate) were used to evaluate differences between > 2 groups. For continuous data with a non-normal distribution, medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) were reported, and Mann–Whitney U tests were used to evaluate differences between groups. For categorical data, Fisher exact tests were used. Significance was set at P < 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS software, Version 9 of the SAS System for Windows (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC).

### 3 L split-dose polyethylene glycol is superior to 2 L polyethylene glycol in colonoscopic bowel preparation in relatively high-BMI (≥ 24 kg / M) individuals: a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^111sm417]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Latest guidelines on bowel preparation do not provide recommendations on the appropriate dose of PEG for overweight and obese population. There are now lack of prospective randomized study to answer this question. Therefore, we performed this multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT) to explore the optimal method for bowel cleaning using PEG in relatively high-BMI individuals.

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

8.1 Pregnancy

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with PEG-3350 and electrolytes for oral solution. It is also not known whether PEG-3350 and electrolytes for oral solution can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. PEG-3350 and electrolytes for oral solution should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.

8.3 Nursing Mothers

It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when PEG-3350 and electrolytes for oral solution is administered to a nursing woman.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of PEG-3350 and electrolytes for oral solution in pediatric patients have not been established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of PEG-3350 and electrolytes for oral solution did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.

8.6 Renal Impairment

Use PEG-3350 and electrolytes for oral solution with caution in patients with renal impairment or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. These patients may be at risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration before, during and after use of PEG-3350 and electrolytes for oral solution and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### Experience with polyethylene glycol allergy-guided risk management for COVID-19 vaccine anaphylaxis [^112SrL2K]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite the ongoing discussion about the safety of IDT and OPTs in PEG allergy, we used these procedures to confirm a suspicion of PEG allergy and found that they can be performed with caution. Indeed, systemic reactions may occur to SPT as described in the literature and as seen in our patients. Therefore, it is recommended to start skin tests and OPT with low concentrations and doses, respectively, and under emergency preparedness. Skin tests to vaccines still remain unsatisfyingly validated, with sensitivity and specificity not yet being determined and vaccines, in general, may elicit test reactions of uncertain significance, for example, based on previous immunity or vaccine adjuvants.OPT is the gold standard in drug allergy and PEG‐hypersensitive patients with negative SPT have been described. Thus, IDT and OPT should be considered in SPT‐negative patients with clinical suspicion of PEG allergy. IDT with PEG‐containing vaccines should be considered in patients with reactions after vaccination with such vaccines, as it has been suggested that PEGylation itself might have an effect on test response to PEG products. In OPT, doses between 500 mg‐1.5 g PEG 3350 and 10–60 mg PEG 4000 elicited reactions and confirmed PEG allergy, demonstrating reactivity to lower amounts of PEG compared to the available data in the literature (55 g PEG 3350 and 7.1 g PEG 4000).

Safety

A total of 143 adverse events were reported by 56 subjects (58%; Supplemental Table 3, Supplemental Digital Content 3). Five serious adverse events were reported in 2 subjects (2%): dehydration (n = 2), upper respiratory tract infection (n = 1), metabolic acidosis (n = 1), constipation (n = 1). Both subjects were randomized to PEG3350 + E. None of the serious adverse events were considered to be drug-related (Supplemental Table 4, Supplemental Digital Content 4). Six subjects (6%) reported a total of 8 adverse events that were suspected to be related to the study drug (Supplemental Table 4, Supplemental Digital Content 4). No differences in rates of adverse events, serious adverse events, or drug-related adverse events were found between groups.

### Polyethylene glycol 3350 without electrolytes for the treatment of functional constipation in infants and toddlers [^112rK2cR]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

We have recently reported the safety and efficacy of polyethylene glycol 3350 without electrolytes (PEG) for the daily treatment of constipation in older children. Because there are very few data available on the use of PEG in infants and toddlers, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of PEG for the treatment of constipation in children < 2 years of age.

Methods

This is a retrospective chart review of 75 constipated children < 2 years of age at start of PEG therapy. PEG was started at an average dose of 1 g/kg body weight/d and parents were asked to adjust the dose to yield 1 to 2 soft painless stools/d. Data from the history and physical examination were collected initially and at short-term (≤ 4 months) and long-term (≥ 6 months) follow-up.

Results

75 otherwise healthy children received PEG for functional constipation. The mean age was 17 months (range, 1 to 24 months) and the mean duration of constipation was 10 months (range, 0.5 to 23 months). The mean duration of short-term follow-up was 2 months and mean duration of long-term follow-up was 11 months. The mean effective short-term PEG dose was 1.1 g/kg body weight/d and the mean long-term dose was 0.8 g/kg body weight/d. Constipation was relieved in 85% with short-term and in 91% with long-term PEG therapy. Adverse effects were mild and included diarrhea, which disappeared with lowering the dose. No subjects stopped PEG because of adverse effects.

Conclusion

PEG is effective, well tolerated and appeared safe for the treatment of functional constipation in children < 2 years of age.

### Polyethylene glycol powder solution versus senna for bowel preparation for colonoscopy in children [^113PzQeB]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Safety and effectiveness of large-volume polyethylene glycol-based solution (PEG-ES) have been documented, but the taste and volume can be barriers to successful colonoscopy preparation. Efficacy and safety of small-volume electrolyte-free (PEG-P) preparation (Miralax) for colonoscopy preparation have been rarely studied, although presently used at many pediatric centers. The primary objective of the present study was to determine whether PEG-P results in a more efficacious and safe colonoscopy preparation as compared with senna.

Methods

The study design was prospective, randomized, and single-blinded. Patients ages 6 to 21 years were randomized to a 2-day clean-out regimen of PEG-P at a dose of 1.5 g/kg divided twice per day for 2 days versus senna 15 mL daily (ages 6–12) or 30 mL daily (ages 12–21) for 2 days. Both preparations required 1 day of clear liquids whereas senna preparation required an additional day of full liquid diet. A blinded endoscopist graded the quality of preparation with a standardized cleanliness tool (Aronchick scale). Serum chemistry panels were obtained. Patients or parents rated symptoms and ease of preparation. The anticipated number of subjects was 166; however, the interim analysis demonstrated inferiority of senna preparation.

Results

Thirty patients were evaluated in the present study. Of the patients in the PEG-P arm, 88% (14/16) received an excellent/good score compared with 29% (4/14), with the senna preparation (P = 0.0022). Both preparations were well-tolerated by patient-graded ease of preparation. Demographics and laboratory values did not differ significantly across the 2 groups. No serious adverse events were noted.

Conclusions

PEG-P is an effective colonoscopy preparation whereas senna preparation was insufficient. Both were well-tolerated and appear safe in a pediatric population.

### Modifications in endoscopic practice for pediatric patients [^113QeZvN]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Pediatric bowel preparation for colonoscopy — Sodium phosphate safety and polyethylene glycol (PEG)–based regimens are outlined: Black-box warnings and manufacturer guidance led to removal of oral sodium phosphate as an over-the-counter option and to recommend against use in "any children younger than 18 years of age". If PEG with electrolytes is chosen, most children require approximately 80 mL/kg, and nasogastric administration for 24 hours before the procedure is described as safe and appropriate, especially in children younger than 6 years. For electrolyte‑free PEG‑3350, doses as much as 10 times higher than those for constipation are reported as emerging as the preparation of choice in many pediatric units, with studies supporting 4‑day regimens and conclusions that both 2‑day and 1‑day preparations are safe and effective.

A permanent change to once-daily dosing was permitted at the investigator's discretion after consultation with the medical monitor if a patient experienced an AE (severe nausea, severe diarrhea, or other event) for ≥ 3 consecutive days. In patients with no BM within a 3-day period, the investigator was permitted to prescribe a 10 mg bisacodyl suppository. If this rescue medication was ineffective, the investigator was permitted to recommend an enema; if the enema failed, immediate short-term use of another treatment, except polyethylene glycol 3350 or tegaserod, was permitted. The use of rescue medication was permitted during screening and the entire treatment period, except for ≤ 24 hours before administration of the first dose of study medication or during the first week of treatment.

### Utilisation and safety of polyethylene glycol 3350 with electrolytes in children under 2 years: a retrospective cohort [^113MtEuE]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Objectives:

In the UK, Movicol paediatric plain (polyethylene glycol 3350 with electrolytes [PEG 3350+E], Norgine, UK), is licensed for chronic constipation in children 2–11 years of age and faecal impaction (FI) from 5 years. This study aimed to investigate usage and characterise the risk profile in children under 2 years of age using PEG 3350+E in the UK.

Methods:

Retrospective, single exposure cohort study, with patients identified from Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD. Patients first prescribed PEG 3350+E under 2 years of age for the treatment of constipation or FI, between September 2003 and July 2019, were included.

Results:

There were 13,235 patients with a constipation indication and 40 patients with FI. For the constipation cohort: median age of PEG 3350+E first prescription was 1.2 years [interquartile range (IQR) 0.9, 1.6] and 68.4% had one treatment episode (TE). The mean duration of exposure, in the first TE, was 88.9 days. The most common total daily dose was one sachet (6.9 g).

In terms of incident events on treatment, 0.5% of patients had abdominal pain, 3.0% had diarrhoea (may be attributed to treatment) and 4.1% had vomiting. 2.0% had signs/symptoms which could (in extreme cases) be associated with electrolyte disturbance, however, none had abnormal electrolyte values.

Discussion:

The safety aspect of this study did not identify any signals of concern in the constipation cohort. The number of patients in the FI cohort were too small for robust conclusions. If information were available, then a safety study would ideally assess treatment intake per kilogram, including electrolyte intake, before reaching safety conclusions. Nevertheless, these data contribute to real-world evidence on the use of PEG 3350+E in this population.

### Bowel preparation for pediatric colonoscopy: report of the NASPGHAN endoscopy and procedures committee [^117TbgsP]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Medium credibility.

Pediatric colonoscopy bowel preparation — polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG-3350) regimens, dosing, outcomes, and safety are detailed across prospective and retrospective studies. PEG-3350 is stated to be safe and effective for bowel preparation in children and has become the most popular bowel preparation, with clinically insignificant electrolyte changes reported. In a 2-day PEG-3350 plus bisacodyl regimen, adverse events were mild and included nausea 19%, abdominal pain 11%, and occasional vomiting 4%. Prospective dosing included 46 children given PEG-3350 1.5 g · kg^-1 · day^-1 for 4 days, and another series in 149 children used 1.5 g · kg^-1 · day^-1 up to 100 g/day in 2 to 3 divided doses for 4 days with adequate colonic preparation in 89% of patients. A 2-day cleanout using an average PEG-3350 dose of 1.9 g · kg^-1 · day^-1 in 30 children reported that in 90% minimal to no washing was required, although 23/30 also received bisacodyl and/or an enema. In a prospective protocol, 238 g of PEG-3350 mixed with 1.9 L of Gatorade over a few hours had a completion rate of 93.5%, with the cecum reached in all 46 patients and the terminal ileum intubated 84% of the time. A retrospective series using 238 to 255 g of PEG-3350 in 1.9 L over 2 hours in 272 children (median age 13.7 years, range 1.08–17.92 years) showed effective cleansing in 93% of patients; these patients ate regular meals the day before and took only clear liquids up to 3 hours preprocedure. The Food and Drug Administration recommended the avoidance of oral sodium phosphate in patients younger than 18 years, and a black box warning is in place for phosphate-based preparations.

### Macrogol (polyethylene glycol) laxatives in children with functional constipation and faecal impaction: a systematic review [^113kBWc5]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2009). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Previously published reviews on the management of childhood constipation have commented on the lack of high quality clinical trials in the field, – despite the widespread use of laxatives. Although there remain significant gaps in the evidence base, this literature review has demonstrated that the evidence base of current clinical practice is now improving.

The placebo-controlled study of PEG+E by Thomson et al defines a baseline proof of principle in a relatively mildly affected population, while the two phase study by Candy et al confirms that, once disimpacted, even severely affected children can be maintained satisfactorily on low doses of PEG+E (the mean daily dose was just under two paediatric dose sachets). PEG+E could also be used as monotherapy whereas almost one third of patients on lactulose required senna. No patient on PEG+E reimpacted compared with almost one in four on lactulose.

The five studies comparing PEG with lactulose – exhibit some potentially important differences that prevent the results being pooled in meta-analysis. Firstly, they involve three different agents: PEG 3350, PEG 3350+E and PEG 4000. While there is no a priori reason for supposing that these will behave functionally differently as laxatives, one cannot necessarily assume equivalence. Secondly, there are dose differences: in two casesthe dose was titrated according to clinical response, subject to an upper limit; in one casea single titration was permitted, with add-in therapy being required beyond that; and in the other two studiesthere was a fixed dose regime. Finally, there are methodological concerns regarding the analysis of the Gremse et al studyin that the presented results exclude the patients who had withdrawn due to lack of efficacy, biasing the results in favour of lactulose.

### Polyethylene glycol for constipation in children younger than eighteen months old [^1142wMLV]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a safe and effective treatment for constipation in children older than 18 months. Data on its safety and efficacy in infants are lacking. The goal of this study was to determine safety, efficacy, and optimal dose of polyethylene glycol powder for treatment of constipation in patients younger than 18 months.

Methods

The authors reviewed the charts of patients younger than 18 months treated with PEG 3350 for constipation. The initial dose, effective maintenance dose, response to therapy, duration of therapy, and side effects were recorded.

Results

Twenty-eight patients younger than 18 months of age treated with PEG were identified (3, age 0–5 months; 9, age 6–11 months; 16, age 12–17 months). Mean duration of therapy was 6.2 ± 5 months (range, 3 weeks-21 months). Mean initial dose was 0.88 g/kg/day (range, 0.26–2.14 g/kg/day). Mean effective maintenance dose was 0.78 g/kg/day (range, 0.26–1.26 g/kg/day). PEG relieved constipation in 97.6% of patients. One infant experienced increased gas per rectum and four others experienced transient diarrhea that resolved after adjusting the dose.

Conclusion

Oral powdered polyethylene glycol at a maintenance dose of 0.78 g/kg/day is safe and effective for patients younger than 18 months. Dose and safety profiles are similar for those reported in older children.

### Utilisation and safety of polyethylene glycol 3350 with electrolytes in children under 2 years: a retrospective cohort [^1165CuAC]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Participants

A total of 20,861 patients aged under 2 years of age who were prescribed PEG 3350+E, between September 2003 and July 2019, were initially identified. From this initial identification, 13,235 patients were identified with the indication of constipation and 40 patients identified with the indication of faecal impaction who had at least one PEG 3350+E prescription.

Furthermore, from the initial identification, 7586 patients were excluded from analysis as their reasons for consultation in the 30 days before prescription did not specify constipation or faecal impaction. It is possible that the child presented with constipation which was not recorded by the GP in the consultation record when prescribing, or that the prescription related to a reason for consultation recorded after prescribing or > 30 days before prescribing.

For the constipation cohort; cohort characteristics are presented in Table 1 and incident events of interest are presented in Table 2. Due to small numbers for the FI cohort (n = 40), only cohort characteristics are presented in Table 3.

Constipation Cohort

Among children with constipation, 9380 patients (70.9%) were aged between 12 and < 24 months, with a further 3855 patients (29.1%) aged < 12months. Specifically, PEG 3350+E was used in 477 patients (3.6%) who were < 6 months of age. In total, 7512 patients (56.8%) were female. Where reported, the median weight at index was 9.3 kg (IQR 7.4, 11.0; n = 445) and the median weight at the end of the first TE, for those with weight reported at index, was 9.3 kg (IQR 8.4, 10.9; n = 34).

Total daily dose (TDD) was explored across all prescriptions in TEs. In total, 9325 patients (70.5% cohort) with constipation had a TDD of one sachet. Other common doses were 1.5 sachets (n = 1845, 13.9%) and two sachets (n = 2021, 15.3%). Stratification by age group revealed that a higher proportion of those aged 0– < 6 months had a TDD of < 1 sachet (85.1%) or one sachet (71.5%) across all prescriptions in TEs.

### EORTC 10968: a phase I clinical and pharmacokinetic study of polyethylene glycol liposomal doxorubicin (caelyx, doxil) at a 6-week interval in patients with metastatic breast cancer. European organization for research and treatment of cancer [^115NtsTn]. Annals of Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

We performed a phase I study of polyethylene glycol (pegylated, Stealth) liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx, Doxil) using a prolonged (6-week) dose interval to reduce the incidence of skin toxicity that was dose-limiting at more conventional dose intervals, and which appeared to be schedule dependent.

Patients and Methods

Eligible for the study were metastatic breast cancer patients who had received a maximum of one prior therapy for metastatic disease. The defined dose levels were 60, 70, 80 and 90 mg/m2.

Results

Twenty patients were assessed at starting doses of 60 mg/m2 (n = 9) or 70 mg/m2 (n = 11). The dose-limiting toxicity was mucositis. Severe skin toxicity was not observed at the 60 mg/m2 dose level, and occurred in only one patient treated at 70 mg/m2. Significant neutropenia, alopecia, and nausea and vomiting were rare events. No clinical cardiac events occurred, despite a median cumulative doxorubicin dose of 323 mg/m2 (range 5–630 mg/m2). Partial responses were documented in five patients. Pharmacokinetics were assessed in 15 patients, and confirmed the long terminal half-life of the agent (median 77 h) demonstrated in earlier studies.

Conclusions

The recommended dose of Caelyx/Doxil using this schedule is 60 mg/m2 every 6 weeks. This is a safe and effective regimen that permits prolonged administration of anthracycline to patients with metastatic breast cancer.

### PEG 3350 administration is not associated with sustained elevation of glycol levels [^111aPvdy]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether trace amounts of ethylene glycol (EG), diethylene glycol (DEG), or triethylene glycol (TEG) in PEG 3350 are associated with increased blood levels of EG, DEG, or TEG in children receiving daily PEG 3350 therapy.

Study Design

Blood samples were drawn from 9 children who were being treated for constipation with PEG 3350 (6–12 years old) before and every 30 minutes for 3 hours after receiving 17 g of PEG 3350. PEG 3350, tap water, and blood samples from 18 age- and sex-matched controls also were analyzed.

Results

Baseline blood levels of EG and TEG did not differ between control and treated groups. DEG levels (median [IQR]) were lower in the PEG 3350 group (40.13ng/mL [36.69, 63.94] vs 92.83ng/mL [51.06, 128.93], P = 0.008). After PEG 3350 dose, levels of EG (390.51ng/mL [326.06, 624.55]) and TEG (2.21ng/mL [0, 4.5]) peaked at 90 minutes at 1032.81ng/mL (826.84, 1486.13) (P = 0.009) and 35.17ng/mL (15.81, 45.13) (P = 0.0005), respectively. DEG levels did not significantly change. Standard 17-g doses of PEG 3350 in 8 oz (237mL) of water resulted in concentrations (mean ± SD) of EG, DEG, and TEG of 1.32 ± 0.23 µg/mL, 0.18 ± 0.03 µg/mL, and 0.12 ± 0.01µg/mL, respectively. EG, DEG, and TEG levels in public water supply were 0.07 µg/mL, 0.21 µg/mL, and 0.02µg/mL, respectively.

Conclusions

Daily PEG 3350 therapy in children was not associated with sustained elevation of EG, DEG, or TEG blood levels over levels in matched controls. Although EG and TEG levels increased after a standard dose of PEG 3350, their peak values remained well below toxic levels.

### Split dose and miraLAX-based purgatives to enhance bowel preparation quality becoming common recommendations in the US [^114S2TEu]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Rates of suboptimal bowel preparation up to 30% have been reported. Liberalized precolonoscopy diet, split dose purgative, and the use of MiraLAX-based bowel preparation (MBBP) prior to colonoscopy are recently developed measures to improve bowel preparation quality but little is known about the utilization prevalence of these measures. We examined the patterns of utilization of these newer approaches to improve precolonoscopy bowel preparation quality among American gastroenterologists.

Methods

Surveys were distributed to a random sample of members of the American College of Gastroenterologists. Participants were queried regarding demographics, practice characteristics, and bowel preparation recommendations including recommendations for liberal dietary restrictions, split dose purgative, and the use of MBBP. Approaches were evaluated individually and in combination.

Results

Of the 999 eligible participants, 288 responded; 15.2% recommended a liberal diet, 60.0% split dose purgative, and 37.4% MBBP. Diet recommendations varied geographically with gastroenterologists in the West more likely to recommend a restrictive diet (odds ratio [OR] 2.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16–7.67) and physicians in the Northeast more likely to recommend a liberal diet more likely. Older physicians more often recommended split dosing (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.04–2.97). Use of MBBP was more common in suburban settings (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.23–3.73). Evidence suggests that physicians in private practice were more likely to prescribe split dosing (p = 0.03) and less often recommended MBBP (p = 0.02). Likelihood of prescribing MBBP increased as weekly volume of colonoscopy increased (p = 0.03).

Conclusions

To enhance bowel preparation quality American gastroenterologists commonly use purgative split dosing. The use of MBBP is becoming more prevalent while a liberalized diet is infrequently recommended. Utilization of these newer approaches to improve bowel preparation quality varies by physician and practice characteristics. Further evaluation of the patterns of usage of these measures is indicated.

### Utilisation and safety of polyethylene glycol 3350 with electrolytes in children under 2 years: a retrospective cohort [^111VxjNu]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

A sensitivity analysis was undertaken to investigate the use of the MDE instead of the 60-day treatment exposure period for the final prescription in a TE. There was no change in the most frequently reported events between the main analysis and the sensitivity analysis (data not shown). Constipation and related symptoms were the most frequently reported events in the constipation cohort when using the MDE (n = 3268, 24.7% cohort).

A further sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine events in patients who were aged under 2 years when a PEG 3350+E prescription was issued but had turned 2 years of age during the 60 day exposure period (n = 1131). As a result, the exposure period for this sensitivity analysis covered the period of the overlapping prescription after the child had turned 2 years of age and as such, event counts are limited. In the constipation cohort, the most frequently reported events were constipation and related symptoms (n = 201, 1.5% cohort). Events of interest reported on treatment in these patients were: abdominal pain (n = 13, 1.1%), diarrhoea (n = 30, 2.7%) and vomiting (n = 40, 3.5%).

Faecal Impaction Cohort

The size of the faecal impaction cohort was very small; however, the line of demarcation between the diagnosis of constipation and FI in real-world clinical practice is blurred. In total, seven patients (17.5% cohort) with FI had a TDD of two sachets. Other doses were one sachet (n = 5, 12.5%), 1.5 sachets (n < 5) and 0.5 sachets (n < 5). Constipation and related symptoms, was the most commonly reported incident event on treatment in the faecal impaction cohort (n = 12, 30.0% cohort). Frequency of events of interest was low; with only diarrhoea reported on treatment (n < 5).

### Utilisation and safety of polyethylene glycol 3350 with electrolytes in children under 2 years: a retrospective cohort [^117UfFpv]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Variables

The outcomes of interest were reasons for consultations, number of prescriptions, duration of continuous treatment, dose, number of treatment episodes (TEs), test results during treatment and patient demographics.

All adverse events on treatment were identified (using reasons for consultations) at any time during the treatment exposure period following a prescription for PEG 3350+E. Pre-specified adverse events of interest, listed on the SmPC, were examined using reasons for consultations. These included abdominal pain, peripheral oedema, diarrhoea, vomiting and electrolyte disturbance. For abdominal pain, peripheral oedema, diarrhoea and vomiting, events were derived from synonymous Read code terms.

However, there were no synonymous Read code terms reported for electrolyte disturbance. Therefore, signs and symptoms which a patient may have presented with (if experiencing electrolyte disturbance) were used as a proxy to identify potential cases (for example, seizures, muscle twitching, fatigue). Potential electrolyte disturbance events were identified by a clinician and defined as any Read codes which met the criteria for the following signs/symptoms: confusion/agitation, seizures/loss of consciousness, hypoaesthesia/paraesthesia, muscle twitching/spasms, oedema, fatigue, shortness of breath and/or dehydration. It is important to note that these Read codes are not specific for electrolyte disturbance; clinically, the frequency for some of the events of electrolyte disturbance was uncommon or rare.

Discontinuation, interruption and resumption of treatment was characterised with the identification of TEs. A TE was defined as a time period containing consecutive PEG 3350+E prescriptions with ≤ 60 days between prescriptions. The final prescription in a TE was assumed to have a duration of 60 days, unless otherwise stated, as most chronic medication prescriptions in the UK are for 2 months' supply. Within a TE the duration of a prescription was assumed to end when the next prescription was issued.

If the time period between prescriptions was more than 60 days then this indicated start of a new TE. One-off prescriptions were assumed to form their own TE with a duration of 60 days.

Covariates of interest included weight (baseline and at end of the first TE), prior events (reasons for consultations in the 3-month period before first starting PEG 3350+E) and prior medications (in the 3-month period before first starting PEG 3350+E). Patient exposure to other prescribed medications during and between TEs were characterised to explore switching patterns, add-on therapy and concomitant medications.

### Polyethylene glycol 4000 for treatment of functional constipation in children [^112sSKPD]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of 2 different polyethylene glycol (PEG) doses for the maintenance treatment of functional constipation in children.

Methods

Children with functional constipation according to the Rome III criteria were randomly assigned to receive PEG 4000 at a dose of either 0.7 g/kg (high-dose group; n = 45) or 0.3 g/kg (low-dose group; n = 47) for 6 weeks. Adjustment of the therapy was recommended in the event of < 3 bowel movements (BM) per week or ≥ 3 BM per day. The primary outcome measure was treatment success, defined as ≥ 3 BM per week with no fecal soiling during the last week of the intervention.

Results

A total of 90 of 92 randomized children, with a mean age of 3.7 ± 2.1 years, completed the study. In the analysis based on allocated treatment, treatment success was similar in both groups (relative risk 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.78–1.03). Compared with the high-dose PEG group, the low-dose PEG group had an increased need for therapy adjustment of borderline significance (relative risk 2.0, 95% confidence interval 1.0–4.2), an increased risk of painful defecation, a lower number of stools per week, and lower parental satisfaction. Adverse events were similar in both groups.

Conclusions

To achieve treatment success, both tested doses of PEG were equally safe and effective in the treatment of children with functional constipation.

### Polyethylene glycol 3350 with electrolytes versus polyethylene glycol 4000 for constipation: a randomized, controlled trial [^115qV8PG]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Subjects

Between April 2006 and December 2007, a total of 97 children (ITT population) were included and randomized, of whom 82 completed the study (Fig. 1). Follow-up was completed in December 2008. Reasons for withdrawal were lost to follow-up (n = 5), insufficient response (n = 2), consent withdrawal (n = 2), noncompliance (n = 1), and other (n = 5). Another 20 subjects were excluded from the PP population because of missing baseline data (n = 16), because of the use of laxatives up until inclusion (n = 2), or because of the use of rescue medication for > 2 consecutive weeks, indicating nonresponse (n = 2). The PP population consisted of 62 subjects. Baseline characteristics in both the ITT population and the PP population were similar between groups (Table 1 and Supplemental Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1). Mean age at the onset of constipation was 23.9 (SD 30.5) months and 21.4 (SD 20.5) months in the PEG3350 + E and PEG4000 groups, respectively (P = 0.64; ITT population). Children younger than 2 years had a mean number of 1.2 (SD 1.1) and 1.6 (SD 0.5) bowel movements per week, in the PEG3350 + E and PEG4000 groups, respectively (ITT population). In children older than 2 years, the mean defecation frequency on the toilet was 1.6 (SD 0.8) and 1.2 (SD 0.9) in the PEG3350 + E and PEG4000 groups, respectively (ITT population). Almost all (99%) subjects fulfilled Rome III criteria for functional constipation (Supplemental Table 2, Supplemental Digital Content 2).

### Modifications in endoscopic practice for pediatric patients [^114C8aKv]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Table 5 — acceptable and common protocols for bowel cleansing before pediatric colonoscopy outlines dosing and diet for several options: PEG-ELS (polyethylene glycol-electrolyte lavage solution) short protocol uses 100 mL/y of age/h × 4 h or 20 mL/kg/h (max rate of 1 L/h) × 4 h with diet liberal until cleansing initiated, then clears only until procedure; bisacodyl is given as 2 doses 8–10 h apart on day before the procedure (5 mg/dose for < 5 y old and 10 mg/dose for older children) with clear fluids for 24 h; Picolax (sodium picosulfate with magnesium citrate) is dosed as two doses 8–10 h apart on day before the procedure (0.25 sachet/dose for children < 6 y, 0.5 sachet/dose for 6- to 12-y old children, and 1 sachet for children > 12 y old) with clear fluids for 24 h; and PEG-3350 short protocol uses 238 g OTC (255-g prescription) in 1.9 L of a commercially available sports drink over 2–4 h on the day before procedure with diet liberal until prep initiated, then clear liquids only.

### Polyethylene glycol dosing for constipation in children younger than 24 months: a systematic review [^116gq6g4]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Evaluate safety and effectiveness of Polyethylene glycol (PEG) for chronic constipation in children aged younger than 24 months. Identify the optimum dose of PEG to manage chronic constipation in children aged younger than 24 months.

Methods

In this systematic review, Embase, Medline Ovid, Pubmed, and the Cochrane Library were searched between January 1, 2000 and February 1, 2019. Studies investigating functional constipation, in which patients younger than 24 months of age were treated with PEG, were considered as potentially eligible for review. Two authors screened the studies against inclusion/exclusion criteria. Study quality was assessed with the PEDro quality assessment, Cochrane risk of bias tool, and/or the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.

Results

Five studies (2 randomized controlled trials, 3 retrospective chart reviews) satisfied selection criteria (n = 459). All studies employed different dosage categories: mean effective maintenance dose, mean initial dose, mean short-term and long-term dose, and mean daily dose. Dosage regimens were variable, with 0.45 to 1.1g·kg·day for PEG3350 and 0.48 to 0.65g·kg·day for PEG4000. Adverse effects were transient across all studies for all types of PEG; these included diarrhea and abdominal pain.

Conclusions

This systematic review provided evidence for a lack of reported side effects from PEG for children aged younger than 24 months. Evidence to establish appropriate dosage regimens does not exist. An infographic accompanying this article can be found at http://links.lww.com/MPG/B839.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of subcutaneous methylnaltrexone in patients with opioid-induced constipation and chronic noncancer pain: a phase 3, open-label trial [^112jWgpV]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 1,034 patients received one or more doses of study medication (Figure 1). The most common reasons for study discontinuation were AEs (15.2%), patient request (12.7%), and loss to follow-up (9.3%). Most patients were white (89.7%), were female (64.7%), and reported back pain as their primary pain condition (53.8%) (Table 1). The daily median morphine equivalent dose (MED) of opioids at baseline was 120 mg (range = 1.22 mg to 2,196 mg) and remained similar throughout the treatment period. The majority of patients (42.4%) were receiving between 100 mg and less than 400 mg MED per day at baseline. The overall mean duration of methylnaltrexone treatment was 211.5 days. About half of the 1,034 patients (N = 496; 48.0%) received 44 or more weeks of methylnaltrexone therapy. Concomitant laxative use was reported by 77.3% of patients. The most common laxatives were bisacodyl USP (Dulcolax, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Ridgefield, CT, USA; 25.8%), docusate sodium (15.5%), and polyethylene glycol 3,350 (MiraLAX, Bayer Corporation, Whippany, NJ, USA; 15.9%). The median number of weekly methylnaltrexone injections was 5.98 (range = 0.05–7.14), with the greatest number of patients (49.6%) requiring more than six or seven doses per week (Figure 2).

### Utilisation and safety of polyethylene glycol 3350 with electrolytes in children under 2 years: a retrospective cohort [^1166B2Rw]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Limitations

There may be missing information in CPRD GOLD regarding prescription information, concomitant medications and clinical events from secondary care. Adverse events occurring in secondary care may not be recorded by the GP, meaning that adverse event rates may be slightly lower than in overall clinical practice. Non-serious adverse events may not always be recorded by the GP, however, GPs are often made aware of severe adverse events occurring in secondary care. The prescribing and subsequent management of patients prescribed PEG 3350+E is expected mainly in primary care, so secondary care reporting is expected to be minimal.

Potential misclassification may arise due to patients failing to report clinical events to the GP and/or variations in the coding of diagnoses between GPs. This may vary depending on the clinical event, but it is assumed that serious events will be reported and recorded.

Finally, we assume that prescribing equates to actual medication usage, although this may not be the case for every patient. Usage depends on the parent/guardian and low treatment adherence rates have previously been reported in children with constipation, though adherence with PEG-based treatments may be greater than other laxatives. In addition, the presentation of the child to the GP and the description of symptoms depends on the parent/guardian.

### A dose determination study of polyethylene glycol 4000 in constipated children: factors influencing the maintenance dose [^117LEDfe]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the doses of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 without additional salts allowing normal bowel habits in childhood functional constipation.

Methods

This multicenter noncomparative study allocated children to 4 groups: 6–12 months, 13 months-3 years, 4–7 years, and 8–15 years. Constipation was defined as < 1 stool/d for more than 1 month in children aged 6–12 months and < 3 stools/w for more than 3 months in older children. Children randomly received either a nominal or a double starting dose. Treatment scheduled for 3 months could be adapted. Data were collected daily by the parents and rated at each visit by the investigator.

Results

In the 96 children included, the median (interquartile) effective daily doses were by groups; 3.75 (2.50–5.00) g, 6.00 (4.00–7.43) g, 11.71 (7.00–16.00) g, and 16.00 (16.00–24.00) g, respectively, i.e., around 0.50 g/day/kg with a potential increment of the maintenance dose with higher initial dosages. More children had a final dosage identical to the initial one when started on the nominal dose (73%) than with the double one (42%, P < 0.003). More than 90% of children recovered normal bowel habits. Fecal soiling ceased in > 60% of children with this symptom at enrolment. Fecal mass in the rectum and abdominal pain were markedly reduced and appetite improved.

Conclusions

A daily dose of PEG 4000 around 0.50 g/day/kg in children aged 6 months to 15 years is effective in more than 90% of constipated children and 60% of those with fecal soiling.

### High-dose polyethylene glycol-3350 and gatorade solutions for patients with previous inadequate bowel preparations for colonoscopy are safe and effective [^111BauA2]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 3
Data from the questionnaire filled out by the gastroenterologists describing the baseline characteristics of the subjects, the findings and all the previous failed colonoscopy preparations

P value statistical significance shows arms that were statistically different with p < 0.05. The controls were from a previous colon cleansing study that looked at 306 g of PEG given as a split-dose and 357 g of PEG given the day-prior both with Gatorade in subjects with no history of inadequate colon preparations

NS indicates no significant differences; PEG + G, polyethylene glycol 3350 and Gatorade; ELS, electrolyte solution; Asc, ascorbic acid

Data from the questionnaire filled out by the gastroenterologists describing the previous failed colonoscopy preparations are shown in Table 3 for all subjects and for subjects who used Step 1 and Step 2 preparations. Subjects who previously had 1, 2, 3 or 4 inadequate preparations were 43 (72.9%), 16 (27.1%), 8 (13.6%) and 2 (3.4%) respectively.

There were no major adverse events noted immediately after the colonoscopies or reported by subjects after discharge from the endoscopy labs.

Preparation quality

Colon cleanliness data is shown in Table 4 for all subjects, for subjects who used Step 1 and Step 2 preparations along with similar data from 400 control subjects. One Step 1 subject did not have their right and transverse colon segments rated due to an incomplete colonoscopy. When compared to controls, subjects had no statically significant differences in the Chicago BPS, Modified Chicago BPS, Boston BPS or Adequate/Inadequate BPS scores other than subjects having more perfect scores of 36 on Chicago BPS (82.3% vs 55.4%, p < 0.0001) and higher Fluid Total Colon scores signifying wetter colons (2.25 ± 0.77 vs 1.43 ± 0.98, p < 0.0001).

### A phase 2 evaluation of a new flavored peg and sulfate solution compared to an over-the-counter laxative, peg and sports drink bowel preparation combination [^116RHrBV]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This was an open-label, active-controlled, sequential-cohort study in adult patients undergoing colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening and surveillance or for diagnostic purposes. This study was conducted at 4 U.S. endoscopy centers and approved by Aspire, Institutional Review Board and registered on(NCT03328507) on 01/11/2017. The investigation conformed with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Subjects with known or suspected ileus, severe ulcerative colitis, gastrointestinal obstruction, gastric retention, bowel perforation, toxic colitis or megacolon or who had previous significant gastrointestinal surgeries were excluded. Also excluded were patients with uncontrolled pre-existing electrolyte abnormalities, uncontrolled hypertension, known severe hepatic insufficiency (Child Pugh C), and subjects with cardiac insufficiency (NYHA Functional Classifications 3 or 4).

A screening visit was performed for eligible patients within 30 days prior to their scheduled colonoscopy which included routine blood chemistry. In this adaptive design study conducted over a two-year period, twenty subjects were planned to take the PEG-SD control, with various experimental formulations concurrently and subsequently evaluated (not discussed here) with 40 subjects ultimately planned to take the FPSS to-be-marketed formulation. Preparation administration was not randomized.

On the day prior to colonoscopy, subjects were allowed a low residue breakfast followed by clear liquids until the colonoscopy was completed the following day. Both preparations were administered using the American College of Gastroenterology recommended split-dose (PM/AM) regimen. Subjects assigned to FPSS reconstituted the one-liter dose with water on the evening prior to colonoscopy and consumed 8 oz of solution every 15 min until complete. A second one-liter dose was taken the morning of colonoscopy. FPSS subjects drank an additional 16oz of water following each preparation dose. Subjects assigned to PEG-SD received two 5 mg over-the-counter bisacodyl laxative tablets, two 32-ounce bottles of Lemon-Lime flavored sports drink (Gatorade; PepsiCo, Inc. Chicago, IL, USA), and two 119 g bottles of Polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG 3350). Subjects were instructed to take the bisacodyl at approximately 3PM on the day prior to colonoscopy. Subjects then mixed one bottle of PEG 3350 with one bottle of Gatorade and consumed 8 oz every 15 min until complete, along with additional water. A second one-liter dose was taken the morning of colonoscopy.
