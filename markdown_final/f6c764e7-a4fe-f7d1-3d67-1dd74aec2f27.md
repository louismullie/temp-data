## Question

A 28-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for a preconception counseling visit. She has no known family history of cystic fibrosis and is of Northern European descent. She asks about genetic testing options before trying to conceive. Her partner has no known health issues and no family history of cystic fibrosis.

According to current guidelines, should this woman be offered cystic fibrosis carrier testing at this visit? Justify your answer based on the recommendations.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a 28-year-old woman of Northern European descent with no known family history of cystic fibrosis should be offered cystic fibrosis carrier testing at a preconception visit, and how to justify that recommendation with current guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative, current guidelines and what they say about universal CF carrier screening. Then, I should verify the rationale for preconception timing and why it matters clinically. Next, I will consider ancestry-specific detection rates and residual risk to ensure counseling is accurate. After that, I need to check what to do if she is a carrier, including partner testing and reproductive options. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation and counseling points, making sure I double-check any exceptions or nuances that could change management.

> Let me first confirm the guideline stance on universality. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on offering CF carrier screening to all women who are considering pregnancy or are already pregnant, regardless of ancestry or family history, with ACOG Committee Opinion No. 691 explicitly recommending CF carrier screening for all such patients, and ACOG Committee Opinion No. 762 listing CF among conditions to offer in prepregnancy counseling for all women considering pregnancy [^111Fh9Ss] [^117VB7HA]. ACMG similarly supports offering CFTR carrier screening to all pregnant patients and those planning pregnancy, reinforcing a universal approach rather than ancestry-limited screening [^113WiHBs].

> Wait, let me verify the timing rationale because it drives counseling. Preconception screening is preferred because it maximizes reproductive options if both partners are carriers, including IVF with preimplantation genetic testing, use of donor gametes, adoption, or simply choosing to avoid pregnancy, whereas screening during pregnancy compresses decision-making and may limit options or increase stress, which is why guidelines emphasize preconception timing whenever possible [^1117JffN] [^117PKhoh].

> I should confirm ancestry-specific detection rates and residual risk so I don't overstate certainty. In Northern Europeans, CF carrier frequency is about 1 in 25, and standard panels detect roughly 85–90% of carriers, leaving a residual risk even after a negative result; sensitivity is lower in some ancestries, which underscores the need to explain residual risk during counseling and to select panels with appropriate variant coverage when feasible [^1132FiAC] [^111eh7NJ] [^113Z41N3]. Hold on, I should verify that modern guidance also addresses equity; ACMG's updated position highlights that reliance on limited variant sets can miss carriers in diverse populations, supporting broader panels or sequencing-based approaches to improve detection across ancestries, which is relevant even when the patient is of Northern European descent because partner ancestry may vary and mixed-ancestry offspring are common [^111S2zn8] [^113WiHBs].

> Next, I should review the downstream steps if she screens positive. If the patient is a carrier, her reproductive partner should be offered CF carrier testing, and if both are carriers, the couple has a 25% risk of an affected child with each pregnancy; genetic counseling should be provided to discuss reproductive options such as IVF with PGT, prenatal diagnosis via CVS or amniocentesis, donor gametes, or adoption, and this counseling is recommended both preconception and during pregnancy if timing is constrained [^115cGky8] [^116p9S6p] [^1117JffN]. I need to ensure I note that newborn screening does not replace preconception carrier screening and that carrier status is not revealed by a negative infant screen, so preconception testing retains independent value for family planning [^1121q38j].

> Let me consider test selection and limitations so counseling is precise. Standard panels historically included 23 ACMG/ACOG mutations, which capture most carriers in Northern Europeans; however, expanded panels or NGS-based approaches can increase detection across diverse backgrounds and may identify mild or variable variants, so patients should be counseled about residual risk, the possibility of variants of uncertain significance, and the dynamic nature of variant interpretation over time [^112TVdjh] [^115eY85z] [^1124tzbn]. Hold on, I should verify that we also caution about incidental findings; yes, ECS can uncover health-relevant variants in the tested individual, which should be discussed during informed consent [^115eY85z].

> I will now examine the ethical and practical context to avoid overpromising. Carrier screening is optional after counseling, results should be documented once to avoid unnecessary repeat testing, and patients should be encouraged to inform at-risk relatives if they are carriers, with privacy protections in place; cost and insurance coverage can be barriers in the preconception setting, so clinicians should anticipate this and discuss options, including sequential versus concurrent partner testing depending on timing and patient preference [^112chXVn] [^116b5HmG] [^1115QTqC]. But wait, what if the patient declines? That is acceptable after informed counseling, and the offer should be documented to support shared decision-making and future care [^112chXVn].

> Synthesis and recommendation: Yes, this 28-year-old woman should be offered CF carrier testing at her preconception visit. Current ACOG and ACMG guidelines support universal CF carrier screening for all women considering pregnancy, regardless of ancestry or family history, and preconception testing provides the broadest range of reproductive options if both partners are carriers; counseling should include the rationale for testing, detection rates and residual risk, possible outcomes including carrier status and mild or uncertain variants, and next steps if she is a carrier, including partner testing and reproductive options [^111Fh9Ss] [^113WiHBs] [^1117JffN] [^115cGky8].

Per current guidelines, **yes**, cystic fibrosis (CF) carrier screening should be offered to this 28-year-old woman of Northern European descent at her preconception visit, even without a family history of CF. ACOG and ACMG recommend **pan-ethnic CF carrier screening** for all women who are considering pregnancy or are already pregnant, because carrier frequency is high in Northern Europeans (about 1 in 25) and most affected children are born to couples with no known family history [^111Fh9Ss] [^113WiHBs] [^1132FiAC]. Preconception screening allows for **informed reproductive choices**, including partner testing, prenatal diagnosis, and consideration of assisted reproductive options if both are carriers [^1117JffN] [^116p9S6p]. Screening should be accompanied by counseling on residual risk, test limitations, and next steps if a carrier is identified [^115T6Eav] [^113Z41N3].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 691 recommends offering **CF carrier screening to all women who are considering pregnancy or are currently pregnant**, regardless of ethnicity or family history [^111Fh9Ss]. ACMG similarly endorses **pan-ethnic CF carrier screening** for all individuals who are pregnant or planning pregnancy, emphasizing equity and the limitations of ancestry-based panels [^113WiHBs] [^111S2zn8]. NSGC guidelines likewise advise offering CF carrier testing to **all women of reproductive age**, preferably preconceptionally, and to individuals with a family history of CF or partners of known carriers [^115Cj7zp] [^114FvqwZ].

---

## Rationale for universal screening

- **High carrier frequency**: In Northern Europeans, the carrier frequency is approximately 1 in 25, and most affected children are born to couples with no known family history [^1132FiAC].

- **Early identification**: Universal screening identifies carrier couples before pregnancy, enabling informed reproductive decisions and timely interventions [^1117JffN].

- **Equity and access**: Pan-ethnic screening addresses disparities in detection rates across ancestries and ensures equitable access to testing [^111S2zn8].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Residual risk**: A negative screen does not eliminate carrier risk, as panels do not detect all variants; residual risk depends on ethnicity and panel sensitivity [^111eh7NJ] [^113Z41N3].

- **Counseling**: Pretest and posttest counseling are essential to explain test limitations, residual risk, and reproductive options [^115T6Eav] [^1117JffN].

- **Partner testing**: If the patient is a carrier, her partner should be offered testing to define couple risk and discuss options such as prenatal diagnosis or assisted reproduction [^115cGky8] [^116p9S6p].

---

## Clinical implications of positive results

If the patient is a carrier, **partner testing** should be offered to define couple risk [^115cGky8]. If both partners are carriers, **genetic counseling** should be provided to discuss the 25% risk of an affected child and options such as prenatal diagnosis, IVF with preimplantation genetic testing, or use of donor gametes [^116p9S6p] [^1117JffN]. If the partner is unavailable or declines testing, **residual risk counseling** should be provided based on ancestry and panel sensitivity [^113Z41N3].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Organization** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ACOG | Offer CF carrier screening to all women considering pregnancy or currently pregnant [^111Fh9Ss] |
| ACMG | Offer pan-ethnic CF carrier screening to all pregnant or preconception individuals [^113WiHBs] |
| NSGC | Offer CF carrier testing to all women of reproductive age, preferably preconceptionally [^115Cj7zp] |

---

Current guidelines support offering **CF carrier screening** to this patient at her preconception visit, regardless of family history, to enable informed reproductive planning and early intervention if both partners are carriers [^111Fh9Ss] [^113WiHBs].

### Carrier screening for cystic fibrosis [^115vue5g]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Cystic fibrosis is the first genetic disorder for which universal screening of preconceptional or prenatal patients became a component of standard prenatal care. The molecular genetics and mutation profile of the CFTR gene are complex, with a wide range of phenotypic consequences. Carrier screening can facilitate risk assessment for prospective parents to have an affected offspring, although there remains a small residual risk for carrying a mutation even with a negative screening result. There are ethnic differences with respect to disease incidence and effectiveness of carrier testing, which may complicate counseling.

### Genetic screening for cystic fibrosis [^112ysyvc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The importance of the recent recommendations that address cystic fibrosis carrier screening cannot be overemphasized. For the first time, a systematic approach to offering or making screening available to all pregnant women in the hopes of providing refined risk estimates for a genetic disease has been established. Caucasian of European or Ashkenazi-Jewish descent should be offered screening. Within the proposed guidelines are ethnic-specific carrier frequencies (1/29) used to establish who should be offered testing and to whom testing should be made available. Recent recommendations have made clear that in a pan-ethnic population a frequency of 1/1,000 is required for inclusion into the cystic fibrosis mutation panel. A general framework for screening during pregnancy has been established (either concurrent or sequential). It will be interesting to watch as the fruits of the human genome project are inspected and applied to everyday clinical practice. No doubt the cost of screening will be reduced through advances in technology. The combined efforts of NIH, ACOG, and ACMG have provided the first set of comprehensive standards for screening of recessive diseases. How time changes these guidelines deserves following.

Recommendation 7 — counseling couples at risk to have a child with CF: When both parents are known carriers for CF, available prenatal and pre-implantation diagnostic testing should be offered. Prenatal facilitation of a monitoring plan should begin for couples at risk or who continue a pregnancy known to have CF, and postnatal evaluation through sweat testing and state NBS programs, should be discussed.

Cystic fibrosis is the most common severe autosomal recessive disease, with a prevalence of 1 in 2,500–3,500 live births and a carrier frequency of 1 in 25 among Northern Europeans. Population-based carrier screening for cystic fibrosis has been possible since CFTR, the disease-causing gene, was identified in 1989. This review provides a systematic evaluation of the literature from the past 23 years on population-based carrier screening for cystic fibrosis, focusing on the following: uptake of testing; how to offer screening; attitudes, opinions, and knowledge; factors influencing decision making; and follow-up after screening. Recommendations are given for the implementation and evaluation of future carrier-screening programs.

Recommendation 5 — Changes in testing panels and interpretation — The inclusion and exclusion of mutations on available CFTR mutation screening panels remains a dynamic process as new information is learned about the pathogenicity of CFTR mutations, and when individuals present for genetic counseling with prior carrier screening results, those results should be reviewed and re-interpreted, if necessary, in light of current practice.

Cystic fibrosis — cystic fibrosis carrier screening should be offered to all women who are considering pregnancy or are currently pregnant. Complete analysis of the CFTR gene by DNA sequencing is not appropriate for routine carrier screening. For couples in which both partners are unaffected but one or both has a family history of cystic fibrosis, genetic counseling and medical record review should be performed to determine if CFTR mutation analysis in the affected family member is available. If a woman's reproductive partner has cystic fibrosis or apparently isolated congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens, the couple should be provided follow-up genetic counseling by an obstetrician–gynecologist or other health care provider with expertise in genetics for mutation analysis and consultation.

Cystic fibrosis carrier screening counseling — disease spectrum guidance states that while most positive CF carrier screening results identify mutations associated with classic CF disease, genetic counselors offering CF carrier screening should ensure that they are providing the most current information to patients regarding the range of symptoms, potential treatment options, and quality of life issues associated with CF and the CFTR-related disease spectrum.

### Detection of an apparent homozygous 3120G > A cystic fibrosis mutation on a routine carrier screen [^117TyqJ6]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2006). Low credibility.

A 28-year-old Caucasian female with no personal or family history of cystic fibrosis (CF) presented for preconception counseling and screening. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutation analysis using the Inno-LiPa CFTR assay revealed lack of hybridization for both the wild-type and mutant oligonucleotides for 3120+1G > A. This region was sequenced, and an apparent homozygous 3120G > A mutation was detected. Additional testing revealed an abnormal sweat chloride (77 mmol/L). Review of systems was essentially unremarkable with an absence of sinus symptoms, occasional nonproductive cough, and no features of malabsorption. Physical examination, chest X-ray, and pulmonary function tests were within normal limits. Only two other patients (siblings) with homozygous 3120G > A mutations have been reported (http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr/). Both siblings had pancreatic insufficiency, mild pulmonary symptoms, and abnormal sweat chloride levels. Our findings suggest that a homozygous mutation of a G > A conversion at 3120 is associated with abnormal CFTR function and either a mild form of CF or no overt symptoms of disease, emphasizing the difficulties in assigning genotype/phenotype correlation.

### Committee opinion no. 691: carrier screening for genetic conditions [^1121q38j]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Carrier screening for cystic fibrosis — when both partners are unaffected but one or both has a family history of cystic fibrosis, "Genetic counseling and medical record review should be performed to determine if CFTR mutation analysis in the affected family member is available" and "Carrier screening should be offered for both partners, with attention to ensure that the familial mutation is included in the assessment"; when "A woman's reproductive partner has cystic fibrosis or apparently isolated congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens", "The couple should be provided follow-up genetic counseling by an obstetrician–gynecologist or other health care provider with expertise in genetics"; and if "An individual has two cystic fibrosis mutations but has not previously received a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis", the individual "should be referred to a specialist for further evaluation" and "Genetic counseling is recommended". Program scope notes that "All states include cystic fibrosis screening as part of their newborn screening panel", yet "newborn screening panels do not replace preconception or prenatal carrier screening" and "a negative result in an unaffected newborn provides no information about the carrier status of the parents", so screening "continues to be offered to women who are considering pregnancy or are currently pregnant".

For years, clinicians have offered gene-by-gene carrier screening to patients and couples considering future pregnancy or those with an ongoing pregnancy early in gestation. Examples include ethnic-specific screening offered to Ashkenazi Jewish patients and panethnic screening for cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy. Next-generation sequencing methods now available permit screening for many more disorders with high fidelity, quick turnaround time, and lower costs. However, instituting these technologies carries with it perils that must be addressed. The basis for the selection of disorders on expanded carrier screening panels should be disclosed. The information provided about disorders with mild phenotypes, variable expression, low penetrance, and/or characterized by an adult onset should be complete and transparent, allowing patients to opt out of receiving these test results. Patients also must be made aware of the concept of residual risk following negative test results. Laboratories have a duty to participate in and facilitate this information transfer.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) carrier screening — "Prepregnancy and prenatal carrier screening for cystic fibrosis, also known as CF, was introduced into routine obstetric practice in 2001 (6)". The goal of CF carrier screening is "to identify individuals at risk of having a child with classic cystic fibrosis, which is defined by significant pulmonary disease and pancreatic insufficiency". Because assigning a single ethnicity is increasingly difficult, "in 2005, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended offering cystic fibrosis carrier screening to all patients".

### ACOG committee opinion no. 442: preconception and prenatal carrier screening for genetic diseases in individuals of Eastern European jewish descent [^116eqCFH]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Certain autosomal recessive disease conditions are more prevalent in individuals of Eastern European Jewish (Ashkenazi) descent. Previously, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended that individuals of Eastern European Jewish ancestry be offered carrier screening for Tay-Sachs disease, Canavan disease, and cystic fibrosis as part of routine obstetric care. Based on the criteria used to justify offering carrier screening for Tay-Sachs disease, Canavan disease, and cystic fibrosis, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Committee on Genetics recommends that couples of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry also should be offered carrier screening for familial dysautonomia. Individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent may inquire about the availability of carrier screening for other disorders. Carrier screening is available for mucolipidosis IV, Niemann-Pick disease type A, Fanconi anemia group C, Bloom syndrome, and Gaucher disease.

### Population-based preconception carrier screening: how potential users from the general population view a test for 50 serious diseases [^113oVcpg]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

To date, PCS offered in European health-care systems usually tests for one or a few conditions based on ancestry, such as Ashkenazi Jewish founder variants, like Tay Sachs disease, and diseases with a high prevalence in European populations, like cystic fibrosis (CF). The recent introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has allowed the screening of many genes or conditions simultaneously, and the costs of this type of screening are decreasing rapidly. This development has made it possible not only to offer PCS to high-risk groups, but also to screen the general population for a broad spectrum of conditions.

Such general population testing for several conditions simultaneously has not yet been offered within a health-care setting in Europe. There are commercial screening tests, such as the American Counsyl testthat is available online and offered in Europe via the Belgium firm Gendia. These commercial tests do not distinguish between serious and mild conditions, or between early-onset and late-onset conditions, so that arguably their clinical utility and relevance in reproductive planning are less clear. In addition, commercial tests are usually not offered preconception but during pregnancy that also reduces the available reproductive options. Finally, pre- and post-test counselling is not always provided, so that a core element of good clinical practice, reaching well-considered decisions, is not necessarily incorporated in the process.

We developed an expanded NGS PCS test aimed at all couples wishing to have a child. It involves a blood sample (10 mL per person) and screens for ∼70 genes associated with some 50 very serious, untreatable, early-onset, AR diseases simultaneously. Disease severity was an important criterion for the composition of our panel. We included only those conditions that can be characterized as very serious, that is, early-onset conditions that involve severe mental and/or physical retardation, severe pain and/or premature death. Moreover, as the availability of treatment is regarded as an important characteristic in the classification of disease severity, we also chose to include only conditions that can be characterized as untreatable. For this reason, conditions included in the Dutch newborn screening programme and classified as treatable, such as CF, have not been included in our panel, despite them being serious and early onset. Based on our selection criteria, literature review, and discussions with clinical geneticists, pediatricians, specialists in pediatric metabolic disorders and ethicists, we established a final first test panel (see Supplementary Materials).

### Consumer testing for disease risk: ACOG committee opinion summary, number 816 [^1118NA9B]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Cystic fibrosis carrier screening vignette — direct-to-consumer results, partner testing, and reproductive risk describes that "A 31-year-old patient, gravida 1, and her partner present at 9 weeks of gestation with direct-to-consumer testing carrier screening results indicating she is a carrier of cystic fibrosis (CFTR). No pathogenic changes were identified in her partner". Counseling should include that "if both partners carry a pathogenic variant, the risk for an affected fetus is 1 in 4; however, they also should be aware that false-positive and false-negative results can occur in direct-to-consumer genetic testing". The clinician "offer[s] to confirm a pathogenic AF508 variant" and notes that partner testing by the consumer panel assessed "only some common pathogenic variants", so additional testing "with a standard panel, an expanded panel, or gene sequencing (with or without deletion/duplication analysis) may provide more comprehensive screening". If the partner is negative, "a residual risk should be provided"; in some cases, "parallel testing" of both partners "may be warranted". After gene sequencing, the partner "also is a carrier", and the couple is informed that "any pregnancy (including the couple's current pregnancy) will have a 1 in 4 risk for cystic fibrosis", with options including "in vitro fertilization (IVF) with preimplantation genetic testing in future pregnancies".

Approaches to cystic fibrosis molecular analysis — panel variability and clinician responsibilities indicate there is significant variability in the size, composition, and methodology of CF mutation panels, genetic counselors and other clinicians should have a full understanding of test limitations prior to determining which method is best suited for any given patient, and if the family history is positive for CF, ensuring that the familial mutation is included in the chosen panel is critical to effective post-test counseling.

Residual risk after screening — Most CF carrier screening results will be negative for the first partner screened; if one partner has had a negative screening result and the second is untested, Bayesian analysis should be used to calculate the couple's residual risk to have a child with CF, and such analysis should consider the racial and ethnic background of both individuals and the detection rate of the mutation panel; framing the residual risk in alternative formats may be helpful.

### Committee opinion no. 691: carrier screening for genetic conditions [^115cGky8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis — screening considerations and management — states that cystic fibrosis carrier screening should be offered to all women who are considering pregnancy or are currently pregnant, and if the patient is a carrier then her partner should be tested; during pregnancy, concurrent screening of the patient and her partner is suggested when there are time constraints for decisions regarding prenatal diagnostic evaluation. Given that cystic fibrosis screening has been a routine part of reproductive care for women since 2001, it is prudent to determine if the patient has been previously screened before ordering repeat screening; if previously screened, results should be documented and the test should not be repeated, and before repeat testing the clinical scenario should be discussed with an obstetrician–gynecologist or other health care provider with expertise in genetics. Scenario-based recommendations include: when a woman is a carrier and her partner is unavailable for testing or paternity is unknown, genetic counseling is recommended; when prenatal diagnosis is being performed for other indications and carrier status is unknown, cystic fibrosis screening can be performed concurrently on the patient and partner, chorionic villi or amniocytes may be maintained in culture until results are available, and if both partners are carriers, diagnostic testing for cystic fibrosis can be performed on the chorionic villi or amniocytes; when both partners are cystic fibrosis carriers, genetic counseling is recommended and prenatal diagnosis should be offered for the couple's specific, known mutations.

### Molecular testing for cystic fibrosis carrier status practice guidelines: recommendations of the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^116p9S6p]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2014). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) reproductive risk and prenatal diagnosis — couples in which both partners are carriers of disease-causing CF mutations have a 1 in 4 risk of having a child with CF. Prenatal diagnosis by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) can be performed to evaluate the mutation status of a fetus, and laboratories typically require a sample of both parents' blood as a positive control. Alternatively, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis and in vitro fertilization may be preferable to some couples who wish to reduce the risks of having a child with cystic fibrosis. Couples who are at increased risk for or are expecting a child with CF (3.6% of newly diagnosed infants in 2010) may benefit from referral to a local accredited CF care center, including a genetic counselor specializing in CF, and finding a genotypic "match" is unnecessary and may even be misleading due to disease variability.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 762: prepregnancy counseling [^117VB7HA]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Prepregnancy counseling — family and genetic history screening recommendations specify whom to counsel for key conditions. For Canavan disease, carrier screening is for those of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, and when only one partner is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, that individual should be offered screening first; if it is determined that this individual is a carrier, the other partner should be offered screening. For familial dysautonomia, carrier screening is for those of Ashkenazi Jewish descent with the same approach when only one partner is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. For cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy, the table lists "All women who are considering pregnancy". For fragile X, any woman with a family history of fragile X-related disorders or intellectual disability suggestive of fragile X syndrome and any woman younger than the age of 40 with unexplained ovarian insufficiency are included; women without risk factors who request fragile X screening may be tested after informed consent. For hemoglobinopathies, couples at risk of having a child with thalassemia or sickle cell disease should be offered genetic counseling to review prenatal testing and reproduction options. For Tay–Sachs disease, if either member of the couple is of Ashkenazi Jewish, French–Canadian, or Cajun descent, or there is a family history consistent with Tay–Sachs disease, screening should be offered; biochemical testing can be altered in women who are pregnant or using oral contraceptive pills, so leukocyte testing must be used in these patients.

### Ethnicity-based carrier screening [^114hRhBK]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Ethnicity-based carrier screening for single-gene disorders is an integral part of preconception and prenatal care. The role of ethnicity-based carrier screening has expanded over time with advancing technology. Patients and providers should understand the benefits and limitations of their screening options and engage in appropriate pretest and posttest counseling. The future management of single-gene disorders is changing and a time may be approaching when ethnicity-based carrier screening will be replaced with expanded carrier screening.

Individuals with ≥ 2 mutations identified by carrier screening — Identification of two or more mutations in a patient referred for routine carrier screening should lead to a referral for clinical diagnostic evaluation. If the mutations identified are uncommon CFTR sequence variants, the likelihood of pathogenicity may be refined through determination of phase (cis/trans orientation). The fact that two CFTR alterations have been identified in apparently healthy individuals following carrier testing highlights the importance of determining whether two variants are in cis with one another (within the same allele) or in trans to one another (on opposite alleles).

### Benchmarks for cystic fibrosis carrier screening: a European consensus document [^111PZKRH]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2010). Low credibility.

This paper presents an overview of the conclusions from an international conference convened to address current issues related to the provision of Cystic Fibrosis carrier screening within Europe. Consensus was not aimed at stating whether such a programme should be implemented. Instead the focus was to provide a framework for countries and agencies who are considering or planning its establishment. The general principles and target population of Cystic Fibrosis carrier screening, advantages and disadvantages, health economics, monitoring and future evaluative and research directions were covered. A range of screening strategies have been assessed and compared: pre-conceptional and prenatal screening; individual and couple screening; sequential and simultaneous sampling or testing. Furthermore, technical issues were examined with respect to the choice of the panel of mutations, its detection rate, sensitivity, management of intermediate 'at-risk' couples, screening approach to different populations and ethnic minorities, and assurance of laboratory quality control. The consensus statement also aims to establish the benchmarks for communicating with health care providers, the general public and potential and actual participants before and after the genetic test.

### Committee opinion no. 690: carrier screening in the age of genomic medicine [^115VPiy7]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Glossary — definitions for carrier screening terminology include the following. Ashkenazi Jewish refers to individuals whose Jewish relatives originate from Eastern or Central Europe. Carrier screening is genetic testing performed on an individual who does not have any symptoms of a particular genetic disorder but may have one abnormal allele for the gene that is associated with the disorder. Consanguinity is a union between two individuals who are second cousins or closer in family relationship. Ethnic-based screening is disease screening targeted at high-risk populations, such as screening individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent for Tay–Sachs disease. Expanded carrier screening is disease screening that evaluates an individual's carrier state for multiple conditions at once and regardless of ethnicity. Panethnic screening means individuals are screened regardless of their ethnic background, with an example being the current recommendation for screening every pregnant woman for cystic fibrosis once during her lifetime. Prevalence is the percentage of a population affected by a particular disease at a particular time, and residual risk is a calculated risk that an individual carries an abnormal allele after a negative screening test result.

Genetic conditions in individuals of Eastern and Central European Jewish descent — mixed-ancestry couples should follow a staged approach: When only one partner is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, that individual should be offered screening first, and if a carrier is identified, the other partner should be offered screening. Couples should be informed that the carrier frequency and detection rate in non-Jewish individuals are unknown for most disorders except for Tay–Sachs disease and cystic fibrosis, and therefore it is difficult to accurately predict the couple's risk of having a child with the disorder.

Carrier screening timing and partner management — prepregnancy carrier screening is ideal because it provides patients with the opportunity to learn their carrier status and allows partners to discover if both are carriers before pregnancy; if a woman is found to be a carrier, her reproductive partner should be offered screening, and additional genetic counseling should be provided to discuss the specific condition, residual risk, and prenatal testing options; if a carrier couple is identified before pregnancy, genetic counseling is encouraged so that reproductive options can be discussed.

### ACOG committee opinion. number 298, August 2004. prenatal and preconceptional carrier screening for genetic diseases in individuals of Eastern European jewish descent [^115EmZpR]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Certain autosomal recessive disease conditions are more prevalent in individuals of Eastern European Jewish (Ashkenazi) descent. Previously, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended that individuals of Eastern European Jewish ancestry be offered carrier screening for Tay-Sachs disease, Canavan disease, and cystic fibrosis as part of routine obstetric care. Based on the criteria used to justify offering carrier screening for Tay-Sachs disease, Canavan disease, and cystic fibrosis, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Committee on Genetics recommends that couples of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry also should be offered carrier screening for familial dysautonomia. Individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent may inquire about the availability of carrier screening for other disorders. Carrier screening is available for mucolipidosis IV Niemann-Pick disease type A, Fanconi anemia group C, Bloom syndrome, and Gaucher's disease.

### Committee opinion no. 691: carrier screening for genetic conditions [^112chXVn]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Carrier screening — general principles emphasize informed choice, timing, partner testing, and documentation: Information about genetic carrier screening should be provided to every pregnant woman, and after counseling, a patient may decline any or all screening. Carrier screening and counseling ideally should be performed before pregnancy to enable consideration of reproductive options, including advanced reproductive technologies. If an individual is found to be a carrier, the individual's reproductive partner should be offered testing, and concurrent screening of the patient and her partner is suggested when timelines for prenatal diagnostic decisions are constrained. If both partners are carriers, genetic counseling should be offered and prenatal diagnosis and advanced reproductive technologies to decrease the risk of an affected offspring should be discussed. Prenatal carrier screening does not replace newborn screening, nor does newborn screening replace the potential value of prenatal carrier screening. Carriers' relatives are at increased risk, patients should be encouraged to inform relatives, and clinicians should not disclose this information without the patient's permission. Family history, including ethnic background and any known consanguinity, is important for risk assessment; individuals with a positive family history should be offered carrier screening and may benefit from genetic counseling, ideally with information on the specific mutation. Carrier screening for a particular condition generally should be performed only once and documented in the health record, and any decision to rescreen should be undertaken only with the guidance of a genetics professional who can assess the incremental benefit of repeat testing for additional mutations.

Carrier screening — condition-specific recommendations indicate that all patients who are considering pregnancy or are already pregnant, regardless of screening strategy and ethnicity, should be offered carrier screening for cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy, as well as a complete blood count and screening for thalassemias and hemoglobinopathies. Fragile X premutation carrier screening is recommended for women with a family history of fragile X-related disorders or intellectual disability suggestive of fragile X syndrome, or women with a personal history of ovarian insufficiency, and additional screening also may be indicated based on family history or specific ethnicity. Couples with consanguinity should be offered genetic counseling to discuss the increased risk of recessive conditions being expressed in their offspring and the limitations and benefits of carrier screening. Carrier screening will not identify all individuals who are at risk of the screened conditions.

It includes "All women who are considering pregnancy" for cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy. For fragile X, it specifies "Any woman with a family history of fragile X–related disorders or intellectual disability suggestive of fragile X syndrome and any woman younger than the age of 40 with unexplained ovarian insufficiency", and notes that "Women without risk factors who request fragile X screening may be tested after informed consent". For hemoglobinopathies, "Couples at risk of having a child with thalassemia or sickle cell disease should be offered genetic counseling to review prenatal testing and reproduction options". For Tay–Sachs disease, "If either member of the couple is of Ashkenazi Jewish, French–Canadian, or Cajun descent; those with a family history consistent with Tay–Sachs disease also should be offered screening", and "Biochemical testing can be altered in women who are pregnant or using oral contraceptive pills, so leukocyte testing must be used in these patients".

Carrier screening baseline recommendations — universal and risk-based elements are outlined: Expanded carrier screening does not replace previous risk-based screening recommendations, and if obstetrician–gynecologists or other health care providers do not offer expanded carrier screening in their practice, screening recommendations for individual disorders should follow guidelines for carrier screening as outlined in Committee Opinion No. 691, Carrier Screening for Genetic Conditions. All patients who are considering pregnancy or are already pregnant, regardless of screening strategy and ethnicity, should be offered carrier screening for cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy, as well as a complete blood count and screening for thalassemias and hemoglobinopathies. Fragile X premutation carrier screening is recommended for women with a family history of fragile X-related disorders or intellectual disability suggestive of fragile X syndrome, or women with a personal history of ovarian insufficiency, and additional screening also may be indicated based on family history or specific ethnicity, including screening for a limited number of specific diseases in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish, African, Mediterranean, or Southeast Asian ancestry and screening individuals with a family history of or risk factors for genetic diseases.

### Committee opinion no. 690: carrier screening in the age of genomic medicine [^112jP7t4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Carrier screening in the age of genomic medicine — general approach and counseling states that ethnic-specific, panethnic, and expanded carrier screening are acceptable strategies for prepregnancy and prenatal carrier screening, and each obstetrician–gynecologist or other health care provider or practice should establish a standard approach that is consistently offered to and discussed with each patient, ideally before pregnancy. Screening for any condition is optional, and after counseling, a patient may decline any or all carrier screening; if a patient requests a screening strategy other than the one used by the obstetrician–gynecologist or other health care provider, the requested test should be made available to her after counseling on its limitations, benefits, and alternatives. Expanded carrier screening does not replace previous risk-based screening recommendations, and the determination of the appropriate screening approach should be based on the patient's family history and personal values after counseling. Referral to an obstetrician–gynecologist or other health care provider with genetics expertise should be considered for risk assessment, evaluation, and consideration of diagnostic testing as indicated for any patient with a family history of a genetic condition or concern for a genetic diagnosis. Carrier screening will not identify all individuals who are at risk of the screened conditions, and patients should be counseled regarding the residual risk with any test result.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 762: prepregnancy counseling [^1115QTqC]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Prepregnancy counseling — family and genetic history indicates that a genetic and family history of the patient and her partner should be obtained. When any genetic disease carrier status is diagnosed in one or both partners, full medical records review and genetic counseling are recommended to educate the patient on the effects of the disease and the potential options for pregenancy and early pregnancy screening of offspring. Women who present for prepregnancy counseling should be offered screening for the same genetic conditions as recommended for pregnant women, though insurance coverage for screening may be lacking and may be a barrier for some patients. Screening in the prepregnancy period offers the additional advantages of identifying, before pregnancy, couples at risk of having children with genetic diseases and offering appropriate testing to optimize patient education, counseling, and options for achieving pregnancy.

### "Is It worth knowing? " focus group participants' perceived utility of genomic preconception carrier screening [^1157rVGd]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Compared to existing carrier screening technologies, genome sequencing offers substantially more information for reproductive decision-making. Mendelian recessive or x-linked conditions, despite being individually rare, impact as many as 2% of live births. These conditions have an important impact on the health of affected children and account for about 20% of infant mortality and about 10% of pediatric hospitalizations (Costa et al; Kumar et al; Berry et al.). Numerous conditions could be considered for carrier screening, with more than 1000 known autosomal recessive or x-linked conditions in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database. This substantial genetic heterogeneity means that a large proportion of the genome must be evaluated to assess carrier status across all possible conditions. However, current clinical practice is generally limited to evaluating a small number of genes. Carrier screening is more widespread for conditions like Cystic Fibrosis (CF), which is recommended to be offered to all couples considering pregnancy in the U.S. (Grody et al; American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee on Genetics), beta-thalassemia, for which population screening programs have been implemented in countries with a higher prevalence such as Greece, Italy, and Cyprus (Cao et al; Cousens et al.), or Tay Sachs disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population (Kaback). However, pre-conception carrier testing is mostly offered only in specific situations that confer an increased risk. It is typically offered to family members of an identified carrier or affected individual, and members of ethnic or racial groups known to have a higher prevalence of a condition (ACOG Committee on Genetics; American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee on Genetics).

### Preconception risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease [^115QWGTt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Globally, about five per cent of children are born with congenital or genetic disorders. The most common autosomal recessive conditions are thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease, with higher carrier rates in specific patient populations. Identifying and counselling couples at genetic risk of the conditions before pregnancy enables them to make fully informed reproductive decisions, with some of these choices not being available if genetic counselling is only offered in an antenatal setting. This is an update of a previously published review.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of systematic preconception genetic risk assessment to improve reproductive outcomes in women and their partners who are identified as carriers of thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease in healthcare settings when compared to usual care.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Registers. In addition, we searched for all relevant trials from 1970 (or the date at which the database was first available if after 1970) to date using electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO), clinical trial databases (National Institutes of Health, Clinical Trials Search portal of the World Health Organization, metaRegister of controlled clinical trials), and hand searching of key journals and conference abstract books from 1998 to date (European Journal of Human Genetics, Genetics in Medicine, Journal of Community Genetics). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles, reviews and guidelines and also contacted subject experts in the field to request any unpublished or other published trials. Date of latest search of the registers: 20 June 2017. Date of latest search of all other sources: 16 November 2017.

Selection Criteria

Any randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials (published or unpublished) comparing reproductive outcomes of systematic preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease when compared to usual care.

Data Collection and Analysis

We identified 25 papers, describing 16 unique trials which were potentially eligible for inclusion in the review. However, after assessment, no randomised controlled trials of preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease were found.

Main Results

No randomised controlled trials of preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease were included. One ongoing trial has been identified which may potentially eligible for inclusion once completed.

Authors' Conclusions

As no randomised controlled trials of preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, or Tay-Sachs disease were found for inclusion in this review, the research evidence for current policy recommendations is limited to non-randomised studies. Information from well-designed, adequately powered, randomised trials is desirable in order to make more robust recommendations for practice. However, such trials must also consider the legal, ethical, and cultural barriers to implementation of preconception genetic risk assessment.

### Expanded carrier screening for reproductive risk assessment: an evidence-based practice guideline from the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^115eY85z]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2023). High credibility.

Expanded carrier screening (ECS) — incidental findings and sequencing versus genotyping: Incidental findings in ECS for reproductive risk assessment in otherwise healthy adults who can consent to testing should be defined as the following: (1) heterozygous variants, which carry health risks unrelated to the disease caused by variants in a compound heterozygous, homozygous, or hemizygous configuration; (2) heterozygous variants, which confer a risk for symptoms similar or related to the disease caused by variants in a compound heterozygous, homozygous, or hemizygous configuration; or (3) variants, which may diagnose an inherited disease in a person who may not be seeking a diagnosis, and patients should be made aware of this possibility through the informed consent process. When sequencing technology is utilized for ECS, identification of variants with "less severe" presentations is possible, genotyping assays have varied detection rates across groups — such as cystic fibrosis carrier detection rates ranging from 43% in Asian Americans to 88% in Ashkenazi Jews when a 23-mutation panel is used — and therefore the risk of mild variant identification through sequencing is preferable to the risk of variant non-identification through genotyping.

### The evolving landscape of expanded carrier screening: challenges and opportunities [^117PKhoh]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

What is the preferred timing for screening?

There is widespread consensus among professional societies and most commenters that the ideal time to offer carrier screening is preconception, as this allows for more options (e.g. avoiding pregnancy or using advanced reproductive technologies to conceive) than does screening during a pregnancy. Additionally, current guidance documents suggest that screening of both individuals in a couple may take place either sequentially or concurrently, but concurrent screening may be recommended if there are time constraints that could limit the reproductive actionability of the results — for example, if screening is done during a pregnancy.

While preconception care is widely recognized as an important service, most women do not receive these services currently. In the United States, data from selected states indicate that only 33% of women with a recent live birth had a discussion with a health-care professional prior to their pregnancy about improving their health. A review of CF carrier screening studies found lower uptake of screening in the preconception setting than in prenatal care despite a general belief that preconception is the ideal timing, which the authors attributed to many individuals' lack of interest in screening prior to conception. For expanded carrier screening to be delivered as part of preconception care, couples would need to approach planning for pregnancy differently.

### Committee opinion no. 691: carrier screening for genetic conditions [^116b5HmG]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Carrier screening for genetic conditions — when an individual is found to be a carrier for a genetic condition, the individual's relatives are at risk of carrying the same mutation, and the patient should be encouraged to inform his or her relatives of the risk and the availability of carrier screening; the obstetrician–gynecologist or other health care provider should not disclose this information without permission from the patient. It is important to obtain the family history of the patient and, if possible, her partner as a screening tool for inherited risk, and the family history should include the ethnic background of family members as well as any known consanguinity.

### Genetic ancestry analysis on > 93, 000 individuals undergoing expanded carrier screening reveals limitations of ethnicity-based medical guidelines [^1148MBmq]. Genetics in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Carrier screening identifies couples at increased risk for conceiving fetuses affected by serious conditions that appreciably reduce lifespan, result in intellectual disability, and/or benefit from prenatal or perinatal intervention. Carrier screening is typically performed by first identifying female partners who are carriers for autosomal recessive and/or X-linked conditions, and subsequently testing their reproductive partners for condition(s) for which the female was a carrier. A couple is considered at risk if the female carries a pathogenic variant that would cause an X-linked disease in a male child or if both partners are carriers of pathogenic variants in the same gene associated with an autosomal recessive disease.

Current professional guidelines by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommend pan-ethnic carrier screening for cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy. – In addition, these two professional societies have long recommended carrier screening for a partially overlapping and expanded set of conditions based on a patient's self-reported ethnicity (SRE).

### Preconception risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease [^117CFVX7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Globally, about 6% of children are born with a serious birth defect of genetic or partially genetic origin. Carrier screening or testing is one way to identify couples at increased risk of having a child with an autosomal recessive condition. The most common autosomal recessive conditions are thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease, with higher carrier rates in high-risk populations of specific ancestral backgrounds. Identifying and counselling couples at genetic risk of the conditions before pregnancy enables them to make fully informed reproductive decisions, with some of these choices not being available if testing is only offered in an antenatal setting. This is an update of a previously published review.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of systematic preconception genetic risk assessment to enable autonomous reproductive choice and to improve reproductive outcomes in women and their partners who are both identified as carriers of thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease in healthcare settings when compared to usual care.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Registers. Date of latest search of the registers: 04 August 2021. In addition, we searched for all relevant trials from 1970 (or the date at which the database was first available if after 1970) to date using electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO), clinical trial databases (National Institutes of Health, Clinical Trials Search portal of the World Health Organization, metaRegister of controlled clinical trials), and hand searching of key journals and conference abstract books from 1998 to date (European Journal of Human Genetics, Genetics in Medicine, Journal of Community Genetics). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles, reviews and guidelines and also contacted subject experts in the field to request any unpublished or other published trials. Date of latest search of all these sources: 25 June 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: Any randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs (published or unpublished) comparing reproductive outcomes of systematic preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease when compared to usual care.

Data Collection and Analysis

We identified 37 papers, describing 22 unique trials which were potentially eligible for inclusion in the review. However, after assessment, we found no RCTs of preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease.

Main Results

No RCTs of preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease are included. A trial identified earlier has published its results and has subsequently been listed as excluded in this review.

Authors' Conclusions

As there are no RCTs of preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, or Tay-Sachs disease included in either the earlier or current versions of this review, we recommend considering potential non-RCTs studies (for example prospective cohorts or before-and-after studies) for future reviews. While RCTs are desirable to inform evidence-based practice and robust recommendations, the ethical, legal and social implications associated with using this trial design to evaluate the implementation of preconception genetic risk assessment involving carrier testing and reproductive autonomy must also be considered. In addition, rather than focusing on single gene-by-gene carrier testing for specific autosomal-recessive conditions as the intervention being evaluated, preconception expanded genetic screening should also be included in future searches as this has received much attention in recent years as a more pragmatic strategy. The research evidence for current international policy recommendations is limited to non-randomised studies.

Carrier screening for genetic conditions — information about genetic carrier screening should be provided to every pregnant woman, and after counseling, a patient may decline any or all screening. Carrier screening and counseling ideally should be performed before pregnancy. If an individual is found to be a carrier for a specific condition, the individual's reproductive partner should be offered testing in order to receive informed genetic counseling about potential reproductive outcomes, and concurrent screening of the patient and her partner is suggested if there are time constraints for decisions about prenatal diagnostic evaluation. If both partners are found to be carriers of a genetic condition, genetic counseling should be offered, and prenatal diagnosis and advanced reproductive technologies to decrease the risk of an affected offspring should be discussed.

### Committee opinion no. 690: carrier screening in the age of genomic medicine [^1134rfSY]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Carrier screening strategies and practice approach — ethnic-specific, panethnic, and expanded carrier screening are acceptable strategies for pregnancy and preconception carrier screening, and in the past, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has advocated for ethnic-based screening. Expanded carrier screening panels offered by laboratories typically include options to screen from 5–10 conditions to as many as several hundred conditions, and traditionally, panethnic screening has been defined as making screening for specific recommended conditions available to all patients, regardless of ethnic or racial background; this approach largely has been supplanted by expanded carrier screening because of its efficiency and economy. Because all of these are acceptable strategies, each obstetrician–gynecologist or other health care provider or practice should establish a standard approach that is consistently offered to and discussed with each patient, ideally before pregnancy, and if a patient requests a screening strategy other than the one used by the obstetrician–gynecologist or other health care provider, the requested test should be made available to her after counseling on its limitations, benefits, and alternatives; couples with consanguinity should be offered genetic counseling to discuss the increased risk of recessive conditions being expressed in their offspring and the limitations and benefits of carrier screening.

### Clinical utility of expanded carrier screening: results-guided actionability and outcomes [^113VEjRF]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Serious recessive and X-linked conditions affect an estimated 1 in 300 pregnancies. However, universal screening for only the two conditions recommended by current guidelines, cystic fibrosis (CF) and spinal muscular atrophy, – misses nearly 70% of carriers of rare diseaseand fails to detect between 13% and 94% of pregnancies affected with profound and severe conditions, depending on ethnicity. Expanded carrier screening (ECS), i.e. testing reproductive partners' carrier status for a large number of recessive and X-linked conditions without regard to ethnicity, addresses this gap. When ECS is undertaken during the preconception period, results enable interventions to avoid affected pregnancies, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) with preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic conditions (PGT-M); and when undertaken during the prenatal period, results facilitate prenatal diagnostic testing (PNDx; amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling, CVS) and pregnancy management (including termination). The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recognizes ECS as an acceptable strategy for carrier screening, and together with American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, the Society for Maternal–Fetal Medicine, the National Society of Genetic Counselors, and the Perinatal Quality Foundation, acknowledges the unique benefits and considerations of ECS.

### Committee opinion no. 690 summary: carrier screening in the age of genomic medicine [^111SbuL9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Carrier screening, whether targeted or expanded, allows individuals to consider their range of reproductive options. Ultimately, the goal of genetic screening is to provide individuals with meaningful information that they can use to guide pregnancy planning based on their personal values. Ethnic-specific, panethnic, and expanded carrier screening are acceptable strategies for prepregnancy and prenatal carrier screening. Because all of these are acceptable strategies, each obstetrician-gynecologist or other health care provider or practice should establish a standard approach that is consistently offered to and discussed with each patient, ideally before pregnancy. Carrier screening will not identify all individuals who are at risk of the screened conditions. Patients should be counseled regarding the residual risk with any test result. Screening for any condition is optional and, after counseling, a patient may decline any or all carrier screening. If a patient requests a screening strategy other than the one used by the obstetrician-gynecologist or other health care provider, the requested test should be made available to her after counseling on its limitations, benefits, and alternatives. Expanded carrier screening does not replace previous risk-based screening recommendations. The determination of the appropriate screening approach for any individual patient should be based on the patient's family history and personal values after counseling. Referral to an obstetrician-gynecologist or other health care provider with genetics expertise should be considered for risk assessment, evaluation, and consideration of diagnostic testing as indicated for any patient with a family history of a genetic condition or concern for a genetic diagnosis.

### The evolving landscape of expanded carrier screening: challenges and opportunities [^117UG92u]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Carrier screening allows individuals to learn their chance of passing on an autosomal or X-linked condition to their offspring. Initially introduced as single-disease, ancestry-based screening, technological advances now allow for the possibility of multi-disease, pan-ethnic carrier screening, which we refer to as "expanded carrier screening". There are numerous potential benefits to expanded carrier screening, including maximizing the opportunity for couples to make autonomous reproductive decisions, and efficiency and marginal additional costs of including more conditions if the test is already being offered. While numerous laboratories currently offer expanded carrier screening services, it is not yet commonly used in clinical practice, and there is a lack of consensus among experts about the service, including whether this should be offered to individuals and couples, whether this should be offered preconception or prenatally, and what conditions to include in screening programs. Challenges for expanded carrier screening programs include a lack of demand from the public, low prioritization by health systems, the potential for pressure to undergo screening, the possibility of disability-based discrimination, needed adaptations to pre- and post-test counseling, technical limitations, and the evolving technological and socio-political landscape.

### Cystic fibrosis prenatal screening in genetic counseling practice: recommendations of the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^116SJBJN]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2005). Low credibility.

For over a decade, prenatal screening for cystic fibrosis (CF) has been considered a model for the integration of genetic testing into routine medical practice. Data from pilot studies and public policy discourse have led to recommendations by some professional organizations that CF screening should be offered or made available to pregnant women and their partners, and to couples planning a pregnancy. It is crucial that genetic counselors gain thorough understanding of the complexities of CF and the implications of positive test results, so that they may serve as a reliable, educated referral base and resource for health care providers and their patients. While not all pregnant women will be referred for genetic counseling prior to CF carrier testing, genetic counselors often will be asked to counsel clients after they have a positive test result, or who are found to be at increased risk. Genetic counselors can play an important role in providing accurate and current information as well as support for patients' informed decisions. These recommendations were created by a multicenter working group of genetic counselors with expertise in CF and are based on personal clinical experience, review of pertinent English language medical articles, and reports of expert committees. The recommendations should not be construed as dictating an exclusive course of management, nor does the use of such recommendations guarantee a particular outcome. These recommendations do not displace a health care provider's professional judgment based on the clinical circumstances of a particular client.

### Committee opinion no. 691: carrier screening for genetic conditions [^111eh7NJ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis — epidemiology and screening performance — has an incidence of 1 in 2,500 in the non-Hispanic white population, a current median predicted survival of approximately 42 years, and more than 95% of affected males have primary infertility; it is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene located on chromosome 7. Screening test sensitivity varies by ethnicity, ranging from less than 50% in those of Asian ancestry to 94% in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, and a negative screening result reduces but does not eliminate the chance of being a cystic fibrosis carrier and having an affected offspring.

### Feasibility of couple-based expanded carrier screening offered by general practitioners [^116iCMYP]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and recommendations

This GP-provided couple-based ECS test for a limited number of severe AR conditions in the setting of preconception care, presents a timely and responsible option to inform couples planning a pregnancy about their chances of having a child affected by a severe genetic condition. This approach was not only feasible in our setting, but also led to an informed choice for most participants. Future national implementation could involve other dedicated GPs, or other primary HCPs willing to be trained to provide the test, given that support as well as practical tools from a clinical genetics service are available. Furthermore, some factors identified in our study should be considered, such as raising public awareness to facilitate a well-informed population and resolution of reimbursement issues. Our approach, that was feasible in the (northern) Netherlands, might be transferable to other (European) public health systems with easily accessible primary health providers who are willing to be trained and have the necessary resources to offer ECS.

### Committee opinion no. 690: carrier screening in the age of genomic medicine [^111Ev3EB]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Carrier screening counseling and partner testing — if a woman is found to be a carrier for a specific condition, her reproductive partner should be offered screening to provide accurate genetic counseling for the couple with regard to the risk of having an affected child. Additional genetic counseling should be provided to discuss the specific condition, residual risk, and options for prenatal testing, and if a carrier couple (ie, carriers for the same condition) is identified before pregnancy, genetic counseling is encouraged so that reproductive options (eg, donor gametes, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, prenatal diagnosis) can be discussed. Individuals with a family history of a genetic disorder may benefit from the identification of the specific familial mutation or mutations rather than carrier screening, and knowledge of the specific familial mutation may allow for more specific and rapid prenatal diagnosis. Prenatal carrier screening does not replace newborn screening, nor does newborn screening diminish the potential benefit of prenatal carrier screening, and screening for any condition is optional and, after counseling, a patient may decline any or all carrier screening.

Expanded carrier screening (ECS) — preconception reproductive decision-making: In a preconception cohort, 77% of clients were reported to have planned or pursued actions to minimize the risk of an affected pregnancy, but most were already undergoing or planning in vitro fertilization (IVF) at the time of ECS results and the study population was primarily White/European; thus, it is unclear how many individuals in the general population may change reproductive decision-making or have access to all reproductive options after ECS results alone.

### Molecular testing for cystic fibrosis carrier status practice guidelines: recommendations of the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^113h2kiR]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To provide practice recommendations for genetic counselors whose clients are considering cystic fibrosis (CF) carrier testing or seeking information regarding CF molecular test results. The goals of these recommendations are to: 1) Provide updated information about the natural history, diagnosis, and treatment of CF and related conditions. 2) Supplement genetic counselors' knowledge and understanding of the available carrier screening and diagnostic testing options. 3) Describe the current state of genotype/phenotype correlations for CFTR mutations and an approach to interpreting both novel and previously described variants. 4) Provide a framework for genetic counselors to assist clients' decision-making regarding CF carrier testing, prenatal diagnosis, and pregnancy management. Disclaimer The practice guidelines of the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) are developed by members of the NSGC to assist genetic counselors and other health care providers in making decisions about appropriate management of genetic concerns; including access to and/or delivery of services. Each practice guideline focuses on a clinical or practice-based issue, and is the result of a review and analysis of current professional literature believed to be reliable. As such, information and recommendations within the NSGC practice guidelines reflect the current scientific and clinical knowledge at the time of publication, are only current as of their publication date, and are subject to change without notice as advances emerge. In addition, variations in practice, which take into account the needs of the individual patient and the resources and limitations unique to the institution or type of practice, may warrant approaches, treatments and/or procedures that differ from the recommendations outlined in this guideline. Therefore, these recommendations should not be construed as dictating an exclusive course of management, nor does the use of such recommendations guarantee a particular outcome. Genetic counseling practice guidelines are never intended to displace a health care provider's best medical judgment based on the clinical circumstances of a particular patient or patient population. Practice guidelines are published by NSGC for educational and informational purposes only, and NSGC does not "approve" or "endorse" any specific methods, practices, or sources of information.

### The improvement of the best practice guidelines for preimplantation genetic diagnosis of cystic fibrosis: toward an international consensus [^113KbszC]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Concluding remarks

This meeting organized on behalf of EuroGentest has highlighted important variation among the participating countries both in technical protocols and in the counseling of couples. It emphasized the need to pursue harmonization and quality assurance, preferably through some form of internationally or nationally recognized accreditation. Given the complexity of phenotype and genotype relationships, the extremely high number of variants found in the CFTR gene, and the reclassification of some variants as (non)-pathogenic as more data become available, genetic counseling is mandatory, and less common variants should be reviewed with CFTR experts before acceptance of a PGD CF request.

### The evolving landscape of expanded carrier screening: challenges and opportunities [^112xr2Sq]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Carrier screening programs were introduced in the 1970s to offer individuals the opportunity to learn the likelihood that they could pass on an autosomal or X-linked condition to their offspring. Initially, carrier screening programs were used only with ethnic groups who had relatively high incidence of certain conditions, such as ancestry-based screening for Tay–Sachs disease in Ashkenazi Jewish communities and β-thalassemia in Mediterranean populations. After the 1989 identification of the gene associated with cystic fibrosis (CF), CF screening became available, and by the late 1990s the professional consensus was that it should be offered to all individuals or couples seeking prenatal or preconception care. Subsequently, several professional guidance documents have been issued in support of pan-ethnic CF screening. – This move has been motivated in part by the difficulty of assigning individuals to a single ethnicity and determining who is at risk for ancestry-based screening, and to provide more equitable access to carrier screening services. Throughout the past decade, it has become increasingly common to offer carrier screening to the general preconception and prenatal populations. – For example, in some parts of the world, pan-ethnic screening is common for hemoglobinopathies and thalassemias, and it has recently been recommended for conditions such as spinal muscular atrophy – and fragile X syndrome.

### Clinical, technical, and environmental biases influencing equitable access to clinical genetics / genomics testing: a points to consider statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^111S2zn8]. Genetics in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

ACMG Statement — carrier screening equity and universal panels — Carrier screening for cystic fibrosis (CF), recommended by ACMG, was initially limited to specific common variants in the CFTR gene. Subsequent studies showed that as high as 30% of non-White CF patients may be homozygous for variants other than the ACMG-recommended list that would have been missed in a routine CF screening of their parents. Because reproductive partners may come from multiancestral backgrounds, necessitating the use of more than 1 specific carrier screening panel, ACMG has recently recommended offering a universal screening panel to all individuals seeking carrier screening regardless of their ancestry.

### Attitudes of cystic fibrosis patients and parents toward carrier screening and related reproductive issues [^115pUPhp]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting autosomal recessive disorder affecting ~1 in 2500–4000 Caucasians. As most CF patients have no family history of the disorder, carrier screening for CF has the potential to prospectively identify couples at risk of conceiving an affected child. At-risk couples may consequently choose to act on the provided information and take steps to avoid the birth of a child with CF. Although carrier screening is widely believed to enhance reproductive autonomy of prospective parents, the practice also raises important ethical questions. A written questionnaire was administered to adult patients and parents of children with CF with the aim to explore participants' attitudes toward CF carrier screening and related reproductive issues. The study population was recruited from a CF patient registry in Belgium and comprised 111 participants (64 parents, 47 patients aged 16 or older). We found that more than 80% of all participants were in favor of preconception carrier screening for CF. However, some were concerned over potential negative consequences of population-wide CF carrier screening. Regarding future reproductive intentions, 43% of the participants indicated a desire to have children. Among these, preimplantation genetic diagnosis was found to be the most preferred reproductive option, closely followed by spontaneous pregnancy and prenatal diagnosis. Although the findings of our study suggest that patients and parents of children with CF support a population-based carrier screening program for CF, they also highlight some issues deserving particular attention when implementing such a program.

### Preconceptional ancestry-based carrier couple screening for cystic fibrosis and haemoglobinopathies: what determines the intention to participate or not and actual participation? [^11654Wh7]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

This paper explores determinants of the intention to participate or not and of actual participation in preconceptional ancestry-based carrier couple screening for cystic fibrosis (CF) and haemoglobinopathies (HbPs). In total, 9453 individuals from a multi-ethnic population were invited. Invitees who had a partner and who were planning a pregnancy were the target population (33–36%). Test participation was conditional on survey participation. Those who refrained from test participation were asked to participate in the survey only. The questionnaire was based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour, which explains behaviour through intention. It was completed by 418 survey participants: 171 who intended to participate in the testing, and 247 who refrained from test participation. Both test intenders and offer decliners generally had a positive attitude towards test participation, and perceived high behavioural control. This applied to Western and non-Western survey participants equally. Offer decliners, however, perceived less control in terms of the time and effort needed for participation. Still, 68% of them intended to participate in the future if the screening would be offered routinely. Test intenders more often would draw reproductive consequences from test results, perceived a higher risk of being a carrier, more benefits and less adverse psychological outcomes. Feelings of stigmatisation were not an important issue, but 14% thought that there would be discrimination against carriers: among them more were non-Western survey participants. Preconceptional ancestry-based CF and HbPs carrier screening was evaluated as positive and desirable among Western and non-Western survey participants. The effort and time needed for participation were important reasons for declining participation, which might be overcome by improving access to the screening.

### Changing trends in carrier screening for genetic disease in the United States [^114DTbGU]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Screening for genetic disease has been a long established part of preconception and prenatal care. One model for carrier screening has been the community wide screening programs for Tay–Sachs disease (TSD) established in the 1970s. 2 These programs focused on a single severe disease that had an increased carrier frequency in a recognized ethnic group, Eastern European Ashkenazi Jews. Wide implementation of these programs has significantly reduced the incidence of TSD in this ethnic group, with the majority of affected infants currently being from other ethnic groups.

Another disorder that has been widely screened for is cystic fibrosis (CF). It has been over a decade since the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) initiated guidelines for prenatal and preconception carrier screening of cystic fibrosis. Initial guidelines recommended screening Caucasian individuals or those with a family history of cystic fibrosis. In April 2011, the ACOG Committee on Genetics updated their CF screening guidelines, stating that it has become increasingly difficult to classify individuals with CF into distinct ethnic categories. 3 The Committee agreed that it is reasonable to offer CF to all couples planning a pregnancy because it allows them to consider all reproductive options, including pre‐implantation genetic diagnosis, prenatal diagnosis, gamete donation, or adoption.

Given the long history of carrier screening, there are still relatively few guidelines available to providers, resulting in inconsistent practices. In addition, there are conflicting recommendations among organizations (ACOG, ACMG) that have published guidelines. Both organizations recommend screening for cystic fibrosis, Ashkenazi Jewish disorders, and Tay–Sachs disease but ACMG list more disorders on its 'Jewish' panel. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ACOG also recommends ethnicity‐based screening for hemoglobinopathies. 8 Only ACMG recommends screening for spinal muscular atrophy. 9 Neither organization recommends screening for fragile X syndrome, unless the family history suggests it or the patient specifically requests it. 10, 11

Outside of the United States guidelines are more limited. Australia supports universal screening for cystic fibrosis carriers in pregnancy, while guidelines in Canada and United Kingdom do not support this approach. 12, 13, 14 These guidelines are in part driven by cost considerations, and the current availability of cost‐effective gene panels suggests the need to revisit the way screening is offered to patients.

### Laboratory testing for preconception / prenatal carrier screening: a technical standard of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^115T6Eav]. Genetics in Medicine (2024). High credibility.

ACMG technical standard — reproductive risk communication in carrier screening reports should include a brief clinical description and risk statements for both positive and negative findings. When reporting positive results from carrier screening, the report should include a brief clinical description of the disorder, including its penetrance if known and variability in expression if understood. A statement about reproductive risk should be included when a heterozygote is identified, and we encourage laboratories to include a general statement regarding reproductive risk under both circumstances, (1) when a heterozygote is identified and (2) when a heterozygote is not identified. For a heterozygote, the likelihood of an affected child requires that the child receives (1) the allele from the heterozygous parent identified and (2) a second allele from the reproductive partner; offspring with 2 alleles considered to be pathogenic or likely pathogenic may in some cases either not manifest the condition (reduced penetrance) or manifest a condition in a variable way (variable expressivity), and for these reasons, genetic counseling is recommended when an individual or family is at risk. For negative results, residual risk represents the risk that remains after a negative screening test result, high-throughput, pan-ethnic carrier screening poses difficulties in stating the precise residual risk for many conditions simultaneously, and when a patient tests negative for any condition, it is important to recognize that the risk of carrying a clinically important variant is never zero; therefore, before testing, patients should understand that a negative test result does not eliminate the possibility of a genetic condition in their offspring, although patients should understand that screening reduces the identifiable risk for screened conditions by orders of magnitude.

### The clinical content of preconception care: genetics and genomics [^114MXy1v]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

The prevalence of paternal and maternal genetic conditions that affect pregnancy varies according to many factors that include parental age, medical history, and family history. Although some genetic conditions that affect pregnancy are identified easily early in life, other conditions are not and may require additional diagnostic testing. A complete 3-generation family medical history that includes ethnicity information about both sides of the family is arguably the single best genetic "test" that is applicable to preconception care. Assessment of genetic risk by an experienced professional has been shown to improve the detection rate of identifiable risk factors. Learning about possible genetic issues in the preconception period is ideal, because knowledge permits patients to make informed reproductive decisions. Options that are available to couples before conception include adoption, surrogacy, use of donor sperm, in vitro fertilization after preimplantation genetic diagnosis, and avoidance of pregnancy. Future technologic advances will increase the choices that are available to couples.

### Evaluation of cystic fibrosis carrier screening programs according to genetic screening criteria [^113C3mWa]. Genetics in Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Genetic screening programs should meet certain criteria before they can be introduced into the community. The aim of this study was to discuss pilot studies for cystic fibrosis (CF) carrier screening before and during pregnancy in the light of important genetic screening criteria. Overall, CF carrier screening meets the prerequisites that justify screening. However, more specific criteria for the development of screening programs were not always taken into consideration. Most project leaders concentrated on uptake as an important outcome, and less on informed decision-making. To further investigate the long-term psychological and social effects of genetic screening, continuous monitoring of screening projects is recommended.

### Ashkenazi jewish screening in the twenty-first century [^115U1jMZ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Ashkenazi Jewish genetic screening has expanded significantly in the past 4 decades. Individuals of Eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish (AJ) descent are at increased risk of having offspring with particular genetic diseases that have significant morbidity and mortality. In addition, there are some disorders, such as cystic fibrosis, for which northern European Caucasians are at comparable risk with those of an AJ background. Carrier screening for many of these Jewish genetic disorders has become standard of care. As technology advances, so does the number of disorders for which screening is available. Thus, we need to continue to be cognizant of informed consent, test sensitivity, confidentiality, prenatal diagnosis, preimplantation genetic screening, and public health concerns regarding testing.

### Expanded carrier screening for reproductive risk assessment: an evidence-based practice guideline from the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^112gpW2T]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2023). High credibility.

Expanded carrier screening (ECS) — conclusion and conditional recommendation: Expanded carrier screening is a useful tool in family planning and obstetrical care, and to be equitable it should be made accessible to all people considering reproduction, pursuing reproduction, or who may reasonably have the opportunity to reproduce; equitable carrier screening practices rely on the discontinued use of race-based medicine. The use of ECS is conditionally recommended for all reproductive-aged individuals who desire knowledge regarding the risk of infant or early-childhood onset disease in their offspring following an informed consent discussion, and this is a conditional recommendation based on the available evidence and the balance of known benefits and harms. ECS offers the greatest benefit when performed prior to conception, and current clinical practice modifications are necessary to accommodate the optimal implementation of preconception ECS; efforts should be directed to addressing recognized barriers to ECS, including cost/insurance coverage for both members of a reproductive pair, adequate informed consent, provider and patient education needs, and wider access to genetics professionals as needed in the prenatal and preconception periods alike.

### Management of women with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency (phenylketonuria): ACOG committee opinion, number 802 [^116p4g2x]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Risk of genetic transmission and screening in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency — the incidence of PAH deficiency in a population is reported to vary by ethnicity and ranges from 1 in 2,600 to 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 200,000, it is an autosomal recessive disorder, and the carrier frequency is approximately 1 in 50 in those of Northern European descent. All offspring of women with PAH deficiency will minimally be obligate carriers. Prepregnancy carrier screening is recommended for the partner of a patient with PAH deficiency, many expanded carrier screening panels include screening for PAH deficiency with consultation with a health care provider with genetic expertise recommended, and patients with a family member with PAH deficiency should be offered genetic counseling to discuss reproductive risk and appropriate testing options. Prenatal and prepregnancy genetic testing is available if familial mutations are known, detection of fetal PAH variants in cell-free DNA is not recommended, and PAH deficiency is included on statewide newborn screening panels in all 50 states.

### Committee opinion no. 478: family history as a risk assessment tool [^1122PAjW]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Family history plays a critical role in assessing the risk of inherited medical conditions and single gene disorders. Several methods have been established to obtain family medical histories, including the family history questionnaire or checklist and the pedigree. The screening tool selected should be tailored to the practice setting and patient population. It is recommended that all women receive a family history evaluation as a screening tool for inherited risk. Family history information should be reviewed and updated regularly, especially when there are significant changes to family history. Where appropriate, further evaluation should be considered for positive responses, with referral to genetic testing and counseling as needed.

### The improvement of the best practice guidelines for preimplantation genetic diagnosis of cystic fibrosis: toward an international consensus [^112hAqA5]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Inclusion criteria

Multiple occasions arise to detect individuals carrying CFTR variants (Table 3), who may become future candidates for PGD. Some variants are not causing CF but have been included in commercially available population-based carrier screening panels. These kits may be used by accredited and non-accredited laboratories, thus accreditation does not guarantee the non-detection of clinically non-significant variants. Couples may not have been correctly counseled about the risks. Before enrolling a couple for a PGD procedure for CF, it is recommended to evaluate within a multidisciplinary team whether the variants identified in both partners should be considered for PND or PGD. Variants may be grouped in four categories: (i) loss-of-function variants that cause CF disease when paired together; (ii) variants that retain residual CFTR function and are compatible with milder phenotypes such as CFTR-RD; (iii) variants with no clinical consequences; and (iv) variants of unproven or uncertain clinical relevance. A recent survey of genotype and phenotype data from almost 40 000 individuals recorded as 'affected with CF' in the clinical registries in Europe and North America, in conjunction with functional assessment, allowed to redefine the disease liability of 159 common variants in the CFTR gene. However, the disease penetrance of the vast majority of hundreds of rare missense variants identified so far remains unknown. It is therefore recommended to work in close collaboration with specialized clinical geneticists and reference laboratories that have gained considerable knowledge in the interpretation of CFTR variants.

### Pregnancy in women with cystic fibrosis… [^1145Q36i]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Approximately one half of all patients with cystic fibrosis are adults and, as life expectancy increases, issues of sexuality and reproduction become more common. A review by Liaschko and Koren discusses the effect of pregnancy on the mother and fetus when the mother has CF. Many women with CF choose not to have children because of the genetic implications. All husbands or partners of women with CF should be offered genetic screening as part of comprehensive genetic counseling because carrier rates are very high in some populations of northern European descent. Families should be warned that tests are not completely reliable, because more than 500 different mutations are associated with clinical CF, and testing only detects the most common. For the same reason, antenatal testing can give false-negative results. There is no evidence that pregnancy accelerates CF progression clinically or as assessed by changes in forced expiratory volume in one second.

Individual patients may, however, develop serious complications such as pulmonary hypertension or cor pulmonale. Pregnant patients with CF should continue physiotherapy and medication use with adjustment for physiologic changes of pregnancy and concerns about adverse effects on the fetus. Most antibiotics such as penicillins, cyclosporines, and aminoglycosides can be used safely during pregnancy, but tetracyclines should be avoided. Quinolones have not been shown to be teratogenic. Nearly all beta-adrenergic agonists can be used safely during pregnancy. Maternal hypoxia should be avoided because this can lead to fetal growth restriction. Attention must also be given to maternal nutrition. Patients with CF usually have low weight gain during pregnancy. The additional demands of pregnancy may exacerbate malabsorption, gut motility disorders, diabetes, and hepatobiliary disease associated with CF.

Ideally, all patients with CF should be referred to specialized teams for pregnancy management. Opiates and general anesthesia should be avoided during delivery, and epidural anesthesia should be used if analgesia is required. Efforts should be made to avoid prolonged labor, which can exhaust the mother with CF. If necessary, early intervention with instrumental delivery is appropriate. The outcome of pregnancy appears to depend largely on the health of the mother before she became pregnant. No increase in fetal malformations has been reported, and rates of preterm birth have ranged from 5. 9 to 35 percent. Patients with FEV. 1 greater than 80 percent and no Burkholderia cepacia colonization have better outcomes, fewer operative deliveries, and lower rates of preterm birth than more seriously handicapped patients with CF. Pregnancy is likely to be complicated if the mother has pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, or FEV 1 less than 50 percent.

Breastfeeding should only be discouraged if the mother's health is poor. Breast milk from mothers with CF has a lower than normal fat content and lower levels of essential fatty acids, but it does not contain excessive sodium as previously believed. Finally, parents with CF must address the implications of shortened life expectancy. Healthy parenting by people with chronic diseases includes preparation for child rearing and family support when the parent with CF becomes significantly disabled or dies.

### Committee opinion no. 691 summary: carrier screening for genetic conditions [^112WKQrn]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Carrier screening is a term used to describe genetic testing that is performed on an individual who does not have any overt phenotype for a genetic disorder but may have one variant allele within a gene(s) associated with a diagnosis. Information about carrier screening should be provided to every pregnant woman. Carrier screening and counseling ideally should be performed before pregnancy because this enables couples to learn about their reproductive risk and consider the most complete range of reproductive options. A patient may decline any or all screening. When an individual is found to be a carrier for a genetic condition, his or her relatives are at risk of carrying the same mutation. The patient should be encouraged to inform his or her relatives of the risk and the availability of carrier screening. If an individual is found to be a carrier for a specific condition, the patient's reproductive partner should be offered testing in order to receive informed genetic counseling about potential reproductive outcomes. If both partners are found to be carriers of a genetic condition, genetic counseling should be offered. What follows is a detailed discussion of some of the more common genetic conditions for which carrier screening is recommended in at least some segments of the population.

### Expanded carrier screening in the United States: a systematic evidence review exploring client and provider experiences [^116jbP9t]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2022). High credibility.

Expanded carrier screening (ECS) and guideline-based carrier screening (CS) — professional guidance and panel thresholds are as follows: Prior guidance recommended offering CS for cystic fibrosis (CF) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) to all individuals currently pregnant or planning a pregnancy; in 2017 the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) endorsed both CS and ECS as acceptable with a carrier frequency of ≥ 1 in 100 as a useful threshold for inclusion on an ECS panel, and a tiered American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) approach includes 97 autosomal recessive (AR) and 16 X-linked (XL) conditions with greater than a 1 in 200 carrier frequency, while more extensive CS for conditions with less than a 1 in 200 carrier frequency should be reserved for consanguineous pairs or when warranted by family or personal history.

### Cystic fibrosis newborn screening: a systematic review-driven consensus guideline from the United States Cystic Fibrosis Foundation [^111fkhg4]. International Journal of Neonatal Screening (2025). High credibility.

Cystic fibrosis newborn screening (CF NBS) rationale — equity and sensitivity target: There are currently no consensus recommendations to guide best practices for CF NBS in the US. A reasonable goal for newborn screening programs is a 95% sensitivity or true-positive detection rate for all infants with cystic fibrosis, with equitable ascertainment within major ancestral sub-populations based on known CFTR variants. This threshold has precedence from the European CF Society guidelines and the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recommendations for CF carrier screening, which specifies that 95% detection must be achieved within the major ancestral groups in the US as defined by the US Census, and testing frequency and communication strategies should be considered in NBS best practices in addition to IRT and molecular testing.

### Updated recommendations for CFTR carrier screening: a position statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^113WiHBs]. Genetics in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

ACMG CFTR carrier screening — historical minimum variant set and testing scope: The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) "recommended a set of 25 pathogenic variants, later reduced to 23 pathogenic variants", and this minimum set "(often referred to as the 'ACMG-23')" has remained unchanged. In 2020, ACMG "recommended that laboratories could now use either targeted or comprehensive (ie, next-generation sequencing [NGS]) methods for testing and reaffirmed the original set of 23 variants as the minimum set for CF carrier screening", and in 2021 it "continued to recommended offering testing of CFTR… to all pregnant patients, as well as those planning a pregnancy". The page notes the original ACMG‑23 was "derived primarily from" Non‑Hispanic White or Ashkenazi Jewish cohorts, and that "improved equity in variant detection is both necessary and desirable".

### Committee opinion no. 691: carrier screening for genetic conditions [^111X4fDj]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Carrier screening for genetic conditions — general principles state that individuals with a positive family history of a genetic condition should be offered carrier screening for the specific condition and may benefit from genetic counseling. Carrier screening for a particular condition generally should be performed only once in a person's lifetime, and the results should be documented in the patient's health record, and the decision to rescreen a patient should be undertaken only with the guidance of a genetics professional who can best assess the incremental benefit of repeat testing for additional mutations. Prenatal carrier screening does not replace newborn screening, nor does newborn screening replace the potential value of prenatal carrier screening. If a patient requests carrier screening for a particular condition for which testing is readily available and which reasonably would be considered in another screening strategy, the requested test should be offered to her (regardless of ethnicity and family history) after counseling on the risks, benefits, and limitations of screening. When selecting a carrier screening approach, the cost of each option to the patient and the health care system should be considered.

### Cystic fibrosis screening: lessons learned from the first 320, 000 patients [^113vvD1u]. Genetics in Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To examine the data from > 335,000 Cystic fibrosis (CF) tests to detect unsuspected findings and obtain clinical data when indicated to optimize genetic counseling.

Methods

A proprietary database containing 335,204 consecutive CF DNA tests and 445 CF prenatal diagnostic tests was queried. Clinical information was obtained for prenatal and selected nonprenatal cases by telephone contact with physician offices.

Results

The mutation 1078delT was found in much lower frequency than expected with rates of only 1:55,867 tests and 0.06% of CF mutations. This level is below the threshold set by the American College of Medical Genetics. Homozygosity was observed for 2789+5G > A in a 29-year-old women and compound heterozygosity with delta F408 in a 40-year-old woman with isolated chronic sinusitis. Many patients elected prenatal diagnosis when not at a 1:4 risk due to echogenic bowel or IVS-8 5T issues.

Conclusions

With the exception of 1078delT, all CF mutations in the ACMG panel were detected with a frequency of > 0.1% of CF chromosomes. When ACMG guidelines are strictly adhered to, population-based CF carrier screening will accurately identify couples at risk for having children with CF.

INTRODUCTION

The landscape of prenatal and preconception carrier screening (CS) is rapidly changing. Compared with traditional genotyping methods, modern genetic screening technology using next-generation sequencing (NGS) has rapidly expanded disease screening options. Traditional prenatal and preconception CS targeted specific diseases with high prevalence, particularly in defined subpopulations. At present, CS for eight disorders (excluding cystic fibrosis [CF]) are recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) for individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) heritage. These professional guidelines also recommend pan-ethnic screening for CF and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and ACOG recommends pan-ethnic screening for hemoglobinopathies. – Though these guidelines target some of the most prevalent genetic disorders, they do not identify carriers for many common conditions of importance to the diverse subpopulations present in contemporary societies. Moreover, CS based on ethnicity and race is often untenable due to complex population admixture, multiethnic and multiracial populations, and missing or incorrect ethnic/racial information.

Modern genetic screening technology using NGS overcomes these limitations by expanding the number of diseases covered and applies the testing to whole populations. Exome and genome sequencing may further expand the scope of variants identified in the CS panels. Recognizing these benefits, ACOG and ACMG have endorsed offering expanded CS to couples who are considering pregnancy or are already pregnant, regardless of ethnicity. Several studies have demonstrated that CS identifies an increased number of fetuses at risk for severe phenotypes compared with that based on traditional professional screening guidelines. – Currently available expanded CS panels are extremely heterogeneous in panel size, with the number of diseases being screened ranging from 41 to 1556. A joint statement from the ACMG, ACOG, the National Society for Genetic Counselors (NSGC), Perinatal Quality Foundation (PQF), and the Society for Maternal–Fetal Medicine (SMFM) acknowledged the utility of more comprehensive, pan-ethnic CS and provides guidelines for the inclusion of disorders but does not give specifics regarding individual genes.

### Genetic counseling clinical documentation: practice resource of the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^1141dFov]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2021). High credibility.

Cystic fibrosis carrier couple — prenatal genetic counseling session and recommendations documented that Mrs. Hernandez was referred by Dr. Jones to discuss cystic fibrosis in the current pregnancy because both partners are carriers for the deltaF508 pathogenic variant in the CFTR gene; the chance for cystic fibrosis for this and any future pregnancy was stated as 25% with a 50% chance to have a child who is a carrier but unaffected; after discussing options she decided to not pursue an amniocentesis for cystic fibrosis genetic testing at this time; educational brochures were offered but declined until after birth; the plan included a Level II ultrasound examination between 18 and 20 weeks' gestation, prenatal care per obstetrician recommendations, that Mrs. Hernandez should notify the pediatrician to ensure follow-up of newborn screening and possible additional testing/evaluation for cystic fibrosis after birth, that she and her partner were encouraged to inform family members of their cystic fibrosis carrier status, and follow-up genetic counseling if there are any additional concerns; documented time spent was 45 min in direct patient care and 60 min in indirect patient care.
