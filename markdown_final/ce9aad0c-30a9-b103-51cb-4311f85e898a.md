## Question

What is the relationship with pre-diabetes and atherosclerotic disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the relationship between prediabetes and atherosclerotic disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how prediabetes is defined and which glycemic markers best capture risk. Then, I should verify the strength and consistency of epidemiologic associations with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and mortality. Next, I will examine causality using Mendelian randomization and consider mechanistic plausibility. After that, I need to check whether prediabetes adds risk beyond traditional risk factors and whether risk differs by phenotype or sex. Finally, I will translate this into clinical implications, including screening, risk stratification, and the role of lifestyle versus pharmacotherapy, while noting controversies and evidence gaps.

> Let me first confirm the definition and phenotypes of prediabetes, because misclassification can obscure risk signals. Prediabetes is an intermediate dysglycemic state below diabetes thresholds, variously defined by impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or HbA1c 5.7–6.4%, and importantly, these phenotypes are not interchangeable and carry different metabolic and prognostic implications, with IGT often reflecting more pronounced insulin resistance and higher cardiovascular risk than isolated IFG [^112zAtdQ] [^111G8yza].

> Next, I should review the magnitude of epidemiologic associations. Large meta-analyses of prospective cohorts consistently show that prediabetes is associated with modestly higher risks of all-cause mortality, composite cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, and stroke in the general population, with relative risks around 1.13–1.16 and absolute risk differences on the order of 7–9 events per 10,000 person-years, and importantly, these associations persist after multivariable adjustment, suggesting independence from traditional risk factors [^114GQjtb] [^114Z8Vz4] [^112wDESP].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality from observational data. I need to check Mendelian randomization evidence. MR analyses indicate that genetically determined nondiabetic fasting glucose is causally associated with coronary artery disease, with about a 26% higher odds of CAD per 1 mmol/L increase in fasting glucose, whereas HbA1c in the prediabetic range did not show a significant causal effect in those analyses, highlighting that not all prediabetes phenotypes are equal in their causal contribution to atherosclerosis [^112LuAPW] [^111pi2gq].

> I will now examine mechanistic plausibility to see if the epidemiology aligns with biology. Prediabetes clusters with insulin resistance, compensatory hyperinsulinemia, endothelial dysfunction, chronic inflammation, and a prothrombotic milieu, all of which can accelerate atherogenesis even before overt diabetes, and postprandial hyperglycemia may be particularly injurious to the endothelium, providing a biologically coherent bridge from dysglycemia to vascular disease [^112d7ruN] [^1133eDU5] [^113YooTH].

> But wait, what if the observed risk is just a reflection of shared risk factors like obesity and hypertension rather than dysglycemia per se. I should double-check whether prediabetes adds independent risk beyond adiposity and insulin resistance. Multiple studies show that prediabetes remains associated with adverse cardiovascular profiles and subclinical atherosclerosis even after adjustment for BMI, waist circumference, and fasting insulin, supporting partial independence from adiposity and insulin resistance, though confounding can never be fully excluded in observational designs [^112PVHsj] [^111pfT7Y].

> Let me consider phenotype-specific differences, because this affects screening and risk interpretation. IGT appears to carry higher cardiovascular risk than isolated IFG, and HbA1c-defined prediabetes shows a dose–response relationship with subclinical atherosclerosis even below conventional prediabetes cutoffs, with PESA data demonstrating progressively higher odds of multiterritorial disease as HbA1c rises from 4.9% upward, reinforcing that risk is continuous and not binary [^114GQjtb] [^113o53dc].

> I should confirm sex-related differences, since guidelines increasingly emphasize sex-specific risk. Observational pooled analyses suggest that prediabetes confers a greater excess cardiovascular risk in women than in men, aligning with the broader pattern of higher relative cardiovascular risk in women with diabetes, which has implications for screening intensity and risk communication in clinical practice [^112LtcrD].

> Next, I should review clinical translation, starting with screening and detection. Prediabetes is common and often undiagnosed, and opportunistic screening with fasting glucose or HbA1c is reasonable in adults with risk factors. Importantly, reversion from prediabetes to normoglycemia is associated with lower subsequent cardiovascular risk, underscoring the value of early identification and intervention to modify trajectory [^117Xgndc] [^113cyoRD].

> Now, I need to ensure I distinguish primary from secondary prevention contexts. In people with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, prediabetes is associated with higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, with larger absolute risk differences than in the general population, which strengthens the case for aggressive risk factor modification in this subgroup even if glycemia itself is only modestly elevated [^114GQjtb] [^111qggb7].

> For management, I should confirm that lifestyle intervention is first-line and evidence-based. Structured programs targeting weight loss and physical activity reduce progression to diabetes and improve blood pressure, lipids, and inflammatory markers, and long-term follow-up from the Da Qing program shows sustained reductions in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, supporting early lifestyle therapy as disease-modifying for vascular risk [^117Xgndc] [^115x4cNc].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of pharmacotherapy, because this is controversial. Metformin reduces diabetes incidence in high-risk individuals but has not consistently reduced cardiovascular events in prediabetes, and it is not currently indicated for cardiovascular risk reduction in prediabetes. Ongoing trials like the VA CSP #2002 are testing metformin for secondary prevention in veterans with prediabetes and established ASCVD, and while SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists have cardiovascular benefits in diabetes, evidence for primary cardiovascular risk reduction in prediabetes remains limited and is not guideline-endorsed outside research settings [^117Xgndc] [^1124xg22] [^111Gw6z7].

> I should double-check risk stratification guidance, because not all prediabetes carries the same near-term vascular risk. Professional societies advise treating the global cardiometabolic risk profile rather than glycemia alone, with aggressive control of blood pressure and LDL cholesterol per ASCVD risk category, and in some algorithms, prediabetes with additional risk enhancers can shift lipid targets toward more intensive therapy even when diabetes is not present [^115U2hPX] [^112NfsXk].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Prediabetes is best viewed as a high-risk state on the dysglycemia continuum, with modest but consistent epidemiologic associations with atherosclerotic disease, causal evidence for a glycemia–CAD link, and plausible mechanisms centered on insulin resistance and endothelial injury. Risk is amplified by phenotype, sex, and coexisting cardiometabolic conditions, and early detection with comprehensive risk factor modification — especially lifestyle change — is the most defensible clinical approach pending stronger pharmacotherapy evidence in prediabetes [^114GQjtb] [^112LuAPW] [^112d7ruN] [^117Xgndc].

Prediabetes is associated with a **modestly increased risk** of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) [^114GQjtb], with a pooled relative risk of 1.15 for composite CVD and 1.16 for coronary heart disease versus normoglycemia [^114GQjtb]. Risk is higher with impaired glucose tolerance than impaired fasting glucose [^114GQjtb], and increases with additional cardiometabolic risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia [^112ZECJE]. Prediabetes likely exerts **causal effects on coronary artery disease** [^111pi2gq], but much of the excess risk is mediated by insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction, and coexisting metabolic abnormalities rather than dysglycemia alone [^112NfsXk] [^112aJzis]. Intensive lifestyle interventions reduce progression to diabetes and improve cardiovascular risk factors, though direct evidence for hard ASCVD outcome reduction is limited; pharmacotherapy is not routinely recommended for prediabetes unless other risk factors are present [^117Xgndc] [^111Gw6z7].

---

## Epidemiological evidence linking prediabetes to atherosclerotic disease

Multiple large-scale prospective cohort studies and meta-analyses consistently demonstrate that prediabetes is associated with an increased risk of ASCVD:

- **Meta-analysis findings**: Prediabetes is associated with a 15% higher risk of composite cardiovascular disease (CVD) and a 16% higher risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) compared with normoglycemia, with absolute risk differences of 8.75 and 6.59 per 10,000 person-years, respectively [^114GQjtb].

- **Stroke risk**: Prediabetes is associated with a modestly increased risk of stroke, particularly when defined by impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or combined impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and IGT, with a pooled relative risk of 1.20 [^113Ti2QQ].

- **Mortality**: Prediabetes is associated with increased all-cause mortality, with a pooled relative risk of 1.13 in the general population [^114GQjtb].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying increased ASCVD risk in prediabetes

Several mechanisms plausibly link prediabetes to accelerated atherosclerosis:

- **Insulin resistance**: Central to prediabetes, insulin resistance promotes dyslipidemia, hypertension, and endothelial dysfunction, all of which accelerate atherogenesis [^113WQQc1].

- **Endothelial dysfunction**: Prediabetes is associated with impaired endothelial function, a key early event in atherosclerosis [^111b9Eiq].

- **Inflammation and oxidative stress**: Chronic low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress are prevalent in prediabetes and contribute to vascular injury and plaque formation [^11735NHE].

- **Postprandial hyperglycemia**: Elevated postprandial glucose levels, characteristic of IGT, are particularly atherogenic via increased oxidative stress and endothelial injury [^113YooTH].

---

## Clinical evidence of subclinical atherosclerosis in prediabetes

Subclinical atherosclerosis is more prevalent in prediabetes, as evidenced by increased carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) [^111pfT7Y], coronary artery calcification (CAC) [^112A6jUd], and endothelial dysfunction, even after adjusting for traditional risk factors [^notfound]. These findings indicate that the atherosclerotic process begins before overt diabetes and supports early intervention.

---

## Impact of prediabetes on cardiovascular outcomes

Prediabetes not only increases the risk of incident ASCVD but also worsens outcomes in patients with established cardiovascular disease. In secondary prevention populations, prediabetes is associated with higher all-cause mortality, composite CVD, and CHD events, with absolute risk differences substantially higher than in primary prevention cohorts [^114GQjtb].

---

## Influence of lifestyle interventions and pharmacological treatments

Lifestyle interventions are the cornerstone of prediabetes management, with randomized controlled trials demonstrating significant reductions in diabetes progression and improvements in cardiovascular risk factors:

- **Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)**: Lifestyle interventions reduced diabetes incidence by 58% and improved blood pressure, lipid profiles, and inflammatory markers [^117Xgndc].

- **Long-term outcomes**: The Da Qing Diabetes Prevention Study showed sustained reductions in cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality over 23–30 years following lifestyle intervention [^117Xgndc].

Pharmacological therapy, such as metformin, reduces diabetes progression but has not consistently demonstrated direct cardiovascular outcome benefits in prediabetes. Therefore, it is not routinely recommended unless additional risk factors are present [^117Xgndc] [^111Gw6z7].

---

## Controversies and gaps in current evidence

Despite robust epidemiological data, several controversies persist:

- **Causality**: While observational and Mendelian randomization studies suggest a causal relationship between prediabetes and coronary artery disease, definitive proof awaits larger randomized trials with hard cardiovascular endpoints [^111pi2gq].

- **Heterogeneity of prediabetes**: Different definitions (IFG, IGT, HbA1c) identify distinct populations with varying cardiovascular risk profiles, complicating risk stratification and management [^112zAtdQ].

- **Pharmacotherapy**: The role of pharmacological agents in prediabetes for cardiovascular risk reduction remains uncertain and is not currently recommended outside specific high-risk scenarios [^111Gw6z7].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

Given the increased ASCVD risk in prediabetes, clinicians should:

- **Screen and identify**: Actively screen for prediabetes in patients with cardiovascular risk factors [^117Xgndc].

- **Lifestyle interventions**: Implement intensive lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes, physical activity, and weight loss [^117Xgndc].

- **Risk factor management**: Aggressively manage hypertension, dyslipidemia, and other cardiometabolic risk factors [^112NfsXk].

- **Individualized pharmacotherapy**: Consider pharmacological therapy, such as metformin, in high-risk patients or those with additional risk factors, recognizing the limited direct cardiovascular evidence [^111Gw6z7].

---

Prediabetes is associated with a **modestly increased risk** of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, largely mediated by insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction, and coexisting metabolic abnormalities. Intensive lifestyle interventions are effective in reducing diabetes progression and improving cardiovascular risk factors, though direct evidence for hard ASCVD outcome reduction remains limited. Pharmacotherapy is not routinely recommended unless additional risk factors are present.

### Great debate: pre-diabetes is not an evidence-based treatment target for cardiovascular risk reduction [^1152eZ83]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

With the increasing burden of diabetes as a cause of macro- and microvascular disease linked to the epidemics of obesity, attention is being paid to dysglycaemic states that predict and precede the development of type 2 diabetes. Such conditions, termed pre-diabetes, are characterized by fasting plasma glucose, or plasma glucose levels on an oral glucose tolerance test, or values of glycated haemoglobin intermediate between 'normal' values and those characterizing diabetes. These last are by definition associated, in epidemiological terms, with a higher incidence of microvascular disease-mostly retinopathy. Pre-diabetes overlaps with the components of the 'metabolic syndrome'-among which are excess visceral adiposity; hypertension; hypertriglyceridaemia; high levels of small, dense low-density lipoproteins; and metabolic-associated fatty liver disease. There is little doubt that pre-diabetes has important prognostic implications, especially for the occurrence of myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, and peripheral arterial disease. It is disputed, however, whether pre-diabetes is itself an actionable disease entity, in addition to the risk factors characterizing it. Because of this uncertainty, the latest European Society of Cardiology guidelines chose not to include pre-diabetes as a treatment target for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, at variance from the three previous editions of such guidelines. This is spurring a debate, the Pro and Contra arguments featured in the present debate article.

Pre-diabetes and atherosclerosis

Steven Haffner (San Antonio, TX) gave the Edwin Bierman lecture, discussing the relationship between aspects of pre-diabetes and its relationship to atherosclerosis. He noted that one-third of persons without a prior diagnosis of diabetes who had glucose tolerance testing after myocardial infarction had diabetes and that another third had pre-diabetes as defined by impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or impaired fasting glucose (IFG). In his analyses, pre-diabetes was defined based on finding individuals who on follow-up were documented to develop diabetes, which is in some ways preferable to a definition based on risk of diabetes because of IFG or IGT, as many such individuals do not actually develop diabetes. The development of diabetes should, furthermore, be distinguished from CVD risk. The Diabetes Epidemiology: Collaborative analysis Of Diagnostic criteria in Europe (DECODE) data, as an example, suggest IGT to convey higher risk than IFG. Various statistical methods can be used to understand the relationships between pre-diabetes and preheart disease; the complexity of this relationship is further increased by the finding that many CVD risk factors, such as cigarette use and low HDL cholesterol, are also risk factors for diabetes.

### Could pre-diabetes be considered a clinical condition? opinions from an endocrinologist and a cardiologist [^112Tz4RJ]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

The prevalence of pre-diabetes is increasing worldwide and may start 7 to 10 years before the clinical diagnosis of diabetes. In this stage the presence and accumulation of risk factors is common and already implies an increase in cardiovascular risk. Likewise, the onset of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), mainly coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease and cerebrovascular disease can also take place, all of which account for high rates of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Considering pre-diabetes as a clinical entity, non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments are indicated with drugs which have shown clinical benefits related to reduction in morbidity and mortality. However, there is still need for new long-term studies to assess the real benefits of several new therapeutical approaches, as well as its cost-effectiveness.

### Association between prediabetes and risk of all cause mortality and cardiovascular disease: updated meta-analysis [^113g9BRe]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Prediabetes, also termed intermediate hyperglycaemia or non-diabetic hyperglycaemia, is a high risk metabolic state for diabetes, defined by glycaemic variables that are higher than normal but lower than the thresholds for diabetes. The prevalence of prediabetes is increasing worldwide. Reports estimate that more than 470 million people will have prediabetes by 2030. According to an expert panel of the American Diabetes Association, up to 70% of individuals with prediabetes will eventually develop diabetes. Our previous meta-analysis, which included 53 prospective cohort studies with more than 1.6 million participants, showed that compared with normoglycaemia, prediabetes was associated with a higher risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and all cause mortality after adjusting for multiple risk factors. The risk was increased even in people with prediabetes defined according to the criteria of the American Diabetes Association, which recommended a cut-off value of 5.6–6.9 mmol/L (100–125 mg/dL) for fasting plasma glucose to define impaired fasting glucose. The studies included in the previous meta-analysis were from the general population, so the health risk for prediabetes in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was not established. In recent years, many studies exploring the associations between prediabetes and the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality have been published. On their own, most of the studies had limited power to draw solid conclusions, however, and their results have been debated. A recent contentious report in Science defined prediabetes as a "dubious diagnosis" because of the inconsistent association of prediabetes with cardiovascular disease and mortality. This opinion reflects the controversy around the term prediabetes, and international consensus is urgently needed.

Given these inconsistencies, we performed an updated meta-analysis to analyse the available data on the prognostic value of prediabetes in individuals with and without baseline atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Two key questions were explored: is prediabetes associated with an increased risk of all cause mortality and cardiovascular disease in the general population and in patients with a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; and are different definitions of prediabetes related to different prognoses?

### An investigation of causal relationships between prediabetes and vascular complications [^111pi2gq]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Prediabetes is a state of glycaemic dysregulation below the diagnostic threshold of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Globally, ~352 million people have prediabetes, of which 35–50% develop full-blown diabetes within five years. T2D and its complications are costly to treat, causing considerable morbidity and early mortality. Whether prediabetes is causally related to diabetes complications is unclear. Here we report a causal inference analysis investigating the effects of prediabetes in coronary artery disease, stroke and chronic kidney disease, complemented by a systematic review of relevant observational studies. Although the observational studies suggest that prediabetes is broadly associated with diabetes complications, the causal inference analysis revealed that prediabetes is only causally related with coronary artery disease, with no evidence of causal effects on other diabetes complications. In conclusion, prediabetes likely causes coronary artery disease and its prevention is likely to be most effective if initiated prior to the onset of diabetes.

### Identification of pre-diabetes subphenotypes for type 2 diabetes, related vascular complications and mortality [^111G8yza]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Pre-diabetes, characterized by elevated blood glucose levels below the diabetes threshold, is identifiable through three distinct blood tests: impaired fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of 100–125 mg/dL, impaired glucose tolerance (2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) result of 140–200 mg/dL) or an elevated HbA1c level of 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol). Although often asymptomatic, pre-diabetes significantly increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and associated complications, particularly cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Epidemiological studies suggest that different glycemic markers define distinct yet overlapping populations, reflecting variations in the underlying mechanisms of glucose regulation. These physiological differences may affect the likelihood of progression to diabetes and influence the associated cardiovascular risk in individuals with pre-diabetes. Research has consistently demonstrated that across the glycemic spectrum, various markers of glucose homeostasis are associated with cardiovascular risk, although the strength of these associations varies depending on the marker used. For instance, findings from the Diabetes Epidemiology: Collaborative analysis of Diagnostic criteria in Europe (DECODE) study in Europe indicate that postprandial glucose levels exhibit a stronger correlation with cardiovascular risk than FPG. Similarly, data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study in the USA and a large-scale Asian community-based cohort study suggest that HbA1c is a stronger predictor of cardiovascular risk than FPG.

### Joint associations of pre-diabetes, pre-hypertension, and pre-dyslipidemia with cardiovascular and metabolic disease progression [^1116AmhC]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Established metabolic disorders such as diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia are major contributors to CVD risk. Recent evidence indicates that even subclinical metabolic disturbances, including pre-diabetes, pre-hypertension, and pre-dyslipidemia, may independently increase the risk of CVD and accelerate the progression to clinically diagnosed metabolic diseases. Pre-disease conditions, marked by mild yet abnormal metabolic indicators, are common and typically asymptomatic. While not meeting the diagnostic criteria for disease, they reflect a high-risk state that warrants attention from both patients and healthcare providers. Large-scale surveys in the United States and South Korea report a prehypertension prevalence of 30% in the general population. Estimates suggest prediabetes affects 15.5% of individuals in Eastern countries, rising to 35% in Western nations, with Iran reporting a 13% prevalence, and approximately 70% of individuals with prediabetes develop diabetes. However, the actual prevalence may exceed reported figures due to low awareness among affected individuals.

Despite their subclinical nature, each condition has been individually linked to adverse vascular and metabolic outcomes. Pre-diabetes and pre-hypertension are associated with insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction, whereas predyslipidemia may contribute to early atherogenesis, though evidence remains limited. Biologically, these conditions may interact to amplify inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular injury — mechanisms central to CVD pathogenesis. Nonetheless, the extent to which multiple pre-disease conditions together increase CVD risk or accelerate the progression to overt metabolic disease remains unclear. Given that pre-disease states represent a modifiable window for early intervention, clarifying these joint associations is crucial for improving risk stratification and guiding preventive strategies. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study to date has assessed the joint associations of pre-diabetes, pre-hypertension, and pre-dyslipidemia on CVD. We hypothesize that the coexistence of pre-diabetes, pre-hypertension, and pre-dyslipidemia is associated with greater CVD and metabolic disease risk than individual conditions.

To address the research gaps, we examine the joint associations of pre-diabetes, pre-hypertension, and pre-dyslipidemia on the incidence of CVD events (stroke and heart disease) and the progression to overt metabolic diseases. We hypothesize that the combination of these precondition is associated to a higher risk of CVD and metabolic problems thant each one alone. Our findings aim to support the development of targeted early interventions for individuals in the pre-disease stage.

Dysglicaemia and cardiovascular disease

There is a strong relationship between dysglicaemia and cardiomorbidity and cardiomortality

Cardiomorbidity

There is a relationship between dysglicaemia and cardiovascular atherosclerotic disease as certified by several clinical trials which have demonstrated the association of pre-diabetes with subclinical indicators of atherosclerosis, as described bellow:

1. **Calcium score of coronary arteries**: the average score of coronary calcification (CAC) in pre-diabetic patients is about 6.7 times increased (93 vs. 14) compared to non-diabetic individuals;

2. **Carotid intima-media thickness**: the results from the Mexico City Diabetes Study have shown that the relation of the thickness between the intima and the medium in the common and internal carotid arteries, were significantly more elevated in pre-diabetics as compared to non-diabetics. European and Indian studies also showed the same event after adjustments to other risk factors;

3. **Prevalence of cardiovascular disease**: in pre-diabetics, even without metabolic syndrome, there is an increased incidence both in coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. In patients with metabolic syndrome, such morbidities occur at a higher level, and they also present higher incidence of stroke;

4. **Hypertension**: the Framinghan study demonstrated that, for both genders, the cardiovascular event rate has been progressively increasing from the normal levels of arterial pressure. In individuals with glucose intolerance, such events also occur, though at a much higher rate, proportionally to the arterial pressure level;

5. **Worsening of the clinical evolution of acute coronary syndromes**: the Glucose Tolerance in Patients with Myocardial Infarction (GAMI) study. Such study, performed with subjects with acute myocardial infarction, showed that only 34% of patients had normal dysglicaemia upon admittance, against 35% and 31% of pre-diabetics and diabetics, respectively. The same was observed in two other studies, the China Heart Study (CHS) and the Euro Heart Survey (EH S), for which only 36% and 45% of individuals, respectively, had normal fasting dysglicaemia in the acute stage of infarction, which means that the great majority already presented a change in glucose metabolism upon admittance and were unaware of such condition;

6. Several studies have demonstrated that other biochemical markers of cardiovascular disease such as C-reactive protein, tumour necrosis factor-alpha increase in graded manner with deterioration of glucose intolerance;

### Diabetic vascular disease: an experimental objective [^114RWECn]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2006). Low credibility.

It is well known that humans with diabetes have more atherosclerosis and its complications. The causes of this relationship are, however, unclear. Although recent data show that improved glycemic control reduces arterial disease in type 1 diabetes, other studies have shown that subjects with "prediabetes" have more cardiovascular disease before the development of hyperglycemia. Thus, either hyperglycemia and/or lack of insulin actions are toxic to arteries, or metabolic derangements exclusive of hyperglycemia are atherogenic. For > 50 years animal models of diabetes and atherosclerosis have been used to uncover potential mechanisms underlying diabetes associated cardiovascular disease. Surprisingly, diabetes alone increases vascular disease in only a few select animal models. Increased atherosclerosis has been found in several animals and lines of genetically modified mice; however, diabetes often also leads to greater hyperlipidemia. This makes it difficult to separate the toxic effects of insulin lack and/or hyperglycemia from those caused by the lipids. These studies are reviewed, as well as more recent investigations using new methods to create diabetic-atherosclerotic models.

### Reversion from pre-diabetes mellitus to normoglycemia and risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in a Chinese population: a prospective cohort study [^113cyoRD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Pre–diabetes mellitus is defined as an intermediate metabolic state between normoglycemia and diabetes mellitus and includes both impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glucose. 1 The global prevalence of diabetes mellitus and pre–diabetes mellitus in adults has been increasing over recent decades. 2, 3, 4 Recent evidence suggests that, in addition to patients with diabetes mellitus, those with pre–diabetes mellitus are also vulnerable to atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). 5, 6 Some, 7, 8, 9 but not all, studies 10, 11 showed that higher fasting blood glucose concentrations were associated with a higher CVD risk in individuals without diabetes mellitus. Even when overt diabetes mellitus is delayed or prevented, both microvascular and macrovascular diseases appear to be more prevalent in those with pre–diabetes mellitus than in their normoglycemic peers. 12, 13, 14 Data from the DPPOS (Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study) and Special Diabetes Program for Indians Diabetes Prevention Program both showed that patients with pre–diabetes mellitus who reverted to normoglycemia had a reduced risk of developing diabetes mellitus. 15, 16 Arguably, the prevention of diabetes mellitus and its complications lies in the restoration of normoglycemia rather than in the maintenance of pre–diabetes mellitus.

Given the epidemic proportion of pre–diabetes mellitus worldwide and especially in China and the United States, 17, 18 if a causal relationship exists, even a modest decrease in risk might reduce the substantial burden of CVD events. 19 In addition, reversion from pre–diabetes mellitus to normoglycemia is related to improvements in a range of cardiovascular risk factors. 20 In addition, the results from the Whitehall II cohort study showed that reversion from 2‐hour plasma glucose–defined pre–diabetes mellitus to normoglycemia was associated with a reduction in the future risk of CVD and death. 19 However, few studies have explored the impact of reversion from pre–diabetes mellitus to normoglycemia and CVD risk. 16, 19, 20, 21 Notably, a previous history of CVD was not excluded in their analysis; the clinical outcomes in prior studies were comprehensive CVD outcomes; and myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke events, including stroke types, were not assessed independently. Hence, the current analysis sought to examine whether reversion from pre–diabetes mellitus to normoglycemia is also associated with a lower incidence of CVD (MI and stroke) and all‐cause mortality using data from the Kailuan study.

### Pre-diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular risk [^112NfsXk]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Pre-diabetes represents an elevation of plasma glucose above the normal range but below that of clinical diabetes. Pre-diabetes can be identified as either impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). The latter is detected by oral glucose tolerance testing. Both IFG and IGT are risk factors for type 2 diabetes, and risk is even greater when IFG and IGT occur together. Pre-diabetes commonly associates with the metabolic syndrome. Both in turn are closely associated with obesity. The mechanisms whereby obesity predisposes to pre-diabetes and metabolic syndrome are incompletely understood but likely have a common metabolic soil. Insulin resistance is a common factor; systemic inflammation engendered by obesity may be another. Pre-diabetes has only a minor impact on microvascular disease; glucose-lowering drugs can delay conversion to diabetes, but whether in the long run the drug approach will delay development of microvascular disease is in dispute. To date, the drug approach to prevention of microvascular disease starting with pre-diabetes has not been evaluated. Pre-diabetes carries some predictive power for macrovascular disease, but most of this association appears to be mediated through the metabolic syndrome. The preferred clinical approach to cardiovascular prevention is to treat all the metabolic risk factors. For both pre-diabetes and metabolic syndrome, the desirable approach is lifestyle intervention, especially weight reduction and physical activity. When drug therapy is contemplated and when the metabolic syndrome is present, the primary consideration is prevention of cardiovascular disease. The major targets are elevations of cholesterol and blood pressure.

Pre-diabetes — key for the understanding of cardiovascular complications in type 2 diabetes

Impaired insulin action (insulin resistance) in combination with impaired insulin secretion is a major pathophysiological mechanism leading to elevated fasting or postprandial glucose in pre-diabetic individuals. Impaired insulin action is observed in several tissues, particularly in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, endothelium, and the liver. Compensatory hyperinsulinemia is often seen in pre-diabetic individuals because the pancreas compensates for insulin resistance in peripheral insulin-sensitive tissues.

Pre-diabetes is a heterogeneous entity. Both IFG and IGT are characterized by insulin resistance. Previous small studies demonstrated that individuals with IGT have a more pronounced degree of insulin resistance, whereas individuals with IFG are characterized by a more pronounced β-cell defect when related to the ambient glucose levels and the degree of insulin sensitivity. We recently carried out a study including almost 1,000 offspring of type 2 diabetic patients and showed that participants with isolated IFG had impaired basal insulin secretion, reduced first-phase insulin response, and reduced insulin sensitivity compared with normoglycemic individuals. Subjects with IFG also have reduced hepatic sensitivity to insulin. In contrast, a characteristic finding in subjects with isolated IGT is increased insulin resistance.

Several studies have provided evidence that high insulin level is associated with risk of CHD in nondiabetic subjects in prospective population studies (summarized in). We were the first to show that insulin resistance per se is directly associated with atherosclerosis, even in normoglycemic subjects. We measured insulin sensitivity by the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp and asymptomatic atherosclerosis with ultrasound method in the femoral or carotid arteries. Healthy nonobese subjects without any medication but who had atherosclerotic plaques and corresponding control subjects without signs of atherosclerosis were included in the study. Subjects with asymptomatic atherosclerosis exhibited an approximate 20% decrease in insulin-mediated glucose. Our study provides evidence that the primary events responsible for atherothrombosis could be related to insulin resistance per se.

### Redefining the diagnosis of diabetes using glycated hemoglobin [^113QTWNn]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The International Expert Committee is indeed careful to point out that the threshold does not identify an A1C level below which risk is nil but, instead, one below which risk is lower: an inflection point in a continuous positive relationship rather than a true step function. However, the outcome used is retinopathy, i.e. one of the microvascular complications. It is natural to wonder whether a different threshold might have been chosen if the outcome considered had been atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Available data on the relationship between A1C and CVD risk may be less defined than those relating to retinopathy, but CVD events are more prevalent than microvascular events in type 2 diabetes. Admittedly, recent trial results showing an uncertain link between lowering glucose and macrovascular complications add to the complexity of defining risk using solely one feature (i.e.g.lucose) of a multidimensional metabolic disease. It would be reassuring if a critical analysis of the evidence converged on the same — or very close to the same — A1C level to be posited as the diabetes diagnostic threshold carrying definite risk for both micro- and macroangiopathy.

The lack of an A1C value for a formal definition of "pre-diabetes" is likely to raise further and related concerns. Here again, other methods, including the use of glucose values, may be helpful, but there continues to be little consensus on the best test to use in predicting diabetes. A variety of mathematical models, questionnaires, and risk engines can be used to define risk of diabetes as well as risk of cardiovascular disease, including one available on the American Diabetes Association Web site. Furthermore, progression rates of people with mildly abnormal tests of glucose in the pre-diabetes range are highly variable and dysglycemia may sometimes regress to normal without intervention. Even so, we expect considerable debate to follow with calls for a more robust diagnostic option to detect at-risk individuals. This is of particular importance when pharmacological therapy is being considered. Critics may reason that a diagnostic test for population-based and societal interventions to eat healthy, increase physical activity, and optimize body weight is not necessary. Yet, we would argue that when dealing with an individual patient, the conversation regarding risk reduction, whether it is attempted with diet or drugs, will be facilitated with concrete numbers with which a condition and its response to intervention can be measured.

### Joint associations of pre-diabetes, pre-hypertension, and pre-dyslipidemia with cardiovascular and metabolic disease progression [^1121SQ6n]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the cumulative presence of multiple pre-disease states significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease among middle-aged and older adults. These findings underscore the need for early screening and multifactorial interventions targeting pre-diabetes, pre-hypertension, and pre-dyslipidemia to reduce CVD and metabolic disease burden.

### An investigation of causal relationships between prediabetes and vascular complications [^112LuAPW]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

It is unclear if prediabetes is pathogenic or merely a prelude to the disease state of diabetes. We sought to address this important question using MR to estimate the causal effect of nondiabetic variations in FG on the major complications of diabetes. We compared these findings with those obtained through meta-analysis of published observational data from 1,326,915 participants. In the observational analysis, prediabetes was modestly associated with CAD and stroke, but not with CKD. In the MR analyses however, only prediabetic blood glucose was associated with CAD, with a 26% higher odds of CAD per mmol L −1 increase in fasting glucose. Elevation in genetically determined HbA1c did not confer a statistically significant increase in the odds of CAD or any other outcomes, though the number of instruments was less (n = 8) and the instruments were unclassifiable.

To date, there has been no medicinal products approved for the treatment of prediabetes in the EU or US. While lifestyle measures are clearly recommended as first-line intervention to improve glycaemia in people at high risk of developing diabetes, it is widely acknowledged that additional drug therapy may be beneficial in people with prediabetes, if their risk of diabetes is elevated for other reasons.

Current regulatory requirements for supportive evidence include showing that delay in disease progression is accompanied by other indicators of clinical benefit. To provide this evidence, large, long-term clinical trials are needed, the high cost of which inhibits the development of prediabetic medicinal products. Moreover, there are reimbursement challenges of treating very large numbers of people with prediabetes. Determination of the health implications and risk assessment of prediabetes would, therefore, aid design of smaller, shorter, and potentially less expensive, clinical trials by providing alternative health benefits. It would also help address the value of treating large populations over longer periods, by showing cost effectiveness.

### Diabetes and pre-diabetes are associated with cardiovascular risk factors and carotid / femoral intima-media thickness independently of markers of insulin resistance and adiposity [^114NPNbx]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Worldwide, the number of persons with diabetes mellitus (DM) is expected to double in the next 25 years and to affect more than 350 million individuals by 2030. Accordingly, there is a growing interest in identifying individuals in stages preceding overt DM in order to potentially prevent the occurrence of DM and associated complications. The majority of complications of DM are related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and it is therefore important to assess whether pre-diabetes stages are also associated with detrimental vascular outcomes.

Pre-diabetes has been first described by the World Health Organization in 1980 as impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). In order to avoid the time-consuming and somewhat cumbersome measurement of 2-hour postload glucose concentrations (2hBG), the American Diabetes Association (ADA) proposed in 1997 to identify pre-diabetes as impaired fasting glucose (IFG), which relies on one fasting measurement only. In 2004, the ADA lowered the cut-off point for IFG from 6.1 to 5.6 mmol/l. It has been demonstrated that both IFG and IGT are risk factors for the subsequent development of both DM and CVD. However, the respective prognostic values of IFG and IGT to predict DM and CVD risk are still controversial.

Because they measure different aspects of glucose metabolism, IFG and IGT have different underlying physiological and clinical significance with respect to insulin sensitivity and secretion. Subsequently, these two categories of impairment of glucose regulation (IGR) may differently relate to CVD risk factors. However, both IFG and IGT are strongly associated with excess body weight, which in turn is associated with insulin resistance. Hence, the relationship between IGR categories and CVD risk factors or CVD outcomes may be mediated by such markers of adiposity or insulin resistance.

Intima-media thickness (IMT) of peripheral arteries (particularly carotid IMT) can be regarded as a cardiovascular risk factor since it is an independent predictor of CVD morbidity and mortality. However, IMT also measures organic vascular changes -atherosclerosis- and it is therefore also increasingly used as a proxy of CVD outcomes.

Insulin resistance, pre-diabetes, and Type 2 diabetes

The gold standard for evaluating insulin resistance, namely the hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp technique, is impractical for regular large-scale clinical practice. Hence, surrogate markers for insulin resistance have been proposed, the best known of which is the Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), calculated using the formula: [fasting plasma insulin (mU/L) × plasma fasting glucose (mmol/L)]/22.5. A value of 2.5 or higher is considered to indicate insulin resistance. Additional surrogate markers include the triglyceride-glucose indexand triglyceride to HDL-cholesterol ratio, both of which are associated with risk of cardiovascular disease independent of LDL-cholesterol.

Pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes can be diagnosed by measuring (i) glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), (ii) fasting plasma glucose, or (iii) plasma glucose 2 h after an OGTT (Figures 4 and 5). The OGTT consists of a fasting glucose blood test followed by the consumption of a 75 g glucose drink and a diagnostic glucose blood test at 120 min. This test provides information about the pancreatic reserve to compensate for insulin resistance.

In the context of obesity, pre-diabetes is an easily measurable clinical manifestation of insulin resistance. However, it is important to note that insulin resistance can exist in the absence of dysglycaemia, and therefore, some individuals at an early stage of SMD will not be identified when using pre-diabetes as a proxy for insulin resistance. Therefore, we recommend using HOMA-IR in addition to HbA1c to determine whether an individual is at an early stage of SMD.

Conclusions

Prediabetes was associated with an increased risk of all cause mortality and cardiovascular disease in the general population and in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Screening and proper management of prediabetes might contribute to primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

### Use of the steno T1 risk engine identifies preclinical atherosclerosis better than use of ESC / EASD-2019 in adult subjects with type 1 diabetes at high risk [^114UxNPH]. Diabetes Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the concordance between the 2019 ESC Guidelines on diabetes, pre-diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases developed in collaboration with the EASD (ESC/EASD-2019) and the Steno T1 Risk Engine (Steno-Risk) cardiovascular risk scales for individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) without cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to analyze the relationships of their use with identification of preclinical atherosclerosis.

Research Design and Methods

We consecutively selected patients with T1D, without CVD, age ≥ 40 years, with nephropathy, and/or with ≥ 10 years of T1D evolution with another risk factor. The presence of plaque at different carotid segments was determined by ultrasonography. Cardiovascular risk was estimated in accord with ESC/EASD-2019 risk groups (moderate/high/very high) and the Steno-Risk (< 10%, low; 10–20%, moderate; ≥ 20%, high), as T1D-specific scores. In an exploratory analysis, we also evaluated the non-T1D-specific 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Assessment of Cardiovascular Risk (ACC/AHA-2013) pooled cohort equation for individuals between 40 and 79 years of age.

Results

We included 501 patients (53% men, mean age 48.8 years, median T1D duration 26.5 years, 41.3% harboring plaques). Concordance between T1D-specific scales was poor (κ = 0.19). A stepped increase in the presence of plaques according to Steno-Risk category was seen (18.4%, 38.2%, and 64.1%, for low, moderate, and high risk, respectively; P for trend < 0.001), with no differences according to ESC/EASD-2019 (P = 0.130). Steno-Risk identified individuals with plaques, unlike ESC/EASD-2019 (area under the curve [AUC] 0.691, P < 0.001, vs. AUC 0.538, P = 0.149). Finally, in polynomial regression models (with adjustment for lipid parameters and cardioprotective treatment), irrespective of the ESC/EASD-2019 category, high risk by Steno-Risk was directly associated with atherosclerosis (in moderate/high-risk by ESC/EASD-2019 odds ratio 2.91 [95% CI 1.27–6.72] and 4.94 [2.35–10.40] for the presence of plaque and two or more plaques). Similar results were obtained with discordant higher Steno-Risk versus ACC/AHA-2013 (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Among T1D patients undergoing primary prevention, use of Steno-Risk seems to result in better recognition of individuals with atherosclerosis in comparison with ESC/EASD-2019. Notwithstanding, carotid ultrasound could improve the categorization of cardiovascular risk.

### Effect of glycaemic control on cardiovascular disease in individuals with type 2 diabetes with pre-existing cardiovascular disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116kH1jK]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

The role of intensive glucose control in people with type 2 diabetes and pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) is controversial. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine in a subset of people with type 2 diabetes and pre-existing CVD, the CV effect of intensive glucose control versus standard of care. We searched Medline, the Cochrane library, EMBASE and the National Institutes of Health Trial registration database for randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effect of intensive glucose control versus standard glucose control in people with type 2 diabetes on incident CVD. Data were extracted using a structured form. When data were not available in the publications, authors were contacted. Eight trials involving 8339 participants were included. Among adults with type 2 diabetes and pre-existing CVD, there was no difference in the risk of CV events in those allocated to intensive glucose control compared with those in the standard care arm (relative risk 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.87–1.09). In conclusion, in people with diabetes and pre-existing CVD, intensive glucose control versus standard care had a neutral effect on incident CV events.

### Continued efforts to translate diabetes cardiovascular outcome trials into clinical practice [^115NtVGa]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes is characterized by a heavy atherosclerotic burden, inadequate compensatory remodeling and accelerated plaque progression, despite extensive use of medical therapies. In diabetic patients, macrovascular and microvascular disease are tightly linked: patients with proliferative retinopathy have a 25-fold higher risk for lower limb amputation and a 2–3 fold higher risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) as compared to those without. These features account for an increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. CVD may be present at HbA1c values below the diagnostic threshold for diabetes, and in patients with overt type 2 diabetes, for every percentage point increase in HbA1c, the relative risk of CVD increases by about 18%. For these reasons, the latest ESC/EASD Guidelines on diabetes, pre-diabetes, and CVD emphasize the need for a stringent approach in patients with diabetes, underlying the importance of a patient-centered care. In summary, in patients with type 2 diabetes, there is an excess risk and burden of CVD, which parallels the worsening of glycemic control.

Several mechanisms are though to be responsible for cardiovascular damage in diabetic patients, including hyperglycemia and oxidative stress, hypoglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. These mechanisms can be countered by the use of different glucose-lowering medications, which are therefore expected to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes, in addition to lowering HbA1c < 7.0%, which is still considered the goal to maximise cardiovascular benefit. Nonetheless, a survey from the ESC suggests that there is wide space to improve the management of patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

We herein aim to briefly re-analyse the results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting the effects of various glucose-lowering medications on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. To this end, we run a PubMed search for RCTs with the following terms: "type 2 diabetes" "randomized controlled trial" "cardiovascular" and screened for cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) assessing safety or efficacy of glucose-lowering medications.

### The longitudinal association of remnant cholesterol with cardiovascular outcomes in patients with diabetes and pre-diabetes [^116majTr]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Elevated LDL-C is a well-known risk factor for CAD, which is commonly considered as the primary therapy target. However, after reduction of LDL-C to recommended levels, there is still a considerable residual risk of MACEs. A growing amount of studies supported the notion that RC might contribute to this residual risk, which is of particular interest based on the fact that burgeoning prevalence of DM is associated with increased TG levels and its potential intersection with CAD. Emerging evidence indicated that RC was capable of converging a variety of proatherogenic effects, including monocyte activation, upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, and increased prothrombotic factors production. In-vitro and animal investigations provided the evidence that elevated RC levels could lead to atherosclerosis in the same way as elevated levels of LDL-C by penetrating the arterial wall, being taken up by macrophage and causing foam cell formation. These data may suggest that RC is more important than TG to explain the residual risk though their circulating concentrations are correlated. Numerous clinical studies also indicated that high RC concentrations were related to increased risk for atherosclerosis and CAD. A recent study showed that RC was associated with coronary atheroma progression independent of conventional lipid parameters. In addition to observational studies, a number of genetic studies have strongly shown that higher RC is a causal risk factor for CAD. More recently, the latest guideline for dyslipidemia management underlined the atherogenic effect of apoB and revealed that the clinical benefit of lipid-lowering therapy might attribute to the reduction of apoB-containing particles, which mostly referred to RC. Hence, the atherogenic effects of RC may explain the associations with an increased incidence of MACEs, as demonstrated in the present study.

### Atherogenic index of plasma is associated with major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113r1mw8]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) refers to a condition that involves cholesterol buildup in the arteries, often presenting as coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral artery disease of atherosclerotic origin. ASCVD is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among individuals with diabetes globally, resulting in an estimated annual cost of $37.3 billion. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been associated with the early onset of ASCVDs. Specifically, diabetic patients typically develop cardiovascular abnormalities with greater severity 14.6 years in advance than those without diabetes mellitus (DM). Established risk factors for ASCVDs include hypertension and dyslipidemia, which are common in patients with T2DM. Studies showed that patients pre-conditioned with dyslipidemia had dysregulated lipid and glucose metabolism (insulin resistance), resulting in a poorer prognosis of ASCVDs. Although the incidence of T2DM complications has reduced over the years due to advances in medicine, more than 382 million people in the world currently have diabetes, making them more vulnerable to ASCVD-related disability and deaths. Therefore, there is an urgent need for ASCVD prevention in diabetic individuals. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary first to develop effective ways to predict and diagnose T2DM-related ASCVDs more accurately at early stages.

### Joint associations of pre-diabetes, pre-hypertension, and pre-dyslipidemia with cardiovascular and metabolic disease progression [^116PAik4]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Pre-disease risk factors and CVD

Over a median follow-up of 7.1 years, 527 participants experienced CVD, including 135 strokes and 420 cases of heart disease. Table S4 shows the associations of pre-hypertension, pre-diabetes, and pre-dyslipidemia with CVD outcomes. However, only pre-dyslipidemia is associated with an increased risk of CVD (HR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.10–1.56) and heart disease (HR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.04–1.54), while pre-hypertension is associated with an elevated risk of stroke (HR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.05–2.09).

Figure 2 shows the associations between the number of pre-disease risk factors and the incidence of CVD, stroke, and heart diseases. The risk of CVD increases significantly with the number of pre-disease risk factors, with HRs of 1.33 (95% CI 1.04–1.69) for one risk factor, 1.37 (95% CI 1.14–1.89) for two, and 1.55 (95% CI 1.11–2.16) for three, compared to individuals without risk factors. Each additional pre-disease risk factor is associated with a 16.0% higher CVD risk (HR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.06–1.27). Similarly, stroke risk rises with the number of pre-disease risk factors, with an HR of 2.56 (95% CI 1.36–4.84) for three risk factors. For heart disease, although a similar trend is observed, the associations are weaker, with statistical significance only for two risk factors (HR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.02–1.78). Furthermore, the observed associations were consistent in the subgroup analyses (Tables S5–S7).

Studies retrieved and characteristics

Our initial search returned 31 662 articles. After screening titles and abstracts, 307 articles qualified for a full review (fig 1), and 129 studies, involving 10 069 955 individuals, were included in the analysis. Ninety seven studies (9 972 629 participants with a median follow-up time of 9.8 years, supplementary file 2) and 32 studies (97 326 participants with a median follow-up time of 3.2 years, supplementary file 3) reported an association of prediabetes with the primary outcomes in the general population and in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, respectively.

Fig 1
Flow of papers through review

The key characteristics of the studies included in the meta-analysis are presented in supplementary files 4 and 5. Of the 129 studies included, 50 were from Europe, 47 from Asia, 25 from North America (United States and Canada), two from South America (Brazil), three from Oceania (Australia), and one from Africa (Mauritius). One study included patients from Europe and Asia. Based on adjusted confounders, 91 studies (67 from the general population and 24 from patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease) met our criteria for adequate adjustment, while 38 studies (30 from the general population and eight from patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease) did not adequately adjust for potential confounders (supplementary files 6 and 7). According to the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale, 15 studies (11 from the general population and four from patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease) were graded as having fair quality; all other studies were graded as having good quality. Details of the quality assessment are presented in supplementary files 8 and 9.

All cause mortality and cardiovascular disease associated with prediabetes in the general population

In the general population, prediabetes was associated with an increased risk of all cause mortality (relative risk 1.13, 95% confidence interval 1.10 to 1.17), composite cardiovascular disease (1.15, 1.11 to 1.18), coronary heart disease (1.16, 1.11 to 1.21), and stroke (1.14, 1.08 to 1.20; fig 2). Significant heterogeneity was seen for the risk of all outcomes (all I 2 > 50%, P < 0.05) except for coronary heart disease (I 2 = 23.3%, P = 0.24), for the different definitions of prediabetes.

Good: 6 Fair: 30 High for lifestyle interventions and metformin Low for other medicationsk Two trials had > 5 y of follow-up; 1 had > 10 y of follow-up One trial reported reduction in both diabetes incidence and long-term adverse health outcomes with more than the 5-y follow-up, finding that a 6-y lifestyle intervention yielded an absolute decrease in diabetes incidence of 24% and was associated with 10% fewer deaths and 8% fewer cardiovascular deaths over 30 y. Diabetes was the leading cause of kidney failure, lower-limb amputations, and new cases of blindness among US adults.

1, 4 Risk factors associated with development of diabetes in adults include older age, family history, overweight and obesity, dietary and lifestyle factors, environmental exposures, and others. 5 Three tests can be used to identify diabetes or prediabetes: hemoglobin A1c concentration, fasting plasma glucose level, or oral glucose tolerance test6. ADDITION-Cambridge was a cluster RCT of 33 general practices that evaluated a stepwise screening approach starting with the result of a random capillary blood glucose measurement. The Ely study was a parallel-group RCT at a single practice that evaluated screening every 5 years with an oral glucose tolerance test along with screening for cardiovascular disease risk factors. The study had no protocol for standard interventions for those with screen-detected diabetes.

The risk of bias for the trial was rated as medium because of unclear methods of randomization, unclear allocation concealment, and baseline differences between groups. Among a subset of participants who were diagnosed with diabetes and attended a health assessment after 12 years, diabetes cases were identified a mean of 3. 3 years earlier for those in the screening group than in the control group. 50.

### Contributions of 2-h post-load glucose, fasting blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin elevations to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes in adults: a systematic analysis of global data [^117J9jGZ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

TABLE 3
Number of new cases with diabetes or pre‐diabetes caused by including fasting blood glucose (FPG) and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) as diagnostic measures.

While FPG and HbA1c elevations contribute significantly to the case number and prevalence of diabetes, their association with diabetic complications has been less certain. Previous studies consistently showed that 2hPG was still associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease and mortality after adjusting for FPG, HbA1c and other non‐glycaemic risk factors, suggesting that it was an 'independent' risk factor. By contrast, although numerous studies have shown that FPG and HbA1c were associated with the risk of diabetic complications when used individually, this association often disappeared after controlling for 2hPG, especially in the case of FPG. These findings cast doubt on whether FPG and HbA1c are independent risk factors of diabetic complications and whether treatment of individuals with isolated FPG or HbA1c elevation, particularly the former (which accounts 7% of all diabetes), would confer clinically important benefits in terms of preventing diabetic complications such as cardiovascular disease. The reason why 2hPG is more predictive of cardiovascular disease may be related to its stronger indication of postprandial glucose metabolism and insulin resistance. Postprandial glucose spikes contribute significantly to oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction, key drivers of atherosclerosis. 2hPG also correlates closely with insulin resistance, which is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. By contrast, FPG mainly captures basal glycaemia, which is more dependent on hepatic glucose outputand may not fully represent systemic metabolic dysfunction, while HbA1c reflects an average glucose but misses acute fluctuations linked to vascular damage. Having said that, we acknowledge that the evidence on the role of FPG and HbA1c in independently increasing risks of diabetic complications (both macrovascular and microvascular) is insufficient, and more research on this topic is warranted.

### Epidemiology of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease: translation from population to prevention: the kelly west award lecture 2009 [^1165Vqu2]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

In the book Epidemiology of Diabetes and Its Vascular Lesions (1978), Kelly West summarized extant knowledge of the distribution and causes of diabetes. The 30 years of epidemiological research that followed have seen remarkable advances in the understanding of obesity as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, and diabetes and pre-diabetes as risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Increasingly detailed understanding of these relationships has, unfortunately, been accompanied by an alarming increase in the prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. West recognized that pre-diabetes is recognizable as what we now call metabolic syndrome. He predicted that novel insight into diabetes pathogenesis would come from biochemical and genetic epidemiology studies. He predicted that type 2 diabetes could be prevented by healthy lifestyle change. The challenge now is for us to translate these insights into effective strategies for the prevention of the modern epidemic of diabetes and vascular disease.

### Pre-diabetes and the risk for cardiovascular disease: a systematic review of the evidence [^111S3eTD]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Our objective was to estimate the magnitude of the relative risk (RR) for cardiovascular disease associated with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) from published prospective observational studies.

Background

Hyperglycemia is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, the magnitude of the RR for cardiovascular disease associated with IFG and IGT is unclear.

Methods

We searched PubMed from 1997 through 2008 for relevant publications and performed a meta-analysis.

Results

In 18 publications with information about IFG (110 to 125 mg/dl) (IFG 110), estimates of RR ranged from 0.65 to 2.50. The fixed-effects summary estimate of RR was 1.20 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12 to 1.28). In 8 publications with information about IFG (100 to 125 mg/dl) (IFG 100), estimates of RR ranged from 0.87 to 1.40. The fixed-effects summary estimate of RR was 1.18 (95% CI: 1.09 to 1.28). In 8 publications with information about IGT, estimates of RR ranged from 0.83 to 1.34. The fixed-effects summary estimate of RR was 1.20 (95% CI: 1.07 to 1.34). Five studies combined IFG and IGT, yielding a fixed-effects summary estimate of RR of 1.10 (95% CI: 0.99 to 1.23). No significant difference between the summary estimates for men and women were detected (IFG 110: men: 1.17 [95% CI: 1.05 to 1.31], women: 1.30 [95% CI: 1.10 to 1.54]; IFG 100: men: 1.23 [95% CI: 1.06 to 1.42], women: 1.16 [95% CI: 0.99 to 1.36]).

Conclusions

Impaired fasting glucose and IGT are associated with modest increases in the risk for cardiovascular disease.

### Reversion from pre-diabetes mellitus to normoglycemia and risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in a Chinese population: a prospective cohort study [^111b9Eiq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

This study also showed that participants who developed diabetes mellitus trended toward a higher blood pressure and higher triglyceride, total cholesterol, BMI, and hs‐CRP levels than those who remained with pre–diabetes mellitus, whereas those whose pre–diabetes mellitus reverted to normal had a significantly more favorable profile. Reversion from pre–diabetes mellitus to normoglycemia was associated with reductions in blood pressure, triglycerides, and BMI. Indeed, weight loss has well‐known effects on lowering blood pressure 31, 32 and triglyceride concentration, 33 which occur independently of, but in tandem with, their impact on glucose homeostasis. 34

The biological mechanisms underpinning the finding that reversion from pre–diabetes mellitus to normoglycemia decreased the CVD risk remain speculative, but several possibilities exist. First, insulin resistance in the pre–diabetes mellitus stage could promote atherogenesis and likely contribute to the elevated risk of CVD. 35 Second, impaired fasting glucose is associated with some preclinical pathological changes in CVD, such as arterial stiffness, arterial endothelial dysfunction, and intima‐media thickening. 36 Third, weight loss is associated with reversion to normoglycemia. 37 Furthermore, individuals with pre–diabetes mellitus usually have some coexisting CVD risk factors (eg, dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, physical inactivity, and inflammation). 38

Prediabetes is an impaired state of glucose metabolism defined by elevated but not yet diabetic levels of fasting or 2-h glucose, or HbA1c. The specific cutoffs used to define prediabetes vary but the widely adopted American Diabetes Association (ADA) definitions are: impaired fasting glucose (IFG) = fasting glucose 5.6–6.9 mmol L −1; impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) = 2-h glucose 7.8–11.0 mmol L −1; HbA1c = 39–46 mmol L −1 (or 5.7–6.4%). The cooccurrence of IFG and IGT is termed "impaired glucose regulation".

Whilst the global prevalence of prediabetes in adults is about 7.3% (n = 352 million people), in Europe and the US, roughly 4.6% (n = 36 million people) and 33.9% (n = 84.1 million people) of the adult populations, respectively, are estimated to have prediabetes. In the short term, a relatively small proportion (5–10% annually) of those with prediabetes will progress to full-blown diabetes; however, after 5 years, about half will have developed the disease.

As diabetes progresses, it becomes increasingly difficult to treat, as the capacity to endogenously produce insulin diminishes and life-threatening complications arise. About five million people died from diabetes-related complications in 2015, of which more than 50% of the deaths were cardiovascular in nature, with costs attributable to diabetes amounting to about one trillion USD globally as of 2017.

Many observational studies have shown that prediabetes is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), suggesting that the pathogenic effects of dysregulated glucose metabolism have already begun even before diabetes is manifest. However, these observations cannot be directly interpreted as causal effects owing to the limitations of observational epidemiology. Nevertheless, if prediabetic blood glucose variation was known to cause micro- and/or macro-vascular disease, this could profoundly impact clinical guidelines for the prevention of micro- and macro-vascular disease.

### Glucose control and cardiovascular disease: is it important? No [^11495L9y]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

There is a substantial amount of clinical data showing the relationship between diabetes and atherosclerosis and its clinical complications. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is more common in people with diabetes than in subjects without the disease, and when it is present, it also has a more aggressive course and a worse prognosis. The bulk of epidemiological data has firmly established that type 2 diabetes is associated with more than a twofold increased risk for cardiovascular (CV) death. In the case of subjects with type 1 diabetes, in spite of the fact that the CVD rate is significantly lower compared with the population with type 2 diabetes, their relative risk for coronary heart mortality is sevenfold higher than in matched counterparts without the disease. Despite all of these data concerning the association of diabetes and CVD, the exact mechanism by which diabetes, and its alterations, is linked to atherosclerosis remains incompletely elucidated. This is especially true in the case of hyperglycemia. The role of nonglycemic factors that accompany the vast majority of patients with type 2 diabetes, such as high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and hemorreological abnormalities, among others, is much better understood and seems to be independent of glycemia. In addition to this, there have been studies demonstrating that interventions addressed to control these other factors in patients with diabetes effectively reduce CV risk. There also have been data including the use of statins, aspirin, the aggressive management of hypertension, and the use of ACE inhibitors. Therefore, the positive effects that the control of other factors beyond hyperglycemia exert on CVD are, nowadays, unquestionable. In contrast, to date, the positive effect of intensive glucose management in comparison to nonintensive glucose control on CVD outcomes is still far from proven and seems unlikely to change in the near future. As an example, the American Diabetes Association/American Heart Association in their last joint scientific statement on primary prevention of CVD in people with diabetes declared that, "No clinical trials of a glycemic intervention have provided clear-cut evidence that glucose lowering reduces the risk of CVD in subjects with diabetes". Furthermore, one of the latest U.S. Food and Drug Administration announcements on antidiabetic agents clearly concluded that, "There is insufficient information available to determine whether any oral antidiabetic medicine reduces cardiovascular risk" in people affected by diabetes.

### Effect of pre-diabetes on future risk of stroke: meta-analysis [^112gV1Bk]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The growing obesity epidemic in the United States has been inextricably linked with a surge in rates of pre-diabetes. Pre-diabetes has been called "America's largest healthcare epidemic", and current estimates indicate that about 35% of adults in the United States have pre-diabetes, or approximately 79 million people. This number is more than three times the number of people with frank diabetes (26 million people). Also concerning is that the overwhelming majority of people with pre-diabetes may be unaware of their risk of diabetes.

Pre-diabetes is generally defined as impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or both. In 1997 the American Diabetes Association defined impaired fasting glucose as a plasma glucose concentration of 110 to 125 mg/dL (6.1–6.9 mmol/L). However, in 2003 the American Diabetes Association redefined impaired fasting glucose as a plasma concentration of 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L). The underlying pathophysiological disturbances (insulin resistance and impaired β cell function) responsible for the development of type 2 diabetes are expressed in people with pre-diabetes. People with pre-diabetes harbour the same vascular risk factors (dysglycaemia, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obesity, physical inactivity, insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction, pro-coagulant state, and inflammation) that place people with type 2 diabetes at high risk of macrovascular complications. Pre-diabetes has been linked to a modest increase in overall cardiovascular events, but the effect of pre-diabetes on risk of future stroke has not been established.

The objective of this study was twofold: to investigate the direction and magnitude of the relation of pre-diabetes with risk of future stroke after accounting for other stroke risk factors, and to evaluate whether this relation varies on the basis of the threshold for impaired fasting glucose or inclusion of impaired glucose tolerance criteria in the diagnosis of pre-diabetes.

### Levels of pre β-1 high-density lipoprotein are a strong independent positive risk factor for coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction: a meta-analysis [^115j7hEY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death in the United States and in Europe resulting from myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. A central process in the development of atherosclerosis is the infiltration of lipid‐rich lipoproteins containing B apolipoproteins into the artery wall. High‐density lipoproteins (HDLs), on the other hand, are antiatherogenic because they mediate the removal of cholesterol from the artery wall via reverse cholesterol transport. Several prospective epidemiological studies have found that low serum HDL‐cholesterol (HDL‐C) concentrations constitute an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 A low plasma level of HDL‐C is a characteristic of the metabolic syndrome, a constellation of clinical features linking insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, HDL deficiency, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypertension with CHD. 6

### Managing atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk in young adults: JACC state-of-the-art review [^114pdYeU]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

There is a need to identify high-risk features that predict early-onset atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The authors provide insights to help clinicians identify and address high-risk conditions in the 20- to 39-year age range (young adults). These include tobacco use, elevated blood pressure/hypertension, family history of premature ASCVD, primary severe hypercholesterolemia such as familial hypercholesterolemia, diabetes with diabetes-specific risk-enhancing factors, or the presence of multiple other risk-enhancing factors, including in females, a history of pre-eclampsia or menopause under age 40. The authors update current thinking on lipid risk factors such as triglycerides, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, or lipoprotein (a) that are useful in understanding an individual's long-term ASCVD risk. The authors review emerging strategies, such as coronary artery calcium and polygenic risk scores in this age group, that have potential clinical utility, but whose best use remains uncertain. Finally, the authors discuss both the obstacles and opportunities for addressing prevention in early adulthood.

### Diabetes and pre-diabetes are associated with cardiovascular risk factors and carotid / femoral intima-media thickness independently of markers of insulin resistance and adiposity [^111pfT7Y]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our data show that IGT and to a lesser extent IFG (in addition to DM) are associated with impaired cardiovascular conditions (whether risk factors or IMT) and that these associations are only moderately mediated by markers of adiposity and insulin resistance. These findings provide further evidence for increased cardiovascular risk associated with pre-diabetes (the increased cardiovascular risk associated with DM is well established) and further stress the need for early screening and management of pre-diabetes.

### Association between prediabetes and risk of all cause mortality and cardiovascular disease: updated meta-analysis [^1136J8Sz]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

In patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the risk of all cause mortality associated with prediabetes was higher in Asian than in non-Asian patients. Although a chance finding cannot be excluded, previous studies have suggested plausible and interesting mechanisms. Firstly, compared with their Western counterparts, Asian individuals might have a different pattern for complications of diabetes. A meta-analysis of interventional randomised controlled trials showed that the risk of microvascular events and new or worsening nephropathy was significantly higher in Asian patients than in western patients. In our analysis, the risk of macrovascular disease (composite cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, and stroke) associated with prediabetes was similar in Asian and non-Asian patients. Therefore, the increased risk of all cause mortality might be attributed to microvascular events. This finding is further supported by previous studies which showed that Asian patients with prediabetes might progress more rapidly to clinical diabetes, and when they develop diabetes, microvascular complications develop more rapidly.

Secondly, differences in genetics, socioeconomic factors, and treatment approaches for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease between Asia and other continents might also have a role in the influence of prediabetes on mortality in Asia. Based on these results, prediabetes management programmes, tailored to Asian patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, might be clinically important, and these programmes should be investigated in future studies. Thirdly, in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, there might be a survival advantage associated with overweight or obesity (so-called obesity paradox). Phenotypic differences in people with impaired glucose regulation have been seen between ethnic groups. Asian populations develop impaired glucose regulation at lower levels of body mass index than European populations, and therefore they might not experience the obesity paradox similarly to their Western counterparts.

### Diabetes and atherosclerosis… [^114qCRvU]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

Author Affiliations: Leducq Center for Cardiovascular Research, Cardiovascular Division, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital; and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Mass. Context Complications of atherosclerosis cause most morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus. Despite the frequency and severity of disease, proven medical therapy remains incompletely understood and underused. Objective To review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and medical and invasive treatment of atherosclerosis in patients with diabetes mellitus. Data Sources Using the index terms diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular diseases, cerebrovascular accident, endothelium, vascular smooth muscle, platelets, thrombosis, cholesterol, hypertension, hyperglycemia, insulin, angioplasty, and coronary artery bypass, we. searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from 1976 to 2001.

Additional data sources included bibliographies of identified articles and preliminary data presented at recent cardiology conferences. Study Selection We selected original investigations and reviews of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and therapy of atherosclerosis in diabetes. We selected randomized. double-blind, controlled studies, when available, to support therapeutic recommendations. Criteria for data inclusion included publication in a peer-reviewed journal or presentation at a national cardiovascular society–sponsored meeting. Data Extraction Data quality was determined by publication in peer-reviewed literature. Data extraction was performed by one of the authors. Data Synthesis Diabetes mellitus markedly increases the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, amputation, and death. The metabolic abnormalities caused by diabetes induce vascular dysfunction that predisposes this patient population to atherosclerosis.

Blood pressure control, lipid-lowering therapy, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, and antiplatelet drugs significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular. events. Although diabetic patients undergo revascularization procedures because of acute coronary syndromes or critical limb ischemia, the outcomes are less favorable than in nondiabetic cohorts. Conclusions Since most patients with diabetes die from complications of atherosclerosis, they should receive intensive preventive interventions proven to reduce their cardiovascular risk.

### Association of pre-diabetes with the risks of adverse health outcomes and complex multimorbidity: evidence from population-based studies in the NIS and UK biobank [^111rAKoq]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this study, associations between pre-diabetes and a range of diseases are well recognised, we also have two key findings that are novel and better described than previous studies. First, a comprehensive analysis of 76 disease outcomes, which facilitates a deeper understanding of the health effects of pre-diabetes, showed that pre-diabetes is robustly associated with 24 non-overlapping diseases across multiple organ systems. Second, people with pre-diabetes are at a significantly increased risk of developing multimorbidity compared with those with normoglycaemia. Our findings imply that a more aggressive management and care of pre-diabetes is likely warranted to prevent the accompanying development of complex comorbidity, thus improving the quality of life.

The present study has innovatively displayed those individuals with pre-diabetes are associated with increased risks of gout, pulmonary embolism, diseases of liver, valvular lesions, colonic polyp, arthrosis and back pain, which have not been reported in previous studies. Our study finds that the positive correlations between pre-diabetes and multiple vascular diseases are consistent with the results of previous studies. With regard to cardiovascular diseases, an analysis from the UK Biobank indicated that pre-diabetes was associated with elevated cardiovascular disease risk even before progression to type 2 diabetes. Individuals with pre-diabetes may have more significant early arteriosclerosis, and they were at an increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation. The recent meta-analysis also summarised that pre-diabetes is positively associated with the risk of multiple cardiovascular outcomes. Indeed, retinopathy is a common microvascular complication in patients with diabetes, and pre-diabetes before the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is associated with an increased risk of microvascular disease. In our predefined list of three eye diseases and diagnostic groups, pre-diabetes increases the risk of choroidal and retinal diseases, cataract and other lens disorders. A meta-analysis that included nine cross-sectional studies also showed that pre-diabetes was associated with a higher prevalence of retinopathy compared with normoglycaemia. Early detection of pre-diabetes may provide an opportunity to reduce the burden of macrovascular and microvascular disease, as such diseases can precede the development of overt diabetes.

### Interplay of glycated hemoglobin and traditional risk factors for the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in people without diabetes [^113GGSix]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the world's leading cause of mortality, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), a major contributor to the global CVD burden, accounted for approximately 23% of all deaths globally in 2021. Assessing cardiovascular risk in individuals without CVD relies on identifying the presence or absence of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs). Over 50% of new CVD cases in both men and women can be attributed to traditional modifiable CVRFs, including diabetes. Despite significant improvements in certain CVRFs, the prevalence of ASCVD among U.S. adults has remained relatively stable, while the overall burden of CVD has progressively increased over the past 20 years.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), defined in part by a glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level ≥ 6.5%, is a major metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance, resulting in hyperglycemia and an increased risk of CVD and all-cause mortality. Recent evidence indicates that prediabetes, as defined by HbA1c levels, is associated with an increased risk of CVD and all-cause mortality in the general population, although findings vary significantly across studies. An analysis of individual participant data from 73 prospective studies involving 294,998 participants without a known history of diabetes mellitus or CVD at baseline showed that incorporating HbA1c values into cardiovascular risk assessment provided little additional predictive value. Additionally, low HbA1c levels (< 5.0%) have been linked to an increased risk of all-cause but not cardiovascular mortality in individuals without diabetes. The current European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines on diabetes, prediabetes, and CVD focus solely on individuals with diabetes, largely overlooking prediabetes due to a lack of clear evidence. In the United States, the Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) risk score does not include HbA1c as a predictor; Similarly, the recently proposed Predicting Risk of CVD EVENTs (PREVENT) equations incorporate HbA1c only as an optional variable, intended to improve risk stratification when clinically indicated, such as in individuals with diabetes or prediabetes.

No. number; CI, confidence interval

Sex-specific factors in women merit consideration. In US guidelines, factors such as pre-eclampsia and early menopause are regarded as 'risk-enhancing' with recommendation for statin therapy in women otherwise at borderline or intermediate risk. The 2021 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Prevention guideline recommends screening for hypertension and diabetes in women with a history of pregnancy-induced hypertension, PCOS, and gestational diabetes. Women are also disproportionately at risk of chronic kidney disease, itself a risk factor for ASCVD, which presents earlier than in men. Auto-immune inflammatory diseases, which impact women more than men increasing risk for premature ASCVD, independent of traditional risk factors, are also considered 'risk-enhancing' factors by guidelines (Table 1).

### Association between prediabetes and risk of all cause mortality and cardiovascular disease: updated meta-analysis [^114GQjtb]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To evaluate the associations between prediabetes and the risk of all cause mortality and incident cardiovascular disease in the general population and in patients with a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Design

Updated meta-analysis.

Data sources

Electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar) up to 25 April 2020.

Review methods

Prospective cohort studies or post hoc analysis of clinical trials were included for analysis if they reported adjusted relative risks, odds ratios, or hazard ratios of all cause mortality or cardiovascular disease for prediabetes compared with normoglycaemia. Data were extracted independently by two investigators. Random effects models were used to calculate the relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. The primary outcomes were all cause mortality and composite cardiovascular disease. The secondary outcomes were the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke.

Results

A total of 129 studies were included, involving 10 069 955 individuals for analysis. In the general population, prediabetes was associated with an increased risk of all cause mortality (relative risk 1.13, 95% confidence interval 1.10 to 1.17), composite cardiovascular disease (1.15, 1.11 to 1.18), coronary heart disease (1.16, 1.11 to 1.21), and stroke (1.14, 1.08 to 1.20) in a median follow-up time of 9.8 years. Compared with normoglycaemia, the absolute risk difference in prediabetes for all cause mortality, composite cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, and stroke was 7.36 (95% confidence interval 9.59 to 12.51), 8.75 (6.41 to 10.49), 6.59 (4.53 to 8.65), and 3.68 (2.10 to 5.26) per 10 000 person years, respectively. Impaired glucose tolerance carried a higher risk of all cause mortality, coronary heart disease, and stroke than impaired fasting glucose. In patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, prediabetes was associated with an increased risk of all cause mortality (relative risk 1.36, 95% confidence interval 1.21 to 1.54), composite cardiovascular disease (1.37, 1.23 to 1.53), and coronary heart disease (1.15, 1.02 to 1.29) in a median follow-up time of 3.2 years, but no difference was seen for the risk of stroke (1.05, 0.81 to 1.36). Compared with normoglycaemia, in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the absolute risk difference in prediabetes for all cause mortality, composite cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, and stroke was 66.19 (95% confidence interval 38.60 to 99.25), 189.77 (117.97 to 271.84), 40.62 (5.42 to 78.53), and 8.54 (32.43 to 61.45) per 10 000 person years, respectively. No significant heterogeneity was found for the risk of all outcomes seen for the different definitions of prediabetes in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (all P > 0.10).

Conclusions

Results indicated that prediabetes was associated with an increased risk of all cause mortality and cardiovascular disease in the general population and in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Screening and appropriate management of prediabetes might contribute to primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

### Atherosclerosis in diabetes and insulin resistance [^1133eDU5]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease are the major causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes and those with insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. Both conditions profoundly accelerate the development of atherosclerosis and increase the morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular events. The question, therefore, is what are the molecular/biochemical mechanisms that underlie the potentiating influence of diabetes, the metabolic syndrome and/or insulin resistance on the development and progression of atherosclerosis? The following review will focus on the molecular mechanism whereby hyperglycaemia and/or hyperinsulinemia either directly or indirectly promote atherosclerosis.

### Hyperglycaemia-associated caspase-3 predicts diabetes and coronary artery disease events [^113tQzxL]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

sCaspase-3 predicts atherosclerotic coronary artery disease events

Cell apoptosis is a common feature of human atherosclerosis, suggested to contribute to plaque growth in the later stage of the disease. Apoptotic cells are also present at the sites of plaque ruptures, the most common cause of coronary events. Therefore, markers of cell apoptosis have gained interest as candidate markers of the atherosclerotic disease and events.

Caspase-3 is an executioner enzyme that regulates cell apoptosis. Circulating Caspase-3 may be released from either apoptotic cells or live cells exposed to cell stress stimuli, potentially as a response to avoid cell apoptosis.

In the Dallas Heart Study, Matulevicius et al showed that high levels of sCaspase-3 were associated with a higher coronary calcium score, potentially reflecting late-stage atherosclerosis. Therefore, sCaspase-3 levels could potentially be associated with coronary atherosclerotic disease rather than the presence of vulnerable plaques causing acute complications. A previous study of sCaspase-3 in the MDC-CC cohort did not find any significant relationship between Caspase-3 and incidence of acute coronary events. However, that study had a shorter follow-up period and did not include non-acute coronary interventions, and the absence of a significant difference could be related to lower statistical power and a different end-point definition compared with the present study. The present study showed that sCaspase-3 levels predict future CAD (including acute coronary events and non-acute coronary interventions) in a cohort without known cardiovascular disease. sCaspase-3 remained a significant predictor of future CAD after adjusting for major cardiovascular risk factors according to the Framingham risk score, BMI and diabetes. The association between sCaspase-3 and CAD could be due to the pre-CAD diabetes. However, sCaspase-3 was associated with CAD both through diabetes and independently of diabetes according to our sensitivity analysis. This suggests that sCaspase-3 is a marker of coronary atherosclerotic events in general and may not be specific to the acute cardiovascular events.

Limitations of the study

A limitation of the present study is that the PEA methodology cannot differentiate between active and inactive sCaspase-3 or between free proteins or proteins bound to extracellular vesicles. Moreover, we cannot separate different forms of diabetes, yet the vast majority of cases included will be T2D.

### Nonlinear relationship between atherogenic index of plasma and the risk of prediabetes: a retrospective study based on Chinese adults [^112FeJyQ]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Prediabetes is defined as a condition in which blood glucose parameters are above normal but below the threshold for diabetes, and it is a high-risk state for developing diabetes. The International Diabetes Federation reported that prevalence rates of prediabetes were 7.7% worldwide in 2017, which affected around 374 million people. It is predicted by the International Diabetes Federation that 548 million adults will have prediabetes by 2045, representing 8.6% of adults worldwide. Approximately 5–10% of adults with prediabetes develop diabetes each year, and about 70% of adults with prediabetes become diabetes finally. Some research reported that individuals with prediabetes are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease, which indicates that the pathogenic effects of impaired glucose may begin even before people develop diabetes. The increasing prevalence of prediabetes worldwide and its complications make blood glucose disorder a serious public health problem. In order to prevent and treat diabetes in its early stages, many studies explored the risk factors for prediabetes and diabetes. While prediabetes may represent a transient intermediary phase, its presence substantially heightens the likelihood of subsequent development of both type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular ailments. Furthermore, when patients with prediabetes have dyslipidemia, the risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease is markedly amplified. Evidence from previous studies also pointed out that lifestyle changes, medication, and control of dyslipidemia can prevent prediabetes from developing into diabetes. Therefore, it is crucial to screen for risk factors for prediabetes and to treat these conditions as early as possible to prevent the disease from progressing and suffering negative effects.

### Clinical staging to guide management of metabolic disorders and their sequelae: a European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement [^113SyZfh]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Systemic metabolic disorder staging, prevalence of systemic metabolic disorder, and risk conferred by systemic metabolic disorder

As indicated above, the individual SMD components do not appear in isolation, and there are many bidirectional associations between them. Given that a person with SMD will likely have more than one comorbidity, it is, therefore, essential to take a holistic approach to clinical management. To facilitate this process, we propose a staging system for SMD, as shown in Box 2, that we use to guide actionable management of SMD as it progresses. Stage 1 is characterized by metabolic abnormalities before organ damage, Stage 2 is characterized by early organ damage, and Stage 3 is characterized by more advanced organ damage. The defining criteria for each SMD stage are described in more detail in the next section.

Box 2
Definition of each stage of systemic metabolic disorder

- Stage 1 is defined as the presence of (i) insulin resistance/pre-diabetes alone or (ii) overweight/dysfunctional adiposity and at least one of the following traits: isolated liver steatosis, hypertension, or atherogenic dyslipidaemia

### Joint associations of pre-diabetes, pre-hypertension, and pre-dyslipidemia with cardiovascular and metabolic disease progression [^112ZECJE]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this nationally representative cohort of middle-aged and older Chinese adults, we found a positive association between the cumulative number of pre-disease states (the pre-disease triad of pre-diabetes, pre-hypertension, and pre-dyslipidemia) and subsequent CVD risk. Importantly, interaction analyses showed significant additive and multiplicative interactions between pairs of pre-disease conditions, emphasizing the need for early and comprehensive prevention strategies.

Our findings align with previous epidemiological evidence associating individual pre-disease conditions with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A meta-analysis of 53 prospective cohort studies (n = 1,611,339) reported that prediabetes, defined by impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or elevated HbA1c, significantly increased the risks of CVD and all-cause mortality, with variation depending on the diagnostic criteria used. Studies such as DECODE and the San Antonio Heart Study have also identified prediabetes as a strong predictor of CVD, with the risk increasing prior to the onset of diabetes. Similarly, large-scale observational studies have shown that prehypertension, particularly at blood pressure levels of 130 to 139 mmHg systolic or 85 to 89 mmHg diastolic, is associated with elevated risks of premature death and cardiovascular morbidity. Several cohort studies have further reported significant associations between prehypertension and increased stroke risk. Importantly, emerging evidence suggests that pre-disease states are reversible, and such reversal is correlated with a reduction in cardiovascular risk. For instance, a Chinese cohort study (n = 14,231) found that reversion from prediabetes to normoglycemia was associated with a 22% lower risk of CVD and an 18% lower risk of all-cause mortality.

### Characteristics of atheromatosis in the prediabetes stage: a cross-sectional investigation of the ILERVAS project [^112KK6ZP]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, prediabetes is associated with a significantly increased burden of atheromatous disease in men with 2 or more CV risk factors. This finding points to this subpopulation as the main target for strategies aimed at reducing CV risk factors and HbA1c. In addition, our results suggest that the global impact of prediabetes on the atherosclerotic process in the entire population is quite limited.

Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes — atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk categories define lipid targets to guide therapy. High risk (< 10% 10-year risk) has goals LDL-C < 100 mg/dl, apo B < 90 mg/dl, and non–HDL-C < 130 mg/dl. Very high risk (10%–20% 10-year risk) targets LDL-C < 70 mg/dl, apo B < 80 mg/dl, and non–HDL-C < 100 mg/dl. Extreme risk (> 20% 10-year risk) specifies LDL-C < 55 mg/dl, apo B < 70 mg/dl, and non–HDL-C < 90 mg/dl, with criteria including target organ damage such as estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 or ABI < 0.9.

### Diabetes, prediabetes, and cardiovascular risk: shifting the paradigm [^114TPhAG]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

As the prevalence of diabetes continues to increase worldwide, diabetes-related macrovascular morbidity and mortality are becoming major health care problems. Epidemiologic evidence suggests this relationship begins early in the progression from normal glucose tolerance to frank diabetes. This report reviews this epidemiologic evidence linking early stages of glucose dysregulation with cardiovascular disease and discusses the results of major clinical trials demonstrating that lifestyle or pharmacologic intervention can reduce the incidence of diabetes in high-risk individuals. These observations indicate that early identification and aggressive treatment of subjects with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance have the potential to reduce both the incidence of diabetes and its related cardiovascular disease. Three clinical trials are being conducted to test whether early pharmacotherapy can reduce or delay the incidence of diabetes, and their results may well begin to shift the treatment paradigm toward earlier intervention.

### Glycated hemoglobin and subclinical Atherosclerosis in people without diabetes [^113o53dc]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The metabolic injury caused by protein glycation, monitored as the level of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), is not represented in most risk scores (i.e. Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk scale).

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to assess the association between HbA1c and the extent of subclinical atherosclerosis (SA) and to better identify individuals at higher risk of extensive SA using HbA1c on top of key cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs).

Methods

A cohort of 3,973 middle-aged individuals from the PESA (Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis) study, with no history of cardiovascular disease and with HbA1c in the nondiabetic range, were assessed for the presence and extent of SA by 2-dimensional vascular ultrasound and noncontrast cardiac computed tomography.

Results

After adjusting for established CVRFs, HbA1c showed an association with the multiterritorial extent of SA (odds ratio: 1.05, 1.27, 1.27, 1.36, 1.80, 1.87, and 2.47 for HbA1c 4.9% to 5.0%, 5.1% to 5.2%, 5.3% to 5.4%, 5.5% to 5.6%, 5.7% to 5.8%, 5.9% to 6.0%, and 6.1% to 6.4%, respectively; reference HbA1c ≤ 4.8%; p < 0.001). The association was significant in all pre-diabetes groups and even below the pre-diabetes cut-off (HbA1c 5.5% to 5.6% odds ratio: 1.36 [95% confidence interval: 1.03 to 1.80]; p = 0.033). High HbA1c was associated with an increased risk of SA in low-risk individuals (p < 0.001), but not in moderate-risk individuals (p = 0.335). Relative risk estimations using Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease predictors confirmed that inclusion of HbA1c modified the risk of multiterritorial SA in most risk categories.

Conclusions

Routine use of HbA1c can identify asymptomatic individuals at higher risk of SA on top of traditional CVRFs. Lifestyle interventions and novel antidiabetic medications might be considered to reduce both HbA1c levels and SA in individuals without diabetes.

### Interplay of glycated hemoglobin and traditional risk factors for the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in people without diabetes [^111wSgh5]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our pooled analysis of 20,360 individuals initially free of diabetes and ASCVD from four U.S. cohort studies, higher HbA1c levels were associated with progressively increased risks of ASCVD and all-cause mortality. Risks ranged from a 17% increase in ASCVD and a 14% increase in mortality at HbA1c levels of 5.5–5.9%, to 59% and 35%, respectively, at levels of 6.0–6.4%. These elevated risks remained consistent even at the extremes of CVRF burden, regardless of whether none or all three CVRFs were present. The effect of higher HbA1c levels within the prediabetic range on all-cause mortality was more pronounced in non-Black individuals compared to Black individuals. HbA1c levels < 5.0% were associated with a 17% higher mortality risk, which persisted among individuals with no CVRFs.

### American college of endocrinology pre-diabetes consensus conference: part one [^1146iXRS]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Jacqueline Dekker (Amsterdam, the Netherlands) discussed the Hoorn Study, emphasizing the need for evidence-based prevention of diabetes and vascular complications. She discussed the complex history of criteria for diabetes and pre-diabetes. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) definitions of diabetes accept fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l/l) and 2-h post–75-g glucose load levels ≥ 200 mg/dl (≥ 11.1 mmol/l). In 2003, the ADA suggested that the lower limit of IFG be reduced from 110 to 100 mg/dl, putting it in conflict with the WHO guidelines. Genuth and Kahn have recently argued that neither IGT nor IGT is useful. Recently, there have been proposals that A1C should be used in the diagnosis of diabetes. There are, then, a number of approaches to assessing diabetes risk: those based on direct measures (IFG and IGT) and those based on markers like A1C and the presence of metabolic syndrome. Dekker proposed that we endeavor to understand the performance of the differing definitions and the prevalence of the (pre-) disease states so defined, their agreement, and their associations with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and with diabetes from the dual perspectives of clinical care and public health interests.

### Fetuin – A and risk of diabetes-related vascular complications: a prospective study [^113oseou]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Human prospective studies on fetuin-A and incidence of diabetes or CVD have so far yielded contradicting results. Although several systematic reviews reported an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) with higher fetuin-A concentrations, two recent Mendelian Randomization (MR) studies did not support the causality of these associations. Fetuin-A was positively associated with CVD in healthy community-dwelling adults in EPIC-Potsdam, a finding which was subsequently corroborated by a genetic analysis. However, a recent meta-analysis of 7 prospective studies (exclusive EPIC-Potsdam) could not confirm a higher CVD risk for genetic variants associated with higher fetuin-A levels. As to diabetes complications, the previous studies were primarily of cross-sectional nature and reported inverse associations of fetuin-A with macrovascular events, such as peripheral arterial disease and the presence of atherosclerotic plaques in individuals with T2D. The only two prospective studies on fetuin-A and risk of macrovascular diabetes-associated disease are the Rancho Bernardo Study (RBS) and Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) studies, in which higher baseline fetuin-A levels among individuals with diabetes were related to higher rates of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The conflicting data on fetuin-A regulation in cardiometabolic disease onset clearly need to be reconciled in terms of timing of events and causality. Yet prospective epidemiologic studies to evaluate associations with microvascular outcomes in diabetes are still missing. Moreover, no study so far has examined the relationships of vascular diabetes-related complications with plasma fetuin-A measured prior to diabetes diagnosis and unaffected by the presence of disease or treatment, which is key for etiological research. In this prospective study we investigated the relationships between circulating pre-diagnosis fetuin-A concentrations and risk of diabetes-related microvascular and macrovascular disease, controlling for a wide range of potential confounders and across both sexes and subgroups with different liver and kidney functions, BMI, fasting state, and glucose metabolism.

### Cardiovascular disease in diabetes, beyond glucose [^112aJzis]. Cell Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite the decades-old knowledge that diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the reasons for this association are only partially understood. While this association is true for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, different pathophysiological processes may be responsible. Lipids and other risk factors are indeed important, whereas the role of glucose is less clear. This lack of clarity stems from clinical trials that do not unambiguously show that intensive glycemic control reduces cardiovascular events. Animal models have provided mechanisms that link diabetes to increased atherosclerosis, and evidence consistent with the importance of factors beyond hyperglycemia has emerged. We review clinical, pathological, and animal studies exploring the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in humans living with diabetes and in mouse models of diabetes. An increased effort to identify risk factors beyond glucose is now needed to prevent the increased cardiovascular disease risk associated with diabetes.

### Association between serum visfatin levels and atherosclerotic plaque in patients with type 2 diabetes [^112PheYw]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in China. Atherosclerosis is the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease and inflammation and oxidative stress are thought to play an important role in this complex process. Increasing evidence has highlighted that diabetes is a major risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic and experimental data further suggested that the pathohistological characteristics and clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis differed depending on the vascular territory involved. Carotid and femoral atherosclerotic plaques are associated with distinctive therapeutic outcomes. Exploring the roles of different inflammatory mediators within the carotid and femoral plaques in patients with diabetes will help to clarify the exact pathogenesis of atherosclerotic lesions. However, the risk factors and mechanisms contributing to development of these complications are inadequately investigated.

Visfatin, also known as nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), or pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF), has been identified as a novel and multifaceted protein, which plays an important role in regulating a variety of physiological and pathological functions. In the context of metabolic diseases, elevated circulating levels of visfatin have been proposed as markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. The association between circulating visfatin with cardiovascular disease has also been extensively analyzed. High visfatin plasma levels may promote vascular inflammation and atherosclerotic plaque destabilization. Increased serum visfatin levels have been associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome. However, circulating visfatin levels in atherosclerosis plaque progression in patients with type 2 diabetes, or its association with the vascular territory affected remain unclear.

The aim of this study was to explore the association between circulating visfatin and carotid, femoral artery atherosclerosis in a Chinese population with type 2 diabetes and to analyze the difference of visfatin levels between patients with carotid and femoral plaques.

### Sex differences in cardiovascular risk associated with prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes [^112LtcrD]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Women with Type 2 diabetes (T2D) face up to 50% higher risk of cardiovascular disease than men. This study evaluated the extent to which prediabetes and undiagnosed T2D are associated with a greater excess risk of cardiovascular disease in women versus in men.

Methods

Data were pooled from 18,745 cardiovascular disease-free individuals from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, and the Jackson Heart Study. The risk of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease or stroke) associated with prediabetes or undiagnosed T2D was estimated using Cox models adjusting for sociodemographic factors, concomitant risk factors, medication use, and menopausal status. Data were collected in 2022, and the analysis was performed in 2023.

Results

During a median follow-up of 18.6 years, the associations between prediabetes and risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were only significant in women (hazard ratio = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.34, p = 0.03) but not in men (hazard ratio = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.00, 1.28, p = 0.06) (p-interaction = 0.18). The associations between undiagnosed T2D and cardiovascular disease outcomes were significant in both sexes, but the effect was more pronounced in women (coronary heart disease: hazard ratio = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.4, 2.41, p < 0.0001 in women vs hazard ratio = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.38, 2.07, p = 0.007 in men; stroke: hazard ratio = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.39, 2.72, p < 0.0001 vs hazard ratio = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.36, 2.6, p < 0.0001; atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: hazard ratio = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.5, 2.28, p < 0.0001 vs hazard ratio = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.4, 1.98, p < 0.0001) (all p-interactions ≤ 0.2). Both White and Black patients exhibit similar sex differences.

Conclusions

Prediabetes or undiagnosed T2D was associated with a greater excess risk of cardiovascular disease in women than in men. The sex differential in cardiovascular disease risk among those without the T2D diagnosis suggests the need for sex-specific guidelines in T2D screening and treatment.

### Diabetes and pre-diabetes are associated with cardiovascular risk factors and carotid / femoral intima-media thickness independently of markers of insulin resistance and adiposity [^112PVHsj]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Impaired glucose regulation (IGR) is associated with detrimental cardiovascular outcomes such as cardiovascular disease risk factors (CVD risk factors) or intima-media thickness (IMT). Our aim was to examine whether these associations are mediated by body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (waist) or fasting serum insulin (insulin) in a population in the African region.

Methods

Major CVD risk factors (systolic blood pressure, smoking, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol,) were measured in a random sample of adults aged 25–64 in the Seychelles (n = 1255, participation rate: 80.2%).

According to the criteria of the American Diabetes Association, IGR was divided in four ordered categories: 1) normal fasting glucose (NFG), 2) impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and normal glucose tolerance (IFG/NGT), 3) IFG and impaired glucose tolerance (IFG/IGT), and 4) diabetes mellitus (DM). Carotid and femoral IMT was assessed by ultrasound (n = 496).

Results

Age-adjusted levels of the major CVD risk factors worsened gradually across IGR categories (NFG < IFG/NGT < IFG/IGT < DM), particularly HDL-cholesterol and blood pressure (p for trend < 0.001). These relationships were marginally attenuated upon further adjustment for waist, BMI or insulin (whether considered alone or combined) and most of these relationships remained significant. With regards to IMT, the association was null with IFG/NGT, weak with IFG/IGT and stronger with DM (all more markedly at femoral than carotid levels). The associations between IMT and IFG/IGT or DM (adjusted by age and major CVD risk factors) decreased only marginally upon further adjustment for BMI, waist or insulin. Further adjustment for family history of diabetes did not alter the results.

Conclusion

We found graded relationships between IGR categories and both major CVD risk factors and carotid/femoral IMT. These relationships were only partly accounted for by BMI, waist and insulin. This suggests that increased CVD-risk associated with IGR is also mediated by factors other than the considered markers of adiposity and insulin resistance. The results also imply that IGR and associated major CVD risk factors should be systematically screened and appropriately managed.

### Interplay of glycated hemoglobin and traditional risk factors for the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in people without diabetes [^115LYd8t]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

A recent U.K. Biobank study revealed that the risk of incident CVD in high-risk individuals with prediabetes is roughly similar to that of patients with diabetes. Similarly, we observed notable differences in event rates based on HbA1c levels and CVRF categories. Among individuals with none and those with all CVRFs, the difference in ASCVD event rates between HbA1c levels of 6.0–6.4% (highest category) and 5.0–5.4% (reference category) was 3.7 and 15.2 per 1000 person-years, respectively. Indeed, in individuals free of diabetes and with high HbA1c levels, cardiovascular risk is highly dependent on the presence of other CVRFs; a cohort of 10,144 individuals reported much higher CVD event rates in high-risk individuals without diabetes and with HbA1c < 5.5% than in low-risk individuals with HbA1c of 6.0–6.4% (29.6 vs 2.5 per 1000 person-years, respectively). Furthermore, regarding HbA1c levels in diabetic ranges, it was also shown that HbA1c levels of 7.0–8.0% had a stronger cardiovascular impact in individuals with moderate baseline ASCVD risk than those at lower ASCVD risk (< 10%).

### Association between prediabetes and risk of all cause mortality and cardiovascular disease: updated meta-analysis [^114tTdgT]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

We performed the search in accordance with the recommendations of the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) group. Electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar) were searched for studies with a combined MeSH heading and text search strategy, with multiple terms associated with "blood glucose" and "cardiovascular disease" or "mortality". The first round search was conducted up to 30 June 2019, a second round search was updated on 9 December 2019, and a third round search was updated on 25 April 2020, during the revision process (see supplementary file 1 for the detailed method used to search PubMed). The strategies for the other databases were similar but adapted where necessary. Reference lists were manually checked to identify other potential studies.

Studies were included for analysis if they met these criteria: prospective cohort studies or post hoc analysis of clinical trials of adult individuals (aged ≥ 18), from the general population or from patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; blood glucose or glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c), and other cardiovascular risk factors, were evaluated at baseline; and adjusted relative risks, odds ratios, or hazard ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) were reported for all cause mortality, composite cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, and stroke associated with prediabetes in comparison with normoglycaemia.

Prediabetes was defined as any or all of the following: impaired fasting glucose according to the definition of the American Diabetes Association (IFG-ADA)or the World Health Organization (IFG-WHO); impaired glucose tolerance; or raised HbA 1c according to the criteria of the American Diabetes Association (HbA 1c -ADA)or the International Expert Committee (HbA 1c -IEC). Normoglycaemia was defined according to the different guidelines (table 1).

### Hemoglobin A1c and abdominal obesity as predictors of diabetes and ASCVD in individuals with prediabetes in UK biobank: a prospective observational study [^1124sg1q]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Whether "prediabetes" merits particular clinical attention beyond the management of associated risk factors is controversial, particularly given the expansion of the definition of prediabetes from HbA1c 6.0–6.4% to 5.7–6.4%. Accordingly, we compared the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and type II diabetes mellitus (DM) risk in male and female participants with prediabetes and HbA1c 5.7–6.0% (low) versus 6.1–6.4% (high) to examine whether preventive recommendations should prioritize treating blood sugar or obesity, the major determinants of risk of DM versus other causes of ASCVD, such as lipids and blood pressure.

Research Design and Methods

10-year risks of ASCVD and DM risk were determined separately in 296,470 women and men, age 40–73, from UK Biobank, free of ASCVD and DM at baseline. Cox proportional hazards regression with adjustment for conventional risk factors and Kaplan-Meier estimators were used with low (HbA1c 5.7–6.0%) and high prediabetes (HbA1c 6.1–6.4%) as primary exposuress with further stratification and adjustment for waist circumference.

Results

In multivariate-adjusted models, low and high prediabetes was associated with increased risk of ASCVD versus normal HbA1c in both women (HR = 1.08, 95% CI 1.01,1.15 in low prediabetes and 1.25, 95% CI 1.14,1.38 in high prediabetes) and men (HR = 1.18, 95%CI 1.11,1.24 in low prediabetes and 1.27, 95% CI 1.17,1.38 in high prediabetes). The associations with new onset DM were substantially more potent, achieving HR of 4.05, 95%CI 3.73,4.40 in low prediabetic women versus 14.22, 95% CI 13.06,15.49 in high pre-diabetic women and 4.45, 95% CI 4.12,4.80 in low prediabetic men versus 15.59, 95% CI 14.43,16.85 in high pre-diabetic men. Furthermore, increasing waist circumference in low prediabetic men and all prediabetic women was associated with meaningful increase in DM risk.

Conclusions

The risks of progression to both new onset DM and ASCVD are significantly greater in the prediabetic population. This underscores the importance of preventing the development of DM and efforts to reduce cardiometabolic risk through optimizing multiple risk factors in both categories of prediabetes. Risk modification by waist circumference suggests weight and glucose lowering therapies should be targeted at those with highest risks.

### Preclinical carotid atherosclerosis in patients with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA), type 2 diabetes and classical type 1 diabetes [^113Gy3w4]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

The high frequency of carotid plaques, despite the increased use of statins in LADA cases, remained after adjusting for the main cardiovascular risk factors, including diabetes duration. The current cross-sectional study does not allow for the identification of potential causes of our unexpected finding of higher atherosclerotic burden in LADA, even though patients with type 2 diabetes tend to exhibit, as in other studies, a worse cardiovascular risk profile including higher blood pressure, more obesity and an adverse lipid profile. In both the Freemantle Study and the Collaborative Atorvastatin Study, patients designated LADA had comparable cardiovascular disease as the patients with type 2 diabetes; while in the Botnia study after 13 years of diabetes 56% of LADA patients had ischemic heart disease and 5% had had cerebrovascular events. To date, only one other study has assessed the frequency of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with LADA and type 2 diabetes, and none have assessed that frequency in the three cohorts we assessed. That Chinese study was retrospective and not designed to answer the question we posed here, but they did find a comparable frequency of carotid atherosclerosis compared with type 2 diabetes patients. Taken together, these studies indicate that patients with adult-onset diabetes, irrespective of the cause of the diabetes, are at risk of carotid and coronary atherosclerosis. It is difficult to understand why this should be, given that autoimmune diabetes cases are less likely to have the metabolic syndrome and related features. Two possibilities suggest themselves. First, the time of onset of autoimmune diabetes antedates the disease by months, even years, and it remains possible that LADA patients have had low-grade disease many years before clinical presentation, as can be the case with type 2 diabetes. However, the duration of LADA pre-disease is unknown both in this study and in general, while the risk of atherosclerosis in these cases was increased with increasing diabetes duration post-diagnosis. Second, patients with LADA are not well managed and are consistently shown to have higher HbA1c levels than comparable cohorts of patients with type 2 diabetes. Higher HbA1c has been found to be associated with higher coronary and carotid atherosclerotic burden in non-diabetic patients. Additionally, deranged glycemic control has been independently related to coronary heart disease in both LADA patients, and diabetes patients in general. Higher HbA1c concentrations have also been related to cardiovascular disease in the non-diabetic population in prospective studies, including the Norfolk cohort of European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study and The Copenhagen City Heart Study.

### Alcohol intake and cardiovascular disease and mortality: the role of pre-existing disease [^117Fd6Cn]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Pre-existing conditions have been postulated as possible causes of the J-shaped relationship between alcohol intake and cardiovascular disease. Two research questions have been addressed in this paper. First, whether never drinkers and former drinkers differ from moderate drinkers in terms of health, and if so, which health problems contribute to this difference. Second, whether the U-shaped relationship between current alcohol intake and cardiovascular disease or all-cause mortality could in part be explained by difference in pre-existing disease burden.

Design, Setting and Participants

A prospective case-cohort, the Lifestyle and Health Study, consisting of 16,210 men and women aged between 45 and 70 years. Alcohol intake and risk factors were assessed at baseline with a self-administered questionnaire. Medical information was obtained from general practitioners. Cardiovascular events and mortality were followed for a period of 5 years (1996–2001).

Main Results

Never drinkers and former drinkers were less healthy than moderate drinkers. They rated their health more often as poor, and often had more diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and also alcohol-related diseases. The difference in disease burden did not change the observed relationship between alcohol intake and cardiovascular events, and only partially changed the U-shaped relationship between alcohol intake and all-cause mortality.

Conclusions

The found difference in health between never drinkers and former drinkers compared with moderate drinkers appeared to be only a partial explanation of the observed relationships between alcohol intake and cardiovascular disease, and between alcohol intake and all-cause mortality.

### Correlation between cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus: current concepts [^113hwDhu]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Individuals exhibiting precursor symptoms of diabetes mellitus or reaching diagnostic thresholds for diabetes are at increased risk of death due to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Moreover, patients with diabetes alone, as well as those who have diabetes paired with established CVD, remain undertreated for cardiovascular risk factors. The clear correlation between these disease processes has led many to speculate that they share common pathogenetic processes. Recent research has made it increasingly evident that the core metabolic defects that mark diabetes, including impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and proinflammatory and prothrombotic states, lead to endothelial dysfunction and accelerate atherogenesis. Moreover, increases in sympathetic tone with diabetes are associated with changes in cardiac and vascular function that lead to hypertension, left ventricular dysfunction, and cardiac autonomic neuropathy; such changes set the stage for arrhythmia, silent infarction, and sudden death. Furthermore, diabetes-related changes in metabolic and autonomic functioning, as well as increases in inflammatory and thrombotic signaling, compromise the ability of myocardial and vascular tissue to remodel after injury and to recover and sustain functionality. Because potentiation of atherogenesis and cardiac dysfunction occurs in the presence of early diabetic symptoms as well as in the established disease, early implementation of strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk factors and to slow diabetes progression may help to improve long-term outcomes for at-risk individuals. Such interventions may include well-established treatments for hypertension and dyslipidemia, diet improvements, weight loss, and exercise as well as novel pharmacologic interventions aimed at newly identified therapeutic targets.

### Association between estimated glucose disposal rate and future cardiovascular disease risk across glucose metabolism status: a prospective cohort study [^116uJNMW]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a significant global health challenge, with its prevalence continuing to rise across various demographics and regions. Recent studies indicate that CVD is responsible for a substantial portion of global morbidity and mortality, affecting nearly half a billion individuals worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes CVD as one of the leading causes of death, accounting for more than 40% of global mortality. The prevalence of CVD is particularly alarming in low- and middle-income countries, where it is exacerbated by increasing rates of risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.

Diabetes, prediabetes, and normoglycemia are critical states in the continuum of glucose regulation that significantly influence cardiovascular risk. Diabetes itself is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Moreover, a growing body of research indicates that prediabetes is associated with an increased risk of CVD. Interestingly, those with diabetes or prediabetes are not the only ones at risk for CVD. Research has consistently demonstrated that even individuals classified as normoglycemic can experience heightened cardiovascular risks due to underlying metabolic disturbances. This paradox is explained by insulin resistance (IR), which often precedes detectable glycemic abnormalities and induces chronic inflammation while activating pathological molecular pathways conducive to CVD development. These mechanisms establish a critical link between subtle metabolic dysfunction and cardiovascular risk even without overt dysglycemia. Even though they might not exhibit obvious signs of diabetes, these individuals' cardiovascular health has to be closely watched and evaluated.

These guidelines include the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes 2022; American College of Cardiology (ACC) 2020 Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on Novel Therapies for Cardiovascular Risk Reduction in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease; Management of hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes, 2018: A consensus report by the ADA and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), together with its 2019 update; 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines on diabetes, pre-diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases developed in collaboration with the EASD

ASCVD, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; CV, cardiovascular; CVD, cardiovascular disease; CVOT, cardiovascular outcomes trial; GLP-1 RA, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist; Hb1Ac, haemoglobin A1c; SGLT2, sodium–glucose transporter 2

*Other options are thiazolidinediones, DPP-4 inhibitors if not on GLP RA, basal insulin, sulfonylureas

† Based on the flowchart of treatment of patients with T2D in the ADA 2022 guidelines, "first-line therapy depends on comorbidities, patient-centred treatment factors, including cost and access considerations, and management needs and generally includes metformin and comprehensive lifestyle modification", and treatment choices are subsequently shown on the flowchart according to the presence/absence of ASCVD, indicators of high risk, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease

The purpose of this review is to provide an expert summary that will help clinicians navigate the overwhelming wealth of CVOT data. We discuss how CVOTs can provide valuable insights for management in clinical practice, and consider remaining gaps in knowledge, as well as how diabetes CVOTs have led to further cardiorenal-focussed studies that seek to understand more about how some GLDs may improve outcomes for our patients.

### Effect of pre-diabetes on future risk of stroke: meta-analysis [^113Ti2QQ]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To assess the association between pre-diabetes and risk of stroke, and to evaluate whether this relation varies by diagnostic criteria for pre-diabetes.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies.

Data Sources

A search of Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library (1947 to 16 July 2011) was supplemented by manual searches of bibliographies of key retrieved articles and relevant reviews.

Selection Criteria

Prospective cohort studies that reported multivariate adjusted relative risks and corresponding 95% confidence intervals for stroke with respect to baseline pre-diabetes were included.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers extracted data on pre-diabetes status at baseline, risk estimates of stroke, study quality, and methods used to assess pre-diabetes and stroke. Relative risks were pooled using random effects models when appropriate. Associations were tested in subgroups representing different characteristics of participants and studies. Publication bias was evaluated with funnel plots.

Results

The search yielded 15 prospective cohort studies including 760,925 participants. In 8 studies analysing pre-diabetes defined as fasting glucose 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L), the random effects summary estimate did not show an increased risk of stroke after adjustment for established cardiovascular risk factors (1.08, 95% confidence interval 0.94 to 1.23; P = 0.26). In 5 studies analysing pre-diabetes defined as fasting glucose 110–125 mg/dL (6.1–6.9 mmol/L), the random effects summary estimate showed an increased risk of stroke after adjustment for established cardiovascular risk factors (1.21, 1.02 to 1.44; P = 0.03). In 8 studies with information about impaired glucose tolerance or combined impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glucose, the random effects summary estimate showed an increased risk of stroke after adjustment for established cardiovascular risk factors (1.26, 1.10 to 1.43; P < 0.001). When studies that might have enrolled patients with undiagnosed diabetes were excluded, only impaired glucose tolerance or a combination of impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance independently raised the future risk of stroke (1.20, 1.07 to 1.35; P = 0.002).

Conclusion

Pre-diabetes, defined as impaired glucose tolerance or a combination of impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance, may be associated with a higher future risk of stroke, but the relative risks are modest and may reflect underlying confounding.

### Intimal redox stress: accelerated atherosclerosis in metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. atheroscleropathy [^11735NHE]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2002). Low credibility.

Metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, prediabetes, and overt type 2 diabetes mellitus are associated with an accelerated atherosclerosis (atheroscleropathy). This quartet is also associated with multiple metabolic toxicities resulting in the production of reactive oxygen species. The redox stress associated with these reactive oxygen species contribute to the development, progression, and the final fate of the arterial vessel wall in prediabetic and diabetic atheroscleropathy. The prevention of morbidity and mortality of these intersecting metabolic diseases can be approached through comprehensive global risk reduction.

### Prediabetes and cardiovascular disease: pathophysiology and interventions for prevention and risk reduction [^112d7ruN]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Prediabetes is a state characterized by impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance. This review discusses the pathophysiology and macrovascular complications of prediabetes. The pathophysiologic defects underlying prediabetes include insulin resistance, alpha- and beta-cell dysfunction, increased lipolysis, inflammation, and suboptimal incretin effect. Recent studies have revealed that the long-term complications of diabetes manifest in some people with prediabetes; these complications include microvascular and macrovascular disorders. Finally, we present an overview of randomized control trials aimed at preventing progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes and discuss their implications for macrovascular risk reduction.

### Association between varying cut-points of intermediate hyperglycemia and risk of mortality, cardiovascular events and chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Z8Vz4]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Study selection

We identified 7153 studies for abstract screening. Studies were included for analysis if they met the following criteria: were prospective cohort studies of adult individuals aged 18 years and older, were from the general population or from patients with previous atherosclerotic CVD, had measures of impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance or intermediate HbA1c as defined by the ADA, WHO or IEC criteria that was evaluated at baseline, included at least one outcome of interest, and reported adjusted HRs, relative risks (RRs) or ORs for the risk of prediabetes and at at least one outcome of interest. Studies that did not have longitudinal measures of prediabetes as well as at least one relevant outcome, were not conducted in humans, and were not published in the English language were excluded from full-text review. A total of 280 studies were included in the full-text review. Of these, 174 studies were excluded for the following reasons; the study did not have a cut-point for intermediate hyperglycemia that was consistent with the WHO, ADA or IEC criteria: the study was an earlier version of a study included in the analysis; the study was a duplicate of another study included in the analysis; the study population had a pre-existing condition aside from atherosclerotic CVD; full-text of the study was not available; no relevant measures of association or CIs were reported; follow-up time was < 2 years and no relevant outcome was reported. In total, 106 studies were included (online supplemental figure 1). Cohort studies were included multiple times if they assessed the associations between differing glycemic measures and outcomes. However, only the largest sample size of each cohort was counted towards the overall sample size of the analysis. Primary outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events, heart failure events and stroke events. Secondary outcomes of interest were heart failure, chronic kidney disease and retinopathy.

Our study protocol was developed in consensus with Emory investigators. This meta-analysis was not prospectively registered in the PROSPERO database.

### Association between prediabetes and risk of all cause mortality and cardiovascular disease: updated meta-analysis [^1156Hvnd]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Furthermore, our study showed new findings. Firstly, significant heterogeneity was found for the risk of all cause mortality and cardiovascular disease for different definitions of prediabetes in the general population. Individuals with impaired glucose tolerance were susceptible to a higher risk of all cause mortality than those with impaired fasting glucose. The increased risk was seen even when fasting plasma glucose concentrations were as low as 5.6–6.9 mmol/L, supported by a meta-analysis of individual participant data performed by the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration, which showed that fasting plasma glucose concentrations exceeding 5.6 mmol/L were associated with increased mortality. We also found that the risk was mainly driven by fasting plasma glucose concentrations in the range 6.1–6.9 mmol/L. These results are important for future selection of those at high risk for prevention trials. Secondly, the inclusion of HbA 1c as a criterion for diabetes and prediabetes has led to concerns of its limited use for predicting future cardiovascular disease events. In this study, we found that the risk of composite cardiovascular events and coronary heart disease was increased in the general population with a HbA 1c concentration of 39–47 mmol/mol (5.7–6.4%). These results provide evidence for the inclusion of HbA 1c in defining prediabetes. HbA 1c is an easier method for screening than the oral glucose tolerance test, which is time consuming. Hence this information would help stratification to prioritise a screening programme. Thirdly, we found that prediabetes was also associated with an increased risk of mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. These results suggest that managing prediabetes in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease might also be an important goal to lower their future risk of recurrent cardiovascular disease and premature death.

### Primary prevention of ASCVD and T2DM in patients at metabolic risk: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^111Gw6z7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Further research — metabolic risk, ASCVD, and T2DM priorities include inflammation and liver disease mechanisms, biomarker utility, genetic markers, and clinically meaningful outcomes. More research is needed related to increased inflammation in liver and blood vessels and its connection to insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, and β-cell failure, and more studies are needed on the relationship between metabolic syndrome and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, including whether reduction in liver fat eventually reduces ASCVD. The guideline asks whether newer biomarkers that correlate with metabolic risk enhance predictive power for ASCVD or T2DM and whether they affect therapeutic intervention, and calls for more research on the relative weighting of metabolic risk components. It states that prediabetes and diabetes are a continuum and that future studies need a focus on prevention of ASCVD, diabetic microvascular complications, mortality, and patient-important outcomes rather than purely biochemical conversion to T2DM. It also calls for further identification and analysis of genetic markers and for understanding how to use these markers to guide preventive therapy using a personalized approach. Finally, it notes that medications such as SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists may have cardiovascular benefits and potential use in primary prevention of both ASCVD and T2DM; however, evidence is lacking and more controlled trials are needed.

### Comparative prognostic performance of definitions of prediabetes: a prospective cohort analysis of the atherosclerosis risk in communities (ARIC) study [^112zAtdQ]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2017). Medium credibility.

Prediabetes is a pressing clinical and public health problem, which affects approximately 12% to 30% of U.S. adults age 18 years and older, depending on the definition used. International organizations largely agree on the clinical cut-points for diagnosis of diabetes and, in 2010, HbA1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol was adopted for diagnosis of diabetes by many international groups, in part based on the association of HbA1c with retinopathy. By contrast, the category of prediabetes does not have a uniform definition. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends identifying persons with prediabetes using the following definitions: fasting glucose between 5.6–6.9 mmol/L (100–125 mg/dL; "impaired fasting glucose"), HbA1c between 39–46 mmol/mol (5.7–6.4%), or 2-hour glucose following a 75–g oral glucose tolerance test between 7.8–11.0 mmol/L (140–199 mg/dL; "impaired glucose tolerance"). The World Health Organization (WHO) also recommends 2-hour glucose 7.8–11.0 mmol/L, but recommends a fasting glucose of 6.1–6.9 mmol/L (110–125 mg/dL) to identify "impaired fasting glucose". In 2009, the International Expert Committee (IEC) recommended an HbA1c definition of 42–46 mmol/mol (6.0–6.4%) for the intermediate risk group, which has been adopted by some organizations. Identification of individuals with prediabetes provides an opportunity for intervention through lifestyle modification and pharmacologic interventions to prevent progression to diabetes. Consensus on definitions of prediabetes could help guide resource allocation and aid public health efforts focused on identification of persons at risk for diabetes and its complications.

Although the selection of biomarker cut-points for screening or diagnosis requires a broad range of considerations, associations with clinical outcomes are an important factor. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare the prognostic performance of the above-mentioned definitions of prediabetes in their associations with major clinical complications including incident diabetes, chronic kidney disease, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, and all-cause mortality. We compared the risk of future outcomes across different definitions of fasting glucose, HbA1c and 2-hour glucose during over two decades of follow-up in the community-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study.

### Severity and mortality of COVID 19 in patients with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease: a meta-analysis [^114XR1vr]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

We found that the highest effect size for severity and mortality was related to cardiovascular disease (which comprised atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in most studies and included myocardial infarction, stroke and/or peripheral arterial disease). This corresponds about the double of the risk attributed to diabetes and hypertension for mortality alone, indicating that pre-existing cardiovascular disease is the greatest risk factor to be addressed. Although cardiovascular disease was recognized as an important risk factor for these outcomes in most studies, the intensity of association is variable, possibly due to different definitions and severity of cardiovascular disease. While some authors included cerebrovascular diseases, others included only those with coronary heart disease and/or heart failure.

The mechanism associated for the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is complex and involves a pathological process associated with oxidative stress, inflammation and a prothrombotic status. These same mechanisms that cause damage and vascular remodeling are observed in individuals with type 2 diabetes, obesity and hypertension. Infections with other species of coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-COV also pointed to an increased risk of mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease. Initial reports indicated similar outcome with the novel coronavirus. The mechanism implicated in the association between COVID-19 severity or mortality and cardiometabolic factors is still under investigation. Potential explanations include the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease in older people (another established risk factor for adverse outcome), a functionally impaired immune system, and an elevated angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor expression. Coronaviruses can bind to target cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor which is expressed in several tissues and is involved in the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS). ACE2 receptor is a homologue of the angiotensin-converting enzyme that converts angiotensin II to angiotensin 1 to 7 and decreases the vasoconstriction mediated by the renin-angiotensin system and, also, the pro-inflammatory role of angiotensin II. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 receptor can result in alteration of its post-receptor signaling pathways, leading to vasoconstriction, pro-inflammatory response and to endothelial dysfunction that could result into myocardial injury and prothrombotic processes.

### Lifetime risk to progress from pre-diabetes to type 2 diabetes among women and men: comparison between American diabetes association and World Health Organization diagnostic criteria [^1161mzVR]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The worldwide prevalence of diabetes varies between 8.8% and 14.2% and is expected to increase in coming years. Although gender differences exist in the prevalence of obesity and diabetes, lifestyle and pharmacological interventions are the cornerstone to deflect the global rise in diabetes prevalence among both women and men. Pre-diabetes, a condition with elevated blood glucose levels below the threshold of diabetes, places women and men at high risk of diabetes. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the WHO are the authorities that publish the major clinical guidelines for pre-diabetes definition. The main difference in the definition of pre-diabetes between the ADA and WHO is difference in the threshold of the glycemic index. For fasting glucose, the threshold according to the ADA guideline is 5.6 mmol/L, whereas the WHO defines a threshold of 6.0 mmol/L. To be clinically useful in prevention, pre-diabetes definition should accurately identify future cases of diabetes. Recent evidence points towards gender differences in epidemiology of both diabetes and obesity, possibly resulting from biological and lifestyle factors but also from disparities in treatment and prevention. For example, more men are overweight at a younger age and women develop diabetes at a higher body mass index (BMI) then men. Gender differences also exist in the development of diabetes-associated complications, such as coronary heart disease and stroke. These findings highlight the importance of a sex-specific approach in the assessment of high-risk individuals for diabetes. In preventive settings, long-term absolute risks are preferable by clinicians and patients over relative risks for risk communication and estimation. Lifetime risks provide straightforward messages to patients and clinicians on cumulative risks of developing certain diseases during a life span. Data on the lifetime risk of developing diabetes in women and men for different definitions of pre-diabetes have been lacking or are limited to absolute risks within a limited time period.

Hence, our aim was to study the impact of applying ADA and WHO pre-diabetes definitions on women and men from a community-dwelling population and to assess their prediction of lifetime risk to progress to diabetes. We first studied the proportion that meets the diagnosis of pre-diabetes according to the ADA and WHO criteria. Second, we examined the remaining 10-year and lifetime risk for women and men to progress to overt diabetes across different age groups according to both criteria. We then compared the lifetime risk of developing diabetes between WHO-diagnosed and ADA-diagnosed pre-diabetes status in both women and men.

### Random plasma glucose levels and cause-specific mortality among Chinese adults without known diabetes: an 11-year prospective study of 450, 000 people [^111fixwW]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

The continuous positive relationship between RPG and CVD mortality in the present study is consistent with associations with incident major CVD in CKB, and with the association of fasting plasma glucose levels in the Asia Pacific Cohort Studies Collaboration individual participant data meta-analysis. This latter study, including 240,000 participants from 13 prospective studies, found a positive log-linear association with CVD mortality extending down to a usual fasting plasma glucose of at least 4.9 mmol/L. In contrast, analyses from the ERFCand the Korean Cancer Prevention Study (KCPS) (including ~1.2 million participants)showed J-shaped associations of fasting plasma glucose with CVD and atherosclerotic CVD mortality, respectively. Thresholds in these associations were observed at baseline fasting plasma glucose levels of 5.0–5.6 mmol/L, again possibly reflecting comparatively small numbers of deaths at the lowest fasting plasma glucose levels. Despite the apparent differences in the associations at the lower end of the glycemic range, in combination, these studies support an association of glycemia with CVD mortality risk below diabetes diagnostic thresholds, consistent with reported higher CVD risks associated with pre-diabetes, and with genetic studies suggesting a causal relationship of non-diabetic glycemia with atherosclerotic CVD.

We demonstrated a continuous positive association between RPG and mortality due to CKD, which was stronger than that with CVD mortality, and which persisted after exclusion of participants who developed diabetes during follow-up. Although a positive association of glycemia with risk of CKD (largely renal microvascular disease) has been observed in people with diabetes, to our knowledge, this is the first study to observe an association with CKD mortality among individuals without known diabetes, independent of blood pressure and adiposity. With supportive evidence from a recent genetic study, this is of interest given the ongoing debate regarding the relevance of the diabetes diagnostic threshold to microvascular disease risk, and future investigation of the association with more refined CKD endpoints will be of interest. There was a strong association between usual RPG and mortality due to chronic liver disease, comparable to that with CKD mortality. However, attenuation of this association after exclusion of the first 3 years of follow-up suggests there may be residual reverse causality, possibly reflecting incomplete understanding of chronic liver disease natural history and etiological pathways linking non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with cardiometabolic diseases and their risk factors.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^111Dhtbh]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Long-term atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) implications of pregnancy complications — risk markers and programming: dyslipidemia, obesity, and/or presence of the metabolic syndrome or diabetes mellitus before pregnancy, high risk status such as PCOS, as well as hypertension during pregnancy are important for future ASCVD risk. Pre-eclampsia and pregnancy-induced-hypertension are not only associated with post-pregnancy cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity for the mother, but have also been linked to epigenetic factors influencing subsequent infant health, and much evidence exists to suggest that developmental programming by pathologies during pregnancy influences both fetal development and future cardiometabolic risk of the fetus and the mother.

### Pre-prediabetes: insulin resistance is associated with cardiometabolic risk in nonobese patients (STOP DIABETES) [^112Kvj9z]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Context

Prior studies have demonstrated glycemic and cardiometabolic risk in the prediabetic state.

Objective

This work aims to examine if insulin resistance (IR) is associated with markers of glycemic, cardiometabolic, and atherosclerotic risk in nonobese, nonprediabetic individuals compared to insulin-sensitive (IS) individuals matched for body mass index (BMI), sex, and age.

Methods

Of 1860 patients from the STOP DIABETES study, 624 had normal fasting plasma glucose, BMI less than 30, and glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) less than 5.7%. All received an oral glucose tolerance test. Insulin sensitivity was quantitated using the Matsuda index: less than the 25th percentile equals IR (n = 151) and 25th percentile or greater equals IS (n = 473). Measures of dysglycemia and cardiometabolic risk were compared between IR individuals (n = 151) and a subset of IS individuals who were matched for BMI, sex, and age (n = 151). Carotid intima media thickness and carotid plaque were measured in 65 IR and 76 IS individuals.

Results

Compared to matched IS patients, IR nonobese individuals demonstrated increased indicators of glycemic and cardiometabolic risk, including increased 60-minute plasma glucose and percentage of patients with 60-minute plasma glucose greater than 155mg/dL; increased 120-minute plasma glucose; unrecognized impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes, decreased disposition index; increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure; elevated plasma triglycerides (TGs); reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol; increased TGs/HDL ratio, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. The presence, size, and number of carotid plaques was greater in the IR group.

Conclusion

Approximately 1 in 4 nonobese patients in this population with normal fasting glucose and HbA1c were IR. In these nonobese participants, IR was associated with multiple indicators of dysglycemia and cardiometabolic risk.

Results

Baseline characteristics of the study population

A total of 3405 adults were included in the analysis. The mean (SD) baseline age was 57.07 (8.66) years, and 1699 (49.9%) were women. Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics according to the number of pre-disease risk factors. At baseline, 845 (24.8%), 1,317 (38.7%), 965 (28.3%), and 278 (8.2%) had 0, 1, 2, and 3 pre-disease risk factors, respectively. Participants with more risk factors were more likely to be older, overweight or obese, and have higher hs-CRP levels. In addition, we described the baseline characteristics of participants using data not being imputed (Tables S3). These results were similar in Table 1.

### The impact of obesity on different glucose tolerance status with incident cardiovascular disease and mortality events over 15 years of follow-up: a pooled cohort analysis [^117UQxbK]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and pre-diabetes are well-established and independent risk factors for various life-threatening conditions, particularly cardiovascular diseases and mortality. Over the past few decades, the global prevalence and incidence of pre-diabetes/T2DM have been steadily increasing, raising significant concerns. According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the worldwide prevalence of prediabetes and T2DM was 6.2% and 10.5% in 2021 and estimated reach to 6.9% and 12.2% in 2045, respectively. The meta-analysis of Mendelian randomization studies suggests that obesity was associated with 67% and 20% higher risk of T2DM and coronary artery disease (CAD), respectively with significant heterogeneity between included studies.

Recently, in a retrospective study among the American population, researcher found that among obese individuals those with pre-diabetes (using A1C criteria) had a higher risk of mortality compared to the normoglycemic population. However, a post hoc analysis of the ORIGIN study found that overweight and moderately obese patients had a lower risk of all-cause mortality compared to patients with a BMI of 22–24.9 kg/m 2 among both diabetic and prediabetic populations. Moreover, some recent studies have investigated sex-specific differences in CVD incidence, CV mortality, and all-cause mortality, taking into account obesity status. While some studies have found obesity to be a protective factor in women, others have reported contradictory results.

### Cardiovascular disease in diabetes: where does glucose fit in? [^1143ubv8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Recent prospective clinical trials have failed to confirm a unique benefit from normalization of glycemia on cardiovascular disease outcomes, despite evidence from basic vascular biology, epidemiological, and cohort studies.

Evidence Acquisition

The literature was searched using the http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov search engine including over 20 million citations on MEDLINE (1970 to present). Keyword searches included: atherosclerosis, cardiovascular, and glucose. Epidemiological, cohort, and interventional data on cardiovascular disease outcomes and glycemic control were reviewed along with analysis of recent reviews on this topic.

Evidence Synthesis

High glucose activates a proatherogenic phenotype in all cell types in the vessel wall including endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, inflammatory cells, fibroblasts, and platelets, leading to a feedforward atherogenic response. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND COHORT STUDIES: Epidemiological and cohort evidence indicates a clear and consistent correlation of glycemia with cardiovascular disease. A recent report of over 25,000 subjects with diabetes in the Swedish National Diabetes Registry verifies this relationship in contemporary practice. Interventional Studies: Prospective randomized interventions targeting a hemoglobin A1c of 6–6.5% for cardiovascular disease prevention failed to consistently decrease cardiovascular events or all-cause mortality.

Conclusions

Basic vascular biology data plus epidemiological and cohort evidence would predict that glucose control should impact cardiovascular events. Prospective clinical trials demonstrate that current strategies that improve blood glucose do not achieve this goal but suggest that a period of optimal control may confer long-term cardiovascular disease benefit. Clinicians should target a hemoglobin A1c of 7% for the prevention of microvascular complications, individualized to avoid hypoglycemia.

### Screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes: US preventive… [^117Xgndc]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

The USPSTF found convincing evidence that preventive interventions, in particular lifestyle interventions, in persons identified as having prediabetes have a moderate benefit in reducing the progression to type 2 diabetes, as well as reducing other CVD risk factors such as blood pressure and lipid levels. Other preventive interventions are also effective in reducing the progression to type 2 diabetes without necessarily reducing other CVD risk factors. because of differences in the definition of prediabetes or the heterogeneity of prediabetes. 2 A large cohort study of 77 107 persons with prediabetes reported that the risk of developing diabetes increased with increasing hemoglobin A1c level and with increasing body mass index.
3. Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes can be detected by measuring fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c level, or with an oral glucose tolerance test. A fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg/dL or greater, an HbA1c level of 6.

5% or greater, or a 2-hour postload glucose level of 200 mg/dL or greater are consistent with the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. A fasting plasma glucose level of 100 to 125 mg/dL, an HbA1c level of 5. 7% to
6. 4%, or a 2-hour postload glucose level of 140 to 199 mg/dL are consistent with prediabetes.
14. One trial, the Da Qing Diabetes Prevention Study comparing a 6-year lifestyle intervention with control, found lower all-cause mortality and CVD-related mortality in the combined intervention groups vs control group at 23 and 30 years of follow-up, though not at 20 years of. Another trial 41 found no statistically significant difference in myocardial infarction over 7 years of follow-up. 30%] for BMI of 22 to < 30).

18 For both thiazolidinediones and α-glucosidase inhibitors, meta-analysis of 3 trials each found associations with a reduction in the incidence of diabetes, but the results were limited by imprecision and inconsistency across trials. 2, 23 Other pharmacologic interventions seeking to delay or prevent diabetes have been studied, but only in 1 study each. 2.

### Hemoglobin A1c as a prognostic factor and the pre-diabetic paradox in patients admitted to a tertiary care medical center intensive cardiac care unit: the jerusalem platelets thrombosis and intervention in cardiology (JUPITER-6) study group [^117Q46wN]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this large prospective trial in a tertiary care medical center ICCU, the prevalence of pre-DM (32.4%) and DM (28.6%) patients were similar to several other studies involving cardiac and ICCU patients. Around 9% of patients with no previous diagnosis of DM had HbA1c levels on admission in the diabetic range. Our data show that in non-selected consecutive ICCU patients the highest risk for in-hospital and overall mortality rate is among the pre-DM and DM subgroups. Surprisingly, we found that the highest mortality risk tends to be among patients with pre-DM and not in the patients with DM.

Pre-DM is an intermediate stage of glycemic control with glycemic parameters above normal but below the diabetes threshold. It is a state with a high risk of conversion to overt DM (5–10% per year) and is associated with various complications of DM, including cardiovascular complications. A recent meta-analysis including more than 10-million individuals has shown that a pre-DM state is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease in the general population and in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, despite the association between pre-DM and adverse cardiovascular outcomes, the recommended treatment remains focused on changing lifestyles and only suggests considering pharmacotherapy with metformin. This is in contrast to the given medical treatment and growing use of newer anti-glycemic treatments, such as sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) agonists in patients with overt DM.

### Risk of progression to diabetes among older adults with prediabetes… [^113CY2Xx]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

A, Of the participants with glycated hemoglobin levels of 5. 7% to
6. 4% at visit 5, 645 had HbA1c-defined prediabetes at visit 6, 97 progressed to diabetes, 148 regressed to normoglycemia, and 207 died. We sought to compare the prevalence of prediabetes — based on glycated hemoglobin levels, fasting glucose levels, either, or both — and examine progression from normoglycemia to prediabetes or diabetes and progression from prediabetes to diabetes in a community-based cohort of older adults from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study. The prevalence of prediabetes was 15% according to the IEC HbA1c definition and 23% according to the WHO definition. Compared with participants with HbA1c levels less than 5. 7%, participants with prediabetic HbA1c levels were more likely to be Black or have an FG level of 100–125 mg/dL.

A total of 893 participants with HbA1c levels less than 5. 7% at visit 5 had HbA1c levels less than
5. 7% at the follow-up visit, 239 progressed to prediabetic levels of HbA1c, 227 died, and 41 developed diabetes. Among participants with prediabetic HbA1c levels at baseline, 645 had no change in status, 207 died, 148 regressed to normoglycemia, and 97 progressed to diabetes. The prevalence of HbA1c-defined prediabetes was higher among Black participants than White participants.

### Insulin resistance, β-cell function, adipokine profiles and cardiometabolic risk factors among Chinese youth with isolated impaired fasting glucose versus impaired glucose tolerance: the BCAMS study [^114tq9Ud]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) among young individuals, both globally and in China, presents a major public health challenge. In 2017, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimated that 425 million people between the ages of 20 and 79 years worldwide were affected by T2D, with the number projected to increase to 629 million by 2045. According to a recent national survey in China, nearly 1 in 10 adults had T2D and the prevalence of pre-diabetes was as high as 50%. As T2D is a progressive disease with insidious onset, often silent until presenting with organ damage after many years of hyperglycemia, screening programs for early manifestations of the disease, like pre-diabetes, are needed.

Pre-diabetes is defined as an intermediate metabolic state between normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and overt T2D, which encompasses individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) as well as impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Studies in adults have suggested the existence of metabolic subphenotypes among pre-diabetic individuals, with IFG being characterized by a combination of hepatic insulin resistance (IR) and defective early-phase insulin secretion, while IGT primarily consists of peripheral IR combined with impaired first-phase and second-phase insulin secretion. Not only is pre-diabetes an intermediate state of dysglycemia, but also it exists on a continuum of cardiometabolic risk between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and T2D. However, the overlapping pathogeneses of dysglycemia and cardiometabolic dysfunction are not fully understood. While this overlap can be partially attributed to an intricate relationship between metabolism and inflammation, a number of adipokines, such as leptin, adiponectin, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), and retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) play an important role not only in the atherosclerotic process but also in the development of diabetes. Nonetheless, the preponderance of evidence addressing the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for a relationship between cardiometabolic risk and pre-diabetes are derived from adult-based studies, with little understanding of the clinical manifestations in youth, especially from China. While fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) are all endorsed by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) to test for pre-diabetes and diabetes, FPG is preferred as a screening test due to cost and convenience, especially in youth, despite the fact that its efficiency is still under debate.

### Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or heart failure: first cardiovascular event in adults with prediabetes and diabetes [^115K2cGe]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Individuals with prediabetes and diabetes are at increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and heart failure (HF). Whether ASCVD or HF is more likely to occur first in these populations within different race-sex groups is unknown.

Objective

To determine the competing risk for the first cardiovascular event by subtype in Black and white men and women with prediabetes and diabetes.

Methods

Individual-level data from adults without ASCVD or HF were pooled from 6 population-based cohorts. We estimated the competing cumulative incidences of ASCVD, HF and noncardiovascular death as the first event in middle-aged (40–59 years) and older (60–79 years) adults, stratified by race and sex, with normal fasting plasma glucose (FPG < 100 mg/dL), prediabetes (FPG 100–125 mg/dL) and diabetes (FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL or on antihyperglycemic agents) at baseline. Within each race-sex group, we estimated risk the adjusted hazard ratio of ASCVD, HF and noncardiovascular death in adults with prediabetes and diabetes relative to adults with normoglycemia after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors.

Results

In 40,117 participants with 638,910 person-years of follow-up, 5781 cases of incident ASCVD and 3179 cases of incident HF occurred. In middle-aged adults with diabetes, competing cumulative incidence of ASCVD as a first event was higher than HF in white men (35.4% vs 11.6%), Black men (31.6% vs 15.1%) and white women (24.3% vs 17.2%) but not in Black women (26.4% vs 28.4%). Within each group, the adjusted hazard ratio of ASCVD and HF was significantly higher in adults with diabetes than in adults with normal FPG levels. Findings were largely similar in middle-aged adults with prediabetes and older adults with prediabetes or diabetes.

Conclusions

Black women with diabetes are more likely to develop HF as their first CVD event, whereas individuals with diabetes from other race-sex groups are more likely to present first with ASCVD. These results can inform the tailoring of primary prevention therapies for either HF- or ASCVD-specific pathways based on individual-level risk.

### Impaired fasting glucose is associated with increased perioperative cardiovascular event rates in patients undergoing major non-cardiothoracic surgery [^1152JvMp]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery are at high risk of cardiovascular complications. Diabetes mellitus (DM) and hyperglycemia are risk factors for adverse perioperative cardiac and noncardiac events. In patients with known DM, the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is increased with increasing plasma glucose concentration. Each 1% increase in glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) level was associated with a 14% increase in the incidence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction. However, more recently the emphasis has shifted from diabetes to new-onset hyperglycemia. Pre-diabetes represents a metabolic stage intermediate between normal glucose hemostasis and DM. Although DM has been recognized as an independent predictor of perioperative cardiovascular outcomes, the prognosis of nondiabetic patients with impaired glucose regulation is not clear. The relationship between preoperative glucose levels and perioperative adverse cardiovascular events in noncardiac surgical patients is not evaluated in prospective, randomized studies. This study was conducted to elucidate the association between preoperative glucose levels with perioperative cardiovascular events in patients undergoing major noncardiac, nonvascular surgery.

### Health risks and interventions in prediabetes: a review [^1124ngZX]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Prediabetes is a condition which appears prior to the development of diabetes in which blood glucose is abnormally high but do not reach the diagnostic threshold of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is characterized by a cluster of metabolic abnormalities viz. dysglycemia, dyslipidemia, hypertension, physical inactivity, obesity, insulin resistance, procoagulant state, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress and inflammation, placing prediabetic subjects to an increased risk for diabetes and its complications. Recent studies demonstrate that complications of diabetes i.e. microvascular and macrovascular complications may manifest in some prediabetic subjects. This article reviews prediabetes-related risk factors and health issues. In addition, this article also highlights the interventions to prevent the development of diabetes in prediabetic subjects.

### Natural history of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes: role of hyperglycemia [^113YooTH]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic vascular disease is more common in diabetic than in nondiabetic individuals. Diabetic macrovascular disease also has a more severe course with greater prevalence of multiple-vessel coronary artery disease and more diffuse elongated atheromas in affected blood vessels. In this review, we discuss possible reasons for increased incidence of cardiovascular (CV) events in individuals with diabetes. Although an increased prevalence of standard CV risk factors has been clearly documented in association with diabetes, diabetes-related abnormalities, particularly hyperglycemia, also play an important role. Epidemiological studies suggest that the effect of hyperglycemia on CV risk is independent of other known risk factors, but no data from primary interventional trials are available yet. Analysis of datasets from populations that included individuals with impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glucose suggest that the pathogenic role of hyperglycemia on the blood vessel wall already exists in the early stages of glucose intolerance. The effect of postprandial or postchallenge hyperglycemia seems to be greater than the effect of fasting blood glucose abnormalities. The relationship of postprandial glycemia, fasting blood glucose, and CV risk in individuals with diagnosed (or overt) diabetes is less clear, although most reports indicate a greater pathogenic potential of postprandial hyperglycemia rather than fasting hyperglycemia. Based on the results of epidemiological reports, the most appropriate targets in interventional trials are postprandial hyperglycemia or A1C.

### Impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease [^1146n3Ae]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze the association among impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Methods

We review current studies that have addressed the foregoing relationship and summarize the results of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.

Results

A major cause of the reduction in life expectancy in patients with diabetes is CVD and cardiovascular complications. Both prediabetes and diabetes predispose to cardiovascular alterations. IGT and even the upper normal values of nondiabetic glucose levels are associated with an increased cardiovascular risk. The risk of heart disease can be increased as early as 15 years before the diagnosis of diabetes. Patients with chronic or acute CVD and no previous diagnosis of diabetes frequently present with either IGT or diabetes. Thus, such patients should undergo screening for diabetes with an oral glucose tolerance test. In acute coronary syndromes, lowering of glucose levels to the near-normal range by administration of insulin is highly beneficial. Early, rigorous interventions to improve metabolic control will yield better cardiovascular outcomes in patients with dysglycemia.

Conclusion

Aggressive preventive and treatment strategies, which can include multiple interventions, are needed to minimize the potential effects of CVD in patients with diabetes or IGT.

### Lipoprotein (a) levels and risk of cardiovascular disease events in individuals with diabetes mellitus or prediabetes: the atherosclerosis risk in communities study [^111kF1dZ]. Atherosclerosis (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Diabetes increases risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Current guidelines do not recommend measuring lipoprotein(a), another ASCVD risk factor, in these individuals. We examined the association of lipoprotein(a) levels with incident ASCVD events in persons with and without diabetes or prediabetes.

Methods

Lipoprotein(a) and other ASCVD risk factors were measured at baseline (1996–1998) in the biracial Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study; participants without prevalent ASCVD (coronary heart disease or stroke) were monitored ∼15 years for incident ASCVD events.

Results

Of 9871 eligible participants (mean age 63 years; 5816 women; 2155 African Americans), 1543 had diabetes and 3615 had prediabetes. Cumulative ASCVD incidence rates (event/1000-person years) were higher in participants with diabetes (26%) or prediabetes (13%) than in nondiabetic individuals (10%, p < 0.001). When comparing highest to lowest lipoprotein(a) categories (≥ 50 mg/dL vs. ≤ 10 mg/dL), increasing lipoprotein(a) levels were significantly associated with increasing incident ASCVD events in Caucasian participants with prediabetes (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.35; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07–1.69); p = 0.03) and diabetes (HR = 1.42; 95% CI 1.10–1.84; p < 0.01), but not those with normal fasting blood glucose. Adding lipoprotein(a) to Pooled Cohort Equation variables improved risk prediction in persons with diabetes (Δ in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] 0.0087, net reclassification index [NRI] 0.1761) and prediabetes (ΔAUC 0.0025, NRI 0.0938).

Conclusions

In this biracial cohort, elevated lipoprotein(a) levels in Caucasian individuals with diabetes or prediabetes were associated with further increased ASCVD risk. Adding lipoprotein(a) to traditional risk factors improved ASCVD risk prediction.

### Impact of lipid and ASCVD-modulating agents on glycemia and new-onset diabetes or prediabetes [^112LFkuJ]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The effects of lipid-lowering drugs on glucose metabolism and the emergence of new-onset diabetes (NOD) have been a matter of concern. Since the prestatin era, nicotinic acid has been known to induce or exacerbate hyperglycemia. This was confirmed in recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs), notably AIM-HIGH (Atherosclerosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome With Low HDL/High Triglycerides) and HPS-THRIVE (HEART Protection Study 2-Treatment of HDL to Reduce the Incidence of Vascular Events). This and other adverse events, and the overall lack of cardiovascular event (CVE) benefits, have led to its very limited use.

Currently, statins remain the drug of choice for CVE reduction. A recent comprehensive review by CTT (Cholesterol Treatment Trialists') consortium provides the incidence of NOD or worsening glycemia from 23 placebo-controlled RCTs (n = 156,000, median follow-up > 4.0 years), of which ∼20% had pre-existing diabetes mellitus (DM). The rate ratio (RR) for NOD with low/moderate intensity statin and high intensive statin were 10.0% (95% CI: 1.04–1.16) and 36% (95% CI: 1.25–1.48), respectively. Of those who developed NOD, 62% were in the top quartile of glycemia at baseline. However, the mean increase in A1C was 0.06 and 0.08%, respectively. In those with pre-existing DM, the RR for worsening glycemia with low/moderate and intensive therapy groups were 10% (95% CI: 1.06–1.40) and 24% (95% CI: 1.06–1.44), respectively. The precise mechanism of hyperglycemic effects of statins is not firmly established, and likely involves both insulin secretion and its peripheral actions. While the emergence of NOD with statins was still associated with favorable reductions in CVEs, many patients and care providers remain concerned about the statin-induced NOD, particularly in primary prevention. This is also a relevant issue when choosing add-on lipid therapy when maximally tolerated statins do not provide optimal low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apo-B, and non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) goals. Therefore, choosing any add-on therapy with neutral or favorable effects on hyperglycemia, while promoting additional reductions in CVEs and no major adverse effects, are worthy of consideration. Furthermore, as the prevalence of obesity and DM continue unabated and still on the rise, this becomes a particularly relevant issue for millions of people globally.

### Association between prediabetes and risk of all cause mortality and cardiovascular disease: updated meta-analysis [^114qXZbv]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

Primary outcomes were the risk of all cause mortality and composite cardiovascular events in the general population and in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, respectively. Secondary outcomes were the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke in individuals with prediabetes compared with normoglycaemia. Data for outcomes adjusted for the highest number of variables were used for the meta-analysis. We combined the log relative risks or log hazard ratios and corresponding standard errors by the inverse variance approach. Where the odds ratios (ORs) were presented, data were converted to relative risks (RRs) for the meta-analysis (RR = OR/([1−pRef]+[pRef×OR]), where pRef is the prevalence of the outcome in the reference group (normoglycaemia group). We used I 2 statistics to test for heterogeneity. An I 2 value of more than 50% was considered to indicate significant heterogeneity. Even when no statistically significant heterogeneity was seen, however, a random effects model was used as the primary approach to combine results across studies rather than the fixed effects model, owing to underlying methodological heterogeneity (eg, baseline characteristics of the participants, length of follow-up, and adjustment for confounders).

We calculated the absolute risk difference for all cause mortality and cardiovascular outcomes associated with prediabetes by multiplying the assumed comparator risk of each outcome of interest by the estimated RR−1, according to the recommendation of the Cochrane guidelines. We used the median risks of outcomes in individuals with normoglycaemia across studies as the assumed comparator risks. Absolute risk differences were expressed as events per 10 000 person years.

Subgroup analyses of primary outcomes were conducted according to sex (men v women), ethnicity (Asian v non-Asian), age (average < 60 v ≥ 60), sample size (< 5000 v ≥ 5000 participants), length of follow-up (< 10 years v ≥ 10 years), and study quality (adequate adjustment v inadequate adjustment). We also conducted sensitivity analyses where the use of random effects models was changed to fixed effects models for the meta-analysis or the relative risks were recalculated by omitting one study at a time. Publication bias was evaluated by inspecting funnel plots for the outcomes, and further tested with Begg's test and Egger's test.

### Tirzepatide and the 10-year predicted risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes in adults with obesity and prediabetes: a post hoc analysis from the three-year SURMOUNT-1 trial [^1116f9bA]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Obesity is a chronic, neuroendocrine disease with a rising prevalence worldwide. In the United States (US), the prevalence of obesity has nearly tripled over the last three decades, increasing from < 14.0% in 1990 to 40.3% in 2023. Obesity and its related complications are interconnected, forming a group of interdependent risk factors that drive the progression of metabolic and cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. As a central driver, obesity exacerbates insulin resistance, leading eventually to beta‐cell dysfunction, thus underpinning the development of prediabetes and ultimately, type 2 diabetes (T2D). Prediabetes is a significant global health concern, affecting approximately 38% of US adults. The progression from insulin resistance to prediabetes to overt T2D increases the risk of long‐term vascular disease, including atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure (HF), CVD‐related mortality, and all‐cause mortality compared to those with normoglycemia.
