## Question

chronic rlq pain intermittent

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating chronic intermittent right lower quadrant pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical problem and establishing a baseline workup. Then, I should construct a prioritized differential diagnosis by organ system and highlight key mimics. Next, I will map an evidence-based diagnostic algorithm, including when to image and when to scope. After that, I should consider special populations and red flags that mandate escalation. Finally, I will outline management pathways, including when surgery or endoscopic therapy is appropriate, and close with a concise decision framework and follow-up plan anchored in guidelines and trials.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and baseline evaluation. Chronic intermittent right lower quadrant pain lasting more than 3 months with episodic exacerbations requires a structured approach: detailed history (onset, periodicity, relation to meals, menses, activity, bowel/bladder symptoms, weight change, fever/night sweats), targeted exam including abdominal wall and Carnett's maneuver, and core labs such as CBC, CRP or ESR, urinalysis, and a pregnancy test when applicable; I should also screen for red flags like weight loss, nocturnal pain, GI bleeding, anemia, or new bowel habit change that would prompt expedited imaging or endoscopy rather than watchful waiting [^112BidjC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — appendicitis is common, but chronic or recurrent appendicitis is controversial, so I need to keep an open mind while prioritizing the differential. The most likely etiologies to consider include gastrointestinal causes such as chronic/recurrent appendicitis, right-sided diverticulitis, IBD, epiploic appendagitis, and neoplasia; gynecologic causes including endometriosis, ovarian cysts/torsion, and pelvic inflammatory disease; urologic causes such as ureteral stones; abdominal wall etiologies like ACNES; and functional or neuropathic pain syndromes; I should also remember rare entities such as intestinal tuberculosis, Strongyloides, and internal herniation that can masquerade as RLQ pain [^116G2i4R] [^1169b6pf] [^114ZqLA7] [^113KSy4G] [^115kEvFZ] [^117YAP7Q].

> I will now examine appendiceal pathology more closely because it often rises to the top in RLQ pain. Chronic or recurrent appendicitis may present with intermittent RLQ pain without classic acute features; small randomized and observational data suggest that elective laparoscopic appendectomy can reduce pain in carefully selected patients, even when histology is not overtly abnormal, though selection criteria remain imprecise; appendicoliths and appendiceal thickening on CT can support the diagnosis, and emerging endoscopic direct-vision appendicitis therapy (EDAT) offers a non-surgical option for multiple appendicoliths in specialized centers [^115bhkCq] [^116DSkkf] [^112QMjHh] [^115U7sbN].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging strategy before I anchor on appendicitis. For nonpregnant adults with persistent or recurrent RLQ pain, contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis is the most appropriate first-line modality to evaluate surgical and nonsurgical causes, with MRI or ultrasound reserved for specific scenarios such as pregnancy or when radiation avoidance is prioritized; a conditional strategy using ultrasound first and CT if inconclusive improves sensitivity and reduces missed urgent diagnoses compared with CT-only or ultrasound-only approaches [^1146XbnY] [^112Yc9Ju].

> Next, I should review gynecologic etiologies in patients with female reproductive organs, because they are frequent and sometimes overlooked. Endometriosis can involve the appendix and cause cyclical RLQ pain; pelvic ultrasound with Doppler is first-line to assess adnexa, with MRI when ultrasound is nondiagnostic; I need to check for ovarian torsion when pain is acute and severe, recognizing that CT may show twisted pedicle or displaced ovary and should trigger urgent gynecologic consultation and ultrasound confirmation; laparoscopy is both diagnostic and therapeutic for endometriosis and adhesions when noninvasive workup is unrevealing [^114muqGm] [^113ebeJa] [^112b81r8] [^115QZPJp].

> Let me consider gastrointestinal mimics that can confound the picture. Right-sided diverticulitis, particularly in younger or Asian patients, can mimic appendicitis; CT typically shows pericolonic fat stranding and colonic wall thickening around a diverticulum; epiploic appendagitis presents with focal RLQ pain and a fat-ring sign on CT and is usually self-limited; I should also keep IBD in mind with weight loss, diarrhea, or perianal disease and pursue colonoscopy with ileal evaluation when alarm features or persistent symptoms are present [^1164tyD8] [^114mhPKH] [^112aQ7Zc] [^111Ttnh6].

> I need to ensure I do not miss abdominal wall pain syndromes. Anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome (ACNES) produces localized, reproducible pain that intensifies with tensing and may respond to diagnostic nerve blocks; a positive Carnett's sign supports the diagnosis and can spare patients from unnecessary laparoscopy or appendectomy when other evaluations are negative [^114ZqLA7].

> But wait, what if the pain is neuropathic or referred. Thoracic or lumbosacral radiculopathy can present as chronic abdominal wall pain; if the story fits — burning quality, dermatomal pattern, sensory changes — I should consider a neurology referral and targeted imaging of the spine rather than repeated abdominal studies that are unlikely to clarify the source [^111BLWyG].

> Next, I should review when to escalate to endoscopy or laparoscopy. In patients over 45–50 years or those with red flags such as anemia, weight loss, change in bowel habits, or nocturnal pain, I should arrange colonoscopy to exclude right-sided neoplasia. In younger patients with alarm features or refractory symptoms, ileocolonoscopy is reasonable. When exhaustive noninvasive testing is negative and pain persists, diagnostic laparoscopy with conscious pain mapping can identify endometriosis, adhesions, or appendiceal pathology and permit definitive therapy in the same sitting [^116AnYmS] [^111XT9LU] [^1127rfcG].

> I should double-check special populations and contexts that modify pretest probabilities and imaging choices. In pregnancy, ultrasound is first-line and MRI is preferred over CT when additional imaging is needed; in children, ultrasound-first strategies reduce radiation, but CT after inconclusive ultrasound improves detection of urgent conditions; in patients with NF1, appendiceal neurofibroma should be considered and appendectomy is reasonable given malignancy risk; in those with ADPKD, I must evaluate for non-ADPKD causes of chronic pain such as stones or infection before attributing symptoms to cysts alone [^1146XbnY] [^111n2Yma] [^116ZSMeF] [^115EQVki].

> Let me synthesize a practical diagnostic algorithm while staying vigilant for pitfalls. Start with history, exam, and basic labs. If red flags are present, proceed directly to contrast-enhanced CT and urgent specialty referral. If low risk and no red flags, obtain CT abdomen/pelvis to evaluate for appendiceal, colonic, urologic, and abdominal wall causes. If CT is negative and symptoms persist, add pelvic ultrasound/MRI for gynecologic disease and consider colonoscopy for IBD or neoplasia. If all noninvasive tests are unrevealing and pain remains disabling, proceed to diagnostic laparoscopy with pain mapping and concurrent treatment of identified pathology [^1146XbnY] [^111XT9LU].

> Now, I will outline management pathways tailored to likely diagnoses, but I should confirm each aligns with evidence. For suspected chronic/recurrent appendicitis in appropriately selected patients, laparoscopic appendectomy offers a reasonable chance of pain improvement even when histology is nondiagnostic. For multiple appendicoliths in patients declining surgery, EDAT is an emerging alternative in specialized centers. For endometriosis or adhesions, laparoscopic excision or lysis is both diagnostic and therapeutic. For epiploic appendagitis, NSAIDs and supportive care suffice. For ACNES, nerve blocks and, if needed, neurectomy are effective. For functional or neuropathic pain, multimodal pain management and neurology input are appropriate once structural disease is excluded [^115bhkCq] [^115U7sbN] [^115QZPJp] [^112aQ7Zc] [^114ZqLA7].

> Hold on, I should verify that my decision framework is coherent and safe. A practical approach is to classify patients into three buckets: high risk with red flags warrants immediate CT and specialty referral. Intermediate risk with persistent symptoms merits CT-based evaluation and targeted endoscopy or laparoscopy if unrevealing. Low risk with mild, stable symptoms may be observed with close follow-up, reserving imaging for progression. Throughout, I must avoid premature closure and revisit the differential if the clinical course deviates from expectations or if new features emerge [^1146XbnY] [^113VXWg4].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and safety netting are explicit. For patients discharged without a definitive diagnosis, arrange reassessment within 2–4 weeks to confirm stability or evolution. Document functional impact and quality of life to guide escalation. And counsel on red flags that should trigger urgent re-evaluation, including new fever, weight loss, GI bleeding, or nocturnal pain, aligning with GRACE-2 principles for low-risk, recurrent abdominal pain in the ED setting [^116dSrMQ] [^113VXWg4].

Chronic intermittent right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain has a broad differential, but **appendiceal pathology** (chronic appendicitis, appendicolith) [^116DSkkf] [^112QMjHh], **gynecologic disease** (endometriosis, ovarian cysts, PID) [^114muqGm] [^113ebeJa], and **functional disorders** (IBS, functional abdominal pain) are most common [^notfound]. Initial workup should include a **focused history, exam, CBC, urinalysis, and pregnancy test** [^112BidjC]; if unrevealing, obtain a contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen/pelvis [^1146XbnY] to assess for appendiceal, bowel, or pelvic pathology. Ultrasound is first-line in women of reproductive age or pregnancy [^113ebeJa]. Management is cause-specific: appendectomy for confirmed appendiceal disease [^115bhkCq], medical therapy for gynecologic or functional disorders, and laparoscopy for unexplained cases [^111XT9LU]. Red flags (weight loss, anemia, nocturnal pain, mass) require urgent evaluation to exclude malignancy or serious disease [^116AnYmS].

## Diagnostic approach

### Initial evaluation

- **History and physical examination**: Detailed characterization of pain (onset, duration, intensity, associated symptoms), menstrual history, bowel habits, urinary symptoms, and psychosocial factors [^114HA7ey].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, urinalysis, pregnancy test (in women of reproductive age), stool studies (if indicated) [^112BidjC].

- **Imaging**: CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast is the preferred initial imaging modality for non-pregnant adults [^112BidjC]; ultrasound is first-line in pregnant patients or women of reproductive age [^1114v2Y1] [^113Y3yaq].

---

### Advanced evaluation

If the initial evaluation is inconclusive, **laparoscopy** is both diagnostic and therapeutic for unexplained chronic RLQ pain, particularly in women [^115QZPJp]. MRI pelvis provides detailed soft-tissue evaluation for gynecologic pathology and is radiation-free [^113ebeJa]. Colonoscopy is indicated when bowel disease is suspected (e.g. Crohn's, IBS) [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Gastrointestinal causes**: Medical management (diet, medications), surgical intervention (appendectomy, bowel resection) if indicated [^115bhkCq].

- **Gynecological causes**: Hormonal therapy, surgical intervention (laparoscopy, hysterectomy) if indicated [^115QZPJp].

- **Urological causes**: Medical management, surgical intervention (stone removal) if indicated.

- **Musculoskeletal causes**: Physical therapy, nerve blocks, surgical intervention if indicated [^114ZqLA7].

- **Functional causes**: Psychological therapy, pain management strategies [^notfound].

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring urgent evaluation

- Unintentional weight loss
- Anemia
- Nocturnal pain
- Palpable mass
- Severe or rapidly worsening pain
- Gastrointestinal bleeding

---

Chronic intermittent RLQ pain requires a **structured approach**, integrating history, examination, and targeted imaging to identify the cause and guide therapy. Most patients benefit from initial CT [^1146XbnY], with ultrasound reserved for pregnancy or reproductive-age women [^113s4teP] [^113Y3yaq]; laparoscopy is appropriate when noninvasive tests are inconclusive [^115QZPJp].

### Chronic appendicitis diagnosed preoperatively as an ovarian dermoid [^111poNst]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Recurrent right lower quadrant pain in young women can be a diagnostic dilemma. Chronic appendicitis is often mistakenly excluded from the differential diagnosis. In the present case, pelvic inflammatory disease was diagnosed in a 19-year-old woman with bilateral lower abdominal pain (greater on the right than the left), fever, and elevated white blood cell count. She was treated with intravenous antibiotics until resolution of symptoms. The pain recurred 1 month later, and the patient presented to our emergency department. At that time, she was afebrile and all laboratory results were normal or negative, aside from an elevated white blood cell count. Computed tomography suggested a right ovarian dermoid. At laparoscopy, however, the right tube and ovary were normal, and chronic appendicitis was confirmed. Although computed tomography is often accurate for delineating the cause of pelvic abnormality, it also may be misleading.

Recognizing and communicating a diagnosis of chronic pain in inflammatory bowel disease — definition and characteristics: Abdominal pain is considered chronic if it has persisted 3–6 months past its acute onset and resolution of the insult, and chronic pain is experienced irrespective of the presence, intensity, or duration of peripheral stimuli arising from the digestive tract; it can be episodic and fluctuating and is related to biological, psychological, and social triggers. Inflammation-induced hyperalgesia often outlasts actual inflammation, and providers are often reluctant to intervene for pain symptoms before a certain amount of "recovery time" has passed.

Surgical Endoscopy (2008). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic laparoscopy — indications, contraindications, risks, benefits, and diagnostic accuracy for chronic pelvic pain specify that the indication is chronic pelvic pain of unknown etiology after appropriate noninvasive workup. Contraindications include procedure intolerance and known dense pelvic adhesions that may make an accurate evaluation of pelvic pathology impossible or may impede safe abdominal access. Risks are procedure- or anesthesia-related complications. Benefits include potential identification of the source of the chronic pelvic pain, possibility for immediate therapeutic intervention, and potential improvement in the patient's quality of life. Diagnostic laparoscopy has been demonstrated to identify endometriosis, adhesions, or other abnormalities of the appendix and ovaries as the source of chronic pelvic pain.

### Left lower-quadrant pain: guidelines from the American college of radiology appropriateness criteria [^113Y3yaq]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of left lower-quadrant pain includes gastrointestinal, gynecologic, and renal/ureteric pathology. Imaging is helpful in evaluating left lower-quadrant pain, and is generally guided by the clinical presentation. Acute sigmoid diverticulitis should be suspected when the clinical triad of left lower-quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis is present. The severity of disease varies from mild pericolonic and peridiverticular inflammation to severe inflammatory changes with complications such as perforation, peritonitis, or abscess or fistula formation. Computed tomography is the preferred test in evaluating clinically suspected diverticulitis. It is used to evaluate the severity and extent of disease and to identify complications, but it also may diagnose other causes of left lower-quadrant pain that can mimic diverticulitis. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to assess left lower-quadrant pain. It has superior resolution of soft tissues and does not expose the patient to ionizing radiation, but it is expensive and requires more time to perform. Transabdominal ultrasonography with graded compression is another effective technique but is limited by its high operator dependency and technical difficulties in scanning patients who are obese. Pelvic ultrasonography is the preferred imaging modality in women of childbearing age. Radiography with contrast enema is less sensitive than computed tomography in diagnosing diverticulitis and is seldom used.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain? [^115CmY7q]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Abdominal pain is very common presentation to emergency department. It is vital that the physician has an understanding and be familiar with the presentations of common diseases that cause abdominal pain. Patients with acute abdominal pain are a heterogeneous group that consumes a great deal of a surgical department's resources. To streamline efficiency and provide maximum cost effectiveness it would be of benefit to identify clinical and laboratory parameters in patients admitted with acute abdominal pain that would indicate no significant intra abdominal pathology and thereby encourage early discharge back to the community.

Women of childbearing age commonly present with right iliac fossa pain, most of them do not have appendicitis. Those who do not have the classical features of appendicitis with no evidence of peritonism on examination can be safely managed by active observation or diagnostic laparoscopy. This study was designed to identify the clinical and laboratory red flags. Recognizing these red flags in the history and physical examination and the initial imaging and laboratory findings helps to determine which patients may have a serious underlying disease process, and therefore warrant more expedited evaluation and treatment.

### Imaging of right lower quadrant pain in children and adolescents: expert panel narrative review [^111n2Yma]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2023). Medium credibility.

Right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain is a common clinical presentation in children, and accurate clinical diagnosis remains challenging given that this nonspecific presentation is associated with numerous surgical and nonsurgical conditions. The broad differential diagnosis varies by patient age and sex. Important considerations in the selection of a diagnostic imaging strategy include the sequencing, performance, and cost of tests. This article provides a comprehensive narrative review of the diagnostic imaging of RLQ pain in children and adolescents, including a discussion of the complementary roles of ultrasound, CT, and MRI; description of key imaging findings based on available evidence; and presentation of salient differential diagnoses. Subspecialized pediatric emergency medicine and surgical perspectives are also provided as further clinical insight into this common, but often challenging, scenario. Finally, the current status of imaging of RLQ pain in children and adolescents is summarized on the basis of expert consensus.

### Gallstones top to toe: what the radiologist needs to know [^112FiUEo]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Gallstone pathology

The broad spectrum of gallstone-related disease can be broken down based on the anatomical locations in which they occur (Fig. 8).

Fig. 8
Illustration outlines the multitude of locations within the digestive tract where gallstones can manifest and lists the pathological processes that occur in these locations

Gallbladder

Unsurprisingly, the most common location for gallstones and thus gallstone-related disease is the gallbladder.

Biliary colic is caused when a stone temporarily obstructs the drainage from the cystic duct, resulting in severe cramping abdominal and right upper quadrant pain that can radiate to the back and right shoulder tip as the gallbladder contracts (typically, these symptoms are temporary and subside with resolution of the cystic duct obstruction). Ultrasonography will often demonstrate cholelithiasis without associated complications in patients with simple biliary colic.

Calculous cholecystitis refers to infection and inflammation of the gallbladder wall caused by irritation from gallstones, and this can be an acute or chronic process. The typical clinical presentation of acute cholecystitis is of right upper quadrant pain, with or without radiation to the right shoulder, which is more constant compared to the intermittent pain seen in biliary colic. There is usually associated pyrexia and other infective symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. The typical imaging features of acute cholecystitis are as follows: gallbladder wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid and a distended gallbladder (Figs. 9 and 10). Chronic cholecystitis is caused by repeated episodes of biliary colic and acute cholecystitis over time, and in contrast to acute cholecystitis, the gallbladder is usually shrunken down and the wall is thickened and scarred.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaRight lower quadrant pain-suspected appendicitis [^1114v2Y1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Appendicitis remains the most common surgical pathology responsible for right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal pain presenting to emergency departments in the United States, where the incidence continues to increase. Appropriate imaging in the diagnosis of appendicitis has resulted in decreased negative appendectomy rate from as high as 25% to approximately 1% to 3%. Contrast-enhanced CT remains the primary and most appropriate imaging modality to evaluate this patient population. MRI is approaching CT in sensitivity and specificity as this technology becomes more widely available and utilization increases. Unenhanced MRI and ultrasound remain the diagnostic procedures of choice in the pregnant patient. MRI and ultrasound continue to perform best in the hands of experts. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Annular pancreas in a 24-year-old woman with persistent abdominal pain [^115S6n28]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Annular pancreas (AP) is a rare diagnosis in the adult population but can cause significant morbidity if not correctly identified. In adults, the most common symptoms are abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. While these are not specific to AP, they are important clues to this diagnosis in the right clinical context. We present the case of a 24-year-old woman presenting with a 6-year history of progressive abdominal pain and dyspepsia in the context of an extensive negative workup. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) series and MRI revealed partial duodenal obstruction, concerning for AP. While patients with chronic abdominal pain and vague GI complaints may be diagnosed with functional bowel disorders, it is important to appropriately address the possibility of an underlying structural lesion such as AP. This strategy is not only cost-effective but also saves the patient discomfort associated with unnecessary procedures and allows a timely intervention.

### An approach to the patient with chronic undiagnosed abdominal pain [^114HA7ey]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for referral to a gastroenterologist. The workup of patients with chronic abdominal pain can be extremely challenging as clinicians are responsible for determining whether the patient can be observed or treated symptomatically or this abdominal pain heralds a more systemic disease. The differential is typically wide and given the innervation of the abdomen, localization of abdominal pain does not always provide clear insight into the etiology. This review attempts to help the gastroenterologist narrow down that broad differential and focus on key elements of the patient visit. We emphasize the importance of a detailed history from the patient, along with review-specific details of their history and physical examination that can clue one in about the etiology of the abdominal pain. We review the causes of diffuse abdominal pain that may not first be considered along with uncommon causes of localized abdominal pain. We also review the functional causes of abdominal pain and the importance of identifying these disorders, to avoid unnecessary testing that commonly occurs with these patients.

### Evaluating patients with right upper quadrant pain [^117DxLpY]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Many disorders of the liver, gallbladder, and biliary tree may cause right upper quadrant pain and clinical diagnosis may be challenging. Imaging plays a key role in establishing a prompt diagnosis and guiding appropriate management. Although ultrasonography is the initial imaging modality of choice for most hepatobiliary disorders, radionuclide imaging, computed tomography (CT), and MR imaging also play important roles. Acute cholecystitis may be associated with many complications that have characteristic imaging features. MR cholangiopancreatography achieves high accuracy in diagnosis of choledocholithiasis and allows for noninvasive imaging when ultrasonography and CT are indeterminate.

### Clinical features and preventability of delayed diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis [^113CiBhs]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In this case-control study, children with delayed diagnosis at their index ED encounter were more likely to have a longer duration of abdominal pain, no pain with walking, abdominal pain outside the right lower quadrant, no abdominal guarding, and a complex chronic condition compared with children with a timely diagnosis of appendicitis. Based on PAS or pARC scores, children with delayed diagnoses were less clinically discernible. They were more likely to receive nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antiemetic therapy and less likely to receive opioids or undergo imaging. In 76.8% of patients with a delayed diagnosis, there were possibly or probably opportunities to improve diagnosis. Children with delayed diagnosis had worse outcomes. When the diagnosis was made, hospitalizations were longer, appendectomy was less likely, and appendiceal perforation and multiple abdominal surgical procedures were more likely. Taken together, our findings suggest that delayed diagnosis was more likely in patients with less classic presentations, that such patients were less likely to undergo imaging or receive appendicitis-directed treatments, and that a substantial fraction of delayed diagnoses were preventable despite being less clinically apparent.

Among children with delayed diagnosis of appendicitis, progression of disease occurred between the index and delay ED encounters. Nearly every classic symptom or sign of appendicitis was more likely to be present during the later visit. The PAS and pARC scores, which measure the likelihood of appendicitis, were higher during the delay encounter than during the index encounter. Abdominal guarding and migration of pain to the right lower quadrant were especially likely to develop after the index encounter: each feature was more than 10 times as likely to be present later. The presence of more classic symptoms during a second ED visit makes the diagnosis more discernible to clinicians. Conversely, the absence of classic appendicitis symptoms puts a patient at risk of a delayed diagnosis.

Nevertheless, in this study, most delayed diagnoses were probably or possibly MOIDs, indicating that there were potential opportunities to prevent delay. The 3 elements of the diagnostic process most associated with a MOID were failures in diagnostic reasoning that indicated that the patient's history should have prompted a deeper evaluation. Most children with delayed diagnosis had neither a WBC count nor an imaging study performed at the index encounter. Children with a characteristic history or physical examination should undergo these tests in an effort to prevent delayed diagnosis. In this study, only 22.0% to 61.3% of children received indicated imaging based on a pARC score above the threshold at which imaging is cost-effective. This finding suggests an opportunity to improve detection.

### Appendiceal neurofibroma and diverticula in a neurofibromatosis type 1 patient with chronic right lower quadrant pain [^116ZSMeF]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1, Von Recklinghausen disease) is an autosomal dominant disease with a birth incidence of 1/2500–3000. The most common presentations of NF1 are cutaneous presentations like café-au-lait spots and neurofibromas. 5%-25% of patients with NF1 have gastrointestinal manifestations of the disease. Appendiceal neurofibroma are extremely rare and only a few cases are described in literature. An appendectomy is indicated because of high risk of appendicitis and malignant transformation. We report the case of a 74-year-old male patient with a history of NF1 with chronic right lower quadrant pain. Successive imaging scans showed suspicion of chronic appendicitis. A diagnostic laparoscopy, resulting in a laparoscopic appendectomy was performed without complications. Histopathology showed appendiceal neurofibroma and diverticula. The postoperative course was uneventful. In patients with NF1 with right lower quadrant pain benign appendiceal neurofibroma should be included in the differential diagnosis. A diagnostic laparoscopy should be performed followed by an appendectomy.

### Caecal-diverticulitis: a rare differential diagnosis for right-sided lower abdominal pain [^114K23yL]. Colorectal Disease (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

There are several differential diagnoses for acute abdominal discomfort with pain referred to the right lower quadrant region. The objective of this report is to outline our experience with diverticulitis of the caecum, which is a rare condition that is particularly difficult to diagnose correctly pre-operatively.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of acute diverticulitis of the caecum was performed over the period from January 1992 to December 2000 within the Surgical Department of the RWTH Aachen, Germany. The progress of each patient was assessed by interviewing the patient and by telephone contact with the patient's general practitioner.

Results

Seven patients with isolated infective diverticulitis of the caecum were encountered in the course of this study. In five of these cases, the pre-operative diagnosis was either unclear or incorrect. Four patients underwent surgery for suspected appendicitis. In one patient, the diverticulitis was diagnosed during laparoscopic surgery undertaken for presumed adnexal disease. Intestinal continuity was restored in all cases. The postoperative course was uneventful.

Conclusions

Right-sided caecal diverticulitis is rare in comparison to diverticulitis of the sigmoid or descending colon. Nevertheless, it should be actively considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with acute tenderness in the right lower abdominal region.

### Acute appendicitis after laparoscopic treatment of acute epiploic appendagitis [^117DSsya]. Surgical Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Epiploic appendagitis (EA) is a rare cause of right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal pain. We report an unusual case of acute gangrenous appendicitis that developed after laparoscopic treatment of an EA. A 62-year-old man underwent laparoscopy for RLQ abdominal pain. EA was found and a resection was performed. The appendix, which was macroscopically normal, was left undisturbed. One week later, the patient was operated on for acute gangrenous appendicitis. Histologic examination separately confirmed both diagnoses. The definitive outcome was uneventful. The exact origin of this unusual case is unknown: Could acute appendicitis have been secondary to laparoscopic manipulation or initially missed? We conclude that acute appendicitis may be either missed or induced by laparoscopy for RLQ abdominal pain.

Recurrent abdominal pain is a common reason for repeated visits to outpatient clinics and emergency departments, reflecting a substantial unmet need for timely and accurate diagnosis. A lack of awareness of some of the rarer causes of recurrent abdominal pain may impede diagnosis and delay effective management. This article identifies some of the key rare but diagnosable causes that are frequently missed by gastroenterologists and provides expert recommendations to support recognition, diagnosis, and management with the ultimate aim of improving patient outcomes.

### Clinical features and preventability of delayed diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis [^112y49xK]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Secondary Analysis

In a model assessing clinical features at the index encounter, patients with delayed diagnosis of appendicitis were more likely to have had abdominal pain for 48 to 96 hours (adjusted OR [aOR], 2.40; 95% CI, 1.16–4.97) compared with less than 24 hours, no pain with walking (aOR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.10–0.25), abdominal pain maximally outside the right lower quadrant (aOR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.57–1.58), no abdominal guarding (aOR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.21–0.51), and a complex chronic condition (aOR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.05–5.23) (Table 2). Adding care features to the model, children who received nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (aOR, 3.78; 95% CI, 2.10–6.80) or ondansetron (aOR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.10–3.61) were more likely to have a delay in diagnosis, whereas those who received opioids (aOR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.14–0.49), a CT scan (aOR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.05–0.22), or ultrasonography (aOR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.08–0.24) were less likely. In this model, the presence of a complex chronic condition was no longer associated with delay.

### Evaluating the patient with right upper quadrant abdominal pain [^115Az56X]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain is among the most common complaints in the emergency department. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI causes for pain. Evaluation of patients requires a combination of history, physical examination, laboratory testing, and diagnostic imaging. This article details the anatomy and physiology of the right upper abdomen and approach to the history and physical examination of the most common diseases encountered in the emergency department. "Can't miss", non-GI diagnoses are discussed. Best practices of laboratory and imaging, and treatment of most common diagnoses of RUQ pain are reviewed.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® right lower quadrant pain: 2022 update [^1146XbnY]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

This document focuses on imaging in the adult and pregnant populations with right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal pain, including patients with fever and leukocytosis. Appendicitis remains the most common surgical pathology responsible for RLQ abdominal pain in the United States. Other causes of RLQ pain include right colonic diverticulitis, ureteral stone, and infectious enterocolitis. Appropriate imaging in the diagnosis of appendicitis has resulted in decreased negative appendectomy rate from as high as 25% to approximately 1% to 3%. Contrast-enhanced CT remains the primary and most appropriate imaging modality to evaluate this patient population. MRI is approaching CT in sensitivity and specificity as this technology becomes more widely available and utilization increases. Unenhanced MRI and ultrasound remain the diagnostic procedures of choice in the pregnant patient. MRI and ultrasound continue to perform best in the hands of the experts. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### "Cecal gangrene": a rare cause of right-sided inferior abdominal quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis [^1151rMVD]. Emergency Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

We report on a 58-year-old man with known diabetes, congestive heart failure, and need for chronic hemodialysis presenting with right lower abdominal quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis. Although initial clinical findings were highly suggestive of acute appendicitis, CT revealed marked circumferential wall thickening of the cecum, which was interpreted as cecal infarction by the radiologist. Intraoperatively, cecal necrosis was confirmed, but the ileocecal valve and, especially, the appendix showed no ischemia. No vascular occlusions were found. Histopathologic analysis of the resected cecum demonstrated isolated transmural cecal necrosis with marked infiltration of the cecal wall by numerous bacteria and neutrophils. We present the CT features and histopathologic findings of isolated cecal gangrene, review the pathogenesis of occlusive and nonocclusive cecal ischemia or infarction, and discuss the role of bacterial superinfection as a potential cofactor in the pathogenesis of isolated cecal necrosis which should be included in the differential diagnosis of right-sided inferior abdominal quadrant pain.

Functional abdominal pain and alarm features — In children with functional abdominal pain, diagnostic testing (noninvasive or invasive) for Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection should not be undertaken, and the page cautions that diagnostic testing for the infection should not be undertaken in these children after a positive noninvasive test due to anxiety and unnecessary endoscopy. Alarm signs include persistent right upper or right lower quadrant pain, dysphagia, odynophagia, persistent vomiting, gastrointestinal blood loss, involuntary weight loss, deceleration of linear growth, delayed puberty, unexplained fever, and a family history of inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or PUD. In the absence of alarm signs or symptoms, recent updated recommendations did not identify compelling evidence to support upper endoscopy as part of the diagnostic work up.

### Intestinal obstruction in children: could it be congenital abdominal bands? [^112jFZLU]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic abdominal pain is the most commonly seen condition in the pediatric population. Many causes can be successfully managed by conservative treatment; nevertheless, surgical intervention is sometimes inevitable. Among many surgical conditions, such as appendicitis as the most frequent cause, one is also to think about congenital abdominal bands. We report a case of a 10-year-old boy with chronic abdominal pain, who suddenly developed clinical and radiologic signs of intestinal obstruction. The cause of chronic abdominal pain as well as the intestinal obstruction was revealed during the operation: 2 congenital abdominal bands, trapping the gut convolutes. To our knowledge, this is the first report of 2 bands in a single patient.

Chronic abdominal pain can be a difficult diagnostic dilemma. Anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome (ACNES) is a potential differential diagnosis that should be considered because treatment is both easy and effective. We describe the case of a 51-year-old man presenting with 7months of right lower quadrant abdominal pain on the background of known Crohn's disease. A circumspect surgical approach and multidisciplinary input was key to making the diagnosis of a nerve entrapment syndrome.

Case Presentation

An 8-year-old female presented to urgent care with sharp, acute-on-chronic right lower-quadrant abdominal pain, which began the morning of presentation and persisted throughout the afternoon. Her mother described her as having difficulty ambulating due to the pain. They were unable to indicate whether the pain had migrated from the periumbilical region. She had abdominal pain that had been ongoing for the past 3 weeks with a waxing and waning presentation and had taken polyethylene glycol in the past for constipation. She denied nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention, fever, diarrhea, hematochezia, or melenic stools. She denied cough, congestion, or rhinorrhea. She did not have any unexplained pruritus. She also had no dysuria, urinary frequency, or urgency.

She had no other chronic conditions for which she took any medication and had no history of abdominal or inguinal hernias or previous surgeries. Her family history was notable for multiple close family members with a history of appendectomy, including her mother.

She and her mother recently arrived in the United States from rural Peru 3 months prior. Her workup upon arrival was negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, syphilis, and active tuberculosis. She had a recent normal lead level. Her mother expressed concern for general parasitosis in their home community in Peru; however, the patient had never had specific symptoms and had not had any testing done.

In clinic, her vital signs were notable for tachycardia and tachypnea. She was afebrile. Her weight was in the 73rd percentile. Her general exam was notable for an uncomfortable appearance, not moving on the exam table. Her abdominal exam demonstrated active bowel sounds. She voluntarily tensed her abdominal muscles throughout the exam. She exhibited acute tenderness to palpation with rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant (McBurney's point) with generalized tenderness in all other quadrants, including the suprapubic region. Pain could be reliably elicited in her right lower quadrant with palpation of her left lower quadrant (Rovsing sign). Supine internal and external flexed hip rotation (obturator sign) and straight leg left against resistance (psoas sign) elicited intense pain in her right lower quadrant. She was unable to participate in a jump test to further assess for peritonitis.

History and physical examination in suspected appendicitis — In a meta-analysis of approximately 4,000 patients, right lower quadrant abdominal pain was reported as the most useful clinical finding with positive likelihood ratio 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.31 to 8.46 and negative likelihood ratio 95% CI 0 to 0.28. In a separate meta-analysis, pain migration had positive likelihood ratio 2.06 (95% CI 1.63 to 2.60) and negative likelihood ratio 0.42 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.69), while pain progression had positive likelihood ratio 1.39 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.50) and negative likelihood ratio 0.46 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.77). Additional Class III data indicate right lower quadrant tenderness had positive likelihood ratios of 2.3 and 1.1 with negative likelihood ratios of 0 and 0.1; rigidity carried a positive likelihood ratio of 3.8, and anorexia, rectal tenderness, guarding, fever, and percussion tenderness in the right lower quadrant had positive likelihood ratios below 2.9.

### Chronic appendicitis "syndrome" manifested by an appendicolith and thickened appendix presenting as chronic right lower abdominal pain in adults [^112QMjHh]. Emergency Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

In this short report, we describe a small series of adult patients with chronic appendicitis presenting with chronic right lower quadrant abdominal pain. The clinical presentation was unusual and atypical for classic appendicitis because of the absence of fever, peritoneal tenderness on focused graded compression of the abdomen, and leukocytosis. Computed tomography (CT) findings included the presence of an appendicolith and appendiceal thickening, without mesenteric infiltration, abscess, or collection. In this series, the appendicolith appeared to represent a marker rather than an actual cause of appendicitis. Focused CT scans with additional lung and bone windows proved optimal in detecting appendicoliths, which were not visible on the scout localizer scans, despite windowing modifications. Our findings suggest that chronic appendicitis may be a phenomenon unique to adults and should be included in the differential diagnosis of chronic right lower quadrant pain in patients seen in the emergency room setting. Surgery is curative in such patients, although expectant management is an alternative when tolerated by the patient.

### ESR essentials: gynaecological causes of acute pelvic pain in women: a primer for emergent evaluation-practice recommendations by the European society of emergency radiology [^113ebeJa]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pelvic US and colour Doppler is the first imaging modality to rule in/out adnexal torsion. The US appearance of torsion is variable and depends on the chronicity and degree of torsion, and whether there is some preservation of arterial flow to the ovary from its dual supply from the ovarian and uterine arteries. Findings greatly depend on factors such as duration and degree of vascular obstruction and whether it is intermittent. Classical sonographic signs of ovarian torsion include increased ovarian diameter (> 4 cm) and volume (> 20 cm³ premenopausal or > 10 cm³ postmenopausal); however, in 5% of patients, no ovarian enlargement occurs. Other signs of ovarian torsion are peripherally displaced follicles, midline or superior displacement of the affected ovary, heterogeneity of the central stroma with echogenic areas indicating haemorrhage and hypoechoic areas representing oedema, and uterine deviation to the side of the affected ovary and ascites. Doppler ultrasound flow patterns reflect the degree of vascular compromise and duration of torsion with venous flow affected before the high-pressure arterial flow. Signs of complete torsion include absent venous flow, decreased or absent diastolic flow and absent arterial flow. In partial torsion, arterial flow with high resistive spectral signal may be seen, In some cases of nonviable or complete torsion, peripheral arterial flow can be preserved, which may be due to the dual arterial supply and relative preservation of flow within the uterine artery. The 'whirlpool' sign refers to the twisted ovarian pedicle, and in association with an enlarged ovary, it is diagnostic of ovarian torsion. Many of these findings can also be seen with contrast-enhanced CT and MRI, including the presence of a twisted vascular pedicle or an underlying mass and abnormal enhancement (Fig. 6). Finally, abnormal morphology and cystic degeneration suggest infarction.

Case Report

A 46-year-old woman presented with pain on micturition and a 15-month history of right-sided pelvic pain aggravated by an abdominal massage. Her course and outcome, aided by use of computed tomography (CT) scan, is described, identifying a 6-cm, mass-like lesion in the right lower quadrant enclosing an ambiguous linear calcified lesion, which on laparotomy revealed a fish bone embedded in a section of the terminal ileum and the perivesical area.

Conclusion

### Case series: diverticulitis in the young [^114mhPKH]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Diverticulitis has long been regarded as a disease of the elderly, but its incidence has been increasing in those under age 40. Younger patients with diverticulitis are more likely to be male and obese. They often have atypical presentations, and 25% may have right lower quadrant pain. Not surprisingly, the condition is often misdiagnosed, resulting in unnecessary surgery. An abdominal CT scan is the modality of choice for diagnosis, but the most important diagnostic step is simply to include diverticulitis on the differential diagnosis of a young person with lower abdominal pain.

### Elucidating the cause of pelvic pain [^1112bm2d]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain is a common condition. Establishing a diagnosis can be complicated by the interplay between various organ systems, including urologic, gynecologic, gastrointestinal, neurologic, endocrinological, psychological, and musculoskeletal. Frequently, the patient will have seen multiple providers and undergone multiple tests, as well as invasive procedures, before the musculoskeletal system is even considered in the differential diagnosis. Typically, the musculoskeletal and nervous systems become suspected culprits only once all other potential etiologies have been eliminated.

Recommendations for chronic pelvic pain — Diagnostic laparoscopy can be safely applied in the diagnosis of chronic pelvic pain (grade B). The procedure may identify the etiology of chronic pelvic pain in a proportion of patients, and its diagnostic accuracy may be improved by the technique of conscious pain mapping (grade B). Nevertheless, the existing evidence does not allow firm recommendations, and further research is needed to establish the value of DL for chronic pelvic pain (grade B).

### Chronic abdominal pain secondary to mesh erosion into cecum following incisional hernia repair: a case report and literature review [^1157L1HB]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Case report

The patient is a 56-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension, morbid obesity, and uterine fibroids. She had a history of abdominal surgery with two cesarean sections, total abdominal hysterectomy, and bilateral salpingooophorectomy. Five months after her last surgery in 1996, the patient was re-admitted with a large incisional hernia. She had open hernia repair with inlay polypropylene mesh under general anesthesia. Her post-operative course was uncomplicated. In general, polypropylene is cheap, available readily and is usually first choice for most hernias. It causes intense scarring, which is what is desired for repair of hernias.

Approximately 14 years (June 2010) after hernia repair, the patient presented to the Emergency Department complaining of intermittent abdominal pain rated 6/10 starting at right lower quadrant and migrating upwards and diffusely over the entire abdomen, associated with 2–3 episodes of nausea/ week. She had felt this pain on and off for the past 2 years but came to the Emergency Department because she felt it was worsening. She denied any other complaints. She was passing gas and having bowel movements. All lab work was normal. Computed tomography (CT) scan of abdomen and pelvis was unremarkable. Physical exam showed moderate tenderness at right lower quadrant but was otherwise benign. Prior screening colonoscopy showed diverticulosis but was otherwise unremarkable. Repeat colonoscopy was performed on this admission which showed mesh in the cecum. In light of the patient's past history of incisional hernia repair with polypropylene mesh, this finding was consistent with partial migration of the previous surgical mesh into the cecum and mesh was intact. The mesh appeared to have eroded into the lumen, but there was no enterocutaneous fistula or any other enteric fistula. This would have been evident by clinical exam and CT scan. The patient had no external leakage of stool or gas to suggest an enterocutaneous fistula, and she did not have peritoneal signs to suggest an enteric leak into the abdomen (Fig. 1).

### Beyond appendicitis: common and uncommon gastrointestinal causes of right lower quadrant abdominal pain at multidetector CT [^1169b6pf]. Radiographics (2011). Low credibility.

Right lower quadrant abdominal pain is one of the most common causes of a patient visit to the emergency department. Although appendicitis is the most common condition requiring surgery in patients with abdominal pain, right lower quadrant pain can be indicative of a vast list of differential diagnoses and is thus a challenge for clinicians. Other causes of right lower quadrant pain beyond appendicitis include inflammatory and infectious conditions involving the ileocecal region; diverticulitis; malignancies; conditions affecting the epiploic appendages, omentum, and mesentery; and miscellaneous conditions. Multidetector computed tomography (CT) has emerged as the modality of choice for evaluation of patients with several acute traumatic and nontraumatic conditions causing right lower quadrant pain. Multidetector CT is an extremely useful noninvasive method for diagnosis and management of not only the most common causes such as appendicitis but also less common conditions.

### Right lower quadrant abdominal pain: Do not forget about ovarian torsion on the computed tomography scan [^112b81r8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Abdominal pain is one of the most common chief complaints of patients presenting to emergency departments, and emergency physicians (EPs) often evaluate patients with right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Ovarian torsion is a rare cause of abdominal pain, but early diagnosis is essential for salvage of the affected ovary. The diagnostic study of choice for ovarian torsion is a pelvic ultrasound with color Doppler, but it is important for EPs and radiologists to be aware of findings of ovarian torsion that might appear on computed tomography (CT).

Case Report

We present a case of a young female with right lower quadrant abdominal pain with CT evidence of ovarian torsion that was not recognized; the patient was discharged and then called back when the study was over-read as concerning for ovarian torsion. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? The presence of radiographic findings associated with ovarian torsion on a CT scan should encourage an EP to order a pelvic ultrasound with color Doppler (if available) and obtain an obstetrics/gynecology consult.

Women with chronic, cyclical abdominal wall pain after gynecologic surgery may present in the plastic surgeon's office requesting body contouring. We present one such case in which an abdominal wall endometrioma was found. Resection of the endometrioma with the abdominal panniculus resulted in symptomatic cure for the patient. Plastic surgeons should be aware of the association of endometriosis with chronic pelvic/abdominal pain. Furthermore, suspicion of abdominal wall endometrioma should be entertained when patients present with chronic intermittent or cyclical abdominal wall pain after surgery of the pelvis or abdomen, especially after gynecologic or obstetric procedures.

### Tubercular appendicitis – a case report [^116DBzY6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

The disease can present either as a chronic disease (commonest presentation) with recurrent episodes of right iliac fossa pain, vomitings and diarrhoea, as acute appendicitis, or as a latent type that is detected incidentally. The acute presentation occurs due to severe pyogenic infection that is superimposed on the tubercular appendix. This type of presentation is seen during the quiescent phase of pulmonary tuberculosis, if present. The presence of chronic abdominal pain of long duration in young adults, pulmonary tuberculosis, poor nutritional status and loss of weight, and the presence of chronic diarrhoea have been said to be indicative of tuberculosis of the appendix, but these symptoms are of doubtful value, especially in India, where tuberculosis and amoebiasis are common.

As there are no pathognomic clinical features of appendicular tuberculosis, a pre-operative diagnosis is difficult. The diagnosis is usually made after histopathological examination of the appendectomy specimen. Pre-operative diagnosis does not alter the management of these patients as treatment in patients presenting with signs and symptoms of appendicitis remains appendectomy. However, anti-tubercular therapy must be started in the post-operative period if the biopsy reveals tuberculosis.

### Diagnosing chronic testicular pain… [^111wpGVD]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic testicular pain is unilateral or bilateral scrotal pain lasting for more than three months and interfering with normal activities. Because of the innervation of the scrotum, testicular pain may originate in the abdomen or testis. The cause of testicular pain may be difficult to determine. In approximately 25 percent of cases, an underlying cause for orchalgia cannot be identified. A review by Kapoor and Nargund stresses a systematic approach to the diagnosis of chronic testicular pain. The history should include questions concerning lower urinary tract and bowel symptoms, as well as a complete genitourinary and sexual history. The onset and nature of the pain can give important clues to diagnosis. Intermittent testicular torsion is characterized by recurrent episodes of severe pain that may be accompanied by nausea and systemic symptoms. The pain may last from minutes to hours.

Pain following groin or scrotal surgery is often continuous and exacerbated by sexual intercourse. Following vasectomy, pain may result from a sperm granuloma in the epididymis or from entrapment of nerve fibers in granulation tissue. Chronic orchalgia is reported following about one per 1, 000 vasectomies. Varicocele-related pain is characteristically described as a persistent, aching discomfort or heavy sensation that is relieved by lying down. Although testicular tumors are usually described as painless, up to 40 percent of patients report dull aching or heaviness. Bleeding into a tumor or other abnormalities such as hydroceles, epididymal cysts, and spermatoceles can produce acute or severe pain. Testicular pain associated with chronic infection is usually associated with urinary symptoms or those of sexually transmitted diseases. The management of testicular lesions depends on the etiology. Patients should be cautioned that surgical treatment may not resolve pain.

For cases where the etiology cannot be determined, ilioinguinal nerve block or microsurgical denervation may relieve the pain. Systemic analgesia or orchidectomy may be required in individual cases. In such extreme cases, psychologic consultation is recommended to ensure that the pain is neurologic and not psychogenic in origin.

### Evaluation of acute abdominal pain in adults [^111kDKdj]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain can represent a spectrum of conditions from benign and self-limited disease to surgical emergencies. Evaluating abdominal pain requires an approach that relies on the likelihood of disease, patient history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The location of pain is a useful starting point and will guide further evaluation. For example, right lower quadrant pain strongly suggests appendicitis. Certain elements of the history and physical examination are helpful (e.g., constipation and abdominal distension strongly suggest bowel obstruction), whereas others are of little value (e.g., anorexia has little predictive value for appendicitis). The American College of Radiology has recommended different imaging studies for assessing abdominal pain based on pain location. Ultrasonography is recommended to assess right upper quadrant pain, and computed tomography is recommended for right and left lower quadrant pain. It is also important to consider special populations such as women, who are at risk of genitourinary disease, which may cause abdominal pain; and the elderly, who may present with atypical symptoms of a disease.

### Strongyloides appendicitis: unusual etiology in two siblings with chronic abdominal pain [^115kEvFZ]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Appendicitis is one of the most common causes of acute surgical disease in children and young adults. Parasites, however, are one of the uncommon etiologies. An 8-year-old girl and her 7-year-old sister presented with more than 2 months of chronic abdominal pain that became worse over a 1-week period before presentation. The 2 sisters presented 1 month apart. Both had similar symptomatology and physical examination findings. At operation, the surgical findings included an inflamed appendix with a cross section of the parasite Strongyloides. Strongyloides appendicitis has occurred almost exclusively in areas endemic to the parasite. Its environment is more common outside the United States but occasionally is seen in the Southeast region and in institutionalized individuals. The presentation of acute exacerbation of chronic abdominal pain coupled with the pathologic finding of Strongyloides in an acutely inflamed appendix, should alert the clinician of other possible cases. This increased index of suspicion will allow more prompt diagnosis and help avoid the morbidity of delayed operation.

### Internal herniation of adnexa through a defect of the broad ligament: case report and literature review [^117YAP7Q]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Internal herniation through a defect of the broad ligament occurs rarely. Herniation of the ovary rather than the small intestine or colon is extremely rare. We present only the third known case of herniation of the adnexa into a broad ligament defect. A 42-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, aborta 1, had severe continuing right lower quadrant pain that was resistant to medical and surgical treatments. The clinical history was significant for long-standing endometriosis, 2 previous laparoscopic procedures to treat endometriosis, and chronic pelvic pain despite medical and surgical treatments. At the second laparoscopic procedure, pelvic endometriosis was excised, and a large defect of the right broad ligament was noted but not treated. At the third operation, right salpingo-oophorectomy was performed to eliminate the large broad ligament defect and the possibility of internal herniation on the right side as a possible explanation for the patient's chronic right lower quadrant pain. Postoperatively, the pain resolved, and the patient has been pain-free for 9 months. This type of internal herniation should be considered in the differential diagnosis in female patients with pelvic pain.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic pelvic pain in women, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, RCOG 2012 guidelines recommend to recognize that there is frequently more than one component to chronic pelvic pain. Aim to identify contributory factors rather than assign causality to a single pathology. Recognize that it may not be possible to identify confidently the cause of the pain at the initial assessment.

### Diagnostic laparoscopy guidelines: this guideline was prepared by the SAGES guidelines committee and reviewed and approved by the board of governors of the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES), November 2007 [^1127rfcG]. Surgical Endoscopy (2008). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic laparoscopy — technique for chronic pelvic pain evaluation can be performed under general anesthesia or conscious sedation, and the latter approach must be used with conscious pain mapping; smaller trocars and lower pneumoperitoneum pressures should be used to decrease operative pain. The patient is placed in the lithotomy position with an initial peri-umbilical access site, additional trocars can be placed in the left lower or right lower quadrant, and a cervical manipulator or rectal probe can be used if necessary for retraction but are usually not used during conscious sedation. During the procedure, adhesions are divided, suspected endometriosis lesions should be biopsied and classified, random biopsies may demonstrate endometriosis in 30% of patients with typical symptoms when no visible lesions are present, free peritoneal fluid should be sampled for endometriosis, and endometriosis lesions can then be fulgurated or removed.

Chronic pelvic pain is pain lasting longer than 6 months and is estimated to occur in 15% of women. Causes of pelvic pain include disorders of gynecologic, urologic, gastroenterologic, and musculoskeletal systems. The multidisciplinary nature of chronic pelvic pain may complicate diagnosis and treatment. Treatments vary by cause but may include medicinal, neuroablative, and surgical treatments.

### Acute abdominal pain in adults: evaluation and diagnosis [^112BidjC]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute abdominal pain, defined as nontraumatic abdominal pain lasting fewer than seven days, is a common presenting concern with a broad differential diagnosis. The most common causes are gastroenteritis and nonspecific abdominal pain, followed by cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, diverticulitis, and appendicitis. Extra-abdominal causes such as respiratory infections and abdominal wall pain should be considered. Pain location, history, and examination findings help guide the workup after ensuring hemodynamic stability. Recommended tests may include a complete blood count, C-reactive protein, hepatobiliary markers, electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, urinalysis, lipase, and pregnancy testing. Several diagnoses, such as cholecystitis, appendicitis, and mesenteric ischemia, cannot be confirmed clinically and typically require imaging. Conditions such as urolithiasis and diverticulitis may be diagnosed clinically in certain cases. Imaging studies are chosen based on the location of pain and index of suspicion for specific etiologies. Computed tomography with intravenous contrast media is often chosen for generalized abdominal pain, left upper quadrant pain, and lower abdominal pain. Ultrasonography is the study of choice for right upper quadrant pain. Point-of-care ultrasonography can aid in the prompt diagnosis of several etiologies of acute abdominal pain, including cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, and appendicitis. In patients who have female reproductive organs, diagnoses such as ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, and adnexal torsion should be considered. If ultrasonography results are inconclusive in pregnant patients, magnetic resonance imaging is preferred over computed tomography when available.

### An 18-year-old with acute-on-chronic abdominal pain [^112rYNYr]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

An 18-year-old woman with a complex past medical history presented with 2 days of vomiting and lower abdominal pain. She had been admitted for the majority of the previous 5 months for recurrent pancreatitis and had undergone a cholecystectomy. Additional symptoms included nausea, anorexia, constipation, and a 40-lb weight loss over 4 months. She appeared uncomfortable, and an examination was remarkable for tachycardia, hypertension, and diffuse abdominal tenderness to light palpation. Her initial laboratory test results revealed mildly elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase 68 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 80 U/L) and a normal lipase. She was admitted for pain control and nutritional support. Over the next few days, the lipase increased to 1707 U/L. Despite optimizing her management for acute pancreatitis, the patient's symptoms persisted. Further history gathering and laboratory testing ultimately revealed her diagnosis. Our expert panel reviews her hospital course and elucidates the management of our eventual diagnosis.

### Bilateral massive leiomyomas in a bicornuate uterus, with torsion of the right horn [^116n3nkK]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Case presentation

An African American woman in her 30s presented to the emergency room with a chief complaint of acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain. The patient reported a progressive worsening of this pain over the past week, despite using over-the-counter medications. She described the pain as sharp, non-migrating and persistent, with no periods of relief. She also noted episodes of constipation, which she had previously attributed as the cause of her pain in the past. She revealed a 2-year history of intermittent abdominal pain, bloating and abdominal distension, which she assumed was related to weight gain. Additionally, she reported a long-standing history of constipation that was typically relieved with over-the-counter stool softeners. Over the past year, however, she had noticed a marked increase in abdominal distension accompanied by more frequent and severe episodes of pain. Although she had successfully managed her pain with over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen in the past, this current episode had persisted and worsened despite its use. She denied a history of unintentional weight loss, loss of appetite or difficulty with urination. Her gynaecological history included a history of irregular menstrual cycles with occasional heavy bleeding, and she was previously diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome in 2021. She endorsed a known history of leiomyomas since 2020 but was not aware of the size or any other uterine abnormalities. She denied the use of contraceptives and had never been pregnant or attempted pregnancy before. She denied any medical issues or prior abdominal surgery. She had a desire for future fertility.

His medical histories were essential hypertension and a long history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). His current medications were enalapril 5 mg, two times a day; salmeterol/fluticasone propionate (50/250), one puff twice a day and ipratropium bromide/fenoterol two puffs prn. On physical examination, his body temperature was 37.8°C, pulse rate was 99 beats per minute, blood pressure was 140/80 mm Hg and respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute. He had jaundice with icteric sclera. Abdominal examination revealed mild abdominal distension, normal bowel sound and moderate tenderness at right upper quadrant; liver and spleen were not palpable.

### Chronic epigastric pain in a middle-aged man [^1136Dry5]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this article is to describe and show a number of imaging findings that are classical for an intussusception in an adult and discuss the clinical manifestations and associated findings. We also discuss the differential diagnosis of intussusception in an adult and the most likely causes.

Conclusion

A malignant cause of intussusception is more likely when an intussusception involves the large bowel, in which case primary adenocarcinoma of the colon is the most prevalent. Therefore, surgical resection followed by careful pathologic analysis is typically indicated in nonresolving cases. Nevertheless, when intussusception is transiently diagnosed in an asymptomatic adult, follow-up is favored over surgery.

### Mast cell deposition and activation may be a new explanation for epiploic appendagitis [^113Fhcqw]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Chronic abdominal pain without associated abnormal bowel habits is often relegated into a category called functional bowel syndrome which most commonly presents with right lower quadrant pain. This case presents an alternative consideration for such patients. Isolated abdominal pain can be explained by MCs which release mediators locally and thus may be undetectable in the blood and urine. This study suggests that a high MC density in the peritoneal covering of the intestinal appendage is associated with chronic abdominal pain and acute EA. The MCs may cause chronic pain in or near the appendages due to local secretion of mediators of nociception such as histamine and tryptase. The use of non-steroidal therapy for acute EA is often effective which is interesting in that these drugs also stabilise MCs. Via elaboration of a variety of fibrogenic mediators (eg, transforming growth factor-beta), MCAS can affect the development of sclerosis/adhesions as sometimes found already present in patients with MCAS undergoing their initial abdominal surgeries (personal observations, LBA)), furthering the likelihood that MC activation in the epiploic appendage could play a pathological role in the inflammatory process in the peritoneal lining (eg, peritonitis) and in the appendagitis per se.

Patient's perspective

Since the birth of my son in 2008, my health has been in decline. I have had migraines, abdominal pain, joint pain, swelling, depression, traumatic brain injury and debilitating fatigue. Despite the illnesses, I began a Master of Divinity programme to pursue ordination. I began an exercise regimen of swimming, strength training and cardio 5 days a week. I followed this regimen for 2 years with little weight loss. However, the illnesses increased in severity and frequency. Respiratory illness and all-over body pain halted the exercise. I diligently followed treatment plans from the rheumatologist, neurologist, psychiatrist and primary care doctor. The treatments gave intermittent relief but not enough to participate fully in life. At some point, concentrating became a roadblock to reading and writing papers. I flunked out of the programme. Determined to continue my education, I enrolled at a different school that has supported me and given me accommodations.

### Red flag signs and symptoms for patients with early-onset colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116AnYmS]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Our review also found that nearly half of individuals with EOCRC reported abdominal pain, based on evidence from 73 studies, and a 1.3- to 6-fold positive association with EOCRC risk across 4 studies. Given its association with a myriad of gastrointestinal conditions, the American Academy of Family Physicians recommends computed tomography for evaluating patients with acute right or left lower quadrant abdominal pain and ultrasonography for right upper quadrant pain, though the guidelines also recommend identifying associated symptoms to better focus a differential diagnosis. It may be inefficient and unrealistic to perform colonoscopy for all adults younger than 45 years with isolated abdominal pain, given the low diagnostic yieldand insufficient capacity across the US to accommodate this group. Nevertheless, the fact that 40% of patients with EOCRC presented with abdominal pain and 27% presented with altered bowel habits reinforces that any new symptom should be comprehensively evaluated by a clinician. Our findings suggest that EOCRC should be part of the initial differential diagnosis, and that a plan for follow-up should be in place, such as a 30- to 60-day follow-up visit to confirm whether the original working diagnosis was correct, the red flag sign or symptom has resolved, or to refer for colonoscopy to exclude EOCRC if these criteria are not met. We postulate that all benign causes of red flag signs or symptoms either can be diagnostically confirmed or should resolve with initial treatment. When an alternative diagnosis is not confirmed or signs or symptoms fail to resolve, a colonoscopy to rule out EOCRC should be pursued. Abdominal pain could serve as a marker to prompt further patient-clinician discussion about additional medical history, which could help determine whether further diagnostic work-up is warranted.

### Endometriosis and the appendix: a case series and comprehensive review of the literature [^114muqGm]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To report the prevalence of appendiceal disease in women with chronic pelvic pain undergoing laparoscopy for possible endometriosis, summarize the literature, and more accurately estimate the prevalence of endometriosis of the appendix.

Design

Prospective case series and literature review.

Setting

Academic research institute.

Patient(S)

One hundred thirty-three patients with chronic pelvic pain and possible endometriosis undergoing laparoscopy.

Intervention(S)

History, physical exam, and abdominopelvic laparoscopy. Endometriosis and adhesions were excised using selective Nd:YAG contact laser trabeculoplasty and pathologically evaluated. Only patients with visible abnormalities involving the appendix were treated via concurrent laparoscopic appendectomy.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Appendiceal abnormalities at laparoscopy.

Result(S)

Of 133 patients, 13 had a previous appendectomy with unknown pathology. Of the remaining 120 patients, 109 reported right lower quadrant pain. Of this subgroup, six patients had appendiceal pathology: four with pathology-confirmed endometriosis, one with Crohn's disease suspected at laparoscopy, and one with chronic appendicitis. The prevalence of appendiceal endometriosis in patients with biopsy-proven endometriosis (n = 97) or with right lower quadrant pain (n = 109) was 4.1% and 3.7%, respectively. This rate was similar to the 2.8% prevalence confirmed by literature review in patients with endometriosis but was much higher than that reported in all patients (0.4%).

Conclusion(S)

Appendiceal endometriosis, while relatively uncommon in patients with endometriosis, is rare in the general population. In patients with right lower quadrant or pelvic pain, the appendix should be inspected for endometriosis and evidence of nongynecologic disease.

### US of right upper quadrant pain in the emergency department: diagnosing beyond gallbladder and biliary disease [^112jNZ25]. Radiographics (2018). Low credibility.

Acute cholecystitis is the most common diagnosable cause for right upper quadrant abdominal (RUQ) pain in patients who present to the emergency department (ED). However, over one-third of patients initially thought to have acute cholecystitis actually have RUQ pain attributable to other causes. Ultrasonography (US) is the primary imaging modality of choice for initial imaging assessment and serves as a fast, cost-effective, and dynamic modality to provide a definitive diagnosis or a considerably narrowed list of differential possibilities. Multiple organ systems are included at standard RUQ US, and a variety of ultrasonographically diagnosable disease processes can be identified, including conditions of hepatic, pancreatic, adrenal, renal, gastrointestinal, vascular, and thoracic origin, all of which may result in RUQ pain. In certain cases, subsequent computed tomography, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, MR cholangiopancreatography, or cholescintigraphy may be considered, depending on the clinical situation and US findings. Familiarity with the spectrum of disease processes outside of the gallbladder and biliary tree that may manifest with RUQ pain and recognition at US of these alternative conditions is pivotal for early diagnosis and appropriate management. Diagnosis at the time of initial US can reduce unnecessary imaging and its consequences, including excess cost, radiation exposure, nephrotoxic contrast medium use, and time to diagnosis, thereby translating into improved patient care and outcome. This article (a) reviews the causes of RUQ pain identifiable at US using an organ-system approach, (b) illustrates the US appearance of select conditions from each organ system with multimodality imaging correlates, and (c) discusses the relevant pathophysiology and treatment of these entities to aid in efficient direction of management.

### Diagnosis and management of chronic pelvic pain [^116TT42r]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain is difficult to diagnose and to treat [81] because of the multiple and often overlapping causes [82]. A systematic approach aids in the thorough evaluation and appropriate therapy. At the initial visit(s), a thorough history should be taken and complete physical examination performed. Screening for co-existing conditions, such as depression, narcotic dependency, and physical, sexual, or emotional abuse is crucial so these issues may be addressed immediately while additional causes for pelvic pain are evaluated. The relative likelihood of gastrointestinal, urologic, musculoskeletal, or gynecologic etiology must be considered to guide a more thorough initial evaluation. With gynecologic chronic pelvic pain, differentiation between hormonally responsive and nonresponsive conditions is helpful for diagnosis and treatment. Therapy can then be instituted or an appropriate referral made.

### Right-sided diverticulitis mimics appendicitis [^1164tyD8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Right-sided diverticulitis is a rare source of right lower quadrant pain in Western society; however, it is quite common in Asian societies. Right-sided diverticulitis presents very similarly to appendicitis, with right lower quadrant pain, fever, nausea, and laboratory abnormalities, and is often seen in young patients.

Objectives

In this report, we present a case of right-sided diverticulitis. We review right-sided diverticulitis' diagnosis and management. It is important to diagnose right-sided diverticulitis because it is a good mimic of appendicitis and ideally should be diagnosed before a patient has unnecessary surgery.

Case Report

A 26-year-old Asian woman presented for evaluation of right lower quadrant pain and fever. She was initially thought to have appendicitis clinically, but had right-sided diverticulitis diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) scan. She was admitted and received intravenous antibiotics and bowel rest. Her right-sided diverticulitis resolved in 3 days.

Conclusions

Severe right lower quadrant pain in young patients of Asian descent can be right-sided diverticulitis. Right-sided diverticulitis is a benign condition managed medically that mimics appendicitis. CT imaging seems to be the best way to avoid unnecessary surgery.

### Clinical features and preventability of delayed diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis [^115BL2gz]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Cases were also reviewed for the secondary outcome of preventable delayed diagnosis, defined as a missed opportunity to improve diagnosis (MOID). To grade the likelihood of a MOID, we used the validated Modified Safer Dx checklist. The Safer Dx measures the likelihood of a MOID using 13 items relating to individual elements of an encounter that could lead to MOIDs. The first 12 items include the history, physical examination, data gathering, presence of "red flags", incomplete caregiver information, completeness of evaluation, diagnostic reasoning, test interpretation, follow-up of results, differential formation, disease evolution, and how closely the index presentation reflected typical features of the disease. The final item, the MOID score, graded the overall likelihood of a MOID. All items are measured on a scale of 1 to 7. We further classified a score of 1 to 2 as an unlikely MOID, 3 to 5 as a possible MOID, and 6 to 7 as a likely MOID.

Variables

Potential clinical features associated with delayed diagnosis were chosen a priori based on clinical features related to the ultimate diagnosis of appendicitis from previous literature. These features included age, sex, duration of abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea or vomiting, migration of pain to the right lower quadrant, history of fever, pain with walking, maximal pain in the right lower quadrant, and abdominal guarding. If the symptom was not mentioned in the record, it was assessed as being absent, as is typical for this type of study. We also assessed the presence of a complex chronic condition based on same- and previous-encounter diagnosis codes.

We hypothesized that several care features would be associated (positively or negatively) with delayed diagnosis, including obtaining ultrasonographic imaging, obtaining a CT scan, use of a nonopioid analgesic (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, ketorolac, or naproxen), use of an opioid analgesic (fentanyl, hydromorphone, morphine, or oxycodone), or use of ondansetron. Finally, because we planned to evaluate disparities between timely and delayed diagnosis, we collected race, ethnicity, and insurance information as recorded in the source database.

### Abstract… [^116ENJg5]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Acute sigmoid diverticulitis, a complication of colonic diverticulosis, is the most common cause of acute left lower-quadrant pain in adults. Diverticulosis occurs in 5 to 10 percent of persons by 45 years of age, and in up to 80 percent by 80 years of age. 1 Although most persons with diverticulosis never have symptoms, diverticulitis occurs in 10 to 20 percent of persons with this condition, 2 and recurrent diverticulitis occurs in approximately 25 percent of these patients. 3 The severity ranges from mild to severe, which can result in perforation with peritonitis and abscess or fistula formation. The severity of the initial attack is an excellent predictor of the likelihood of recurrence. 4 Mild cases of diverticulitis can be treated medically. More severe cases may require emergent surgery as a result of complications.
5. Illustrative Cases CASE 1 A 64-year-old man presents with left lower-quadrant pain that has progressively worsened over the past three days.

Axial contrast-enhanced computed tomography shows multiple diverticula in the sigmoid colon, with stranding of the adjacent fat. A coronal reformatted image shows the offending diverticulum. The patient is treated conservatively with antibiotics. CASE 2 A 44-year-old man who was recently treated conservatively for diverticulitis presents with recurrent left lower-quadrant pain and fever. Contrast-enhanced CT shows a rim-enhancing gas and fluid collection adjacent to the sigmoid colon, which is consistent with a diverticular abscess. Multiple sigmoid diverticula, colonic wall thickening, and pericolonic fat stranding are also present. The abscess is drained percutaneously. Radiologic Evaluation Imaging of patients with lower-quadrant pain should be guided by the clinical scenario. The differential diagnosis should be considered, and any additional relevant information should be obtained to guide clinical management.

Imaging may not be necessary in patients with the classic triad of left lower-quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis, and in whom uncomplicated diverticulitis is suspected. Imaging also may not be necessary in patients with a history of diverticulitis who present with relatively mild clinical symptoms of recurrent disease. However, imaging often plays a definitive role in evaluating left lower-quadrant pain of unclear etiology.

### Bowel obstruction: a narrative review for all physicians [^1155jpvH]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical case presentation

An 81-year-old woman with arterial hypertension and a laparotomic appendectomy when she was 12 years old presents to the emergency department with intermittent acute abdominal pain and vomiting. The last defecation was 2 days ago, and the bowel is closed to gas. Current medications only include valsartan 80 mg daily. The body temperature is 37.5 °C, and all vital parameters are normal. The remainder of the examination demonstrates pain and localized peritonism in the lower right quadrant. Laboratory tests are normal except white blood cells at 14,000 per microliter.

Questions include the following: How should this patient be evaluated and treated? What is the working diagnosis? Options include stump appendicitis, right colon diverticulitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, bowel obstruction, gastroenteritis, right renal colic, right colon cancer, bowel ischemia, or inflammatory bowel disease (Fig. 1).

Clinical presentation

A 45-year-old man developed multiple papules on the abdomen (with sizes of about 2–15 mm) for 9 months (figure 1), intermittent black stool and abdominal pain for 5 months. Colonoscopy revealed chronic inflammation of the colorectal mucosa (pathological results indicated active inflammation of the mucosa and Epstein-Barr virus positive) (figure 2). CT enterography examinations revealed segmental ileal stenosis in the right lower abdomen. The abdominal pain worsened 3 days before admission. Laboratory examinations during hospitalisation showed that C reactive protein was 31.53 ng/L; fibrinogen was 5.77 g/L and D-dimer was 1308 ng/mL, respectively. On the day of hospitalisation, the patient had sudden aggravation of abdominal pain without flatus and defecation. Physical examination showed abdominal tenderness, rebound pain and muscle tension. Abdominal X-ray indicated intestinal obstruction. Emergency laparotomy was performed. During the operation, a large number of gas, yellow faecal water and abscesses were seen. Multiple ischaemia and perforations in the small intestine (seven places) were detected.

### Surgical management of acute right lower-quadrant pain in pregnancy: a prospective cohort study [^113s4teP]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The etiology of right lower-quadrant pain in pregnant patients is a challenge in diagnosis. We discuss the surgical issues among pregnant patients with right lower-quadrant pain and demonstrate the method to diagnosis.

Study Design

This was a prospective cohort study with enrollment during 2 years. Pregnant patients presenting with acute right lower-quadrant abdominal pain and requiring surgical consult were included. Demographics, gestational age, symptoms, workup, operative results, and pathology were recorded.

Results

One-hundred patients were enrolled, 38 had nonspecific abdominal pain, 15 of whom were admitted. There were no differences in temperature, leukocyte count, and neutrophil shift among the admitted and nonadmitted patients. Forty-one patients underwent surgery and had a substantially higher gestational age, leukocyte count, and neutrophil shift than those who did not. Ultrasound was performed considerably more often on first-trimester patients (81.6%) compared with second- (58.1%) and third-trimester (57.9%) patients, and CT scan was used considerably less in the first trimester compared with the second and third trimesters, and considerably less than ultrasound for the first trimester. Sensitivity of ultrasound for appendicitis was inversely correlated to fetal gestational age, and CT scan retained high sensitivity and specificity throughout pregnancy.

Conclusions

This is one of the first prospective studies assessing diagnoses and workup of pregnant patients with right lower-quadrant pain. We recommend abdominal ultrasound be the first imaging modality for patients for whom surgical consultation is necessary, thereby determining if the pathology is obstetric. If inconclusive, a CT scan is necessary to guide treatment.

### Right lower-quadrant pain-more than one diagnosis [^114GQDV4]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

When a patient presents with right-lower-quadrant pain in the emergency room, the diagnosis of appendicitis must always be considered, but the differential diagnosis for this symptom includes many other etiologies. We describe a case of an 8-year-old girl with von Willebrand disease who presented with right-lower-quadrant pain and was found to have an appendiceal wall hematoma. During her evaluation, an ultrasound of the abdomen was performed, and the results were initially interpreted as an intussusception. Although ultrasound is a highly reliable way to diagnose appendicitis and intussusception, the case illustrates that the thickened abdominal wall that occurs in a mural hematoma can appear like the "target sign" that is usually associated with intussusception, and in certain clinical scenarios, alternative forms of imaging may be of value.

### The acute right lower quadrant: CT evaluation [^111yQmJy]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Acute right lower quadrant pain is a nonspecific but common clinical complaint. Appendicitis is the most common cause of acute right lower quadrant pain and CT has become the most reliable imaging method in the evaluation of these patients. Although there is controversy regarding the best way to perform CT in this setting, oral and i.v. contrast-enhanced CT remains the most commonly used technique. CT with oral and i.v. contrast material facilitates diagnosis of appendicitis and the numerous other entities that may cause right lower quadrant pain.

### Randomized clinical trial evaluating elective laparoscopic appendicectomy for chronic right lower-quadrant pain [^115bhkCq]. The British Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

It is questionable whether elective appendicectomy can effectively reduce persistent or recurrent right lower-quadrant abdominal pain due to chronic or recurrent appendicitis.

Methods

This single-centre double-blind randomized clinical trial studied the effects of elective laparoscopic appendicectomy on pain 6 months after operation in patients with persistent or recurrent lower-quadrant pain. A secondary outcome evaluated was the relationship between clinical response and appendiceal histopathology. The analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis.

Results

Forty patients were randomized to laparoscopic appendicectomy (18) or laparoscopic inspection only (22). Postoperative pain scores differed significantly between the groups, favouring appendicectomy (P = 0.005). Relative risk calculations indicated that there was a 2.4 (95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) 1.3 to 4.0) times greater chance of improvement in pain after laparoscopic appendicectomy. The number needed to treat was 2.2 (95 per cent c.i. 1.5 to 6.5). There was no association between postoperative pain scores and histopathology findings.

Conclusion

Persistent or recurrent lower abdominal pain can be treated by elective appendicectomy with significant pain reduction in properly selected cases. Histopathology may not be abnormal.

### Imaging of acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain: differential diagnoses beyond appendicitis [^111Ttnh6]. Emergency Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Evaluation of acute right lower quadrant pain remains a common and challenging clinical scenario for emergency medicine physicians due to frequent nonspecific signs, symptoms, and physical examination findings. Therefore, imaging has evolved to play a pivotal role in the emergency setting. While appendicitis is a common cause for acute pain, there are numerous other important differential considerations with which the radiologist must be aware. The purpose of this review is to list an anatomy-based, encompassing differential diagnosis in addition to acute appendicitis for right lower quadrant pain; demonstrate the key imaging findings of numerous differential considerations; and describe helpful imaging and clinical features useful in narrowing the differential diagnosis.

The clinical features of intestinal tuberculosis vary greatly and are not specific. This makes it difficult to distinguish intestinal tuberculosis from other intestinal diseases. A Comparison of the clinical finding according to pieces of literature is summarized in Table 1.

Clinical manifestations of intestinal tuberculosis

* Not mention in the study

The most common clinical features are abdominal pain, weight loss, and fever. Abdominal pain is chronic but can also be acute on chronic if acute complications occur. Abdominal pain often occurs in the right lower quadrant area of the abdomen and the periumbilical area. Weight loss is also the most common symptom that occurs in patients with intestinal tuberculosis due to various causes such as chronic inflammatory processes, decreased intake, and impaired absorption. Weight loss can be accompanied by mild to moderate anemia. Most intestinal tuberculosis patients also experience irregular low-grade fever, with body temperature between 37.5 and 38.5 °C, accompanied by night sweats. An increase in temperature occurs more frequently in the afternoon. Other gastrointestinal symptoms also often occur such as chronic diarrhea, constipation, and decreased appetite. On physical examination, it is often found ascites and palpable abdominal mass, especially in the right lower quadrant area (19,3%), and splenomegaly (14,2%). Complications that are often found are intestinal bleeding, fistula, and perforation.

### Extra scrotal spermatocele causing lower abdominal pain: a first case report [^1167a5f1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Lower quadrant abdominal pain is a common complaint evaluated in emergency departments (EDs). The number of differential diagnoses is lowered when the pain in a male patient is associated with a palpable tender mass. These diagnoses include inguinal hernia, inflamed inguinal lymph node, rectus sheath hematoma, cryptorchidism, mass derived from the spermatic cord, and polyorchidism. We report a case of extra scrotal spermatocele causing lower quadrant abdominal pain that was misdiagnosed as an inguinal hernia on several ED visits. Lower quadrant mass and pain caused by a spermatocele are unusual conditions. Upon the patient's third (ED) visit, the painful mass remained located in his right lower quadrant. The lower quadrant mass was movable on palpation and with pressure could be delivered into the superior aspect of the scrotum. The patient had an abdominal and pelvic computed tomography scan and lower quadrant ultrasound. The imaging studies revealed the mass to be a cystic structure. Surgical excision confirmed that the mass was a spermatocele. Differential diagnoses, diagnostic approaches, and treatment are discussed.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^117XAyts]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

In this series, a clinician extemporaneously discusses the diagnostic approach (regular text) to sequentially presented clinical information (bold). Additional commentary on the diagnostic reasoning process (italics) is integrated throughout the discussion.

Clinical Information: A 43-year-old Mexican woman presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain. Her illness had begun 1 week earlier with fevers to 38.9°F and intermittent frontal headache without photophobia or other neurological symptoms. Two days prior to presentation, she began having left upper quadrant (LUQ) abdominal pain described as sharp, unremitting and radiating to the midepigastrium, right upper quadrant and left flank. The pain did not change with eating, but she did report episodic nausea and vomiting. She denied hematemesis, dysuria or diarrhea. Her last menstrual period had begun 3 weeks earlier, and she denied recent sexual activity. One day prior she had been diagnosed with gallstones at another emergency department and treated with oral metoclopramide and hydrocodone-acetaminophen.

Clinician

Left upper quadrant pain commonly results from gastritis, colitis (splenic flexure), pancreatitis, pyelonephritis, nephrolithiasis, splenic enlargement or infarction, or left lower lobe pneumonia. Intermittent headaches frequently accompany systemic illness, so the challenge is determining if the associated fever signals an intracranial infectious process such as meningitis, encephalitis or brain abscess. The severity and duration of headache, lack of previous headache history, presence of meningeal signs and neurological deficits are common indications for imaging the central nervous system and analyzing the CSF.

### Musculoskeletal causes of chronic pelvic pain: what a gynecologist should know [^113hgE3h]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Ten percent of all gynecologic consultations are for chronic pelvic pain, and 20% of patients require a laparoscopy. Chronic pelvic pain affects 15% of all women annually in the United States, with medical costs and loss of productivity estimated at $2.8 billion and $15 billion per year, respectively. Chronic pelvic pain in women may have multifactorial etiology, but 22% have pain associated with musculoskeletal causes. Unfortunately, pelvic musculoskeletal dysfunction is not routinely evaluated as a cause of pelvic pain by gynecologists. A pelvic musculoskeletal examination is simple to perform, is not time-consuming, and is one of the most important components to investigate in all chronic pelvic pain patients. This article describes common musculoskeletal causes of chronic pelvic pain and explains how to perform a simple musculoskeletal examination that can be easily incorporated into the gynecologist physical examination.

### Clinical, ultrasonographic, and pathologic characteristics of patients with chronic right-lower-quadrant abdominal pain that may benefit from appendectomy [^116DSkkf]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic pains of the right lower quadrant of the abdomen (RLQA) remain a challenging problem worldwide, especially in areas with limited technical background; chronic appendicitis is still a subject of controversy. The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical and paraclinical data of patients with chronic pains of RLQA who had an appendectomy performed.

Methods

During a period of 4 years, all patients presenting with a chronic pain of the RLQA were selected for our study and underwent clinical assessment and systematic ultrasonography of the abdomen; these served as a basis of selecting candidates for appendectomy. The intraoperative findings, histology results, and outcome after appendectomy were analyzed.

Results

Three hundred nineteen patients presented with chronic pains of the RLQA of which 213 could be finally analyzed; their mean age was 15.3 years; 192 patients were females. They had pains for 2–8 years. Echography showed a heterogeneous lesion in the RLQA in 87% of the cases. The operative findings displayed adhesions and other signs of chronic inflammation in 182 cases. Pathological analysis frequently revealed fibrosis and lymphoplasmocytic infiltration indicative of chronic inflammation. Eighty-seven percent of the patients were cured by appendectomy.

Conclusions

There is a chronic process involving the appendix that occurs in the RLQA of patients with chronic pains, typically the adolescent female. Appendectomy usually solves the problem. The criteria for selection of candidates still need to be identified, but in the absence of laparoscopic facilities, we recommend appendectomy when no other cause for the pain has been identified.

### Unusual presentation of a familiar pathology: chronic appendicitis [^114JMkA1]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

We present a case of a man who experienced night sweats, abdominal pain and fever for over 3months, with incomplete response to broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. Although CT imaging was insufficient to identify the cause for his chronic abdominal pain, the abnormality of a 'misty mesentery' was crucial in guiding further investigation. The final diagnosis of chronic appendicitis was made through laparoscopic and pathological examination. This case highlights the utility of a collaborative diagnostic effort between disciplines. Chronic appendicitis can cause lingering abdominal pain. Early recognition and appropriate referral can save patients months and even years of unnecessary suffering.

### Endoscopic direct-vision appendicitis therapy for the treatment of chronic appendicitis with multiple appendicoliths [^115U7sbN]. Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Appendicoliths are considered as a well-established etiology factor in both acute appendicitis and chronic abdominal pain syndromes. While appendectomy remains definitive for acute appendicitis, emerging endoscopic strategies, especially natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) illuminate organ-preserving alternatives, particularly in complex cases where conventional approaches falter. Endoscopic retrograde appendicitis therapy (ERAT) is increasingly utilized in acute appendicitis therapy. However, it technically depends on fluoroscopic guidance and carries risks of perforation during blind cannulation of the appendiceal lumen with contrast catheters. Herein we present a case of multiple large appendicoliths with chronic obstruction successfully resolved through endoscopic direct-vision appendicitis therapy (EDAT) (Video 1).

A 28-year-old man presenting with a 1-year history of intermittent right lower quadrant dull pain, acutely exacerbated in the preceding week was admitted to our medical team. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed four calculi within the appendiceal lumen with the largest measuring 1.4 cm in maximal diameter (Fig. 1 a–c). The patient declined surgical intervention and had undergone conservative medical treatment with limited efficacy. We performed EDAT (Fig. 2 a–i), which enabled complete appendicolith extraction and resulted in immediate resolution of abdominal pain. Intravenous antibiotics were administered for 24 hours, and a semi-liquid diet was initiated on postoperative day 2 (POD 2). The patient was discharged on POD 3 without recurrence of symptoms.

### Chronic pain: what does It mean? A review on the use of the term chronic pain in clinical practice [^111BLWyG]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

The term "chronic pain", especially when used as label to indicate a pain condition viewed as a disease in itself, may also carry the risk of a delay in the diagnosis of the underlying pathology and inappropriate treatment. Tamburin et alreported a case of a middle-aged woman with well-controlled diabetes mellitus and a severe chronic pain (NRS ranging from 8 to 10/10) in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. After an accurate neurological investigation, the initial diagnosis of chronic abdominal pain has been replaced with that of neuropathic pain, due to thoracic radiculopathy and probable lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy, and the following corticosteroid therapy resulted in consistent pain reduction (NRS reduced to 2–3/10).

The use of the term "chronic pain" might result insidious in clinical settings, especially with patients dealing with pain lasting more than 3 months without known causes. Raffaeli et alnoted that patients with chronic non-cancer pain, compared to those with cancer pain, often fail to make sense of their pain, because they may have difficulties to understand that it is possible to have daily pain without any other disease causing it. A qualitative study, involving young people with chronic pain and their parents, found that "chronic pain" – as diagnostic label – may elicit uncertainty and was sometimes perceived as a diagnosis given when the biological cause of pain has not been identified, or when pain is not deemed "real", thus producing frictions within the patient–clinician relationship. In the same study, lacking evidence of physical causes, patients and their parents struggled to make sense of a diagnosis of "chronic pain". Moreover, several participants expressed concerns that a serious health condition (eg, cancer) could have been missed, which fuelled a relentless search for alternative diagnosis. In the field of pain, an unclear diagnostic label is found to be associated with negative clinical, psychological and social outcomes as well as with further uncertainty and treatment seeking, which may place an extra burden on health services and prevent patients from directing their attention to other aspects of life. Therefore, "chronic pain", as diagnostic label, could not facilitate the comprehension of the clinical condition. Furthermore, despite the patient recognizes long-standing pain as a more complex health problem, the term "chronic pain" might continue to reinforce a dualistic vision in family members, who, having likely experienced pain as a transient condition, may also stigmatize certain pain behaviors as a source of "social disruption": the sick role is legitimate only for a period of time.

### Imaging right lower quadrant pain: not always appendicitis [^116G2i4R]. Clinical Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Although acute appendicitis (AA) is one of the commonest causes of right lower quadrant abdominal pain (RLQP), there are numerous other conditions in the abdomen and pelvis that can simulate the clinical presentation of AA for which imaging is essential in detection. We discuss the approach to evaluation of patients presenting with acute onset RLQP and the choice of various imaging modalities that can be utilized. Although CT remains the workhorse in evaluation, US and MRI, given lack of radiation, play an important ancillary role, particularly in the pediatric and pregnant patients. We present a spectrum of conditions presenting with RLQP which we have classified systematically ranging from conditions affecting the bowel, mesentery/omentum/peritoneum, vasculature, urinary and reproductive systems to give the reader a checklist of conditions to consider when evaluating a case of RLQP.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: diagnostic accuracy study [^112Yc9Ju]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Application of CT after a negative or inconclusive ultrasonography result (strategy 5) had a higher sensitivity than the clinical diagnosis without imaging: 94% versus 88% (P < 0.001). This conditional strategy would result in a significantly lower number of missed urgent conditions compared with CT only: 6% versus 11%, with a higher sensitivity (P < 0.001) but a lower specificity (P < 0.001). An alternative conditional strategy with CT only after inconclusive ultrasonography (strategy 6) would further reduce use of CT (27% of patients) but would increase the proportion of missed urgent conditions from 6% to 15%.

Five hundred and twelve (50%) patients were older than 45, and 157 (15%) patients had a body mass index exceeding 30. Nine per cent of urgent conditions would be missed with a strategy in which imaging is based on body mass index (strategy 8) compared with 10% for the strategies based on age (strategy 7) or on both age and body mass index (strategy 9). The diagnostic accuracy of the strategy reflecting the American College of Radiology guidelines (10) was comparable to that of the CT only strategy. The use of ultrasonography for both pain in the right upper quadrant and pain in the right lower quadrant (strategy 11) would lead to 16% missed urgent conditions.

Exposure to radiation

Table 2shows use of ultrasonography and CT for each strategy. CT related exposure to radiation would vary between 56% and 81% for the strategies driven by patients' characteristics and between 65% and 95% for the strategies driven by location of pain. The second lowest use of CT (49%) would be achieved with the conditional CT strategy, the strategy that also had the highest sensitivity in detecting urgent diagnoses.

### A retroperitoneal femoral nerve schwannoma as a cause of chronic pelvic pain [^1112KJGc]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

This is a case report of pelvic pain caused by a large retroperitoneal femoral nerve schwannoma. A 31-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 2, was referred for surgical treatment of her chronic right lower quadrant pain. Laparoscopy revealed normal pelvic anatomy and a 7- x 5-cm mass overlying the right psoas muscle and involving the right femoral nerve. A combination of laparoscopic and laparotomy dissection allowed complete excision of the mass. Pathological analysis of the mass revealed a benign schwannoma of the femoral nerve sheath. Transient right femoral neuropathy complicated her postoperative course. Nongynecologic causes of pelvic pain are common and may include neurologically derived causes. Retroperitoneal schwannomas are uncommon and occur in about 0.5% of schwannomas. Complete surgical excision is recommended and results in an excellent cure rate.

Regarding medical management for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to management of chronic pain, KDIGO 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain an evaluation for chronic flank, abdominal, or lumbar pain in patients with ADPKD to rule out causes other than ADPKD, such as mechanical or spinal back pain or malignancy in older patients, or complications from ADPKD, such as chronic low-grade infection or stones.

### Chronic pelvic pain [^1147BJFD]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

As opposed to the satisfying solutions found in the management of acute pain, chronic pelvic pain can be a vexing problem for the patient and physician. Seldom is a single source or cause found, and nearly always the condition is influenced by the broader social and psychological context of the patient. In this article, we discuss the evaluation of chronic pelvic pain, often considering pain as the disease itself, and identify peripheral generators, which gynecologists can address to help reduce their contributions to symptoms.
