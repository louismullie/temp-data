## Question

Is it possible for IgG levels to be low during an infection?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether IgG levels can be low during an infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "low" IgG means in different clinical contexts. Then, I should verify evidence that IgG can be low at the time of acute infection across settings (sepsis, community-acquired pneumonia, severe viral illness). Next, I will examine mechanisms that could explain transient reductions. After that, I need to distinguish whether low IgG is a cause, an effect, or both. Finally, I should consider the prognostic and management implications and when to recheck or intervene, including thresholds for immunoglobulin replacement therapy and evaluation for secondary causes [^114LieuY] [^116qgGPa] [^116UgkiR].

> Let me first confirm definitions and thresholds. Normal adult total IgG is often ~7–16 g/L, but "clinically significant" hypogammaglobulinemia depends on context; many immunology sources regard < 4 g/L (400 mg/dL) as a high-risk threshold for infection and a common trigger for considering replacement in selected populations, whereas ICU studies of sepsis have used cut points around 6.1, 6.5, or 8.7 g/L to define "low" at presentation [^114rwH8r] [^114LieuY] [^116q48nw]. Wait, I should double-check that these thresholds are indeed applied differently by indication; yes, oncology/hematology or transplant populations may individualize decisions beyond a single IgG number, reinforcing that "low" is context-dependent [^1179LQKJ].

> Next, I should review direct evidence in sepsis. On the day of sepsis diagnosis, a systematic review found a median prevalence around 58% of critically ill adults had subnormal IgG by study-specific cutoffs, indicating that many patients manifest low IgG at the time of acute infection presentation; notably, a low IgG at diagnosis was not consistently associated with higher mortality in pooled analyses, suggesting low IgG may be an epiphenomenon or one part of a broader dysregulated host response rather than a standalone prognostic marker [^114LieuY]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — heterogeneity and low study quality temper confidence, but the point remains: yes, IgG can be low during active severe infection in ICU settings [^114LieuY].

> I will now examine community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). A population-based case-control study showed that at diagnosis, 42.7% of CAP cases had low immunoglobulins — predominantly total IgG and IgG2 — and a quarter remained low one month later, whereas about 23.6% normalized by convalescence, supporting that some reductions are transient around the infectious episode and some persist, potentially signaling underlying susceptibility or disease phenotype [^116qgGPa]. Wait, let me verify prognosis signals: lower immunoglobulins at presentation were more common in those requiring inpatient care, aligning with potential severity correlations in CAP cohorts [^116qgGPa].

> Now, severe viral respiratory infection. In 2009 H1N1, severe cases (ICU, respiratory support) had significantly lower total IgG, IgG1, and especially IgG2 compared with moderate cases; importantly, many survivors with IgG2 deficiency remained deficient at ~3 months, hinting at persistent subclass vulnerability rather than purely acute consumption or dilution effects [^115ewhSP]. Hmm, wait a minute — this suggests a mix of transient and persistent patterns depending on the host and the subclass involved [^115ewhSP].

> Let me consider immunosuppression-related settings because they illustrate the "low IgG during infection" encounter from a different angle. B-cell–directed therapies like ocrelizumab lower immunoglobulins over time; declines in IgG are associated with higher serious infection rates, and clinicians frequently meet patients with active infections and concomitant low IgG in this context, which can be both causal and concurrent [^1162yZP6]. Similarly, alemtuzumab-treated patients with IgG < 7 g/L demonstrated more sinopulmonary infections, again exemplifying how low IgG can be present when infections occur in immunosuppressed hosts [^116cCWkd]. I should confirm broader secondary hypogammaglobulinemia causes — transplant, malignancy, autoimmunity, protein loss syndromes — since these conditions often intersect with infection risk and measured low IgG during illness [^117KFWGh].

> But why would IgG be low during an acute infection? Let me think through mechanisms. First, consumption through opsonization and immune complex formation during severe infection may transiently lower circulating IgG, while capillary leak and extravasation in sepsis can redistribute IgG out of the intravascular space, and hemodilution from fluid resuscitation can acutely decrease measured concentrations, all contributing to apparent hypogammaglobulinemia at presentation [^114LieuY]. Second, critical illness–related immune dysregulation ("immunoparalysis") can suppress B-cell function and antibody synthesis, leading to reduced production that may normalize as the patient recovers, consistent with the convalescent normalization seen in a subset of CAP patients [^116qgGPa]. Third, renal or gastrointestinal protein loss (nephrotic syndrome, protein-losing enteropathy) can further depress IgG during illness, sometimes unmasked by the infection episode itself [^116UgkiR]. Finally, subclass-specific patterns (for example, IgG2 reduction linked to responses to polysaccharide-encapsulated bacteria) can modify risk even when total IgG is near-normal, as highlighted in severe H1N1 cohorts [^115ewhSP].

> Hold on, I should verify the directionality — cause versus effect. The relationship is bidirectional. On one hand, pre-existing low IgG or subclass deficiency predisposes to infection (primary antibody deficiencies, drug-induced hypogammaglobulinemia), so a low level measured during infection may reflect the underlying risk factor rather than an effect of the infection itself [^114rwH8r] [^1162yZP6]. On the other hand, acute infections like sepsis or CAP are associated with new-onset or transiently low IgG at presentation, with a subset normalizing on recovery, indicating that infection and its physiology can themselves depress measured levels in the short term [^114LieuY] [^116qgGPa]. I should double-check: both scenarios are supported, reinforcing the need to re-measure after convalescence before labeling a chronic deficiency [^116qgGPa].

> What about prognostic value — does low IgG during infection predict worse outcomes? At first glance, I almost concluded "low IgG invariably predicts worse outcomes". But wait, that's too strong; the sepsis meta-analysis did not show a consistent mortality signal for subnormal IgG at diagnosis, despite a high prevalence of low levels, so the prognostic role is mixed and likely context-dependent [^114LieuY]. Conversely, in CAP, lower immunoglobulins correlated with inpatient care need, suggesting severity association, and in H1N1, IgG2 deficiency independently associated with severe disease, supporting that particular subclasses may carry prognostic weight in some viral settings [^116qgGPa] [^115ewhSP]. Let me reconsider: overall, low IgG at infection onset can be a risk marker in some cohorts but is not universally predictive of mortality across all severe infections [^114LieuY].

> Next, I should review the practical clinical approach. I need to ensure timing and repeat testing are planned: if low IgG is found during an acute infection, recheck after recovery (for example, 4–8 weeks) to distinguish transient depression from persistent deficiency, and consider IgG subclasses if recurrent sinopulmonary infections or encapsulated organisms are involved, as subclass testing can refine diagnosis and guide management strategies [^115pf5Ex]. I should confirm evaluation for secondary causes — review drugs (anti-CD20s like ocrelizumab, cytotoxics), protein losses, hematologic disorders, and autoimmune disease — as part of the work-up when hypogammaglobulinemia persists [^116UgkiR] [^1162yZP6]. For patients who truly have ongoing susceptibility with low IgG, immunoglobulin replacement may be considered in selected settings (for example, IgG < 400 mg/dL or recurrent serious infections), but therapy should be individualized, monitored, and not seen as a panacea; optimizing antimicrobials and airway/physiotherapy remains essential [^116q48nw] [^1179LQKJ]. Hold on, I should verify immunotherapy monitoring: specialist follow-up and periodic IgG checks are standard to titrate to clinical outcomes rather than a single numeric target [^1179LQKJ].

> Bottom line — can IgG be low during an infection? Yes. Multiple lines of evidence show that total IgG and/or subclasses can be subnormal at the time of acute infection presentation across sepsis, CAP, and severe viral illness, sometimes normalizing with convalescence and sometimes persisting, especially when driven by underlying primary or secondary immunodeficiency or subclass patterns; thus, confirmation after recovery and context-aware interpretation are crucial for accurate diagnosis and management [^114LieuY] [^116qgGPa] [^115ewhSP] [^116UgkiR].

---

Yes, **IgG can be low during infection**, particularly with severe bacterial infections or sepsis [^114LieuY] and in patients with primary or secondary immunodeficiencies [^1162yZP6]. Low IgG during infection is often transient [^116qgGPa] — reflecting acute immune dysregulation, increased catabolism, or protein loss [^116UgkiR] — but persistent or profound hypogammaglobulinemia **suggests an underlying immunodeficiency** [^114GHXNU]. This increases susceptibility to recurrent or severe infections [^1162yZP6] and may warrant **immunoglobulin replacement therapy** [^116pKQr7] if levels remain low or infections recur.

---

## Mechanisms underlying low IgG during infection

Several **mechanisms** can contribute to low IgG during infection:

- **Acute immune dysregulation**: Severe infections (e.g. sepsis) can cause transient hypogammaglobulinemia due to immune dysregulation and increased catabolism [^114LieuY].

- **Protein loss**: Protein-losing enteropathies or nephrotic syndrome during infection can cause significant IgG loss [^116UgkiR].

- **Impaired antibody production**: Primary immunodeficiencies (e.g. CVID, XLA) or secondary immunodeficiencies (e.g. HIV, immunosuppressive therapy) can impair antibody production, leading to low IgG during infection [^114GHXNU] [^1162yZP6].

- **Increased consumption**: Immune complex formation and complement activation during infection can increase IgG consumption.

---

## Clinical significance of low IgG during infection

Low IgG during infection **increases susceptibility** to recurrent or severe infections, particularly bacterial infections [^1162yZP6]. If persistent or profound during infection, hypogammaglobulinemia may indicate an underlying primary or secondary immunodeficiency [^114GHXNU]. These findings influence management: low IgG levels may necessitate **immunoglobulin replacement therapy** when infections are recurrent or severe [^1179LQKJ].

---

## Clinical conditions associated with low IgG during infection

Several **clinical conditions** are associated with low IgG during infection:

| **Clinical condition** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Primary immunodeficiencies | - CVID <br/> - XLA <br/> - Hyper-IgM syndromes [^114rwH8r] [^114GHXNU] |
| Secondary immunodeficiencies | - HIV infection <br/> - Immunosuppressive therapy (e.g. rituximab, ocrelizumab) <br/> - Hematologic malignancies [^1162yZP6] |
| Protein-losing conditions | - Nephrotic syndrome <br/> - Protein-losing enteropathy [^116UgkiR] |
| Severe infections | - Sepsis <br/> - Severe bacterial infections [^114LieuY] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation of low IgG during infection

When low IgG is detected during infection, **comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is recommended**:

- **Confirmatory testing**: Repeat IgG measurement after infection resolution to determine if hypogammaglobulinemia is transient or persistent [^114GHXNU].

- **Assessment of other immunoglobulins**: Measure IgA and IgM levels to evaluate overall humoral immunity [^1174LTHG].

- **Evaluation of specific antibody responses**: Assess vaccine responses (e.g. pneumococcal, tetanus) to evaluate functional antibody production [^111NPump].

- **Investigation of underlying causes**: Evaluate for primary or secondary immunodeficiencies, protein-losing conditions, and other potential causes [^116UgkiR].

---

## Management strategies for low IgG during infection

Management of low IgG during infection **depends on the underlying cause** and clinical context:

- **Immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IgRT)**: Indicated for patients with persistent hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent or severe infections [^116q48nw].

- **Treatment of underlying conditions**: Address underlying immunodeficiencies, protein-losing conditions, or other causes of hypogammaglobulinemia [^117KFWGh].

- **Infection prevention strategies**: Vaccination, antibiotic prophylaxis, and infection control measures [^1179LQKJ].

---

## Prognostic implications of low IgG during infection

Persistent low IgG is associated with a **higher risk** of recurrent infections [^1162yZP6]. Persistent hypogammaglobulinemia may indicate or progress to chronic immunodeficiency [^114rwH8r]. Recurrent infections and chronic immunodeficiency can significantly affect quality of life and increase healthcare utilization.

---

IgG can be low during infection due to **acute immune dysregulation, protein loss, impaired antibody production, or increased consumption**. This transient or persistent hypogammaglobulinemia increases susceptibility to infections and may indicate an underlying immunodeficiency, necessitating **diagnostic evaluation** and management [^114LieuY] [^116UgkiR].

### Endogenous IgG hypogammaglobulinaemia in critically ill adults with sepsis: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^114LieuY]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Plasma immunoglobulin concentrations are acutely altered in critically ill patients with sepsis. However, the association between immunoglobulin levels on the day of sepsis diagnosis and subsequent mortality is inconsistent.

- **Methods**: Systematic review of studies that report immunoglobulin measurements and mortality among adults with sepsis managed in a critical care setting. Fixed and random effect meta-analyses were conducted using low IgG levels as primary exposure and acute mortality as the primary outcome. Both variables were used as defined in individual studies.

- **Results**: The prevalence of a low immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration on the day of sepsis diagnosis was variable [58.3% (IQR 38.4–65.5%)]. Three cut-off points (6.1, 6.5, and 8.7 g/L) were used to define the lower limit of IgG concentrations in the included studies. A subnormal IgG level on the day of sepsis diagnosis was not associated with an increased risk of death in adult patients with severe sepsis and/or septic shock by both fixed and random effect meta-analysis (OR [95% CI] 1.32 [0.93–1.87] and 1.48 [0.78–2.81], respectively).

- **Conclusions**: This systematic review identifies studies of limited quality reporting heterogeneous sepsis cohorts with varying lower limits of normal for IgG. Although our data suggest that a subnormal IgG measurement on the day of sepsis diagnosis does not identify a subgroup of patients with a higher risk of death, further studies are needed to confirm or refute this finding, and whether optimal cut-offs and time windows can be defined for IgG measurement.

### Sequencing the B cell receptor repertoires of antibody-deficient individuals with and without infection susceptibility [^114rwH8r]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). Low credibility.

Defense against infections is orchestrated by a complex immune system where every component has a task, and the quantitative or qualitative defect of a single component often contributes to a clinically apparent immunodeficiency. The most common form of inborn errors of immunity/primary immunodeficiency is antibody deficiencies, a phenotype mostly characterized by upper respiratory tract infections. Antibody deficiencies include agammaglobulinemia (no antibodies), hypogammaglobulinemia (not enough antibodies), IgG subclass deficiencies, and specific anti-PnPS (pneumococcal polysaccharide) deficiency, the latter presenting with pneumococcal infections. The combination of serum IgG levels and infection susceptibility is used to make the decision for, or against providing IgG-RT, as the immunoglobulin replacement preparations do not contain significant amounts of IgM or IgA. Hence, IgG-RT is not indicated for the treatment of selective IgA deficiency. The reduction of an IgG titer to 4 g/L has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of infection, though some patients with almost normal IgG levels may still present with pathological infection susceptibility. Conversely, some people with IgG levels of < 4 g/L show no apparent infection susceptibility, potentially because their immune system can respond to each challenge with high-quality acute naïve and memory IgG responses.

We approached this clinical conundrum with the question of whether the composition of the peripheral B cell receptor sequences and number/diversity of B c…

### Infants with low immunoglobulin levels: Isolated low IgA level vs other immunoglobulin abnormalities [^116bcZ8A]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

The International Union of Immunological Societies defined transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy as decreased IgG and IgA levels. Some others, however, include decreased IgA level alone. We compared infants with decreased levels of IgG and IgA, all isotypes, and IgA alone.

- **Objective**: To determine whether infants presenting with diminished IgA only differ clinically and in time of immunoglobulin recovery from those with decreased levels of IgG and IgA, or of all major isotypes.

- **Methods**: Eighty-seven term infants found to have immunoglobulin isotype(s) 2 or more standard deviations below the mean, normal antibody response, intact cellular immunity, and absence of other immunodeficiency syndrome features were evaluated between January 1, 1977, and December 31, 2008. Infants had decreased IgA level (group 1, n = 43), decreased IgA and IgG levels (group 2, n = 39), or low IgA, IgG, and IgM levels (group 3, n = 5).

- **Results**: Groups had similar histories. Immunoglobulins normalized in a similar percentage of all groups during infancy but earlier for group 1 (P = 0.005).

- **Conclusion**: Little reason exists to separate infants with isolated decreased IgA levels from those with decreased levels of IgA and IgG or all isotypes.

### A second look at secondary hypogammaglobulinemia [^117KFWGh]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). Low credibility.

Hypogammaglobulinemia is defined as a reduced immunoglobulin level, which can be either primary, due to inborn errors of immunity, or acquired in the setting of poor antibody production or increased antibody loss. Secondary hypogammaglobulinemia (SHG) should be considered in patients with a history of immunosuppressive therapy, transplant, protein loss syndromes, certain autoimmune conditions, and malignancies, as it can be associated with increased infectious risk. Appropriate history and lab-based screening in these populations can identify SHG, allowing treatment and close monitoring as appropriate. Ideally, treatment focuses on the control of the underlying condition or removal of iatrogenic causes of SHG. However, in many cases, treatment of the underlying condition does not reverse SHG, or immunosuppressive therapy cannot be discontinued without significant risk to the patient. For these patients, strategies for risk mitigation against infectious complications include vaccination, antibiotic prophylaxis, and immunoglobulin replacement therapy. This report aims to summarize the existing and emerging data in the evaluation and management of SHG and highlight areas that require further investigation.

### Alemtuzumab therapy changes immunoglobulin levels in peripheral blood and CSF [^116cCWkd]. Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

The ongoing reduction of IgG levels in peripheral blood seems to be of clinical relevance. Among our 38 patients, those with IgG values below 7 g/L showed a higher susceptibility to develop infections, such as pneumonia, sinusitis, and otitis. The more common infections, such as upper respiratory tract and urinary tract infections, were not related to reduced serum IgG levels. It has to be noted that we did not differentiate between mild hypogammaglobulinemia, defined as IgG 5 g/L, which appears to be tolerated in most subjects.

- **Frequency of different infections during alemtuzumab treatment**: Within our cohort, pneumonia, sinusitis, and otitis were observed much later following alemtuzumab compared with urinary tract infections and upper respiratory tract infections, which occurred early after infusions. This could indicate differences in underlying pathophysiology. Hypogammaglobulinemia is also known as a relevant risk factor for infections with cytomegalovirus (CMV). Recently, few case reports have described CMV infections.

### Laboratory clues to immunodeficiency; missed chances for early diagnosis [^114GHXNU]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Primary immunodeficiency is observed in an estimated one in 1200 people, while secondary immunodeficiency is becoming increasingly common, particularly with the use of immunosuppression, cancer therapies, and newer biological therapies such as rituximab. Delays in diagnosing immunodeficiency predictably lead to preventable organ damage. Examples of abnormal pathology tests that suggest immunodeficiency from all laboratory specialties are provided, where vigilant interpretation of abnormal results may prompt earlier diagnosis. If immunodeficiency is suspected, suggested directed testing could include measuring immunoglobulins, a lymphocyte count, and T-cell and B-cell subsets.

### Higher doses of subcutaneous IgG reduce resource utilization in patients with primary immunodeficiency [^1132y3X4]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

The objectives of primary immunodeficiency (PID) treatment continue to evolve. Successful treatment can no longer be measured solely by the degree to which serious bacterial infections are prevented. Other clinical and functional outcomes must be measured as well. The findings that we report here suggest that increasing the doses of IgG might produce improvements in such outcomes, at least in some patients with frequent infections.

As the agenda of treatment for PID patients moves forward beyond life-or-death interventions, the goals of IgG therapy may shift toward optimization of health state outcomes and the full achievement of health and a normal life. The higher-dose cohort in this comparison recorded improved indices of well-being compared to those treated with traditional doses of IgG. This study, despite its limitations, suggests that increasing the SCIG doses is associated with significantly fewer infections, days of hospitalization, days of antibiotic use, and days of missed activities, resulting in reduced resource utilization.

### Sequencing the B cell receptor repertoires of antibody-deficient individuals with and without infection susceptibility [^11543bN1]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). Low credibility.

Conversely, hypogammaglobulinemia patients who did not need IgG-RT had relatively expanded and antigen-experienced B cell repertoires that appear to be adapted to better overcome infection susceptibility. These patients revealed elevated gene usage of IGHV4–30–2, IGHV4–30–4, and IGHV4–31 compared to the patients in need of IgG-RT. An increase of IGHV4–30–2 and IGHV4–30–4 has been reported in WAS patients as well, demonstrating abnormalities of immune repertoire in both cohorts.

Another study on plasmablasts from patients with multiple sclerosis revealed a positive and negative employment of IGHV4–30 gene usage, suggesting other factors influencing autoreactive property, such as CDR3 length and charge, light chain pairing, or mutation accumulation. Two patients with primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (FCL) showed increased usage of the IGHV4–30 gene, indicating the relevance of pathological antigen epitopes in cutaneous lymphomagenesis.

Naïve and memory B cells from WAS patients showed increased IGHV4–31 gene usage, observed in our patients with no need for IgG-RT. The Simon et al. study reported an age-dependent deterioration of B-cell differentiation, possibly leading to an increased infection susceptibility and autoimmune manifestations. Similar observations have been reported in nodal marginal zone lymphomas and cerebrospinal fluid B cells of patients with multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, the synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, both with and without anti-glucose-6-phosphate isomerase antibodies, showed frequent IGHV4–31 gene usage.

### Monitoring, prophylaxis, and treatment of infections in patients with MM receiving bispecific antibody therapy: Consensus recommendations from an expert panel [^116q48nw]. Blood Cancer Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Recommendations for the management of hypogammaglobulinemia:

- **Monitoring**: As hypogammaglobulinemia is frequent in this patient population, particular attention to immunoglobulin (Ig) levels is recommended (level IIC). IgG and IgM serology tests for the diagnosis of past viral infections may be used routinely, but should be interpreted with caution in this population, as patients have often received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment, which may impact the results (level IIC). Patients may also have a false negative result in response to IgG and IgM serology tests due to failure to mount antibody responses to pathogens. A false negative IgG test can make it harder to reliably understand important past exposures in the population, such as CMV; therefore, it is important to test serological status at baseline. However, caution should be taken with baseline serology tests if a patient is negative for IgG CMV.

- **Treatment**: The expert panel discussed Ig replacement therapy for the following patients:
	- Patients whose IgG levels are < 400 mg/dl (level IIC)
	- Patients who have experienced ≥ 2 severe reinfections by encapsulated bacteria, regardless of IgG level (level IIC)
	- Patients with a life-threatening infection (level III)
	- Patients with documented bacterial infection with no or insufficient response to antibiotic therapy (level IIC)

The panel recommends monthly IVIG treatment for the duration of immunoparesis, and in the absence of life-threatening infectious manifestations, until Ig levels are ≥ 400 mg/dl (level IIC). Ig levels should be monitored monthly during Ig treatment (level IIC).

### Adequate patient's outcome achieved with short immunoglobulin replacement intervals in severe antibody deficiencies [^116NSaAm]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

The optimal immune globulin replacement dosages required over time to minimize infection risks in patients with primary antibody deficiencies are not definitely established. As with many interventions, there may be specific subgroups of patients who are more likely to benefit from treatment with higher or lower dosages. The aim of the study was to verify the efficacy of a rationale for individualized immune globulin utilization and to elucidate the effects of care on patient outcome.

- **Methods**: Single-centre interventional study on 108 patients with primary antibody deficiencies. The objective was to determine for each patient the best interval between immune globulin administrations in order to:
	- Keep IgG trough levels > 500 mg/dL,
	- Minimize major infections (pneumonias and infections requiring hospitalization),
	- Minimize adverse events (AE).

- **Results**: Ninety-eight per cent of patients achieved the objective of the study. Patients who had low switched memory B cells and low IgA serum levels and/or are affected by bronchiectasis and/or enteropathy and/or continued to experience adverse events despite pre-medications, achieved the study objective by shortening the administration intervals to 2 weeks or to 1 week without the need to increase the monthly cumulative immunoglobulin dosage and its relative cost. The adverse events were reduced by administering low Ig dosages in a single setting. Patients without risk factors achieved the study objective with immune globulin replacement administered with the widely used interval of 3 or 4 weeks.

### Serum immunoglobulin levels in group E of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Insights for clinical management and immunoglobulin therapy strategies [^113TNSvt]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

The study found that serum IgG and IgM concentrations are notably reduced in COPD patients compared to healthy individuals, with particularly low levels of IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses. Conversely, serum IgA levels were significantly higher in COPD patients compared to normal controls. However, there was no significant association between Ig concentrations, especially serum IgG deficiency and its subclasses, with the frequency and risk of exacerbations during a 12-month longitudinal follow-up. The study suggests exercising extreme caution when considering immunoglobulin therapy in COPD treatment. Immunoglobulin therapy may be considered in severe COPD exacerbations with clear evidence of respiratory infection.

### Low immunoglobulin E flags two distinct types of immune dysregulation [^115Dmz7b]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

During the last two decades, hyper-immunoglobulin (Ig)E syndromes have been characterized clinically and molecularly in patients with genetically determined primary immunodeficiencies. However, the detection of low IgE levels, defined here as below the detection limit in the routine clinical immunology laboratory, has received little attention. We analyzed the association of serum IgA, IgM, and IgG levels (including IgG subclasses) with low, normal, or high serum IgE levels in patients evaluated in a single-center outpatient immunodeficiency and allergy clinic.

The correlation of serum IgE levels with IgG subclasses depended on the clinical phenotype. In patients with immunodeficiencies, IgE correlated with IgG2 and IgG4 but not with IgG3. In contrast, in patients referred for signs of allergy, IgE correlated with IgG3 but not with IgG2. A low IgE result was associated with low IgG3 and IgG4 in allergy referrals, while immunodeficiency referrals with a low IgE result had significantly lower IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 levels.

Hierarchical clustering of non-IgE immunoglobulin profiles (IgM, IgA, IgG, IgG1–4) validated that non-IgE immunoglobulin levels predict the clinic referral, i.e. phenotype, of low-IgE patients. These results suggest a guide for the clinical management of patients with low serum IgE levels.

### Are immunoglobulin concentrations associated with the body composition of adolescents [^112UeyKu]. Human Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to analyze the association between serum concentrations of immunoglobulins (Ig) A, G, and M and the body composition of adolescents from Mexico. Informed consent was obtained from parents, and assent was obtained from the adolescents for the evaluation of 125 adolescents from the capital city of Toluca and the adjacent semiurban county of Lerma de Villada. Height, weight, and waist and hip circumference were measured by trained personnel. Body mass index and waist:hip ratio were calculated from these measurements, whereas body fat (BF) was calculated from tricipital and subscapular skinfolds and measured by bioelectrical impedance. Serum concentrations of Ig were determined by nephelometry. Data were analyzed by independent samples t-test and Pearson correlations.

Subjects were mainly females (71.2%), with a mean age of 16.8 years (± 0.8). No differences were reported in all indicators by weight or BF between genders. Female participants had higher Ig concentrations than males (IgG t = 2.24, p = 0.027; IgA t = 2.05, p = 0.043; IgM t = 4.49, p < 0.001). Positive correlations were reported for IgA and IgM with tricipital skinfold (r = 0.192, p = 0.041 and r = 0.221, p = 0.018, respectively) and for total BF by bioimpedance (r = 0.243, p = 0.009). Ig concentrations do not seem to be affected by overweight, obesity, or excessive or central BF in adolescents.

### The clinical utility of measuring IgG subclass immunoglobulins during immunological investigation for suspected primary antibody deficiencies [^1174LTHG]. Laboratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Differentiating individuals with reinfections (RIs) due to a compromised immune system from those whose immune systems operate at the edge of normal function can be challenging, particularly in pediatric age groups. Normal pediatric populations may experience numerous respiratory infections in a single year. Additionally, it is crucial to differentiate between individuals with transient immune deficiencies that may resolve over time and those with more permanent deficiencies. Detailed immunological analyses can assist in ensuring early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, which is imperative due to the high risk of RIs causing irreversible organ damage.

The measurement of IgG subclass antibodies (IgGSc) is included in various protocols and guidelines for investigating individuals presenting with RIs, lung diseases, and strong suspicion of an antibody deficiency. These analyses are also helpful in monitoring transient versus permanent antibody deficiencies, assessing the progression of mild immunodeficiencies into more severe forms, and supporting some treatment decisions.

IgGSc deficiency (IgGScD) is clinically and genetically heterogeneous and may coexist with abnormal expression of more than one subclass antibody. Individuals with IgGScD may present with a combination of frequent or severe bacterial infections.

### Serum immunoglobulin levels in group E of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Insights for clinical management and immunoglobulin therapy strategies [^1123UH8B]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

The role of defective adaptive immunity and low serum IgG concentration is well established in CVID patients suffering from recurrent pneumonia and respiratory tract complications. It has also been shown that patients with milder forms of hypogammaglobulinemia may suffer from respiratory infections. Although these patients benefit from IgG replacement therapy, they may remain fully asymptomatic for years. Early diagnosis and consideration of IgG replacement therapy is believed to be beneficial. Not only low but even high serum IgG concentrations were associated with respiratory infection burden. Elevated serum IgG in older individuals may also indicate risk of pneumonia-related mortality and recurrent pneumonia, although mechanisms are incompletely described.

In a retrospective analysis by Cowan et al. (2015), involving 14 cases of COPD patients with serum antibody deficiency who underwent antibody replacement therapy, the authors reported a reduction in the frequency of moderate and severe exacerbations. This suggests that antibody replacement therapy may be beneficial in managing COPD patients with serum antibody deficiency, potentially mitigating the recurrence of exacerbations and improving disease outcomes.

In a study by Bermejo Martin et al. (2014), the association between serum Ig deficiency and death due to infection was investigated in 172 patients. The findings revealed that concomitant deficiencies in IgG1, IgM, and IgA were associated with an increased risk of death in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. These results suggest that supplementing exogenous antibodies may be a critical consideration for improving clinical outcomes in these patients.

### Ocrevus zunovo [^111RNdm4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Ocrelizumab decreased total immunoglobulin levels, with the greatest decline seen in IgM levels; however, a decrease in IgG levels was associated with an increased rate of serious infections.

	- In the active-controlled (RMS) trials (Study 1 and Study 2), the proportion of patients at baseline reporting IgG, IgA, and IgM below the lower limit of normal (LLN) in patients treated with intravenous ocrelizumab was 0.5%, 1.5%, and 0.1%, respectively. Following treatment, the proportion of patients treated with intravenous ocrelizumab reporting IgG, IgA, and IgM below the LLN at 96 weeks was 1.5%, 2.4%, and 16.5%, respectively.

	- In the placebo-controlled (PPMS) trial (Study 3), the proportion of patients at baseline reporting IgG, IgA, and IgM below the LLN in patients treated with intravenous ocrelizumab was 0.0%, 0.2%, and 0.2%, respectively. Following treatment, the proportion of patients treated with intravenous ocrelizumab reporting IgG, IgA, and IgM below the LLN at 120 weeks was 1.1%, 0.5%, and 15.5%, respectively.

	- The pooled data of intravenous ocrelizumab clinical studies (RMS and PPMS) and their open-label extensions (up to approximately 7 years of exposure) have shown an association between decreased levels of IgG and increased rates of serious infections. The type, severity, latency, duration, and outcome of serious infections observed during episodes of immunoglobulins below LLN were consistent with the overall serious infections observed in patients treated with intravenous ocrelizumab.

- **Decreased neutrophil levels**: The information for this section was incomplete and thus has been omitted.

### Acquired low immunoglobulin levels and risk of clinically relevant infection in adult patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: a cohort study [^11541vco]. Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Infection is a leading cause of death in the SLE population. Low immunoglobulin levels might be a potential risk factor for infection. We aimed to assess whether acquired low levels of any type of immunoglobulin increase the risk of clinically relevant infection in adult patients with SLE.

We compared adult SLE patients who had acquired any low immunoglobulin levels (IgA, IgM, or IgG) for 2 years with patients with normal or high levels concerning clinically relevant infection (defined as infections requiring intravenous or oral antibiotics) in a prospective cohort study. Group balance was achieved using propensity score adjustment, matching, and inverse probability weighting. The primary analysis was time to event using Cox-regression modeling adjusting for potential confounders. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine several exposure and outcome definitions.

Patients with hypogammaglobulinemia had longer disease duration, more lupus nephritis history, higher proteinuria, and more accumulated damage. Low IgA level was associated with increased risk of clinically relevant infection [hazard ratio (HR): 2.24, 95% CI: 1.61, 3.12], while low IgG (HR: 1.15, 95% CI: 0.84, 1.59) or low IgM (HR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.73, 1.23) was not. Low immunoglobulin recovery in the first year was 2.5% (11), second year 8.2% (36), third year 10.1% (44), and fourth year 18.4% (80), and 60% (263) of acquired hypogammaglobulinemia recovered over 4 years.

The majority of acquired hypogammaglobulinemia in adult patients with SLE is transient. Only low acquired Ig levels were significantly associated with an increased risk of clinically relevant infection.

### Novel variant of common variable immunodeficiency [^112uRpBN]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

A 57-year-old woman with frequent respiratory infections was initially diagnosed with IgG subclass deficiency based on low levels of IgG subclasses 2 and 3. Three years later, she developed an IgA deficiency as well. Despite having a normal total IgG level, she does not meet the criteria for common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). This case may represent a variant of CVID and highlights the importance of estimating immunoglobulin subclasses in patients with suspected immunodeficiency. She is being treated with rotational antibiotics for the first 10 days of every month, monthly intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusions, and osteopathic manipulation one to two times per month. On this regimen, although she has had several viral respiratory infections, she has avoided further hospitalization for more than a year.

### Assessment of low immunoglobulin levels and clinical manifestations in patients with mastocytosis [^1179GVaY]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2023). Low credibility.

Patients with a low IgG level alone or with low IgA or IgM levels have been reported to be susceptible to respiratory tract infections and sinusitis. Patients diagnosed with CVID have a higher prevalence of autoimmune diseases and lymphoid malignancies. Mastocytosis is a myeloproliferative disease, not typically associated with autoimmune disease or frequent infections.

- **Objective**: We sought to determine the distribution of immunoglobulins in children and adults with mastocytosis and evaluate the impact of low immunoglobulins on the clinical management of these patients.

- **Methods**: We performed a 10-year retrospective analysis on 320 adult and pediatric patients with mastocytosis for immunoglobulins using an electronic medical query. We identified 25 adults and 9 children with one or more low immunoglobulins. Patient records were examined for a history of infections and autoimmune disorders.

- **Results**: Serum immunoglobulins in children and adults with mastocytosis fell within the normal range. Among patients with low IgG levels alone or with low IgM and/or IgA, 20% had a history of infections, and 20% of adults had autoimmune disorders. The most common infection was otitis media (OM).

- **Conclusion**: Patients with mastocytosis typically have normal immunoglobulins. With few exceptions, those with low immunoglobulins did not have frequent infections or autoimmune diseases. This data supports the conclusion that routine determination of immunoglobulins in patients with mastocytosis is not required and should be reserved for patients with specific clinical conditions.

### Assessment of low immunoglobulin levels and clinical manifestations in patients with mastocytosis [^1131AmD7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). Low credibility.

Patients with a low IgG level alone or with low IgA or IgM levels are reported to be susceptible to respiratory tract infections and sinusitis. Patients diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency have a higher prevalence of autoimmune diseases and lymphoid malignancies. Mastocytosis is a myeloproliferative disease that is not typically associated with autoimmune disease or frequent infections.

- **Objective**: We sought to determine the distribution of immunoglobulin levels in children and adults with mastocytosis, as well as to evaluate the impact of low immunoglobulin levels on the clinical management of patients with mastocytosis.

- **Methods**: We performed a 10-year retrospective analysis on 320 adult and pediatric patients with mastocytosis, assessing immunoglobulin levels using an electronic medical query. We identified 25 adults and 9 children with one or more low immunoglobulin levels. Patient records were examined for a history of infections and autoimmune disorders.

- **Results**: Serum immunoglobulin levels in children and adults with mastocytosis fell within a normal range. Of the patients with low IgG levels alone or with low IgM and/or IgA levels, 20% had a history of infections and 20% of adults had autoimmune disorders. The most common infection was otitis media.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with mastocytosis typically have normal immunoglobulin levels. With few exceptions, those with low immunoglobulin levels did not have frequent infections or autoimmune diseases. These data support the conclusion that routine determination of immunoglobulin levels may not be necessary for patients with mastocytosis.

### Antibody tests for identification of current and past infection with SARS-CoV-2 [^113cZBxa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

It is important to note that these estimates are based on pooling multiple cross-sectional studies and not on tracking the same groups of participants over time or even using the same tests. The reasons why individuals are included at some particular time points and not at others are mostly not reported.

Estimates of sensitivity beyond three weeks are based on smaller sample sizes, with a maximum of 12 studies contributing data in weeks 4 and 5, and only four studies providing any follow-up information beyond week 5. Estimates for IgA and total antibodies are based on fewer than 100 samples/participants, and we will not comment upon them further. In weeks 4 and 5, pooled sensitivities of IgG were 80.3% (95% CI 72.4 to 86.4); IgM were 68.1% (95% CI 55.0 to 78.9); and for IgG/IgM were 96.0% (95% CI 90.6 to 98.3).

The data beyond week 5 gave sensitivity estimates of 86.7% (95% CI 79.6 to 91.7; IgG), 53.9% (95% CI 38.4 to 68.6; IgM), and 77.7% (95% CI 66.0 to 86.2; IgG/IgM). The expected decline in the sensitivity of IgM is evident.

- **Overall specificity**: We estimated antibody test specificity from 35 studies. Specificity estimates for all studies are presented in Appendix 11 for IgG, IgM, IgG/IgM, IgA, total antibodies, and IgA/IgG. Results pooled across all studies are in Table 4 and show specificity exceeding 98% for all antibody types, with precise estimates (confidence intervals up to 2 percentage points wide), particularly for IgG, IgM, total antibodies, and IgG/IgM, where estimates are based on several thousand non-COVID samples.

### Early appearance of neutralizing immunoglobulin G3 antibodies is associated with chikungunya virus clearance and long-term clinical protection [^114ppjuh]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and related arboviruses have been responsible for large epidemic outbreaks with serious economic and social impact. Although infected individuals clear the virus from the blood, some develop debilitating and prolonged arthralgia.

- **Methods**: We investigated specificity and strength of antibody responses in a longitudinal study on CHIKV-infected patients and analyzed their association with viral load, cytokine profile, and severity.

- **Results**: We found that CHIKV-specific response is dominated by immunoglobulin G3 (IgG3) antibodies. The antibodies were neutralizing, and patients with high viremia rapidly developed high levels of anti-CHIKV antibodies of this specific isotype. Although these patients endured a more severe disease progression during the acute viremic phase, they cleared the virus faster and did not experience persistent arthralgia. However, significant persistent arthralgia was observed in patients with low viremia who developed IgG3 at a later stage.

- **Conclusions**: Absence of early CHIKV-specific IgG3 may therefore serve as a specific marker of patients with increased risk of disease.

### Immune response against and translation to therapy [^114Bs7Lc]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

The role of antibodies in immune response is critical. Conceivably, immunoglobulins IgA, IgG, and IgM may protect against Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Since IgM antibodies play a role in the initial immune response and have a lower antigen affinity, research evaluating IgM responses has been limited. A retrospective study measuring serial IgM responses to CDI concluded that IgM levels against both toxin A and toxin B were lower in patients with recurrent CDI compared to patients with an initial infection.

- **Immunoglobulin A response against C. difficile**: IgA is an antibody widely secreted across mucosal surfaces. Serum IgA exists as a monomer and lacks a secretory component, enabling it to bind to myeloid cells, whereas secretory IgA exists as a dimer produced by plasma cells in the lamina propria. It is taken up into the cell via endocytosis, where it passes through before being secreted onto the mucosal surface. The production of secretory IgA against specific mucosal antigens depends on sampling by M cells, dendritic cells, T-cell activation, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Given its crucial role in maintaining mucosal immunity, it is expected to provide substantial protection against CDI. Two studies showed that low total fecal IgA levels and low total colonic IgA-producing cells are associated not only with prolonged CDI symptoms but also with higher rates of recurrence.

- **Immunoglobulin G response against C. difficile**: Higher IgG levels in response to colonization are thought to be protective against the development of CDI. It has been demonstrated that serum IgG levels in response to colonization are a critical factor in immune defense.

### Premature ageing of the immune system relates to increased anti-lymphocyte antibodies (ALA) after an immunization in HIV-1-infected and kidney-transplanted patients [^1134KYVt]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Low-affinity immunoglobulin (Ig)G with potential autoreactivity to lymphocytes and hypergammaglobulinaemia have been described previously in HIV-1-infected patients. Whether such antibodies increase after challenging the immune system, for example with an immunization, is not known. In the present study, the modulation of antibodies with low affinity and potential autoreactivity was evaluated after the 2012–13 seasonal flu vaccination with a simple empirical laboratory test measuring the titres of anti-lymphocyte antibodies (ALA) in two different models of secondary immunodeficiency: HIV-1 vertically infected patients (HIV) and patients treated with immunosuppressive therapies after kidney transplantation (KT) compared to healthy individuals (HC).

In parallel, the activation status of B cells and their degree of immune senescence was evaluated by measuring the B cell interleukin (IL)-21R expression/plasma IL-21 levels and the frequencies of mature-activated (MA) and double-negative (DN) B cells. A significant increase of ALA titres was observed after vaccination in HIV and KT but not in HC, and this correlated directly with the frequencies of both MA and DN and inversely with the B cell IL-21R expression. This suggests that the quality of an immune response triggered by flu vaccination in HIV and KT may depend upon the activation status of B cells and on their degree of immune senescence. Further investigations are needed to verify whether high frequencies of MA and DN may also relate to increased autoimmunity after immunization in high-risk populations.

### Intravenous immunoglobulin for preventing infection in preterm and/or low birth weight infants [^112gCoHT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Nosocomial infections continue to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among preterm and/or low birth weight (LBW) infants. Preterm infants are deficient in immunoglobulin G (IgG); therefore, administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may have the potential of preventing or altering the course of nosocomial infections.

- **Objectives**: To use systematic review/meta-analytical techniques to determine whether IVIG administration (compared with placebo or no intervention) to preterm (< 37 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) at birth) or LBW (< 2500 g birth weight) infants or both is effective and safe in preventing nosocomial infection.

- **Search methods**: For this update, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and PAS Abstracts2view were searched in May 2013.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which a group of participants to whom IVIG was given was compared with a control group that received a placebo or no intervention for preterm (< 37 weeks' gestational age) and/or LBW (< 2500 g) infants. Studies that were primarily designed to assess the effect of IVIG on humoral immune markers were excluded, as were studies in which the follow-up period was one week or less.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data collection and analysis were performed in accordance with the methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group.

- **Main results**: Nineteen studies enrolling approximately 5000 preterm and/or LBW infants met inclusion criteria. No new trials were identified in May 2013.

### The clinical utility of measuring IgG subclass immunoglobulins during immunological investigation for suspected primary antibody deficiencies [^115cJms5]. Laboratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Measurement of IgG subclass concentrations is a standard laboratory test conducted as part of a panel to investigate suspected antibody deficiencies. This assessment is clinically important when total IgG is within the normal age-specific reference range. Measuring IgG subclasses is useful for diagnosing IgG subclass deficiency, aiding the diagnosis of specific antibody deficiency, supporting the diagnosis of common variable immunodeficiency, and for risk stratification of patients with low IgA. Additionally, measuring IgG subclasses may assist in determining a revaccination strategy for patients and support patient management. Under certain circumstances, IgG subclass measurement may be used to monitor a patient's humoral immune system. This review discusses the utility of measuring IgG subclass concentrations.

### The clinical utility of measuring IgG subclass immunoglobulins during immunological investigation for suspected primary antibody deficiencies [^111An33F]. Laboratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

A challenging issue for the clinician is whether the clinical symptoms presented are the result of a slow maturing immune system or an underlying immune deficiency. Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy (THI) is an antibody deficiency occurring in the first years of life, characterized by a delay in immunoglobulin production that spontaneously recovers in early infancy. Only those patients whose clinical symptoms have resolved and IgG concentrations have normalized after the age of 4 years have definitive THI. The diagnosis is made a posteriori.

Routine measurement and normalization of IgG subclass immunoglobulins may differentiate those who have a transient immunodeficiency from those who may have a more persistent polyclonal immunodeficiency.

During the follow-up of 24 pediatric patients with IgG subclass deficiencies over 40 months, 25% had no further recurrent infections, which correlated with IgG subclass normalization in all individuals tested. Kutukculer and colleagues reported that 67% of pediatric patients with low IgA and IgG subclass deficiencies and 30% of pediatric patients with isolated IgG subclass deficiencies will normalize to age-specific normal concentrations. It has been reported that the mean age for normalization of IgG subclass concentrations in pediatric patients was between 4 and 6 years, and that low IgG2 concentrations may be more challenging to normalize, signifying a more permanent antibody deficiency.

### Association between severe pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus infection and immunoglobulin G(2) subclass deficiency [^115ewhSP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Severe pandemic 2009 influenza A virus (H1N1) infection is associated with risk factors that include pregnancy, obesity, and immunosuppression. After identification of immunoglobulin G(2) (IgG(2)) deficiency in one severe case, we assessed IgG subclass levels in a cohort of patients with H1N1 infection.

- **Methods**: Patient features, including levels of serum IgG and IgG subclasses, were assessed in patients with acute severe H1N1 infection (defined as infection requiring respiratory support in an intensive care unit), patients with moderate H1N1 infection (defined as inpatients not hospitalized in an intensive care unit), and a random sample of healthy pregnant women.

- **Results**: Among the 39 patients with H1N1 infection (19 with severe infection, 7 of whom were pregnant; 20 with moderate infection, 2 of whom were pregnant), hypoalbuminemia (P < .001), anemia (P < .001), and low levels of total IgG (P = 0.01), IgG(1) (P = 0.022), and IgG(2) (15 of 19 vs. 5 of 20; p = 0.001; mean value ± standard deviation [SD], 1.8 ± 1.7 g/L vs. 3.4 ± 1.4 g/L; p = 0.003) were all statistically significantly associated with severe H1N1 infection, but only hypoalbuminemia (P = 0.02) and low mean IgG(2) levels (P = 0.043) remained significant after multivariate analysis. Follow-up of 15 (79%) surviving IgG(2)-deficient patients at a mean (± SD) of 90 ± 23 days (R, 38–126) after the initial acute specimen was obtained found that hypoalbuminemia had resolved in most cases, but 11 (73%) of 15 patients remained IgG(2) deficient. Among 17 healthy pregnant control subjects, mildly low IgG(1) and

### Sequencing the B cell receptor repertoires of antibody-deficient individuals with and without infection susceptibility [^111NPump]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). Low credibility.

The decision to treat hypogammaglobulinemia patients with IgG-RT can be challenging because both IgG levels and infection susceptibility vary among patients. IgG levels do not always predict a patient's infection susceptibility, and in some cases, IgG-RT is recommended for patients with asymptomatic hypogammaglobulinemia due to the potential risk of severe infections. Furthermore, both symptomatic and asymptomatic hypogammaglobulinemia patients can respond well to tetanus vaccines, while the diphtheria response is often impaired. Indeed, most patients in this study had a positive response to the tetanus vaccine before IgG-RT started for those who needed it, while many did not respond to diphtheria vaccines. In addition, 8 out of 9 patients who did not need IgG-RT and were vaccinated with pneumococcal polysaccharides had a positive response, while only 1 out of 4 patients who needed IgG-RT responded.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for infection-related glomerulonephritis, more specifically with respect to laboratory tests, KDIGO 2021 guidelines recommend to assess for low complement (C3, C4), RF, cryoglobulins, and factor B antibody levels in patients with suspected infection-related glomerulonephritis.

### Immunoglobulin G subclass levels and antibody responses to the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) monovalent vaccine among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and HIV-uninfected adults [^113amNSM]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Immunoglobulin (Ig) G levels are important for antibody vaccine responses, and IgG subclass deficiencies have been associated with severe 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infections. Studies have demonstrated variations in immune responses to the H1N1 vaccine; however, the etiology of this variation is unknown. We determined the associations between pre-vaccination overall and influenza-specific IgG subclass levels and 2009 H1N1-specific antibody responses post-vaccination (robust versus poor at day 28), stratified by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status.

Logistic regression models were utilized to evaluate whether pre-vaccination IgG subclass levels were associated with the antibody response generated post-vaccination. We evaluated 48 participants as part of a clinical study, stratified by robust versus poor post-vaccination immune responses. Participants had a median age of 35 years; 92% were male, and 44% were Caucasian. HIV-infected adults had a median CD4 count of 669 cells/mm³, and 79% were receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy. HIV-infected participants were more likely to have IgG2 deficiency (< 240 mg/dl) than HIV-uninfected individuals (62% versus 4%, P < 0.001). No association of pre-vaccination IgG subclass levels (total or influenza-specific) and the antibody response generated by H1N1 vaccination in either group was found.

In summary, pre-vaccination IgG subclass levels did not correlate with the ability to develop robust antibody responses to the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) monovalent vaccine. IgG2 deficiencies were common among HIV-infected individuals but did not correlate with the ability to develop an antibody response.

### Serum immunoglobulin levels in group E of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Insights for clinical management and immunoglobulin therapy strategies [^116gPmqF]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Antibodies are crucial components of the body's adaptive immune system, providing defense against pathogens. Complete or partial deficiency in these antibody classes can increase the risk of various infectious diseases. Among these, IgG holds particular importance, constituting 70–80% of total serum antibodies and serving as a primary defense mechanism against extracellular threats. IgG is further divided into four subclasses, each with distinct roles in immune defense. IgG1 is primarily involved in combating protein-derived antigens, while IgG2 contributes to resistance against microbes with polysaccharide coatings. IgG3 plays a critical role in the immune response against respiratory viruses, and IgG4 is particularly important in fighting respiratory infections. Indeed, it is crucial to emphasize that serum antibody deficiency doesn't always equate to immunodeficiency. Even if an individual has slightly reduced total antibody levels, their body may still be capable of mounting a specific immune response tailored to combat particular pathogens. This highlights the complexity of the immune system, where various factors beyond serum antibody levels contribute to overall immunity and defense against infections.

During the longitudinal follow-up spanning 12 months, we observed that the group with low serum IgG levels experienced a higher frequency of exacerbations per year compared to the normal group (3.4 ± 1.5 vs. 2.9 ± 1). Similarly, the group with high serum IgE levels also had exacerbations occurring more frequently than the normal group (3.2 ± 1.1 vs. 2.9 ± 1). However…

### British Society for Immunology and United Kingdom Primary Immunodeficiency Network (UKPIN) consensus guideline for the management of immunoglobulin replacement therapy [^1179LQKJ]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

There was strong support for statements regarding the need to optimize antibiotic and physical therapies in patients who continue to suffer from infections despite IgRT. This reflects the reality that there are a large number of factors that predispose to infection, and immunoglobulin therapy is by no means a panacea. Physical therapies, including patient exertion and exercise, physiotherapy techniques, and sputum clearance with saline nebulizers, can all help to dramatically reduce infections. Knowledge of the organisms causing infections is also vital to optimize antibiotic choices for treatment and prophylaxis.

Where dose adjustments are implemented, there was consensus that this should be for a trial period with a return to previous dosing levels if the goals of treatment are not met. A 6-month period was suggested in the statement, although comments highlighted the need to individualize this and the role of seasonal factors in interpreting the response to the intervention, and this was supported by patient groups. Dose adjustments should always take into account vial size to avoid waste.

- **Administration, clinical and blood test monitoring**:

- **Recommendation 33**: The following should be tested at a minimum of every six months: IgG levels (trough for IV, any time for SC), full blood count, liver function test, and U&E test.

- **Recommendation 34**: Patients with primary immunodeficiency who are established on IgRT and are stable with no complications should be monitored at an immunology specialist clinic at least every six months.

### Antibody tests for identification of current and past infection with SARS-CoV-2 [^116Qrn7D]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

We anticipated that studies would use a range of reference standards to define both the presence and absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection but were unclear at the start of the review exactly what methods would be encountered. For the QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies; Whiting 2011) assessment, we categorized each method of defining COVID-19 cases according to the risk of bias — the chances that it would misclassify COVID-19 participants as non-COVID-19 — and whether it defined COVID-19 in an appropriate way that reflected cases encountered in practice. Likewise, we considered the risk of bias in definitions of non-COVID-19, and whether the definition reflected those who, in practice, would be tested.

### The clinical utility of measuring IgG subclass immunoglobulins during immunological investigation for suspected primary antibody deficiencies [^115pf5Ex]. Laboratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Reference ranges for pediatric age groups and adult populations have been developed, as well as some study-specific ranges. The diagnosis of IgGScD requires one or more IgGSc concentrations to be less than the fifth percentile in the presence of normal concentrations of IgG, IgA, and IgM. In patients older than 15 years of age, it has been reported that the median IgG3 concentration in patients with IgG3 subclass antibodies deficiency (IgG3ScD) is approximately 0.19 g/L (range 0.10–0.34) and less than 0.10 to 0.24 g/L in patients with chronic sinusitis. Additionally, IgG2 concentrations were less than 0.25 g/L in patients with low IgA and IgG2 subclass antibodies deficiency (IgG2ScD). All abnormal IgGSc concentrations should be confirmed with at least one additional measurement one month after the first test. IgGScD may be due to abnormal concentrations of one IgGSc only or different combinations of any of the four IgGSc.

Knowledge of IgGSc concentrations is clinically important when total IgG, IgA, and IgM concentrations are within their normal ranges. In individuals with respiratory infections (RI), a high percentage may have normal IgG concentrations.

### Cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin G titers do not predict reactivation risk in immunocompetent hosts [^1172dfCS]. Journal of Medical Virology (2019). Low credibility.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation occurs in roughly one-third of immunocompetent patients during critical illness and is associated with worse outcomes. These outcomes have prompted consideration of early antiviral prophylaxis, but two-thirds of patients would receive unnecessary treatment. Tissue viral load has been associated with the risk of reactivation in murine models, and recent work has suggested a relationship between immune responses to CMV and underlying viral load. We, therefore, sought to confirm the hypothesis that serum CMV-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) correlates with tissue viral load and might be used to predict the risk of reactivation during critical illness.

We confirm that there is a good correlation between tissue viral load and serum CMV-specific IgG after laboratory infection of inbred mice. Furthermore, we show that naturally infected outbred hosts have variable tissue viral DNA loads that do not correlate well with serum IgG. Perhaps as a consequence, CMV-specific IgG was not predictive of reactivation events in immunocompetent humans. When reactivation did occur, those with the lowest IgG levels had longer durations of reactivation, but IgG quartiles were not associated with differing peak DNAemia. Together, our data suggest that CMV-specific IgG titers diverge from tissue viral loads in outbred immunocompetent hosts, and their importance for the control of reactivation events remains unclear.

### Update on the use of immunoglobulin in human disease: A review of evidence [^116pKQr7]. Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Human immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous or subcutaneous administration are the cornerstone of treatment in patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases affecting the humoral immune system. Intravenous preparations also have significant applications in the treatment of other diseases, some of which lack acceptable treatment alternatives. We provide an update on the evidence-based guideline for immunoglobulin therapy, last published in 2006. Given the potential risks and inherent scarcity of human immunoglobulin, careful consideration of its indications and administration is warranted.

### Immunoglobulin deficiencies and susceptibility to infection among homozygotes and heterozygotes for C2 deficiency [^115LBnCd]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

About 25% of C2-deficient homozygotes have increased susceptibility to severe bacterial infections. C2-deficient homozygotes had significantly lower serum levels of IgG2, IgG4, IgD, and Factor B, significantly higher levels of IgA and IgG3, and levels of IgG1 and IgM similar to controls. Type 1 (28 bp deletion in C2 exon 6 on the [HLA-B18, S042, DR2] haplotype or its fragments) and type II (non-type I) C2-deficient patients with increased susceptibility to bacterial infection had significantly lower mean levels of IgG4 (p < 0.04) and IgA (p < 0.01) than those without infections (who had a higher than normal mean IgA level), but similar mean levels of other immunoglobulins and Factor B. Of 13 C2-deficient homozygotes with infections, 85% had IgG4 deficiency, compared with 64% of 25 without infections.

IgD deficiency was equally extraordinarily common among infection-prone (50%) and noninfection-prone (70%) homozygous type I C2-deficient patients. IgD deficiency was also common (35%) among 31 type I C2-deficient heterozygotes (with normal or type II haplotypes), but was not found in 5 type II C2-deficient heterozygotes or 1 homozygote. Thus, C2 deficiency itself is associated with many abnormalities in serum immunoglobulin levels, some of which, such as in IgG4 and IgA, may contribute to increased susceptibility to infection. In contrast, IgD deficiency appears not to contribute to increased infections and appears to be a dominant trait determined by a gene or genes on the extended major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotype [HLA-B18, S042, DR2].

### Antibody tests for identification of current and past infection with SARS-CoV-2 [^116C17sd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

In the background, we outlined five possible roles for antibody testing, two of which we did not further consider in this review (serial testing to assess immune response and selection of seronegative COVID-19 patients for monoclonal antibody treatments). We here consider the evidence for the remaining three use cases:

- **Diagnosis of infection**:
	- This applies to patients presenting with symptoms of suspected COVID-19, particularly where molecular testing had failed to detect the virus and if earlier antibody test results (soon after onset of symptoms) were negative. It is unclear how generalizable our results for weeks one to three after symptom onset are to people who present either in the community or in hospital settings with a negative RT-PCR result but ongoing and potentially concerning symptoms. A large proportion of studies included in this review iteration collected data from patients in the acute phase of disease in hospital inpatient settings, with less than 15% clearly recruiting individuals from community or emergency care settings.
	- As noted in the index test(s) section, where COVID-19 vaccination rates are high, antibody tests that can distinguish between antibodies to the N- and S-proteins would be needed to distinguish SARS-CoV-2 infection from vaccination-induced antibodies. Because the studies included in this review were conducted before vaccines against COVID-19 were available, we have not been able to assess test performance for vaccination-induced antibodies compared to antibodies from infection.

### Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 induced by infection or vaccination [^115oLnkd]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Antibody testing remains our best way to estimate past SARS-CoV-2 infection and a positive vaccine response, although many factors, such as waning responses, need to be considered. In the context of SARS-CoV-2, anti-S antibodies are particularly important, as they develop in the majority of infections. As IgM and IgA isotypes generally wane in the peripheral circulation with viral clearance, they are not as useful for monitoring individual and population responses as IgG molecules. However, they may help illuminate the clinical picture in a COVID-19 patient. Not all antibody tests are of equal sensitivity and specificity, and while high-quality tests are now available, there is a range of tests with varying performance. The considerable inter-individual differences in antiviral antibody levels and nature call for international guidelines and improved regulatory standards for antibody testing. This initiative would facilitate comparisons between studies monitoring previous infection and vaccination, positively impacting clinical medicine related to COVID-19 at the individual level.

Currently, mass-produced tests for clinical and community use, many of which have low specificity and sensitivity, are based on individual domains of the spike protein (e.g. S1, S2, RBD) as these are easier to produce for large distribution. However, some of these antigens may not be produced in a native form, which can lead to missed antigenic specificities, especially when antibody titers are low due to time from infection/vaccination or if the assay platform has relatively high limits.

### Illustrative cases on individualizing immunoglobulin therapy in primary immunodeficiency disease [^117Hd7b5]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

To illustrate the need for individualized immunoglobulin therapy in patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDDs), this study reviews evidence on how best to identify the biological serum IgG level in patients with antibody-deficient PIDD.

- **Data sources**: Two case studies from the author's clinical practice are discussed. PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE databases were searched for articles pertaining to serum immunoglobulin levels in patients with PIDD and the relation of trough IgG levels to infection incidence and outcomes.

- **Study selections**: Articles and case studies were selected for their relevance to the individualization of IgG therapy for patients with PIDD. The case studies support the position that each patient has a specific "biological" serum IgG level associated with decreasing or preventing reinfection.

- **Results**: Patients with antibody-deficient PIDD are routinely treated with lifelong immunoglobulin replacement. Although a starting dose has been suggested, the dose of IgG that maintains serum IgG levels that protect against severe or reinfection has not been determined. It is likely the serum IgG level required to prevent infection in these patients varies as it does in normal individuals. This biological serum IgG level must be identified for each patient by plotting documented infections vs. serum IgG levels over time.

- **Conclusion**: Clinical experience and recent evidence suggest that optimal treatment of patients with PIDD involves individualizing IgG treatment to identify the optimal IgG serum levels required for each patient.

### IgG subclasses in smokers with chronic bronchitis and recurrent exacerbations [^113hbm3V]. Thorax (2001). Low credibility.

Tobacco smokers have lower serum levels of IgG than non-smokers. IgG subclass deficiency is common in patients with respiratory infections. Bronchial infections are common in smokers with chronic bronchitis (CB). We have investigated whether susceptibility to exacerbations in smokers with CB is associated with altered IgG subclass levels or IgG subclass deficiency.

- **Methods**: Serum levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgG subclasses 1–4 were determined by radial immunodiffusion in 100 subjects: 33 smokers with stable CB and exacerbations, 24 asymptomatic smokers, and 43 healthy never smokers. Systemic tobacco exposure was verified and excluded using a serum cotinine ELISA. Immunoglobulin data were log transformed to enable the use of parametric statistical methods.

- **Results**: Compared with never smokers, both patients with CB and asymptomatic smokers had significantly lower levels of IgG (median 9.7 g/l [range 5.6–15.2] and 9.9 [6.1–12.1] g/l vs. 12.0 [6.9–18.5] g/l) and IgG2 (2.8 [0.9–5.9] g/l and 2.5 [1.0–6.3] g/l vs. 4.0 [1.7–10.2] g/l). The estimated ratio of median values between the patients with CB and never smokers was 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69 to 0.89) for IgG and 0.65 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.83) for IgG2. The corresponding ratios between asymptomatic smokers and never smokers were 0.79 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.91) and 0.60 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.83), respectively. There were no significant differences between the smoking groups.

- **Conclusions**: Susceptibility to exacerbations in smokers with CB is not associated with lower levels of IgG subclasses.

### Long-term monitoring of the development and extinction of IgA and IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection [^115qWcqQ]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Low credibility.

Despite the significant interest of the scientific community in the behavior of the human body after contact with the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), long-term monitoring (more than six months) of the immunological status of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) of varying severity and individuals with a low SARS-CoV-2 viral load is largely absent.

This study aimed at a nine-month monitoring of the SARS-CoV-2 infection immune response development and extinction by quantitatively assessing IgA and IgG levels in the blood of healthy donors and patients who have undergone COVID-19. The project involved 180 volunteers, of whom 51 (28.33%) contracted COVID-19 during the observation period. All individuals who underwent COVID-19 developed a stable humoral immune response, yet their individual immune statuses exhibited distinct characteristics.

Approximately 39.22% (20 of 51) of the project participants diagnosed with COVID-19 showed an unusual change in plasma anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA levels. Relatively high levels of IgA (ratio ~3) persisted long after recovery, for more than six months. In one-third (17 of 51) of COVID-19 patients, the IgA level exceeded the IgG level. IgA antibodies appeared earlier and exhibited a stronger and more robust response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus than IgG. Increased levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA (ratio from 0.8 to 2.36) throughout the observation period were recorded in 28 of the 180 project participants (15.56%).

### Recurrent and persistent respiratory tract viral infections in patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia [^111aLe2D]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

The occurrence of respiratory tract viral infections in patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia has not been studied.

- **Objective**: We conducted a prospective 12-month follow-up study of respiratory tract infections in 12 adult patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia.

- **Methods**: Nasal swab samples and induced sputum samples were taken at the onset of acute respiratory tract infection and every 3 months thereafter. Samples were tested for bacteria and viruses. PCR tests were performed for 15 respiratory tract viruses. In case the results for rhinovirus were positive, follow-up nasal swab samples were taken every 2 weeks until rhinoviral PCR results became negative. Patients completed symptom diaries, which were collected every month. The spouses of the patients served as healthy control subjects.

- **Results**: During the 12-month period, the 12 patients had 65 episodes of acute respiratory tract infections, and the 11 spouses had 12 acute episodes (P < .001). Respiratory tract viruses were found in sputum in 54% of the infections. Rhinovirus was the most common virus. In more than half of our patients, rhinoviral PCR results stayed positive for more than 2 months. The most long-acting persistence with the same rhinovirus was 4 months.

- **Conclusions**: Despite adequate immunoglobulin replacement therapy, patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia have increased susceptibility to respiratory tract viral infections. Rhinoviral infections are frequent and prolonged.

### EULAR recommendations for the management of ANCA-associated vasculitis: 2022 update [^116HLhmd]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for granulomatosis with polyangiitis, specifically concerning serum immunoglobulins, EULAR 2024 guidelines recommend measuring serum immunoglobulin concentrations before each course of rituximab to detect secondary immunodeficiency in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis receiving rituximab.

### Early appearance of neutralizing immunoglobulin G3 antibodies is associated with chikungunya virus clearance and long-term clinical protection [^1131f4oQ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and related arboviruses have been responsible for large epidemic outbreaks with serious economic and social impact. Although infected individuals clear the virus from the blood, some develop debilitating and prolonged arthralgia.

- **Methods**: We investigated specificity and strength of antibody responses in a longitudinal study on CHIKV-infected patients and analyzed their association with viral load, cytokine profile, and severity.

- **Results**: We found that CHIKV-specific response is dominated by immunoglobulin G3 (IgG3) antibodies. The antibodies were neutralizing, and patients with high viremia rapidly developed high levels of anti-CHIKV antibodies of this specific isotype. Although these patients endured a more severe disease progression during the acute viremic phase, they cleared the virus faster and did not experience persistent arthralgia. However, significant persistent arthralgia was observed in patients with low viremia who developed IgG3 at a later stage.

- **Conclusions**: Absence of early CHIKV-specific IgG3 may therefore serve as a specific marker of patients with increased risk of disease.

### Convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID-19: A rapid review [^112tRQGL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin may reduce mortality in patients with respiratory virus diseases and are currently being investigated in trials as a potential therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A thorough understanding of the body of evidence regarding the benefits and risks is required to assess whether convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin transfusion is effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID-19.

- **Search methods**: The protocol was pre-published with the Center for Open Science and can be accessed at osf.io/dwf53. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Research Article Database, and trials registries to identify ongoing studies and results of completed studies on April 23, 2020. The search criteria included case-series, cohort, prospectively planned, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

- **Selection criteria**: We followed standard Cochrane methodology and performed all steps regarding study selection in duplicate by two independent review authors, in contrast to the recommendations of the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group. We included studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender, or ethnicity. We excluded studies involving populations with other coronavirus diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^113AcJHW]. MMWR. Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for hepatitis A virus infection, more specifically concerning post-exposure prophylaxis, the CDC 2021 guidelines recommend offering immunoglobulin (0.1 mL/kg body weight) or a single dose of monovalent hepatitis A vaccine as soon as possible, ideally within 2 weeks after exposure, to unimmunized individuals recently exposed to HAV.

### Immunoglobulin treatment for hospitalised infants and young children with respiratory syncytial virus infection [^116wFJt8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Millions of children are hospitalized due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection every year. Treatment is generally supportive, and current therapies, such as inhaled bronchodilators, epinephrine, nebulized hypertonic saline, and corticosteroids, are often ineffective or have limited effect. Respiratory syncytial virus immunoglobulin is occasionally used prophylactically to prevent hospital admission from RSV-related illnesses. It may be considered for the treatment of established severe RSV infection or for treatment in an immunocompromised host, although it is not licensed for this purpose. It remains unclear whether immunoglobulins improve outcomes when used as a treatment for established RSV infection in infants and young children admitted to hospital.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of immunoglobulins for the treatment of RSV-proven lower respiratory tract infections in children aged up to three years, admitted to hospital.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science (from inception to 6 November 2018) with no restrictions. We also searched two trial registries for ongoing trials (up to 30 March 2018) and checked the reference lists of reviews and included articles for additional studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials comparing immunoglobulins with placebo in hospitalised infants and children aged up to three years with laboratory-diagnosed RSV lower respiratory tract infection.

### Antibody response after SARS-CoV-2 infection and implications for immunity: A rapid living review [^112c5pue]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The clinical significance of the antibody response after SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. This study aims to synthesize evidence on the prevalence, levels, and durability of detectable antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 infection and explore whether these antibodies confer natural immunity.

- **Data sources**: Research data were collected from MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization global literature database, and Covid19reviews.org, limited to peer-reviewed publications available in English, from 1 January through 15 December 2020.

- **Study selection**: The research involved primary studies characterizing the prevalence, levels, and duration of antibodies in adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The study also considered reinfection incidence and unintended consequences of antibody testing.

- **Data extraction**: Two investigators sequentially extracted study data and assessed quality.

- **Data synthesis**: The findings indicate that moderate-strength evidence shows most adults develop detectable levels of IgM and IgG antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 infection. IgG levels peak approximately 25 days after symptom onset and may remain detectable for at least 120 days. IgM levels peak at around 20 days and then decline. Low-strength evidence suggests that most adults generate neutralizing antibodies, which may persist for several months like IgG. Additionally, low-strength evidence indicates that factors such as older age, greater disease severity, and presence of symptoms may be associated with higher antibody levels.

### Ocrevus [^1162yZP6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Laboratory Abnormalities

- **Decreased immunoglobulins**: Ocrevus decreased total immunoglobulins with the greatest decline seen in IgM levels; however, a decrease in IgG levels was associated with an increased rate of serious infections.

	- In the active-controlled (RMS) trials (Study 1 and Study 2), the proportion of patients at baseline reporting IgG, IgA, and IgM levels below the lower limit of normal (LLN) in Ocrevus-treated patients was 0.5%, 1.5%, and 0.1%, respectively. Following treatment, the proportion of Ocrevus-treated patients reporting IgG, IgA, and IgM levels below the LLN at 96 weeks increased to 1.5%, 2.4%, and 16.5%, respectively.

	- In the placebo-controlled (PPMS) trial (Study 3), the proportion of patients at baseline reporting IgG, IgA, and IgM levels below the LLN in Ocrevus-treated patients was 0.0%, 0.2%, and 0.2%, respectively. After treatment, the proportion of Ocrevus-treated patients reporting IgG, IgA, and IgM below the LLN at 120 weeks rose to 1.1%, 0.5%, and 15.5%, respectively.

	- The pooled data of Ocrevus clinical studies (RMS and PPMS) and their open-label extensions (up to approximately 7 years of exposure) have shown an association between decreased levels of IgG and increased rates of serious infections. The type, severity, latency, duration, and outcome of serious infections observed during episodes of immunoglobulins below LLN were consistent with the overall serious infections observed in patients treated with Ocrevus.

- **Decreased neutrophil levels**: In the PPMS clinical trial (Study 3), decreased neutrophil counts occurred in 13% of Ocrevus-treated patients compared to 10%.

### Is there a clinical significance of very low serum immunoglobulin E level [^114CtPqS]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

High serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E levels are associated with allergies, parasitic infections, and some immune deficiencies; however, the potential effects and clinical implications of low IgE levels on the human immune system are not well known. This study aims to determine the disorders accompanying very low IgE levels in children and adults.

- **Methods**: The patients whose IgE levels were determined between January 2015 and September 2020 were analyzed, and the patients with an IgE level < 2 IU/mL were included in this study. Demographic data, immunoglobulin levels, autoantibody results, and the diagnoses of the patients were noted from the electronic recording system of the hospital.

- **Result**: The IgE levels were measured in 34,809 patients (21,875 children, 12,934 adults), and 130 patients had IgE levels < 2 IU/mL. Fifty-seven patients were children (0.26%); 73 were adults (0.56%). There was a malignant disease in 34 (9 of them children) (26%), autoimmune diseases in 20 (3 of them children) (15.4%), and immunodeficiency in 17 (14 of them children) (13.1%) of the patients. The most common reasons were other diseases, immunodeficiency, and malignancy in children, and malignancy, autoimmune disorders, and other diseases in adults, in rank order. The IgE level did not show any correlation with the levels of other immunoglobulins.

- **Conclusion**: Although rare, a low IgE level has been shown to accompany malignancies, autoimmune disorders, and immune deficiencies. Patients with very low IgE levels should be carefully monitored for systemic disorders.

### Mechanisms of hypergammaglobulinemia and impaired antigen-specific humoral immunity in HIV-1 infection [^111Mm2LW]. Blood (2004). Low credibility.

Hypergammaglobulinemia and defective humoral immunity are hallmarks of HIV-1 infection. Recent studies suggest that naive B cells are the major source of hypergammaglobulinemia in chronic viral infections. It has been recently reported that HIV-1-infected patients exhibit low levels of memory B cells. This study investigates whether defects in naive and memory B cells in HIV-1-infected patients contribute to hypergammaglobulinemia and impaired humoral immunity against specific antigens.

Naive B cells from HIV-1-infected patients exhibited abnormal expression of activation/differentiation markers, specifically CD70 and leukocyte-associated Ig-like receptor (LAIR-1). Activated naive B cells demonstrated a significant increase in intracellular immunoglobulin G (IgG) content ex vivo, and this activated phenotype correlated with hypergammaglobulinemia and the ability of naive B cells from patients to secrete IgG in vitro.

In examining antibody levels to tetanus toxoid, measles, and HIV-1 in relation to memory B cells, a significant reduction of antigen-specific antibodies was observed in patients with low-memory B lymphocytes. However, despite this reduction, hypergammaglobulinemia and levels of polyspecific self-reactive antibodies were comparable in patients with both normal and low memory B cells.

In conclusion, a reduction in memory B lymphocytes in HIV-1 infection correlates with defective humoral immunity. Hyperactivated naive B cells may be the source of abnormal IgG production in HIV-1 infection. These findings could have implications for the design of HIV-1 therapeutic vaccines.

### Serum immunoglobulins in the infected and convalescent phases in community-acquired pneumonia [^116qgGPa]. Respiratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

A population-based case-control study was designed to assess changes in serum levels of immunoglobulins and IgG subclasses between the infected and convalescent phases in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

- **Methods**: Over a 2-year period, all subjects who were over 14 years of age living in the Maresme region (Barcelona, Spain) and diagnosed with CAP were registered. Controls were healthy subjects selected from the municipal census. Prognostic factors were assessed, and serum levels of total IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgG subclasses were measured at diagnosis and 1 month later.

- **Results**: We studied 171 patients with CAP and 90 controls. All immunoglobulins were significantly lower in cases than in controls. At diagnosis, 42.7% of cases showed low levels of some immunologic parameters, mainly total IgG and IgG2. Low immunoglobulin levels at diagnosis were more frequent in patients requiring in-patient care and in those with pneumonia of etiologies other than Streptococcus pneumoniae. In the convalescent phase, 26 (23.6%) patients normalized immunological levels, while in 27 (24.5%) cases, some parameters with low levels persisted, especially in patients with CAP of etiology other than S. pneumoniae.

- **Conclusions**: Low serum levels of immunoglobulins, particularly total IgG and IgG2, were a common finding in patients with CAP compared to healthy controls. Low immunoglobulin levels may be related to CAP prognosis and persisted in the convalescent phase in one-fourth of cases.

### Evaluating and managing hypogammaglobulinemia [^116UgkiR]. Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine (2006). High credibility.

Hypogammaglobulinemia can arise from several possible causes, including:

- **Hematologic and neoplastic disorders**: multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, X-linked lymphoproliferative disease
- **Immunodeficiencies and genetic conditions**: Bruton agammaglobulinemia, reticular dysgenesis, immunoglobulin A deficiency, ataxia telangiectasia, adenosine deaminase 2 deficiency, common variable hypogammaglobulinemia, adenosine deaminase deficiency, X-linked immunoneurologic disorder
- **Viral infections**: Various viral infections
- **Metabolic and enzyme deficiencies**: propionyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency PCCA type, congenital disorder of glycosylation type 1k
- **Gastrointestinal and renal disorders**: protein-losing enteropathy, intestinal lymphangiectasia, nephrotic syndrome
- **Other causes**: plasmapheresis, complement hyperactivation angiopathic thrombosis, hereditary folate malabsorption, myotonic dystrophy, dystrophia myotonica type 2, chronic kidney disease

Additionally, certain medications can cause hypogammaglobulinemia. These include:

- **Immunosuppressive drugs**: ocrelizumab, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, ibrutinib
- **CAR T-cell therapies**: axicabtagene ciloleucel (autologous), tisagenlecleucel (autologous), obecabtagene autoleucel (autologous)
- **Experimental treatments**: linvoseltamab
