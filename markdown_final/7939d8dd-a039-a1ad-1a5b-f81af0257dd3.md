## Question

What is the ICD-10-CM code for adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (HTLV-1–associated) that has not achieved remission?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the ICD-10-CM code for adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (HTLV-1-associated) that has not achieved remission. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct ICD-10-CM category for adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Then, I should verify the remission status coding conventions and whether a specific "not achieved remission" subcode exists. Next, I will check authoritative coding references to confirm the exact code. Finally, I will consider any nuances like subtype or HTLV-1 etiology that might alter code selection and ensure the final answer is precise and supported.

> Let me first confirm the disease category. Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma is a mature T-cell malignancy caused by HTLV-1 and is classified under lymphoid leukemias in ICD-10-CM, specifically within the C91 series for lymphoid leukemia, not under lymphoma codes, even though it has lymphomatous presentations, so I should anchor on C91 rather than C84 or C86 for lymphomas [^1118yCsF].

> Wait, let me verify the remission-status convention. ICD-10-CM uses a suffix pattern where .0 denotes not having achieved remission, .1 denotes in remission, and .2 denotes in relapse for many leukemia subtypes; I need to check whether ATLL follows this same pattern in the C91.5x block, and yes, the coding listings show C91.50 for not having achieved remission, C91.51 for in remission, and C91.52 for in relapse, which matches the standard convention [^1118yCsF].

> I should confirm the exact code. The specific ICD-10-CM code for adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma not having achieved remission is C91.50, which explicitly captures HTLV-1-associated ATLL in the active disease state; I initially wondered if a more generic "other specified leukemia" code like C94.80 might apply, but hold on, that would be incorrect because ATLL has a dedicated code under C91.50, so C91.50 is the accurate choice here [^1118yCsF] [^114WzN1k].

> Let me consider whether subtype or HTLV-1 etiology changes the code. The ICD-10-CM code C91.50 encompasses ATLL regardless of the clinical subtype (acute, lymphoma, chronic, smoldering) and inherently reflects the HTLV-1 association, so I do not need a separate etiologic code; the diagnosis itself is coded as C91.50 when remission has not been achieved, and clinicians should document "HTLV-1-associated" for clarity even though it does not alter the code selection [^1118yCsF].

> Final answer: C91.50 Adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia not having achieved remission [^1118yCsF].

---

The ICD-10-CM code for adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (HTLV-1-associated) that has not achieved remission is **C91.50**. This code specifically denotes active disease and should be used when there is no documented remission. For cases in remission, use **C91.51**; for relapse, use **C91.52**. Accurate coding supports appropriate clinical tracking, billing, and epidemiologic reporting of this aggressive HTLV-1–related malignancy [^1118yCsF].

---

## ICD-10-CM code for adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (HTLV-1-associated) not having achieved remission

The specific ICD-10-CM code for adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (HTLV-1-associated) that has not achieved remission is **C91.50** — Adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia, not having achieved remission [^1118yCsF].

---

## Clinical significance of the ICD-10-CM code C91.50

The code C91.50 is clinically significant because it indicates **active disease** — that is, the malignancy is present and has not responded to treatment or has relapsed. This status influences clinical decision-making, treatment planning, and prognosis. ATLL is an aggressive malignancy with poor outcomes, particularly in the acute and lymphoma subtypes, and documenting active disease is essential for appropriate management and follow-up [^116wqZr2] [^112xzoQ6].

---

## Differentiation from other ICD-10-CM codes related to adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma

ICD-10-CM provides specific codes to distinguish between different clinical statuses of ATLL:

| **ICD-10-cm code** | **Clinical status** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| C91.50 | Not having achieved remission | Active disease, no remission |
| C91.51 | In remission | Disease controlled, no active disease |
| C91.52 | In relapse | Disease recurrence after remission |

---

These codes ensure accurate documentation of the patient's disease status, which is critical for clinical care, billing, and epidemiological tracking [^117RwFnX].

---

## Clinical implications of "not having achieved remission" status

When ATLL is documented as "not having achieved remission", several **clinical implications** arise:

- **Treatment planning**: Active disease typically requires aggressive therapy, including chemotherapy, antiretroviral therapy (zidovudine and interferon-alpha), and consideration of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in eligible patients [^111VwUfi] [^112kgiqk].

- **Prognosis**: Active ATLL, particularly the acute and lymphoma subtypes, carries a poor prognosis with median survival ranging from 6 to 13 months, underscoring the need for timely and effective intervention [^116wqZr2] [^112xzoQ6].

- **Monitoring and follow-up**: Patients with active disease require close monitoring for disease progression, complications such as hypercalcemia, infections, and organ involvement, and response to therapy [^117J7ryJ].

---

## Documentation requirements and coding best practices

Accurate coding of ATLL as "not having achieved remission" requires thorough clinical documentation. Clinicians should explicitly state the **disease status** (active, in remission, or relapsed) and provide supporting clinical evidence, such as laboratory results, imaging studies, and treatment history. Coders should verify the documentation and apply the appropriate ICD-10-CM code accordingly [^1118yCsF].

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10-CM code for adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (HTLV-1-associated) that has not achieved remission is **C91.50**. This code signifies active disease and has significant clinical implications for treatment planning, prognosis, and monitoring. Accurate documentation and coding are essential for optimal patient care, billing, and epidemiological tracking of this aggressive malignancy [^1118yCsF] [^11662FCw].

### Striving to cure adult T-cell leukaemia / lymphoma: a role for allogeneic stem cell transplant? [^116dQ7YQ]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATL) is an aggressive HTLV-1-related malignancy, rare outside of regions where the retrovirus is endemic. Although the use of antiviral therapy has improved outcomes, particularly for indolent forms of ATL, response to combination chemotherapy is poor and outcomes for aggressive subtypes remains dismal. Consolidation with allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT) has an increasing role in the management of ATL in eligible patients, offering favourable long-term remission rates. However, relatively high-transplant-related mortality and issues with donor recruitment for certain ethnicities remain problematic. In this review, we discuss the rationale for and issues surrounding alloSCT in ATL in the context of conventional and emerging therapies.

Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), in its acute stage, is a uniformly fatal disease. ATLL is caused by the human T-cell lymphotropic virus I (HTLV-1), a retrovirus endemic in numerous areas throughout the world including Japan, the Caribbean, Central and South America and certain areas of the United States. Although the progression from HTLV-1 carrier status to ATLL occurs only rarely, ATLL is incurable and thus prevention of HTLV-1 transmission should be a primary goal. With the development of new anti-retroviral and monoclonal therapies, there exist potential cures or at least prolonged remissions for patients diagnosed with ATLL. We present a case of ATLL that, to our knowledge, is only the third reported case in Georgia. In addition, we present a brief review of the literature, including potential new treatment regimens that appear to have promise in the treatment of ATLL.

INTRODUCTION

Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) is an intractable mature T-cell malignancy with diverse clinical features, etiologically associated with a retrovirus designated human T-cell leukemia virus type I or human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), which is endemic in several regions, including the southwest region of Japan, Central and South America, central Africa, the Middle East, Far East, central Australia, and Romania. Because of population migration, sporadic cases are observed in North America, particularly in New York, NY, and Miami, FL; and Europe, mostly in France and the United Kingdom. Incidence of ATL is rising in nonendemic regions of the world. In 2009, ATL researchers joined together and published an ATL consensus report that has been a standard reference for clinical trials of new agents for ATL and that focused on definition, prognostic factors, clinical subtype classification, treatment, and response criteria.

### How I treat adult T-cell leukemia / lymphoma [^112xzoQ6]. Blood (2021). Medium credibility.

Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is a highly aggressive T-cell malignancy that arises in a proportion of individuals who are long-term carriers of human T-lymphotropic virus type 1. The median survival of aggressive subtypes is 8 to 10 months; with chemotherapy-based approaches, overall survival has remained largely unchanged in the ∼35 years since ATL was first described. Through the use of 4 representative case studies, we highlight advances in the biological understanding of ATL and the use of novel therapies such as mogamulizumab, as well as how they are best applied to different subtypes of ATL. We discuss the implementation of molecular methods that may guide diagnosis or treatment, although we accept that these are not universally available. In particular, we acknowledge discrepancies in treatment between different countries, reflecting current drug licensing and the difficulties in making treatment decisions in a rare disease, with limited high-quality clinical trial data.

### Human T-cell leukaemia virus type 1 and adult T-cell leukaemia / lymphoma in queensland, Australia: a retrospective cross-sectional study [^115CzweJ]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2023). Medium credibility.

In 2010, about 4.51 million people lived in Queensland. Extrapolating from our HTLV-1 prevalence estimate of only 0.1%, potentially 4500 people could be living with HTLV-1 in Queensland. With a 4%–5% lifetime risk of developing ATL if HTLV-1-positive, an estimated 180 cases of ATL would be expected to occur. However, the National Cancer Registry recorded only 10 ATL cases over a decade; maybe it is difficult to diagnose ATL and cases are missed as reported in Braziland the Netherlands. The other specific HTLV-1 disease is HAM/TSP, with a similar 4%–5% lifetime risk. HAM/TSP has been observed but not systematically recorded in Australia, since there is no Australian modification of the ICD-10 code for HAM/TSP. In summary, it is possible that people suffering from ATL and HAM/TSP are not diagnosed without specific training and experience.

HTLV-1 causes disease in Queensland and other states of Australia, but due to a lack of obligatory notification HTLV-1 remains underdiagnosed. This may have led to the conclusion that a public health response to HTLV-1 is not necessary in Australia. However, the World Health Organization is considering to formally adopt HTLV-1 as a health topic and recommends testing and counselling of at-risk population to prevent further transmission of this STI.

While HTLV-1 is highly endemic in Central Australia, we demonstrate that it is an ubiquitous virus and not confined to the Indigenous population. It is present in Queensland's general population at low prevalence levels, similar to other industrialised countries such as the UK. It is therefore important to ensure that all people at risk of an STI and/or presenting with HTLV-1 disease-like symptoms are considered for an HTLV-1 screen.

### Definition, prognostic factors, treatment, and response criteria of adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma: a proposal from an international consensus meeting [^1178ttBx]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) is a distinct peripheral T-lymphocytic malignancy associated with a retrovirus designated human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1). The diversity in clinical features and prognosis of patients with this disease has led to its subclassification into the following four categories: acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering types. The chronic and smoldering subtypes are considered indolent and are usually managed with watchful waiting until disease progression, analogous to the management of some patients with chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) or other indolent histology lymphomas. Patients with aggressive ATL generally have a poor prognosis because of multidrug resistance of malignant cells, a large tumor burden with multiorgan failure, hypercalcemia, and/or frequent infectious complications as a result of a profound T-cell immunodeficiency. Under the sponsorship of the 13th International Conference on Human Retrovirology: HTLV, a group of ATL researchers joined to form a consensus statement based on established data to define prognostic factors, clinical subclassifications, and treatment strategies. A set of response criteria specific for ATL reflecting a combination of those for lymphoma and CLL was proposed. Clinical subclassification is useful but is limited because of the diverse prognosis among each subtype. Molecular abnormalities within the host genome, such as tumor suppressor genes, may account for these diversities. A treatment strategy based on the clinical subclassification and prognostic factors is suggested, including watchful waiting approach, chemotherapy, antiviral therapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (alloHSCT), and targeted therapies.

ATL continues to have a dismal prognosis with current therapies, and clinical trials that incorporate molecular and prognostic factors will remain paramount to advances in ATL treatment. We have proposed a strategy for ATL treatment stratified by subtype classification, including an updated opinion on the management of patients with tumorous skin lesions. Future clinical trials should remain a priority to ensure that the consensus is continually updated to establish evidence-based practice guidelines.

### Hospital admissions in individuals with HTLV-1 infection in Spain [^115yCaPb]. AIDS (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine the clinical burden and disease spectrum, as well as time trends for human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and HTLV type 2 (HTLV-2) hospital admissions.

Design

Retrospective, observational study using the Spanish National Hospital Discharge Database.

Methods

Information for the diagnostic codes HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) was retrieved from the national public registry since 1997–2015.

Results

From a total of 66462136 nationwide hospital admissions recorded during the study period, 135 included HTLV diagnosis, being HTLV-1 in 115 (85.2%) and HTLV-2 in 20 (14.8%). The overall hospital admission rate because of HTLV was 2.03 per million, without significant yearly changes. First admissions represented 104 (77%) whereas 31 (23%) were re-admissions. The median in-hospital stay for HTLV patients was 9 days. In-hospital death occurred in 11 (8.1%). The median age of individuals with HTLV admission was 48 years and 60 (44.4%) were women. HTLV was recorded as the main diagnosis in 20%. The most frequent clinical conditions recorded alongside HTLV diagnosis were myelopathy (61; 45.2%), leukemia/lymphoma (30; 22.2%), solid organ transplantation (14; 10.4%) and child delivery (7; 5.2%).

Conclusion

The rate of HTLV diagnosis in hospitalized patients in Spain is low, roughly of two per million admissions. Despite continuous large immigrant flows from HTLV-1 endemic areas, no significant rising in hospitalizations because of HTLV-1 associated illnesses were noticed during the last two decades. Classical clinical complications of HTLV-1 infection, such as myelopathy and lymphoma account for more than two-thirds of cases.

### Revised adult T-Cell leukemia-lymphoma international consensus meeting report [^1172FmDx]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) is a distinct mature T-cell malignancy caused by chronic infection with human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 with diverse clinical features and prognosis. ATL remains a challenging disease as a result of its diverse clinical features, multidrug resistance of malignant cells, frequent large tumor burden, hypercalcemia, and/or frequent opportunistic infection. In 2009, we published a consensus report to define prognostic factors, clinical subclassifications, treatment strategies, and response criteria. The 2009 consensus report has become the standard reference for clinical trials in ATL and a guide for clinical management. Since the last consensus there has been progress in the understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of ATL and risk-adapted treatment approaches.

Methods

Reflecting these advances, ATL researchers and clinicians joined together at the 18th International Conference on Human Retrovirology-Human T-Lymphotropic Virus and Related Retroviruses-in Tokyo, Japan, March, 2017, to review evidence for current clinical practice and to update the consensus with a new focus on the subtype classification of cutaneous ATL, CNS lesions in aggressive ATL, management of elderly or transplantation-ineligible patients, and treatment strategies that incorporate up-front allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation and novel agents.

Results

As a result of lower-quality clinical evidence, a best practice approach was adopted and consensus statements agreed on by coauthors (> 90% agreement).

Conclusion

This expert consensus highlights the need for additional clinical trials to develop novel standard therapies for the treatment of ATL.

Patients with multiple PTCL subtype diagnoses were excluded.

Patient Characteristics

Demographic characteristics assessed at index were age, sex, and geographical region. PTCL subtype was reported based on the PTCL subtype at diagnosis. Subtypes included sALCL (anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK] positive [ALK+] and ALK negative [ALK−]), human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-1-associated adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia (ATLL), AITL, enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma, hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, other mature T/NK-cell lymphomas, and PTCL-NOS. Time metrics included patients' activity time pre- and post-index. CCI scores were assessed during the 6-month baseline period based on the presence of an ICD-9/10 code for certain cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, renal, and hepatic conditions, as well as rheumatic disease, diabetes without/with chronic complications, dementia, hemiplegia or paraplegia, cerebrovascular disease, and HIV/AIDS (Table 1).

### HTLV-1 persistence and the oncogenesis of adult T-cell leukemia / lymphoma [^117VGLS7]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), also known as human T-lymphotropic virus type 1, causes the aggressive malignancy known as adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) in 5% of infected people and a chronic progressive inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, HTLV-1-associated myelopathy, in ∼0.3% to 4% of them, varying between regions where it is endemic. Reliable treatments are lacking for both conditions, although there have been promising recent advances in the prevention and treatment of ATL. Because ATL typically develops after several decades of infection, it is necessary to understand how the virus persists in the host despite a strong immune response, and how this persistence results in oncogenesis.

### Monitoring molecular response in adult T-cell leukemia by high-throughput sequencing analysis of HTLV-1 clonality [^115dvfyW]. Leukemia (2017). Low credibility.

Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is an aggressive CD4+ T-cell malignancy caused by the oncogenic retrovirus human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1). Although the cumulative incidence of ATL among HTLV-1-infected individuals is only 5%, it has an extremely poor prognosis and remains a major health concern in endemic regions. Patients with an aggressive subtype have a median survival of 4–6 and 9–10 months for acute and lymphoma subtypes, respectively (Shimoyama classification). Indolent forms (chronic and smoldering) have a more favorable median survival of 33 and 51 months. Treatment strategies for ATL mainly depend on clinical subtype, geographical localization and response to initial therapy. In Japan, aggressive forms are treated by conventional chemotherapy combined or not with allogeneic stem cell transplantation, while in western countries the combination of zidovudine (AZT) with interferon (IFN) alpha is the standard first-line therapy for acute leukemic subtypes and chronic forms. Response to treatment and complete clinical remission are currently defined on the basis of cytomorphological consensus criteria that have not been revised over the 8 years since they were first described(Supplementary Methods). Given the extremely poor prognosis of ATL, the high rates of rapid relapse and the marked diversity in survival outcome after achieving hematological remission, there is an urgent need for new molecular tools that can reliably evaluate therapeutic response and better define remission.

STRATEGY OF TARGETING THERAPY: PRECLINICAL DATA

Several antiretrovirals used for HIV have demonstrated proven efficacy against HTLV-1 in tissue culture, including the reverse transcription inhibitors zidovudine and tenofovir, as well as the integrase inhibitor raltegravir. However, whether these agents work in vivo via an antiviral effect has remained controversial. Several studies have shown little, if any, viral structural, enzymatic, or regulatory gene expression in ATL, with the exception of the antisense gene HBZ, and it remains controversial whether the continued expression of non- HBZ viral genes is required for tumor maintenance. However, recent data demonstrate that the extinction of Tax expression leads to total growth inhibition of ATL-derived cells even if Tax protein is undetectable at baseline. A possible explanation for these contradictory results is the recent demonstration on the basis of single-cell analysis of transient bursts of Tax oncoprotein, and presumably other viral proteins, which has led to the suggestion that transient Tax expression is essential for ATL survival. Thus, immunotherapy against Tax might be theoretically promising. A recent phase I study that used vaccination with Tax peptide-pulsed dendritic cells in three patients with aggressive ATL in PR or stable disease after chemotherapy demonstrated an induction of immune response against Tax with promisingly long-term remission. This warrants larger studies to demonstrate clinical effectiveness.

Although the combination of AZT/IFN has shown activity, it is uncertain whether these drugs function via antiviral activity in cells in the tumor or microenvironment or through mechanisms other than antiviral activity. Of note, doses of AZT used for the treatment of ATL — 600 to 900 mg/d and up to 3,000 mg/d in certain reports — are generally higher than those used for HIV treatment (600 mg/d) although the inhibitory concentrations of AZT for HTLV and HIV replication are similar. - It is also unclear whether reactivation of HTLV-1 expression in malignant or nonmalignant cells after induction therapy leads to chemotherapy resistance; however, it is notable that a recent chemotherapy trial that included raltegravir demonstrated results that were similar to a trial that lacked antiviral agents during the same induction therapy. Conversely, a recent report demonstrated that the combination AZT/IFN induced a significant inhibition of HTLV-I reverse transcription activity in responding ATL patients but not in resistant patients. These results are in line with a direct antiviral effect, likely in the HTLV-1–infected nonmalignant cells, which may play a major role in the survival of ATL cells.

Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) epidemiology and burden are described: ATLL is malignancy of peripheral T lymphocytes caused by the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1) and is associated with a long period of latency. In the International Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma (PTCL) Project, ATLL comprised approximately 10% of the diagnosis for confirmed cases of PTCL or natural killer (NK)-cell/T-cell lymphomas (n = 1153). ATLL is rare in North America or Europe (< 2%) and has a higher prevalence in Asia (25%), with all cases from Asia originating in Japan. In the United States, 2148 cases were reported from 2001 to 2015, representing an overall rate of 0.06 per 100,000 population.

As responses to intensive chemotherapy in general are not durable and long-term continuation of intensive chemotherapy is not feasible because of complications and cumulative toxicities, early allo-HSCT is recommended after response to first-line therapy. Thus, early referral to a transplantation center at diagnosis is strongly recommended, particularly in patients with high-risk features as described. With progressive disease, clinical outcome after allo-HSCT is poor, and it is crucial to conduct an up-front allo-HSCT while ATL is controlled to maximize the cure rate. It is recommended that allo-HSCT for progressive disease be performed within the setting of a prospective clinical trial to investigate novel HSCT conditioning regimens or post-HSCT treatment strategies to improve current limited treatment results. When considering allo-HSCT, the standard approach involves searching for an HLA-matched related donor (MRD) or an HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD) at diagnosis. However, only a proportion of patients will have an MRD. HTLV-1 seronegative donors are also preferred to avoid the risk of donor-derived ATL. When only HTLV-1 seropositive related donors are available, it is recommended to exclude the presence of abnormally abundant HTLV-1–infected clones using Southern blotting or polymerase chain reaction on the basis of clonality methods. Furthermore, outside of Japan, HTLV-1 infection often arises in minority immigrant populations, which makes it difficult to obtain a suitable MUD from registry panels. In these cases, other possible approaches include cord blood transplantation (CBT) or haploidentical HSCT (haplo-HSCT). Early experience with haplo-HSCT or CBT was unsatisfactory; however, protocols for both CBT and haplo-HSCT have been modified in recent years, although the efficacy of these protocols in ATL is not known. Preliminary anecdotal experience suggests that the TRM remains high, although several reports have suggested that CBT provides results that are similar to other transplantation procedures for selected patients with ATL. - Although experimental in the ATL setting, the addition of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide to haplo-HSCT protocols has improved transplantation outcomes for other hematologic malignancies. HSCT from alternative donor sources earlier in the disease course with good disease control may increase the potential to achieve outcomes that are similar to MUD transplantation outcomes. Without additional evidence from the results of ongoing trials (Data Supplement), it remains difficult to prioritize one donor source over another when an MRD or MUD is unavailable.

### Complete remission of a relapsing adult T cell leukaemia following treatment of a secondary acute promyelocytic leukaemia: towards a reappraisal of arsenic trioxide and all-transretinoic acid? [^111jPQr2]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Despite improvements in therapeutic options, human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-related adult T cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL) has a dismal prognosis. The present report concerns the case of a multirelapsing ATLL that reached a complete remission following the treatment of a secondary acute promyelocytic leukaemia with cytarabine, anthracyclin, all-transretinoic acid and arsenic trioxide. This unexpected result with a multitreated/chemorefractory disease led us to reconsider the potential therapeutic benefits of arsenic trioxide, which has demonstrated efficacy against ATLL cells.

### Integrated molecular and immunological features of human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 infection and disease progression to adult T-cell leukaemia or lymphoma [^1153Uq1o]. The Lancet: Haematology (2023). High credibility.

The human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) retrovirus infects 10–20 million people globally, with endemic regions in southwestern Japan, the Caribbean basin, Africa, and central Australia. HTLV-1 is associated with lifelong infection and immune suppression, resulting in a range of serious sequalae, including adult T-cell leukaemia or lymphoma (ATLL) in 5% of cases. To date, there are no preventive or curative treatments for HTLV-1 and treatment outcomes for ATLL remain generally poor. Depending on the disease subtype, overall survival is 8–55 months. Recent advancements in the past decade have identified genetic, molecular, and immunological events occurring throughout the lives of individuals infected with HTLV-1 and of those who progress to ATLL. In addition, updated guidelines for clinical management have been published. With the aim of focusing research efforts on the development of treatments for both HTLV-1 infections and ATLL, we have conceptualised a four-step disease model for HTLV-1-associated ATLL: (1) viral exposure, (2) establishment of chronic infection, (3) cellular transformation and evolution, and (4) disease presentation and management. For each stage we describe the clinical features, molecular and immunological factors involved, potential biomarkers of disease progression, and the therapeutic applicability of individual targets. We also discuss emerging concepts and novel treatment approaches. Our hope is that this model will promote research interest and guide the testing of new treatments for this neglected virus and its associated rare cancer.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

We performed a retrospective descriptive study of all patients diagnosed with ATL at SUNY Downstate Medical Center and Kings County Hospital between January 2005 and January 2017 after approval by the Institutional Review Board. Diagnosis of ATL was confirmed by clinical history, pathology, and serum HTLV-1 antibody positivity. Patients with pathology not confirmed at our institutions were excluded. Medical records were reviewed for clinicopathologic data and treatment outcomes. We included only patients who had ATL of the acute or lymphomatous subtypes in our final analysis because these groups had most available data. Survival and treatment response were assessed according to 2009 ATL Consensus Criteria. Overall survival (OS) was defined from the time of initial diagnosis (diagnosis of acute or lymphomatous subtypes if progression was from chronic or smoldering subtypes) to death or discharge to hospice or last hospital or clinic censor date (with documentation of refractory or progressive disease). Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined from time of initial therapy to death or progression of disease or relapse, whichever occurred first.

Demographic data, clinicopathologic features, and treatment responses were summarized by using descriptive measures. Treatment outcomes were compared by using independent t tests or nonparametric tests, depending on the normality of the distribution. Analysis outcomes were calculated by the log-rank test, and survival curves were assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical analysis was performed by using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 23 (Chicago, IL).

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^117RwFnX]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### HTLV-1 persistence and the oncogenesis of adult T-cell leukemia / lymphoma [^114mG33x]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

The strongest correlate of the risk of both HTLV-1–associated myelopathyand ATLis the PVL, that is, the percentage of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected with the virus. The PVL is usually higher than that seen in HIV-1 infection, and often exceeds 5% of PBMCs. The PVL is stable in each host within a factor of approximately fivefold but differs between individuals by more than 1000-fold. The PVL is proportional to the total number of HTLV-1 + T-cell clones in the individual, which typically lies between 10³ and 10⁵ but can exceed 10⁶. Each clone carries a single copy of the HTLV-1 provirus integrated in a unique position in the host cell genome.HTLV-1 replication does not kill the host T cell, and many infected clones can be repeatedly detected for at least 10 years. It is likely that most of them survive for the remaining lifetime of the host. This clonal longevity is key to understanding the oncogenesis of ATL.

We have previously conducted clinical trials of allogeneic hematopoietic SCT with reduced-intensity conditioning regimen (RIC) for adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL)-a disease caused by human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection and having a dismal prognosis. Long-term follow-up studies of these trials revealed that 10 of the 29 patients have survived for a median of 82 months (range, 54–100 months) after RIC, indicating a possible curability of the disease by RIC. However, we have also observed that the patterns of post-RIC changes in HTLV-1 proviral load over time among the 10 survivors were classified into three patterns. This is the first report to clarify the long-term outcomes after RIC for ATLL patients.

Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) response criteria — Complete remission requires disappearance of all disease with normal lymph nodes, extranodal masses, spleen, liver, skin, peripheral blood, and bone marrow, and each criterion must be present for at least 4 weeks; provided that < 5% of flower cells remain, complete remission is judged to have been attained if the absolute lymphocyte count, including flower cells, is < 4 × 10⁹/L. Uncertified complete remission is defined as a stable residual mass in a bulky lesion with ≥ 75% decrease in lymph nodes and extranodal masses and normal spleen, liver, skin, peripheral blood, and bone marrow. Partial remission requires regression of disease with ≥ 50% decrease in lymph nodes and extranodal masses, no increase in spleen and liver, ≥ 50% decrease in skin and peripheral blood, and bone marrow irrelevant. Stable disease is failure to attain complete/partial remission and no progressive disease, with no change in size across lymph nodes, extranodal masses, spleen, liver, and skin, and no change in peripheral blood and bone marrow. Relapsed disease or progressive disease is new or increased lesions with new or ≥ 50% increase in lymph nodes, extranodal masses, spleen and liver, ≥ 50% increase in skin, new or ≥ 50% increase in peripheral blood, and reappearance in bone marrow; where footnoted, ≥ 50% increase is defined by ≥ 50% increase from nadir in the sum of the products of measurable disease, and for peripheral blood by ≥ 50% increase from nadir in the count of flower cells and an absolute lymphocyte count, including flower cells, of > 4 × 10⁹/L.

### HTLV-1 persistent infection and ATLL oncogenesis [^117G69mZ]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is an oncogenic retrovirus; whereas HTLV-1 mainly persists in the infected host cell as a provirus, it also causes a malignancy called adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) in about 5% of infection. HTLV-1 replication is in most cases silent in vivo and viral de novo infection rarely occurs; HTLV-1 rather relies on clonal proliferation of infected T cells for viral propagation as it multiplies the number of the provirus copies. It is mechanistically elusive how leukemic clones emerge during the course of HTLV-1 infection in vivo and eventually cause the onset of ATLL. This review summarizes our current understanding of HTLV-1 persistence and oncogenesis, with the incorporation of recent cutting-edge discoveries obtained by high-throughput sequencing.

Human T-cell lymphotropic virus-I (HTLV-I) is the cause of adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma. Various viral proteins, especially, but not exclusively, Tax have been implicated in oncogenesis, mostly through in vitro studies. Tax transactivates a large and apparently ever expanding list of human genes through transcriptional factors. Elucidating not only the pathways but also the timing of action of HTLV proteins is important for understanding the pathogenesis and development of new treatments.

### HTLV-1 persistence and the oncogenesis of adult T-cell leukemia / lymphoma [^111DHztb]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

HTLV-1

Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus, distantly related to HIV-1. It has been present in the human population for more than 20 000 years, and is estimated to infect at least 10 million people globally, but the true number is likely to be greater because systematic epidemiology has not been carried out in some large areas of endemic HTLV-1 infection. Although HTLV-1 mainly infects CD4 + (helper) T cells, ∼5% of the proviral load (PVL) is present in CD8 + (cytotoxic) T cells; the adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) clone is typically a CD4 + cell. The virus induces a T helper cell 1–like phenotype in the infected cell, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of the inflammatory disease HTLV-1–associated myelopathy. The virus is almost 100% cell associated, and infection is propagated both within and between individuals through a specialized cell-to-cell contact called the virological synapse. The infection is, therefore, spread in the population by the transfer of lymphocytes via 2 main routes: breastfeeding and sexual intercourse; transfer of cellular blood products (including occupational exposure) and solid organ transplantationaccount for a small proportion of cases. Three closely related retroviruses that infect humans have been discovered: HTLV-2 infection is endemic to certain indigenous populationsand HTLV-3 and HTLV-4, present in nonhuman primates in sub-Saharan Africa, infect humans only sporadically. However, none of these viruses appear to cause malignant disease in humans.

### Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I-associated adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma: new directions in clinical research [^116p4SqJ]. Clinical Cancer Research (2014). Low credibility.

Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) is a distinct malignancy of regulatory T cell (Treg)/TH2 cells caused by human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1), with a high frequency of expression of CD3/CD4/CD25/CCR4 and FoxP3 in about half of the cells. However, in primary ATL cells, although expression of the virus, including the Tax oncoprotein, appears just after an in vitro culture, integration sites of the provirus into the host genome are random, and chromosomal/genetic abnormalities are complex. ATL is thus a single disease entity that is caused by HTLV-1 and possesses diverse molecular features. The clinical features and prognosis of ATL vary, and this has led to subtypes classified into four categories: acute, lymphomatous, chronic, and smoldering types, based on lactate dehydrogenase and calcium values and organ involvement. Approximately 15 to 20 million individuals are infected with HTLV-1 worldwide, 1.1 million of whom reside in Japan, and the annual incidence of ATL has been estimated to be approximately 1,000. HTLV-1 infection early in life, mainly from breast feeding, is crucial for the development of ATL. The age-specific occurrence of ATL and complex genome abnormalities that accumulate with disease progression suggest a multistep carcinogenesis model following HTLV-1 infection. Various treatment options are available for ATL and consist of watchful waiting for indolent ATL, intensive chemotherapy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for aggressive ATL, and a combination of IFNα and zidovudine for ATL with leukemic manifestation. Several promising new agents, including an anti-CCR4 antibody, are currently undergoing clinical trials associated with translational research.

### Monitoring molecular response in adult T-cell leukemia by high-throughput sequencing analysis of HTLV-1 clonality [^1152RfiL]. Leukemia (2017). Low credibility.

In summary, this pilot study shows that molecular knowledge with regards to HTLV-1 clonal architecture and follow-up of the dominant leukemic clone over time enable a more reliable definition of remission and a better estimate of molecular response in ATL patients. HTS can reveal ATLs refractory to first-line therapy or detect molecular relapse in patients that achieve hematological remission. Additionally, the method can identify 5′LTR-variants, clone switch upon progression and is superior to any conventional method available thus far. The optimized protocol overcomes previous limitations in terms of sensitivity, cost and hands-on time, facilitating implementation in the clinic. Our data support its incorporation in routine follow-up, providing clinicians with a tool to rapidly identify patients who do not benefit from standard therapy and should be enrolled in alternative or novel upfront strategies. It is possible to integrate this approach into next-generation sequencing-based mutation profiling schemes that are increasingly used for monitoring patients with hematological malignancies. As such, although small scale, the study by itself provides a strong proof-of-concept to build on and establishes the rationale for further clinical evaluation. Efforts of the HTLV-1 community will be needed to define how HTS clonality data should be reported for clinical utilization and delineate the optimal time/interval for assessing molecular response in standardized care.

Altogether, our observations highlight the great molecular heterogeneity within patients who achieve complete clinical and hematological remission, underlining the need for revisiting response criteria for ATL. We propose this HTS approach as a method to detect minimal residual disease, estimate graft-versus-ATL effect after allogeneic stem cell transplantation and evaluate clinical trials that remain critical to improving outcomes.

### Revised adult T-Cell leukemia-lymphoma international consensus meeting report [^112rBnp3]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

PERSPECTIVES

Whereas the backbone of ATL treatment has remained largely unchanged since the 2009 consensus report, there have been several advances in the clinical management of these patients, particularly for patients treated in Japan. These include the increased role of allo-HSCT after first-line treatment and the use of mogamulizumab and lenalidomide as novel single agents, both licensed in Japan. The precise roles of these agents and others, such as brentuximab vedotin for CD30 + ATL, remains incompletely understood. Clinical trials are required to understand the roles of these agents in the front-line setting, including indolent subtypes, in maintenance therapy for transplantation-ineligible patients, in maintenance therapy after allo-HSCT, and in the prevention or treatment of CNS disease. As ATL is characterized by early relapses, clinical trials of therapies that might eradicate minimal residual disease are warranted. Preliminary data from France have shown that combining arsenic trioxide with low-dose interferon is feasible and an effective consolidation therapy that is capable of selectively eliminating the malignant clone and restoring oligoclonal architecture. This has raised hopes that the extinction of viral replication (AZT) and Tax degradation (arsenic/IFN) may eradicate the disease. Addition of arsenic trioxide to IFN/AZT was promising in a phase II study for the treatment of chronic ATL.

Since 2009, there has been more widespread use of PET/CT in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. ATL is frequently associated with extranodal disease, and it might be recommended that PET/CT be used at diagnosis, where available, and that PET/CT assessment should be incorporated in future studies. The significance of negative interim PET/CT should be evaluated as it is not yet clear how this might affect treatment strategy.

Reported prognostic factors at diagnosis (eg, IRF4 expression, TP53 mutation/deletion, and other genetic markers) require validation in the context of treatment with AZT/IFN, chemotherapy, or active monitoring to assist in tailored treatment decisions. New methodologies to detect clonal HTLV minimal residual disease have been established using next-generation high-throughput sequencing methods, and the challenge now remains to validate these observations within clinical trials and bring them into the clinical domain in a rapid, cost-effective manner.

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes of caribbean patients with adult T-Cell lymphoma / leukemia at two affiliated New York city hospitals [^111m4Knt]. JCO Global Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia (ATL) is a rare and aggressive mature peripheral T-cell lymphoma caused by the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), which in America reflects migration patterns from endemic areas. ATL incidence in Japan, the Caribbean, and central Brooklyn in the United States, which has a sizeable number of immigrants from the Caribbean, is about 86, 20, and 3.2 cases per 100,000 people, respectively.

ATL is classified into four distinct subtypes on the basis of the Shimoyama criteria: smoldering, chronic, acute, and lymphomatous. Smoldering and chronic ATL follow an indolent course with median survival of 4 to 5 years, whereas acute and lymphomatous subtypes have a dismal prognosis with less than 1-year survival despite aggressive therapy. Given the absence of a standard treatment for ATL, a clinical trial is the preferred option, although the most common strategy remains doxorubicin-based chemotherapy. -

Most ATL literature is derived from the Japanese population and less is known about the Caribbean population.- Our institutions at State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center and Kings County Hospital serve a predominantly Caribbean population in central Brooklyn, New York. We describe here the clinicopathologic characteristics and treatment outcomes of our Caribbean patients with ATL, an under-represented population with high unmet medical needs.

### HTLV-1 persistence and the oncogenesis of adult T-cell leukemia / lymphoma [^113ADqoD]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Two chief factors are associated with the acquisition of driver mutations and the disproportionate expansion of a clone that culminates in ATL: the duration of infection and a high PVL. As outlined earlier, a high PVL is made up of a large number of HTLV-1 + clones: the clones appear to survive indefinitely and turn over more frequently than uninfected CD4 + T cells; that is, they are effectively immortalized in vivo. Furthermore, most cases of ATL in immunocompetent individuals arise in those infected during infancy, usually via breastfeeding. Each clone has therefore passed through a large number of mitotic events in a person aged > 60 years who is infected with HTLV-1. Each mitotic event is accompanied by a low frequency of mutations, most commonly single-nucleotide misincorporations, known as replicative errors. Mutations therefore commonly arise, probably randomly, in HTLV-1–infected T-cell clonesand do not necessarily presage ATL; only certain mutations contribute to the oncogenesis. Tomasetti and Vogelstein, showed that the risk of malignant transformation in a wide range of cell types is strongly correlated with the total number of mitoses that the cell lineage has undergone. Therefore, a simple explanation for the progressive generation of the oncogenic driver mutations that culminate in ATL is mitotic replicative error. The probability that 1 or more infected clones undergoes malignant transformation will depend on the number of clones present in that person and on the time since infection, explaining the observed correlations with age and with the PVL. The trajectory of the PVL and the emergence of an ATL clone are shown schematically in Figure 1.

Each HTLV-1–infected T-cell clone has a proliferative rate and, therefore, a malignant potential that is partly determined by the proviral integration site, the antigen specificity of the clone, and the epigenetic modifications and mitotic errors that it acquires. There is, therefore, a continuum of potential for malignant transformation across the whole population of infected cells in each individual. Consequently, there are well described cases in which > 1 clone has transformed,: this is most clearly observed among patients in whom the dominant clone has been eliminated, either by drug treatment or, in rare cases, by spontaneous regression, and in whom a second clone becomes fully transformed. This phenomenon of clonal succession, in which 1 clone is replaced by a second, unrelated clone, differs fundamentally from the progressive subclonal diversification of 1 clone that commonly occurs in solid tumors.

Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) virology testing — HTLV-1 diagnostics and confirmation: HTLV-1 integration patterns have been reported to have clinical and prognostic implications for ATLL, and HTLV-1 serology is essential to distinguish ATLL from cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, including mycosis fungoides (MF), and PTCL, especially in endemic areas; HTLV-1 serology should be assessed by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and, if positive, confirmed by western blot; if the result from western blot is indeterminate, then polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for HTLV-1 can be performed; monoclonal integration of HTLV-1 proviral DNA occurs in all cases of ATLL.

### T-cell lymphomas, version 2.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^111edTfL]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

T-prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) workup should include a comprehensive medical history and physical examination with careful evaluation of lymph nodes, spleen, and liver plus a complete skin examination and performance status; laboratory assessments should include complete blood count (CBC) with differential, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In a retrospective study of 119 patients with T-PLL, the presence of pleural effusion, elevated LDH, and low hemoglobin levels were associated with shorter overall survival. Bone marrow evaluation is generally unnecessary because peripheral blood smears and immunophenotyping are sufficient to establish diagnosis; however, bone marrow assessments may be useful in some cases and are required to document remission. CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be performed at the time of initial workup, and PET/CT scans may be useful in selected cases though standard uptake value (SUV) is variable in T-PLL. If anthracyclines or anthracenediones are being considered, a multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan or an echocardiogram should be obtained to evaluate cardiac function, particularly for older patients or those with prior cardiac disease. Serology for human T-lymphotropic leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) may be useful to distinguish adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma from T-PLL (HTLV-1 should be negative), and if serology is positive by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA), a confirmatory Western blot should be performed. Screening for active infections and cytomegalovirus (CMV) serology should be strongly considered before starting alemtuzumab alone or in combination regimens, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing is recommended for patients eligible for transplant.

### Distinct characteristics and social determinants in adult T-cell leukaemia / lymphoma patients at a tertiary cancer centre in Canada [^113fTqkS]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Patients

We conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with ATLL identified from the Cancer Registry at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. Patients were included based on the pathological diagnosis of ATLL along with a positive HTLV‐1 antibody test. Additional data were collected from patient charts, including geographic origin, ATLL subtype, initial treatment and response to therapy. The subtype of ATLL was classified by Shimoyama's criteria. The research was approved by the Research Ethics Board of the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre — University Health Network.

Marginalization analysis

We applied the 2021 Ontario Marginalization Index (ON‐Marg), an administrative index using variables obtained from census data, to this cohort in order to examine four different dimensions of marginalization: households and dwellings, material resources, age and labour force, racialized and newcomer populations. These dimensions encompass social and health‐related factors and can be assigned to individuals based on the postal code of their residence. The ON‐Marg index is stable over time and reflective of the Ontario population. The dimension related to households and dwellings measures family and neighbourhood stability. The material resources' dimension captures poverty and the inability to access basic material needs. The age and labour force dimension reflects disability and lack of employment income. The racialized and newcomer population's dimension relates to the population of recent immigrants and those who self‐identify as a visible minority. Data were analysed at the dissemination area level, the smallest geographical area available for population‐level data (between 400 and 700 persons per dissemination area). Postal codes and addresses were linked to a dissemination area using data from Statistics Canada. Higher scores on each dimension correspond to areas that are the most marginalized.

Statistical analysis

Kaplan–Meier estimates were used to calculate progression‐free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Univariate analysis was conducted to identify potential risk factors for outcomes. Hazard ratios (HRs) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with the Cox proportional hazard model for OS and PFS. The following variables were analysed: age at diagnosis, sex, race, central nervous system (CNS) involvement at diagnosis and/or relapse, induction chemotherapy (CHOP‐like regimens vs. antiviral therapy alone), maintenance antiviral treatment following systemic chemotherapy (maintenance treatment) and receipt of allo‐HSCT.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^113ub5ko]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### Molecular and cellular aspects of HTLV-1 associated leukemogenesis in vivo [^111mDMVH]. Leukemia (2003). Low credibility.

Most cancers and leukemias are preceded by a prolonged period of clinical latency during which cellular, chromosomal and molecular aberrations help move normal cell towards the malignant phenotype. The problem is that premalignant cells are usually indistinguishable from their normal counterparts, thereby ruling out the possibility to investigate the events that govern early leukemogenesis in vivo. Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a T cell malignancy that occurs after a 40-60-year period of clinical latency in about 3–5% of HTLV-1-infected individuals. ATLL cells are monoclonally expanded and harbor an integrated provirus. A persistent oligo/polyclonal expansion of HTLV-1-bearing cells has been shown to precede ATLL, supporting the fact that in ATLL tumor cells arise from a clonally expanding non-malignant cell. It is possible to isolate infected, ie preleukemic, cells during the premalignant asymptomatic phase of the infection, thus providing an exceptional system to study the mechanisms underlying human cancers. Here we review some of the consequences of HTLV-1 on its host cell in vivo, at different stages of infection.

### HTLV-1 persistence and the oncogenesis of adult T-cell leukemia / lymphoma [^114DS9jT]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Evolution of the ATL clone, abnormal oligoclonality, and early detection of disease

The unique genomic integration site of the HTLV-1 provirus can serve as a clone-specific marker. Consequently, in some cases in which samples of PBMCs from an individual have been stored before the clinical presentation of ATL, the same clone can be identified, and the timing of the successively acquired driver mutations can be documented. Using this approach, Rowan et aland Wolf et alreported the time course of appearance of driver mutations in the premalignant clone in 6 incident cases of ATL, from each of whom several PBMC samples were stored before the emergence of the disease. The results showed that, although the mutational burden in the premalignant clone typically increased in the 6 months before diagnosis, driver mutations could be detected in the clone up to 10 years earlier. Yamagishi et alalso reported the sequential appearance of mutations during the evolution of the malignant clone, and these authors reviewedthe contribution of both genetic and epigenetic modifications to this evolution. The evolution of the ATL clone is depicted schematically in Figure 1.

### T-cell lymphomas, version 2.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^114YRdVa]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

NCCN Adult T‑Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma — Lymphoma subtype treatment specifies first‑line therapy as clinical trial or systemic therapy, with initial response assessed after 2 cycles and branches to response or no response. After a response, additional therapy is to continue first‑line treatment or consider allogeneic HCT; if there is no response, options include clinical trial, second‑line therapy (ATLL‑D), or best supportive care. For response assessment, consider allogeneic HCT; responses include CR, unconfirmed CR, and PR, and if nodal disease is present, repeat C/A/P/neck CT with contrast or FDG‑PET/CT and repeat relevant baseline imaging studies. Notes include that CNS disease is common and prophylaxis is recommended, antiviral therapy alone is not effective, and the long‑term efficacy of initial therapy regimens is limited with allogeneic HCT potentially a curative option for some patients. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Monitoring molecular response in adult T-cell leukemia by high-throughput sequencing analysis of HTLV-1 clonality [^115UtCGR]. Leukemia (2017). Low credibility.

The development of ATL is associated with the emergence of a dominant clone uniquely identified by the proviral integration site within the host genome, with an underlying polyclonal population of infected cells of varying abundance. In the majority of ATL cases examined to date, the presumed malignant clone carries a single proviral integration. In this study, we explored the benefit of an optimized high-throughput sequencing (HTS) clonality method as a quantitative molecular approach to monitor the malignant clone identified at diagnosis and better evaluate therapeutic response. The method enables the genome-wide mapping of HTLV-1 integration sites and the simultaneous quantification of the abundance of the corresponding clones. It includes several critical modifications that overcome the limitations of previously reported protocols, increasing sensitivity, facilitating multiplexing, and significantly reducing both the cost and hands-on time (Supplementary Methods). As a proof-of-concept, we analyzed retrospective longitudinal samples of five ATL patients diagnosed with a leukemic subtype who all achieved complete hematological remission upon induction therapy. Although all five patients eventually relapsed, the duration of hematological remission and the clinical course were variable between patients (Supplementary Table 1). Two patients achieved a protracted clinical remission of 5.8 and 2.4 years (ATL11 and ATL60; Figures 1a and b), while three patients relapsed after a significantly shorter remission of 4.3, 5.3 and 3.7 months for ATL7, ATL14 and ATL100, respectively (Table 1, Figures 1c–e).

Diagnosis coding under this system uses a different number of digits and some other changes, but the format is very much the same as ICD-9-CM. The U. S. Department of Health and Human Services has mandated industry-wide adoption of ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS code sets by Oct. 1, 2011. ICD-10-CMS will affect all components of the healthcare industry. Ambulatory surgery centers will not be affected by ICD-10-PCS unless they are utilizing ICD-9-CM volume 3 for inpatient procedures. The two major changes in the ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM code sets are structure and detail. The codes will move from a numeric five-character size to an alphanumeric seven-character size. At current count, there are approximately 17, 000 ICD-9-CM codes and the possibility of 155, 000 ICD-10-CM/PCS codes.

### Epidemiology and survival of patients with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia [^116e5rtZ]. Blood Cancer Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Due to the rarity of the disease, real-world and epidemiological data on T-PLL are scarce. Better insights into T-PLL occurrence and real-world treatment data could enhance understanding and inform future advancements. To date, the most comprehensive analyses are from two US-based studies, including a cohort of 119 cases in an institutional report and 1 522 cases in a recently published SEER analysis.

Here, we provide population-based data on T-PLL incidence, survival, and treatment patterns within Germany, complementing the sparse existing epidemiological data and contributing to a broader knowledge of disease patterns.

This study utilized data from all 16 German federal states, obtained through their respective epidemiological and clinical state cancer registries as well as the German Center for Cancer Registry Data. By law, treating physicians are required to report diagnoses, treatment modifications, relapses, and deaths to their respective state cancer registries. Survival data are harmonized with local population registers. Patients with T-PLL were identified by the respective ICD-10GM-Code C91.6 and ICD-O-3-Code 9834/3 between 2016 and 2021. Current population data were retrieved from the Federal Statistical Office of Germany. Incidence and mortality rates were calculated using data from the German Center for Cancer Registry Data, including adult cases identified through death certificates (n = 305). Age-standardization was performed using the 2013 European Standard Population. Age- and therapy-specific survival analyses were based solely on data directly obtained from the state cancer registries resulting in a smaller cohort (n = 245). As of the time of analysis, 2021 data were not available from five state registries. To account for potentially incomplete data and outliers, average incidence rates were computed as the mean from 2017 to 2020.

Out of 153 newly referred human T-lymphotropic virus type I infected patients, 42 (27%) had 5% or more abnormal lymphocytes, consistent with the diagnosis of smoldering adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. The abnormal lymphocyte percentage was higher in patients with human T-lymphotropic virus type I associated inflammatory disease compared with asymptomatic carriers (P = 0.006). Over 4.5 years median follow up, 4 patients, all with 10 or more human T-lymphotropic virus type I DNA copies/100 peripheral blood mononuclear cells at presentation, but only one with 5% or more abnormal lymphocytes at presentation, developed adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Thus, high pre-morbid human T-lymphotropic virus type I proviral load, rather than fulfilment of the classification criteria for smoldering adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, was associated with an increased risk of developing aggressive adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.

### Tax unleashed: fulminant tax-positive adult T-cell leukemia / lymphoma after failed allogeneic stem cell transplantation [^112vPQAJ]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2009). Low credibility.

The human retrovirus HTLV-1 causes Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATLL), a malignant lymphoproliferative disease of CD4+ T cells of dismal prognosis, in 3–5% of the 20 million infected individuals (Proietti et al.(1) and Bazarbachi et al.(2)). Infection with HTLV-1 represents a prototypical model of virus-mediated oncogenesis by virtue of the viral transactivator Tax, a potent oncogenic protein that exerts pleiotropic effects through its ability to deregulate the transcription of various cellular genes and signal transduction pathways and inhibit DNA repair enzymes, which are critical for T-cell homeostasis and genetic stability (Matsuoka and Jeang(3)) (et Boxus Retrovirology 2009). However, the oncogenic potential of Tax remains a conundrum. Tax protein expression is undetectable using conventional methods in freshly harvested ATLL cells and in non-malignant infected CD4+ T cells (Furukawa et al.(4)) but is up regulated after only a few hours of culture in vitro (Hanon et al.(5)). These observations strongly suggest that a host-derived mechanism is able to either actively repress the transcription of viral proteins in vivo or refrain the emergence of Tax-expressing cells, which would have a growth advantage. We report herein a unique case of CD4+ T-cell leukemia highly expressing Tax following rejection of an allogenic peripheral blood stem cell graft for an HTLV-1 associated lymphoma.

### Epidemiological features and outcomes of HTLV-1 carriers diagnosed with cancer: a retrospective cohort study in an endemic country [^1128fVNB]. JCO Global Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Design and Population

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with hematologic or solid neoplasms and with available HTLV-1 serology test results from January 2006 to December 2019 at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases (Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplasicas, INEN in Spanish). The INEN is a tertiary referral cancer center located in Lima, the capital city of Peru, that belongs to the public health insurance network of the Ministry of Health, which provides coverage to about 80% of insured patients. As a national referral center, INEN receives patients from all over the country for diagnosis, management, and follow-up care. All patients were tested for HTLV infection using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as part of the initial workup for cancer diagnosis. Confirmation of HTLV-1 infection via Western blot was only available in some cases given the lack of insurance coverage for such procedure and high health care cost.

The medical records of the patients were identified through the electronic health record system of the INEN. We included patients age 20 years or older with a malignant pathology diagnosis. Hematologic malignancies were classified according to the 2016 WHO Classification system. If a patient was diagnosed with cancer in another center, the histopathological diagnosis was reviewed and confirmed by the INEN's pathologist. Exclusion criteria were as follows: lost or destroyed medical records, incomplete or insufficient data for pathological characterization, patients with a diagnosis of carcinoma in situ, and patients with undetermined HTLV-1 serology results. All patients were linked to the National Identity and Civil Status Registry for vital status verification.

Variables

Demographic information, cancer diagnosis, and tumor staging (when applicable) are available through the electronic system. The clinical data abstraction was completed through a manual review of medical records. Variables included age, sex, region of birth, education level, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, tumor staging, cancer diagnosis, and vital status. Cancer staging for solid neoplasms, Hodgkin lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) was performed according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system 7th edition, and the Shimoyamaclassification for ATL. Cancer diagnoses were grouped on the basis of sex-specific malignancies and whether a tumor was deemed solid or hematologic. The cancer diagnosis categories were breast and female organs, cervix, male genital organs, other solid, non-ATL hematologic malignancies, and ATL. Cervical cancer was analyzed independently, given its high prevalence in our study population.

### Quantification of T cell clonality in human T cell leukaemia virus type-1 carriers can detect the development of adult T cell leukaemia early [^1129FU3L]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There is an urgent clinical need for new approaches to improve the dismal prognosis of adult T cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATL). The development of novel, well-tolerated therapeutics which can target both pre-malignant and malignant cells has raised the possibility of preventing ATL by treating those who are most at risk of transformation in the premalignant stage. These individuals can be identified through serological testing for human T cell leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), who have a 5% lifetime risk of developing ATL. ATL occurs almost exclusively in carriers who have a high PVL, and thus have a ~20% lifetime risk of ATL. Transformation generally occurs after many years of chronic infection, at a median age of ~50 in African-Caribbean and African–American patients. Perinatal exposure to HTLV-1, family history of ATL, smoking, and high proviral load (PVL, ≥ 4 copies of HTLV-1 per 100 PBMCs) are well-established risk factors for transformation. We hypothesised that a novel diagnostic tool that identifies the premalignant stage of ATL in high PVL carriers could further risk stratify this group, by detecting the presence of premalignant cells prior to the onset of symptoms, thus enabling prediction of transformation and justifying therapeutic intervention to prevent disease development.

Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) response assessment defines complete response (CR) as disappearance of disease with an absolute lymphocyte count, including flower cells, < 4 × 10⁹/L in the peripheral blood; partial response (PR) requires ≥ 50% reduction in measurable disease, ≥ 50% reduction in skin involvement, and ≥ 50% reduction in absolute lymphocyte counts without new lesions or organ enlargement. Stable disease (SD) is failure to achieve CR or PR with no progressive disease (PD); PD includes new lesions or ≥ 50% increase in lymph node or extranodal disease, ≥ 50% increase in skin involvement, 50% increase from nadir in flower cells, or an increase in absolute lymphocyte count, including flower cells, of > 4 × 10⁹/L. Each criterion should be observed for a minimal period of 4 weeks to qualify, and an unconfirmed complete response (CRu) is defined as ≥ 75% reduction in tumor size with residual mass and an absolute lymphocyte count, including flower cells, of < 4 × 10⁹/L. The usefulness of PET or PET/CT has not been evaluated for ATLL response assessment.

### Loss of interleukin-10 activates innate immunity to eradicate adult T-cell leukemia-initiating cells [^115v1Caq]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is a rare hematologic malignancy with a dismal prognosisand is initiated by the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV- 1). ATL develops after an extended latency period and is preceded by oligoclonal expansion of activated HTLV-1-infected T cells, as a result of initial expression of the viral transactivator Tax. Tax modulates several cellular pathwaysand is a powerful oncogene; transgenic expression of Tax alone in mice induces murine ATL. Although Tax protein expression is very low in most patients with ATL, long-term survival of the bulk of ATL cells may depend on transient bursts of Tax expression in some, if not the majority, of ATL cells and/or in HTLV-1-infected nonmalignant cells. This renders Tax an attractive therapeutic target, which has been further asserted by the efficacy of a Tax peptide-pulsed dendritic cell vaccine in treating patients with Tax-positive ATL.

Zidovudine (AZT) and interferon-alpha (IFN) have demonstrated clinical efficacy in patients with leukemic subtypes of ATL. However, the disease in several patients is primary or secondary resistant to the therapy and progresses or relapses even after a long period of disease control. This highlights the need for more effective therapies to increase the response rate, improve long-term disease control and, most importantly, eradicate the disease. One approach to improve therapy is targeting ATL leukemia-initiating cells (LIC). Arsenic trioxide (AS) and IFN, in combination, degrade Tax and selectively induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in ATL cells. Patients with ATL treated with a combination of AS, IFNand AZT achieved complete remissionsand some of them had a long-lasting responses, even after treatment withdrawal, suggesting an effect of the treatment on ATL LIC. Similarly, a recent study showed unprecedented prolonged remissions of ATL in patients who received AS/IFN/AZT as a consolidation therapy, with molecular studies demonstrating disappearance of a predominant malignant clone in one patient. Although relapse occurred later, it was due to a different clone. Likewise, in Tax-driven murine ATL, AS and IFNcooperate to cure leukemia through an immediate loss of LIC, and a delayed exhaustion of tumor cells, proving the feasibility of selective targeting of ATL LIC. Of note, LIC activity was measured and defined as the ability of these cells to initiate leukemia in serial transplantation assays.

### Editorial commentary: human T-Cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy / tropical spastic paraparesis [^115iWYBE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is an oncogenic retrovirus that is transmitted from mother to child, particularly through prolonged breastfeeding; between sexual partners through unprotected intercourse; and from donors to recipients through transfusion and transplantation. Thirty-five years after its discovery, screening for HTLV-1 infection is at best patchy and mostly nonexistent. There are 2 main reasons for this: first, the most recent estimate of the prevalence of HTLV-1 is 5–10 million persons worldwide, with the important caveat that 86% of the global population is data poor in this regard; second, there is a perception that disease related to this virus, which has coexisted with humankind for 60 000 years, is uncommon. Whether this reputation is justified requires up-to-date and reliable sero- and clinical epidemiology.

The lifetime risk, among carriers, of adult-T-cell leukemia/lymphoma is 2%–6% regardless of the region of study. However, for HTLV-1–associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), more varied risks are reported with strong hints that, apart from the route of infection, ethnicity and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types impact significantly on risk. Furthermore, HTLV-1 has been associated with a range of other inflammatory manifestations affecting many organs but particularly eyes, lungs, and thyroid and with increased susceptibility to a number of infections, most notably Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfestation syndrome. (Given the high mortality of this latter condition, it is our policy to screen all HTLV-1 carriers who have resided in endemic areas for S. stercoralis). These diseases are much less well recognized even than HAM/TSP, with no data on incidence or prevalence among carriers. How, then, are we to judge the global disease burden of HTLV-1 infection?

Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) first-line therapy depends on subtype, with smoldering and chronic subtypes usually managed with watchful waiting until symptomatic disease, whereas acute and lymphoma subtypes typically require immediate therapy. Among primarily treatment-naive aggressive ATLL, zidovudine plus interferon-alfa produced an overall response rate (ORR) of 58% to 80% and complete response (CR) rates of 20% to 50%, but outcomes were poorer in previously treated relapsed/refractory disease with ORR 17% to 67%. In a meta-analysis of 254 patients, first-line therapy comprised antiviral therapy (n = 75; zidovudine and IFN-alfa in 97% of cases), chemotherapy alone (n = 77; CHOP in 86% of cases), or chemotherapy followed by maintenance antiviral therapy (n = 55). Most of the patients (n = 207 evaluable) had acute (47%) or lymphoma (41%) subtypes; among those who received first-line antiviral therapy alone, 60% had the acute subtype, whereas among those who received chemotherapy alone, 62% had the lymphoma subtype. In patients with available survival data and recorded first-line therapy (n = 207), the 5-year OS rates were 46%, 20%, and 12%, respectively, for patients who received first-line antiviral therapy alone, chemotherapy alone, chemotherapy followed by maintenance antiviral therapy.

LYMPHOMA TYPE OF ATL, EXTRANODAL PRIMARY CUTANEOUS VARIANT

Cutaneous lesions of ATL are variable and may resemble those of mycosis fungoides (MF), with mostly an indolent course, but some are associated with a poor prognosis. Therefore, ATL should be distinguished from cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, including MF, and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), especially in endemic areas, by HTLV-1 serology and genomic analysis as necessary. In a large Japanese retrospective study of ATL with cutaneous lesions, 5-year survival rate was 0% in nodulotumoral and erythrodermic types compared with more than 40% in multipapular, plaque, and patch types. In the 2009 report, primary cutaneous tumoral (PCT) ATL without leukemic, lymph node, and other lesions was frequently included within smoldering ATL and was considered a poor prognostic factor by univariable analyses. PCT-ATL is distinct, with cutaneous lesions appearing as tumors that grow rapidly and whose histology shows large, atypical cells with a high proliferative index(Fig 1). In this revision, we agreed that watchful waiting is inappropriate in PCT-ATL as it frequently has a progressive and fatal clinical course that resembles aggressive ATL. Recently, Japanese hematologists, dermatologists, and pathologists proposed the entity lymphoma type of ATL, extranodal primary cutaneous variant, which shows a poor prognosis and includes PCT-ATL. Macroscopic findings are mostly nodulotumoral and pathologic findings show high-grade T-cell lymphoma type (pleomorphic, medium, or large size cells) with prominent perivascular infiltration and scant epidermotropism. Such cases could be considered for immediate treatment per aggressive ATL protocols with intensive chemotherapy with or without skin-directed therapies, including phototherapy or radiation followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (allo-HSCT; see Allo-HSCT for Agressive ATL section) or interferon with zidovudine (IFN/AZT) with or without arsenic trioxide with or without skin-directed therapies. It should be noted, however, that precisely defining cutaneous tumoral type is difficult — size, height, number, with or without ulceration or subcutaneous extension, and so on — although the nodulotumoral type was defined as nodules or tumors with diameters > 1 cm and the multipapular type as multiple papules with a diameter < 1 cm. Furthermore, other types of cutaneous lesions can be aggressive. Papules, nodules, and tumors are considered as solid, palpable, and raised lesions with a diameter of < 1 cm, < 3 cm, and ≥ 3, respectively. Papules usually occur as multiple lesions, whereas tumor(s) may be seen even as a solitary lesion. Recently, a prognostic index (PI) for chronic- and smoldering-type ATL identified soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) levels as an independent prognostic factor. sIL-2R may therefore be useful but requires additional prospective validation. Additional clinicopathologic and molecular studies are warranted in cutaneous ATL, including the application of recent new agents for MF and PTCL.

T‑prolymphocytic leukemia (T‑PLL) initial workup — The initial workup for T‑PLL should comprise a comprehensive medical history and physical examination, including careful evaluation of lymph nodes, spleen, and liver, in addition to a complete skin examination and evaluation of performance status. Laboratory assessments should include standard blood work including complete blood count (CBC) with differential, a comprehensive metabolic panel, as well as measurements of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In a retrospective study of 119 patients with T‑PLL, the presence of pleural effusion, elevated LDH, and low hemoglobin levels were associated with shorter OS. Bone marrow evaluation is generally unnecessary, as evaluation of peripheral blood smears and immunophenotyping are sufficient to establish the diagnosis of T‑PLL; however, bone marrow assessments may be useful in some cases and are required to document remission. CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should also be performed at the time of initial workup, and PET/CT scans may also be useful in selected cases though standard uptake value (SUV) is variable in T‑PLL. If treatment regimens containing anthracyclines or anthracenediones are being considered, a multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram should be obtained for the evaluation of cardiac function, particularly for older patients or for patients with a prior history of cardiac disease. Serology for detection of antibodies against the human T‑lymphotropic leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV‑1) may be useful to distinguish adult T‑cell leukemia/lymphoma from T‑PLL (HTLV‑1 should be negative in the latter), and if serology shows positivity by enzyme‑linked immunoassay (ELISA), a confirmatory Western blot should be performed. Screening for active infections and cytomegalovirus (CMV) serology should be strongly considered prior to initiation of treatment with alemtuzumab alone or in combination regimens, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing is recommended for patients eligible for transplant.

### Small number of HTLV-1-positive cells frequently remains during complete remission after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation that are heterogeneous in origin among cases with adult T-cell leukemia / lymphoma [^116RDMJP]. Leukemia (2007). Low credibility.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) can provide long-term remission for patients with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) caused by human retrovirus, human T-lymphocyte virus (HTLV-1). To understand how HTLV-1-positive cells including ATLL cells were suppressed by allo-HSCT, we examined HTLV-1 provirus load and residual ATLL cells in peripheral blood of transplant recipients using PCR-based tests. We found that the copy number of HTLV-1 genome, called provirus, became very small in number after allo-HSCT; however, in most cases, provirus did not disappear even among long-term survivors. Tumor-specific PCR tests demonstrated that most of HTLV-1-positive cells that remained long after transplantation were not primary ATLL cells but donor-derived HTLV-1-positive cells. We also found a case having very low amount of residual disease in peripheral blood even long after transplantation. There was only one recipient in whom we failed to show the presence of HTLV-1 genome and antibody against HTLV-1 even with an extensive search, which strongly suggested the elimination of HTLV-1 after allo-HSCT. These results demonstrated that after allo-HSCT the small amount of residual HTLV-1-positive cells were heterogeneous in origin and that long-term disease control for ATLL could be obtained without the complete elimination of HTLV-1.

### Development of a modified prognostic index for patients with aggressive adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma aged 70 years or younger: possible risk-adapted management strategies including allogeneic transplantation [^117BACY5]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) is a distinct type of peripheral T-cell lymphoma caused by human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1). Patients with aggressive ATL such as the acute or lymphoma subtype have dismal outcomes, even with intensive chemotherapy. – Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a promising treatment option for patients with aggressive ATL. – However, there is still no consensus on whether all patients with aggressive ATL should undergo upfront allo-HSCT, because there is no direct comparison of clinical outcomes among non-transplanted and transplanted patients using one large database. In addition, risk stratification of aggressive ATL in transplant eligible patients is not yet well established, mostly due to a lack of prospective randomized studies.

A retrospective study of 807 patients in Japan described a prognostic index for acute and lymphoma type ATL (ATL-PI) that included stage, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS), age, albumin, and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) level. However, in that study, allo-HSCT recipients were excluded to establish ATL-PI, and a large proportion of patients older than 70 years, who are usually not candidates for allo-HSCT, were included. In patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), analysis of cytogenetic abnormalities and specific genes is widely used to improve risk stratification and identify patients who can benefit from upfront allo-HSCT. Such a prognostication system is needed for patients with ATL who are transplant eligible in order to reasonably consider the use of upfront allo-HSCT. Herein, we aim to develop a new prognostic index in patients with aggressive ATL aged 70 years or younger using a large database of 1,191 non-transplanted patients and 601 allo-HSCT recipients, thus making it possible to assess the impact of allo-HSCT in each risk group within this single database.

### Treatment and survival among 1594 patients with ATL [^117UuxsF]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is a malignancy of mature T lymphocytes caused by human T-lymphotropic virus type I. Intensive combination chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have been introduced since the previous Japanese nationwide survey was performed in the late 1980s. In this study, we delineated the current features and management of ATL in Japan. The clinical data were collected retrospectively from the medical records of patients diagnosed with ATL between 2000 and 2009, and a total of 1665 patients' records were submitted to the central office from 84 institutions in Japan. Seventy-one patients were excluded; 895, 355, 187, and 157 patients with acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering types, respectively, remained. The median survival times were 8.3, 10.6, 31.5, and 55.0 months, and 4-year overall survival (OS) rates were 11%, 16%, 36%, and 52%, respectively, for acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering types. The number of patients with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was 227, and their median survival time and OS at 4 years after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was 5.9 months and 26%, respectively. This study revealed that the prognoses of the patients with acute and lymphoma types were still unsatisfactory, despite the recent progress in treatment modalities, but an improvement of 4-year OS was observed in comparison with the previous survey. Of note, one-quarter of patients who could undergo transplantation experienced long survival. It is also noted that the prognosis of the smoldering type was worse than expected.

Introduction

Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive spastic paralysis of the spinal cord and occurs in HTLV-1 carriers. Although most HTLV-1 carriers are asymptomatic, patients with HAM/TSP develop symptoms such as gait disturbance, bladder and bowel dysfunction, weakness, and lower limb paralysis. At least 5–10 million people worldwide are infected with HTLV-1; of these, 1.08 million people were reportedly from Japan. Among these carriers, the number of patients with HAM/TSP in Japan is estimated at approximately 3000, and the lifetime incidence of HAM/TSP is approximately 0.25% among HTLV-1 carriers. HAM/TSP is characterized by gradual progression of walking disability in approximately 70–80% of all patients and relatively rapid progression of walking disability in approximately 20% of patients within 2 years after disease onset. A small proportion of patients (< 10%) have relatively mild disease without progression. HAM/TSP is treated mainly using corticosteroids with anti-inflammatory activity and interferon-alpha (IFN-α), with immunomodulatory and antiviral activity. Although these therapeutic agents may be effective short-term, they have little effect on improving the long-term prognosis.

Mogamulizumab (KW-0761) is a humanized anti-CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) defucosylated monoclonal antibody that kills CCR4-positive T-cells via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Mogamulizumab was approved in Japan in March 2012 for the treatment of relapsed or refractory CCR4-positive adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, which is also caused by HTLV-1. Mogamulizumab was subsequently approved for relapsed or refractory CCR4-positive peripheral T-cell lymphoma, relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and chemotherapy-untreated CCR4-positive adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, combined with other antineoplastics. Outside Japan, mogamulizumab was approved for relapsed or refractory mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome in adults with a history of systemic treatment.

### Clonality analysis of HTLV-1-infected cells enhances prognostic precision in smoldering adult T-cell leukemia / lymphoma [^111VgZbU]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

HTLV-1 infects at least 5–10 million people worldwide and causes two distinct diseases: ATL and HTLV-1-associated-myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). ATL is highly aggressive, with a four-year survival rate of only 11% for the acute subtype, underscoring the urgent need for its early detection and risk stratification for effective treatment.

Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma is classified into four clinical subtypes according to Shimoyama's criteria: smoldering, chronic, acute, and lymphoma types. Patients with smoldering ATL are generally asymptomatic and are diagnosed based on the presence of > 5% abnormal lymphocytes in peripheral blood. However, prognosis varies widely. Although more than 60% progress to aggressive subtypes, others remain stable or even transition between the smoldering ATL and asymptomatic carrier (AC) states, highlighting the heterogeneity of disease pathology and clinical progression. Thus, reliable methods for predicting progression risk are urgently needed to enable risk-stratified treatment strategies.

Assessing the risk of progression from smoldering to aggressive ATL is an actively evolving field. Serum sIL-2R levels ≥ 1,000 U/mL are associated with a higher risk of progression and increased mortality, and this is the prognostic marker currently utilized in clinical practice. Additionally, the peripheral blood HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL) is an established predictor of ATL onset, but its utility in predicting the progression from smoldering to aggressive ATL remains unverified. Recent studies suggest that the degree of clonal expansion of HTLV-1-infected cells, including ATL cells, is a crucial risk factor for ATL progression. However, clinical implementation has been limited because of a lack of large-scale longitudinal studies and technical challenges. Southern blot hybridization, historically used to assess the clonality of HTLV-1-infected cells in Japan, suffers from low sensitivity and qualitative limitations, restricting its clinical utility.

### Evolution of retrovirus-infected premalignant T-cell clones prior to adult T-cell leukemia / lymphoma diagnosis [^115Lqf2D]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is an aggressive hematological malignancy caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1). ATL is preceded by decades of chronic HTLV-1 infection, and the tumors carry both somatic mutations and proviral DNA integrated into the tumor genome. In order to gain insight into the oncogenic process, we used targeted sequencing to track the evolution of the malignant clone in 6 individuals, 2 to 10 years before the diagnosis of ATL. Clones of premalignant HTLV-1-infected cells bearing known driver mutations were detected in the blood up to 10 years before individuals developed acute and lymphoma subtype ATL. Six months before diagnosis, the total number and variant allele fraction of mutations increased in the blood. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from premalignant cases (1 year prediagnosis) had significantly higher mutational burden in genes frequently mutated in ATL than did high-risk, age-matched HTLV-1 carriers who remained ATL-free after a median of 10 years of follow-up. These data show that HTLV-1-infected T-cell clones carrying key oncogenic driver mutations can be detected in cases of ATL years before the onset of symptoms. Early detection of such mutations may enable earlier and more effective intervention to prevent the development of ATL.

B-cell lymphomas — classification and diagnostic features: Cytogenetic features detected by karyotype or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and molecular analysis are increasingly important in defining specific subtypes, and detection of viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), HHV8, and HTLV1 is often necessary to establish a specific diagnosis. The WHO Classification was revised in 2008, 2017, and 2022 to include new disease entities and better define heterogeneous or ambiguous subtypes, and in 2022 the International Consensus Classification (ICC) was also published in addition to the newly revised WHO Classification of Hematolymphoid Tumors (WHO5). While both ICC and WHO5 classify lymphomas based on morphology, clinical features, cell lineage (immunophenotype), and cytogenetic and molecular features, there are differences between them in nomenclature and diagnostic criteria that are discussed under the respective subtypes.
