## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why RNA viral replication is more susceptible to mutation than DNA viral replication, and to choose the best explanation among four options. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core mechanistic difference in polymerase fidelity. Then, I should verify whether subcellular localization meaningfully alters mutation rates. Next, I will examine whether replication speed itself increases errors. After that, I need to check whether uracil versus thymine changes mutational susceptibility. Finally, I will synthesize and confirm the answer with quantitative error-rate data and virologic context.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic foundation. RNA viruses rely on RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) that generally lack 3′→5′ exonuclease proofreading, whereas DNA viruses use DNA polymerases with robust proofreading, which directly elevates RNA virus mutation rates by orders of magnitude; this is the canonical explanation in virology and is supported by experimental and comparative studies of viral evolution and fidelity engineering [^f85808a3] [^86516436] [^01c7afd9].

> Wait, let me verify the quantitative difference so I don't overstate it. Typical RdRps incorporate errors at roughly 1 per 10^3 to 10^5 nucleotides, whereas replicative DNA polymerases with proofreading achieve about 1 error per 10^6 to 10^8 nucleotides; even non-proofreading DNA polymerases are generally more accurate than RdRps, and mismatch repair further lowers DNA error rates, underscoring that the absence of proofreading is the dominant driver of higher RNA virus mutation rates [^01c7afd9] [^9e413070] [^86516436].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about location. Option A claims cytoplasmic replication increases mutation susceptibility, but I need to check whether localization independently alters fidelity. While many RNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm and many DNA viruses replicate in the nucleus, the causal determinant of higher mutation rates is the polymerase proofreading capacity, not the compartment per se; coronaviruses, for example, have acquired accessory proofreading that lowers their mutation rate despite cytoplasmic replication, and herpesviruses show that even DNA viruses can exhibit quasispecies-like diversity when their proofreading is impaired, so localization is not the primary driver here [^26c711bd] [^86516436].

> I will now examine replication speed. Option B suggests faster replication causes more errors, but I should double-check whether speed itself increases intrinsic error rates. While some viruses replicate rapidly, mutation rate is primarily a function of polymerase fidelity and repair, not speed; lethal mutagenesis strategies exploit the inherent error rate rather than altering replication kinetics, and comparative studies emphasize polymerase fidelity and genome architecture over replication speed as determinants of substitution rates, so speed is not the mechanistic cause of higher mutation susceptibility [^436b4986] [^761338ba].

> Let me consider the nucleobase difference. Option C proposes that using uracil instead of thymine increases mutation susceptibility, but I need to ensure I'm not conflating chemical instability with replication fidelity. Uracil's presence in RNA reflects a base difference, not a built-in replication error mechanism; cytosine deamination to uracil can create mismatches in DNA, which is why DNA repair systems like UNG remove uracil, but this is distinct from the fidelity of RNA polymerization, so uracil versus thymine is not the reason RNA viruses mutate faster during replication [^8c355217] [^d17389c1].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "faster replication = more errors" might be plausible, but that would be a misattribution; the error rate is intrinsic to the polymerase's proofreading capacity, not the elongation rate, so even if some RNA viruses replicate quickly, their higher mutation rates are due to the lack of proofreading rather than speed per se, reinforcing that option D is the correct mechanistic explanation [^761338ba] [^86516436].

> Synthesizing this, the best answer is D: RNA replication lacks the proofreading functions characteristic of DNA replication. This mechanistic deficit explains the roughly 10^3–10^5-fold higher error rates in RNA virus replication compared with proofreading DNA polymerases, whereas subcellular location, replication speed, and the uracil/thymine distinction do not directly account for the fidelity gap [^761338ba] [^86516436] [^01c7afd9].

---

The correct answer is **D. RNA replication lacks the proofreading functions characteristic of DNA replication**. RNA viruses rely on RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) that lack **3′→5′ exonuclease proofreading**, leading to error rates ~10^3–10^5-fold higher than DNA polymerases [^761338ba] [^01c7afd9]. This high error rate drives rapid mutation, quasispecies formation, and adaptive evolution, including drug resistance and immune escape [^86516436] [^f25af3e1]. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because cytoplasmic replication, replication speed, and uracil use do not inherently increase mutation rates; the key difference is the **absence of proofreading in RNA replication** [^761338ba].

---

## Mechanism of mutation susceptibility in RNA viruses

RNA viruses replicate using **RdRp**, which lacks proofreading activity, unlike DNA polymerases that have robust 3′→5′ exonuclease proofreading [^86516436]. This absence of proofreading means errors during RNA synthesis are not corrected, resulting in a high mutation rate [^e328cd76].

---

## Comparison of mutation rates between RNA and DNA viruses

RNA viruses have mutation rates approximately **10^3–10^5-fold higher** than DNA viruses [^761338ba]. For example:

- **RNA viruses**: Mutation rates around 1 error per 10^3–10^5 nucleotides [^01c7afd9].
- **DNA viruses**: Mutation rates around 1 error per 10^6–10^8 nucleotides [^9e413070].

This stark difference underscores the **greater susceptibility of RNA viruses to mutation** compared to DNA viruses [^761338ba].

---

## Consequences of high mutation rates in RNA viruses

The high mutation rates in RNA viruses have **significant biological consequences**:

- **Quasispecies formation**: RNA viruses exist as heterogeneous populations of closely related variants, known as quasispecies, which enhances their adaptability and survival [^86516436].
- **Rapid evolution**: High mutation rates enable RNA viruses to rapidly adapt to changing environments, including host immune responses and antiviral therapies [^f25af3e1].
- **Drug resistance**: Frequent mutations facilitate the emergence of drug-resistant variants, complicating treatment strategies [^d66d1436].
- **Immune escape**: Mutations in viral surface proteins allow RNA viruses to evade host immune responses, contributing to persistent infections [^5158d63a].

---

## Role of proofreading mechanisms in DNA replication

DNA replication is characterized by **high fidelity** due to proofreading mechanisms:

- **3′→5′ exonuclease activity**: DNA polymerases possess intrinsic proofreading activity that excises incorrectly incorporated nucleotides, significantly reducing error rates [^86516436].
- **Mismatch repair systems**: Additional cellular repair mechanisms further enhance the accuracy of DNA replication [^notfound].

These proofreading and repair mechanisms collectively maintain the integrity of the DNA genome, minimizing mutation rates [^9e413070].

---

## Exceptions and variations among RNA viruses

While most RNA viruses lack proofreading, there are exceptions. Coronaviruses, for example, possess **exonuclease activity (ExoN)** that provides partial proofreading, resulting in lower mutation rates compared to other RNA viruses [^26c711bd]. However, even with this partial proofreading, coronaviruses still have higher mutation rates than DNA viruses [^26c711bd].

---

## Clinical and therapeutic implications

The high mutation rates of RNA viruses have **important clinical implications**:

- **Antiviral resistance**: Rapid mutation facilitates the emergence of resistance to antiviral drugs, necessitating continuous development of new therapies [^d66d1436].
- **Vaccine development**: High mutation rates complicate vaccine design, as vaccines must target conserved regions of the viral genome to remain effective [^notfound].
- **Diagnostic challenges**: Frequent mutations can affect the accuracy of diagnostic assays, requiring regular updates to detection methods [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

RNA viral replication is more susceptible to mutation than DNA viral replication primarily because RNA viruses lack **proofreading mechanisms** during replication [^761338ba]. This results in significantly higher mutation rates, leading to rapid evolution, drug resistance, and immune escape [^86516436]. Understanding this fundamental difference is crucial for developing effective antiviral strategies and managing RNA viral infections.

1 Introduction

Nucleotides are integral to living cells, serving as the essential components of DNA and RNA. Each nucleotide is structurally composed of a pentose sugar (either ribose or deoxyribose), a nitrogenous base (which can be categorized as either a purine or a pyrimidine), and a phosphate group. Adenine and guanine are the two primary purine bases found in both DNA and RNA. In contrast, cytosine is the only pyrimidine base identified within both types of nucleic acids. DNA contains thymine as its other pyrimidine, whereas RNA is characterized by the presence of uracil. Nucleotides are fundamental to cellular processes and serve as essential cofactors in various metabolic pathways. They facilitate the release of free energy through the hydrolysis of high‐energy ATP compounds and play critical roles in multiple key biological functions, including protein glycosylation, ribosome biogenesis, as well as DNA replication and repair.

Cells utilize two distinct mechanisms to provide nucleotides for their metabolic demands: the de novo pathways and the salvage pathways. The de novo pathways pertain to the synthesis of purine and pyrimidine rings from fundamental molecular components, including amino acids, ribose‐5‐phosphate, carbon dioxide, and ammonia (NH 3). Conversely, the salvage pathways recycle nucleobases and nucleic acids that result from the degradation of pre‐existing nucleic acids. The specific mechanism employed depends on the cell's prevailing energy and metabolic demands.

Rapidly proliferating cells, along with those exhibiting increased metabolic demands, such as virus‐infected cells, rely on the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway to fulfill their increased nucleotide requirements.

The de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway commences with the formation of a pyrimidine ring, which subsequently pairs with ribose‐5‐phosphate, a component derived from the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Uridine monophosphate (UMP), the first precursor of pyrimidines, is produced through a series of six enzymatic reactions involving three principal enzymes of this pathway. The initial three steps are catalyzed by the enzyme CAD, which encompasses carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II, aspartate transcarbamoylase, and dihydroorotase. These reactions yield dihydroorotate, which is then converted to orotate through the action of DHODH. Subsequently, orotate undergoes further enzymatic conversion to form orotate‐5‐monophosphate, and ultimately, UMP through the enzyme uridine monophosphate synthetase (UMPS). Following phosphorylation, UMP can be converted to cytidine triphosphate (CTP) via the enzyme CTP synthase (Figure 1).

Fig. 5
Combination therapy, pharmaco-enhancements and lethal mutagenesis.

A The benefits of using antiviral combinations. Antiviral combinations can be used to exploit antagonistic resistance mutations which increase susceptibility to each other when they occur. Additionally, combinations lower doses of each constituent antiviral required for therapeutic effectiveness. Different antivirals (Antivirals A and B) also penetrate tissues to different degrees, which is especially important in pantropic viral infections. B Pharmaco-enhancements refer to modification of a drug to improve traits such as bioavailability and half-life. Boosting with a secondary antiviral (Antiviral B) slows the metabolism of the first antiviral (Antiviral A), prolonging exposure to the primary antiviral at the target site. C Mechanism of nucleotide analogue lethal mutagenesis. The analogue is incorporated into viral genomes during replication and increases the error rate of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), by allowing ambiguity in base pairing in subsequent rounds of replication, leading to an accumulation of erroneous mutations. Once the error rate exceeds the error threshold, fit viral genomes are no longer being replicated, resulting in viral extinction. D Resistance to mutagens can occur by several methods, such as mutations in the polymerase that prevent mutagen incorporation, mutations that increase fidelity to counter the increase in error rate, and the excision of mutagens by proofreaders which are present in some viruses. Mutagen efficacy is different for different viruses because of variation in mutational robustness which is the ability to express a phenotype despite deleterious mutations. Mutagens must be used at an optimal concentration, excessively high concentrations are genotoxic and toxic to the host, while sub-optimal concentrations may accelerate viral evolution.

### A molnupiravir-associated mutational signature in global SARS-CoV-2 genomes [^a34d1468]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

MTP is incorporated into nascent RNA primarily by acting as an analogue of cytosine (C), pairing opposite guanine (G) bases (Fig. 1a). However, once incorporated, the molnupiravir (M) base can transition into an alternative tautomeric form that resembles uracil (U) instead. This means that in the next round of strand synthesis, to give the positive-sense SARS-CoV-2 genome, the tautomeric M base pairs with adenine (A), resulting in a G-to-A mutation (Fig. 1b). These G-to-A mutations arise from incorporation of molnupiravir into the negative-sense genome. Incorporation of MTP can also occur during the synthesis of the positive-sense genome: in this scenario, an initial positive-sense C correctly pairs with a G during negative-sense synthesis, but this G then pairs with an M base during positive-sense synthesis. In the next round of replication, this M can then pair with A, which results in a U in the final positive-sense genome, with the overall process producing a C-to-U mutation (Fig. 1c). The free nucleotide MTP is less prone to tautomerization to the oxime form than when incorporated into RNA, and so this directionality of mutations is the most likely. However, it is also possible for some MTP to bind, in place of U, to A bases and undergo the above processes in reverse, causing A-to-G and U-to-C mutations (Fig. 1c).

3.6 Retroviruses

Retroviruses are characterized by the presence of reverse transcription, a process wherein the viral positive‐sense RNA genome serves as a template for the synthesis of dsDNA. This DNA is subsequently integrated into the host genome, facilitating the viral replication cycle. mTORC1 activity is crucial for the early replication of HIV. Inhibition of mTOR affects cellular metabolism and impacts the post‐entry steps of viral replication. The activity of mTORC1 plays a crucial role in regulating the synthesis of nucleotides that are essential for the reverse transcription process of HIV. Upon pretreatment with an mTOR inhibitor, there was a significant reduction in the levels of dNTPs, including dGTP, dCTP, TTP, and dATP. The study further investigated the role of specific metabolic enzymes within the pyrimidine pathway. The researchers reported that by blocking mTOR, the activation of CAD through its phosphorylation site at serine 1859 is inhibited, consequently decreasing the levels of pyrimidine metabolite intermediates, such as orotidine.

In addition, there were metabolites related to purine metabolism that were regulated via mTOR. The authors reported that inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1, the enzyme responsible for guanine‐containing purine synthesis, was dependent on mTOR activity. They also observed that RRMI (ribonucleotide reductase) — the enzyme that converts ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides — was similarly dependent on mTOR. This regulation occurs through an increase in glucose and c‐Myc uptake, both of which are influenced by mTORC1 activity. These processes contribute to elevated nucleotide pools that facilitate nucleotide synthesis. Based on these studies, mTOR and its downstream pathways represent promising targets that can potentially be harnessed for therapeutic strategies. An intriguing approach would be to test combination therapies that target both mTOR and specific downstream nucleotide metabolic enzymes to evaluate their antiviral efficacy against HIV.

Another mode of regulating nucleotides is maintaining their balance, as an imbalance of nucleotides can be detrimental to virus replication. One such enzyme that plays an important role in regulating nucleotide levels necessary for viral replication is dUTPase. dUTP hydrolyzes dUTP into dUMP and pyrophosphate (PPi), with dUMP ultimately serving as a substrate for dTTP. By maintaining low dUTP/dTTP ratios, dUTPase prevents the misincorporation of uracil into DNA, thereby reducing the risk of mutations in the viral genome. In non‐primate lentiviruses, dUTPase is necessary for efficient viral replication in non‐dividing cells. However, viruses with defective dUTPase can still replicate in dividing cells, which have high endogenous dUTPase activity.

### Viral reprogramming of nucleotide synthesis and its impact on viral infection [^0714d0b9]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

When the metabolic demands of the cell are low, such as in resting cells and differentiated nonmalignant cells, the pyrimidine supply is derived from the degradation of DNA and RNA. The salvage pathway facilitates the uptake of free pyrimidines, which are subsequently converted into nucleoside or deoxynucleoside monophosphates (NMPs/dNMPs). Thymidine kinases 1 and 2 are responsible for the conversion of deoxythymidine to deoxythymidine monophosphate, while deoxycytidine kinase catalyzes the conversion of deoxycytidine‐to‐deoxycytidine monophosphate (dCMP). The enzymes cytidine deaminase and uridine‐cytidine kinase (UCK) are responsible for the conversion of deoxycytidine to uracil and UMP (Figure 1).

Purine synthesis is a complex process that encompasses a series of 10 reactions, requiring several key substrates, including glutamine, glycine, bicarbonate, and N‐10 formyl‐tetrahydrofolate (THF). The ultimate product of this pathway, inosine monophosphate (IMP), can be further converted into either adenosine monophosphate (AMP) or guanosine monophosphate (GMP) through distinct enzymatic reactions. The synthesis of AMP occurs via adenylo‐succinate, facilitated by the enzymes adenylosuccinate synthetase and adenylosuccinate lyase. Conversely, GMP is produced through a xanthylate intermediate, which involves the action of IMP dehydrogenase and XMP‐glutamine amidotransferase. The salvage pathway involves the catabolism of adenosine, guanosine, and inosine to nucleobases adenine, guanine, and hypoxanthine, respectively, by purine nucleoside phosphorylase and then further converted to NMPs through adenine phosphoribosyl transferase or hypoxanthine‐guanine phosphoribosyl transferase. In addition, deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine can be converted to dAMP or dGMP by DCKs (Figure 2).

### The broad-spectrum antiviral ribonucleoside ribavirin is an RNA virus mutagen [^436b4986]. Nature Medicine (2000). Excellent credibility.

The ribonucleoside analog ribavirin (1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-1,2, 4-triazole-3-carboxamide) shows antiviral activity against a variety of RNA viruses and is used in combination with interferon-alpha to treat hepatitis C virus infection. Here we show in vitro use of ribavirin triphosphate by a model viral RNA polymerase, poliovirus 3Dpol. Ribavirin incorporation is mutagenic, as it templates incorporation of cytidine and uridine with equal efficiency. Ribavirin reduces infectious poliovirus production to as little as 0. 00001% in cell culture. The antiviral activity of ribavirin correlates directly with its mutagenic activity. These data indicate that ribavirin forces the virus into 'error catastrophe'. Thus, mutagenic ribonucleosides may represent an important class of anti-RNA virus agents.

### Distinguishing preferences of human APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B for cytosines in hairpin loops, and reflection of these preferences in APOBEC-signature cancer genome mutations [^5ebd5faf]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing catalytic polypeptide-like subfamily 3 (APOBEC3) enzymes are a part of the human innate immune response against viruses and retrotransposons –. They belong to a family of DNA-cytosine deaminases that convert cytosines to uracils. Error-prone repair or replication of these uracils creates predominantly C:G to T:A or G:C mutations, within specific trinucleotide contexts (generally TCN, where N is any nucleotide) and are referred to as APOBEC signature mutations –. While these enzymes function to restrict viral growth and retrotransposition by targeting single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) intermediates in these processes, they can also cause mutations in the human genome. Several different types of human tumors contain APOBEC signature mutations, and they aid evolution of tumor genomes and help the tumors avoid anticancer therapy –. In particular, two members of this subfamily, APOBEC3A (A3A) and APOBEC3B (A3B) have been implicated in causing tumor mutations –. Consequently, elucidating their preferences for nucleotide sequences and nucleic acid secondary structure is of vital importance in understanding their biological roles.

A3A and A3B, which are likely to have formed from a gene duplication event, have diverged in important ways. While A3A contains a single zinc-binding domain, A3B contains two such domains. Of the two domains within A3B, the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) domain shares an 89% sequence identity with A3A and is catalytically active, whereas the amino-terminal domain (NTD) of A3B is inactive. While A3B resides principally in the nucleus. A3A is thought to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The two enzymes also differ in their interactions with RNA. Whereas A3A has been shown to weakly deaminate cytosines in RNA, such an activity has not been reported for A3B. Additionally, A3B activity is greatly reduced through its binding to RNA.

### Targeted accurate RNA consensus sequencing (tARC-seq) reveals mechanisms of replication error affecting SARS-CoV-2 divergence [^e328cd76]. Nature Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

RNA viruses, like SARS-CoV-2, depend on their RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) for replication, which is error prone. Monitoring replication errors is crucial for understanding the virus's evolution. Current methods lack the precision to detect rare de novo RNA mutations, particularly in low-input samples such as those from patients. Here we introduce a targeted accurate RNA consensus sequencing method (tARC-seq) to accurately determine the mutation frequency and types in SARS-CoV-2, both in cell culture and clinical samples. Our findings show an average of 2.68×10–5 de novo errors per cycle with a C > T bias that cannot be solely attributed to APOBEC editing. We identified hotspots and cold spots throughout the genome, correlating with high or low GC content, and pinpointed transcription regulatory sites as regions more susceptible to errors. tARC-seq captured template switching events including insertions, deletions and complex mutations. These insights shed light on the genetic diversity generation and evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2.

### Programmable DNA pyrimidine base editing via engineered uracil-DNA glycosylase [^c1f14584]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Through guided protein structure-based engineering, we identified mutant variants N204D and Y147A of the hUNG protein capable of specifically excising cytosine and thymine (Fig. 1). Building on this discovery, we identified HHV1_UNG(N147D) and DrUNG(Y85A) through homologous protein searches, each demonstrating more efficient excision of cytosine and thymine, respectively. The activity of DrUNG(Y85A) surpasses that of hUNG(Y147A) by a factor of five, and through further mutations, we enhanced the activity of DrUNG(Y85A) by approximately six-fold (Fig. 2). Consequently, we have developed an effective thymine base editing tool, with the editing window situated at positions 14–18 of the spacer. Engineered DrUNG-based thymine base editors show low off-targets across the entire genome. In addition, it has no obvious off-target sites at the RNA level. Compared to two recently published hUNG-based thymine base editors, the DrUNG-based thymine base editor exhibits not only higher editing efficiency but also minimal cellular toxicity. In contrast, the hUNG editors exhibit significant cytotoxic effects (Fig. 3). However, it is important to acknowledge that this base editing tool currently faces some limitations, including a relatively high indel rate, necessitating further optimization in the future. Additionally, the combination of different DNA polymerases exhibiting specific preferences can be explored to achieve the incorporation of specific base, (Supplementary Fig. 6). In summary, TBEs offer efficient, precise, and low-toxicity methods to base editing, presenting the potential for therapeutic applications in related diseases.

### A ribozyme composed of only two different nucleotides [^c18d682d]. Nature (2002). Excellent credibility.

RNA molecules are thought to have been prominent in the early history of life on Earth because of their ability both to encode genetic information and to exhibit catalytic function. The modern genetic alphabet relies on two sets of complementary base pairs to store genetic information. However, owing to the chemical instability of cytosine, which readily deaminates to uracil, a primitive genetic system composed of the bases A, U, G and C may have been difficult to establish. It has been suggested that the first genetic material instead contained only a single base-pairing unit. Here we show that binary informational macromolecules, containing only two different nucleotide subunits, can act as catalysts. In vitro evolution was used to obtain ligase ribozymes composed of only 2,6-diaminopurine and uracil nucleotides, which catalyse the template-directed joining of two RNA molecules, one bearing a 5'-triphosphate and the other a 3'-hydroxyl. The active conformation of the fastest isolated ribozyme had a catalytic rate that was about 36,000-fold faster than the uncatalysed rate of reaction. This ribozyme is specific for the formation of biologically relevant 3',5'-phosphodiester linkages.

### An enantioselective and modular platform for C4'-modified nucleoside analogue synthesis enabled by intramolecular trans-acetalizations [^0b85b354]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

A Process development. B Mechanistic investigations into the intramolecular trans -acetalization. a Isolated yields; b Carried out at −10 °C; c Carried out at 0 °C. BSA bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide.

Enabled by the development of a versatile intramolecular trans -acetalization reaction, we proceeded to evaluate other Grignard reagents and nucleobases for the generation of high-value 4ʹ-modified nucleoside analogues (Fig. 3). Remarkably, this process proved compatible with an array of topical 4ʹ-modifications including methyl (15, 18–23), ethyl (24, 25), allyl (26, 27), trideuteromethyl (28–31), vinyl (32), and ethynyl (33, 34), that can be conveniently attached with a nucleobase of one's choosing. We proceeded to generate 4ʹ-analogues of natural products adenosine (20, 26, 28), thymidine (15, 31, 32), and cytidine (22, 25, 29, 34). Non-canonical nucleobases that are in high demand in drug discovery such as 6-methoxy-adenine (18), 2-chloro-adenine (23), 6-chloro-adenine (27), iodouracil (19, 30), and 2-fluoro-adenine (21, 33) were also incorporated in excellent overall yields. In all cases, these syntheses represent roughly a two to threefold improvement in step count over the previous shortest syntheses for 15, 19, 20, 21–25. 33, and 34. For instance, during a drug discovery campaign pursuing treatments for RNA-dependent RNA viral infections, Isis Pharmaceuticals synthesized 22 in 14 steps via a semi-synthetic approach starting from diacetone — glucose. In a very recent patent disclosing several DNA damage repair enzyme inhibitors, PrimeFour Therapeutics reported the only synthesis of 21 in 16 steps. Even in comparison to routes that employed newly bioengineered enzymes, our sequence proved to be over twofold shorter (i.e. 15, 19, 20, and 23). For example, 23 was previously synthesized in 11 steps using a biocatalytic trans -glycosylation of 4ʹ-methyluridine with 2-chloroadenine. The novel compounds (18, 26–32) synthesized with this expedited route map well onto structures previously disclosed in the recent patent literature and serve to highlight our process' utility for exploring chemical space around this valuable chemotype. While a few analogues (i.e. 26 and 27) were obtained in lower overall yields, it is important to recognize that chemical synthesis in medicinal chemistry prioritizes routes for their efficiency and the structural diversity they can access. Furthermore, during pandemic emergencies the ability to rapidly generate and identify antivirals becomes even more important in fighting waves of infection and viral mutations.

### Mechanisms of action of ribavirin against distinct viruses [^08c32f30]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2005). Low credibility.

The nucleoside analogue ribavirin has antiviral activity against many distinct viruses both in vitro and in vivo. Five distinct mechanisms have been proposed to explain the antiviral properties of ribavirin. These include both indirect mechanisms (inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibition, immunomodulatory effects) and direct mechanisms (interference with RNA capping, polymerase inhibition, lethal mutagenesis). Recent concerns about bioterrorism have renewed interest in exploring the antiviral activity of ribavirin against unique viruses. In this paper, we review the proposed mechanisms of action with emphasis on recent discoveries, as well as the implications of ribavirin resistance. Evidence exists to support each of the five proposed mechanisms of action, and distinct virus/host combinations may preferentially favour one or more of these mechanisms during antiviral therapy.

### Perspective: APOBEC mutagenesis in drug resistance and immune escape in HIV and cancer evolution [^bfcabda5]. Annals of Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

The AID/APOBEC superfamily: a diverse set of cytosine deaminase enzymes implicated in cancer

APOBEC3 belongs to the AID/APOBEC superfamily, consisting of activation induced deaminase (AID), APOBEC1 (A1), APOBEC2 (A2), APOBEC3A-H (A3A, A3B, A3C, A3D, A3F, A3G, and A3H), and APOBEC4 (A4). AID deaminates cytosines at the immunoglobulin locus, enabling antibody gene diversification via somatic hypermutation, and class switch recombination. A1 was identified originally as an RNA editing enzyme, deaminating apolipoprotein B mRNA at a specific position to create an early stop codon, but it also has robust DNA deamination activity. The functions of A2 and A4 are still unclear and these proteins have yet to show enzymatic activity.

In general, the A3 family members are considered part of the innate immune system, forming overlapping barriers to virus and transposon replication. Consistent with such a physiological function, A3 genes show profound copy number and amino acid variation in mammals. For instance, most humans have seven A3 genes arranged in tandem, whereas rodents have only one at the same genomic location, and each A3 gene in humans as well as several other mammals manifests high levels of amino acid variation due to positive selection.

A3G has been studied intensely in the field of virology, as it was recognized early on to deaminate cytosines in cDNA reverse transcription intermediates of retroviruses including HIV-1. Reverse transcriptase places an adenine opposite to the newly created uracil nucleobase, introducing a viral genomic strand G→A mutation. This inhibits HIV replication by directly rendering the viral genome dysfunctional or by indirectly triggering viral cDNA degradation by subsequent uracil DNA glycosylase activity and endonuclease digestion. A3G can also directly bind to HIV-1 genomic RNA and interfere with viral cDNA synthesis. A3D, A3F, and A3H also contribute to HIV-1 mutagenesis through similar mechanisms, and it is generally accepted that different subsets of A3 family members restrict the replication of different classes of viruses and transposons (reviewed elsewhere).

### No evidence for increased transmissibility from recurrent mutations in SARS-CoV-2 [^5158d63a]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

To date, the fact that none of the 185 recurrent mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 population we identified as candidates for putative adaptation to its novel human host are statistically significantly associated with transmission suggests that the vast majority of mutations segregating at reasonable frequency are largely neutral in the context of transmission and viral fitness. This interpretation is supported by the essentially perfect spread of individual RoHO index scores around their expectation under neutral evolution (Fig. 3). However, it is nonetheless interesting to consider the cause of these mutations. Consistent with equivalent analyses (, accessed 21 Sep 2020), we find no signature of recombination in SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7), though 65% of the detected mutations comprise non-synonymous changes of which 38% derive from C→U transitions. This high compositional bias, as also detected in other studies –, as well as in other members of the Coronaviridae –, suggests that mutations observed in the SARS-CoV-2 genome are not solely the result of errors by the viral RNA polymerase during virus replication. One possibility is the action of human RNA-editing systems, which have been implicated in innate and adaptive immunity. These include the AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases, which catalyse deamination of cytidine to uridine in RNA or DNA, and the ADAR family of adenosine deaminases, which catalyse deamination of adenosine to inosine (recognised as a guanosine during translation) in RNA.

### Enzymatic capture of an extrahelical thymine in the search for uracil in DNA [^8c355217]. Nature (2007). Excellent credibility.

The enzyme uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG) excises unwanted uracil bases in the genome using an extrahelical base recognition mechanism. Efficient removal of uracil is essential for prevention of C-to-T transition mutations arising from cytosine deamination, cytotoxic U*A pairs arising from incorporation of dUTP in DNA, and for increasing immunoglobulin gene diversity during the acquired immune response. A central event in all of these UNG-mediated processes is the singling out of rare U*A or U*G base pairs in a background of approximately 10(9) T*A or C*G base pairs in the human genome. Here we establish for the human and Escherichia coli enzymes that discrimination of thymine and uracil is initiated by thermally induced opening of T*A and U*A base pairs and not by active participation of the enzyme. Thus, base-pair dynamics has a critical role in the genome-wide search for uracil, and may be involved in initial damage recognition by other DNA repair glycosylases.

### Single virus fingerprinting by widefield interferometric defocus-enhanced mid-infrared photothermal microscopy [^3760a5e6]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Clinical identification and fundamental study of viruses rely on the detection of viral proteins or viral nucleic acids. Yet, amplification-based and antigen-based methods are not able to provide precise compositional information of individual virions due to small particle size and low-abundance chemical contents (e.g., ~ 5000 proteins in a vesicular stomatitis virus). Here, we report a widefield interferometric defocus-enhanced mid-infrared photothermal (WIDE-MIP) microscope for high-throughput fingerprinting of single viruses. With the identification of feature absorption peaks, WIDE-MIP reveals the contents of viral proteins and nucleic acids in single DNA vaccinia viruses and RNA vesicular stomatitis viruses. Different nucleic acid signatures of thymine and uracil residue vibrations are obtained to differentiate DNA and RNA viruses. WIDE-MIP imaging further reveals an enriched β sheet components in DNA varicella-zoster virus proteins. Together, these advances open a new avenue for compositional analysis of viral vectors and elucidating protein function in an assembled virion.

### Structural analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 methyltransferase complex involved in RNA cap creation bound to sinefungin [^b8b73cf3]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Coronaviruses have the largest genomes of all RNA viruses. In particular, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 has ~29 800 bases, which encodes 4 structural and 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1–nsp16) that are essential for the lifecycle of this virus. SARS-CoV-2 exploits the cell environment to its full advantage for its use and replication. Importantly, viral RNA must be protected from the cellular innate immunity. One of the most important elements that ensures the integrity of viral RNA is the cap, a specific arrangement at the 5 'end of the RNA molecule that consists of a N -methylated guanosine triphosphate and C 2′-O-methyl-ribosyladenine (type 1 cap, Fig. 1). This arrangement resembles the native mRNA of the host cells, stabilizes the RNA, and ensures effective process of its translation –. In human cells, however, the cap is installed on newly transcribed mRNA already in the nucleus, to which coronaviruses do not have access. Instead, they possess their own cap-synthesizing enzymes. Clearly, this process is essential for the survival and further replication of viral RNA in cells. In principle, four different processes are necessary for installation of a type 1 cap on RNA (either human mRNA or coronavirus RNA). First, the γ-phosphate from a 5′-triphosphate end of the nascent RNA is removed by 5′-RNA triphosphatase. Second, a guanosine monophosphate (GMP) is attached to the formed 5′-diphosphate end of RNA by a guanylyltransferase using GTP as the source of GMP. Finally, the methylation steps take place. In this case, two separate enzymatic steps are required: one for N -7 methylation of the GTP nucleobase (N -7 methyltransferase) and the other for C 2′-O methylation of the following nucleotide.

### Diversity-oriented functionalization of 2-pyridones and uracils [^26968705]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Diversity-oriented functionalization of uracils

Additionally, the successful functionalization of iodinated uracil (4m, Table 2A) and biology-oriented synthesis (BIOS)philosophy prompted us to further uncover the inherent value of our method by synthesizing biorelevant uracil and thymine derivatives (Fig. 4). Delightfully, with readily available iodinated uracils 1m and 1n as substrates, 2d and 2A as the electrophilic reagents, the 6-deuterated thymine derivative (80% deuteration) (19), and other five novel thymine analogs and derivatives (20 − 24) were facilely prepared in moderate yields, using ipso -hydrogenation (19), -Suzuki (20), -Heck (21 − 22), or -Sonogashira termination (23 − 24) respectively. Furthermore, the reaction of 1m with benzyl choride and methylboronic acid afforded 25 in 50% yield, resulting in a one-step formal synthesis of anti-HIV-1 agent 26 (previous method required 6 steps with only 6% overall yield). These results revealed the modularity of our method in diversity-oriented synthesis of useful uracil and thymine derivatives, which will be very attractive for developing new antiviral agents (Fig. 4B) –.

### An adenosine analog shows high antiviral potency against coronavirus and arenavirus mainly through an unusual base pairing mode [^d3d01668]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Owing to its indispensable role in viral RNA synthesis, as well as the lack of host homologs in human cells and structural conservation of its active site among RNA viruses, RdRP is an attractive target for antiviral drug development. NA compounds are ideal candidates for developing small-molecule drugs against viral RdRPs. To date, at least three categories of approved viral RdRP-targeting NA drugs have been identified. The first category is represented by the uridine analog sofosbuvir, with key modifications at the ribose 2′-position that exhibits immediate chain-terminating features under most circumstances. The prominent example in the second category is the adenosine analog remdesivir, with a characteristic cyano group at the ribose 1′-position, which causes unique delayed intervention in certain virus systems, including SARS-CoV-2 and EV71. Notable examples in the third category include favipiravir and molnupiravir, which do not have key modifications in the ribose. With their base substitution (in favipiravir) or modification (in molnupiravir), which results in base pairing ambiguity at both the incorporation and templating stages, these NAs lead to a high frequency of errors in viral genome replication and catastrophe lethality to RNA viruses –. To be effective, compounds in all three categories first need to be incorporated. In contrast, HNC-1664, which was characterized in this work, can effectively compete with ATP in a non-catalytic manner through an alternative base pairing mode that may be taken by different RNA virus families, thus opening an avenue for developing NA inhibitors with broad-spectrum potential. The modification at the 2′-position of HNC-1664 likely plays a key role in disfavoring the regular NTP binding mode, as the critical 2′-hydroxyl is replaced by hydrogen, while the 2′-C-hydrogen on the other side of the ribose is replaced by fluorine. Consequently, the purine base of 1664-TP has the opportunity to adopt the "flipped" conformation, allowing 1664-TP to establish enough stabilizing interactions at rather tight active sites. The discovery of this "abnormal" NTP binding mode may lead to a revolution in NA drug design if the non-catalytic intervention can indeed be as effective and selective as traditional incorporation-based intervention. Since 1664-TP mainly inhibits RNA synthesis through the non-catalytic intervention, the mutagenic potential common for incorporation-based NAs is less of a concern for 1664-TP. More importantly, the observed "flipped" conformation generates drastically different design spaces when the NTP binding pocket is re-explored. In particular, the ribose moiety resides between the distal part of the ring finger subdomain and the -1 product nucleotide, and no longer faces the relatively tight palm domain pocket near motifs A and B, possibly allowing ribose modifications with large-volume groups.

### Highly heterogeneous mutation rates in the hepatitis C virus genome [^a4f0db1a]. Nature Microbiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous mutations are the ultimate source of genetic variation and have a prominent role in evolution. RNA viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) have extremely high mutation rates, but these rates have been inferred from a minute fraction of genome sites, limiting our view of how RNA viruses create diversity. Here, by applying high-fidelity ultradeep sequencing to a modified replicon system, we scored > 15,000 spontaneous mutations, encompassing more than 90% of the HCV genome. This revealed > 1,000-fold differences in mutability across genome sites, with extreme variations even between adjacent nucleotides. We identify base composition, the presence of high- and low-mutation clusters and transition/transversion biases as the main factors driving this heterogeneity. Furthermore, we find that mutability correlates with the ability of HCV to diversify in patients. These data provide a site-wise baseline for interrogating natural selection, genetic load and evolvability in HCV, as well as for evaluating drug resistance and immune evasion risks.

### Mutational spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 during the global pandemic [^12a1a1ed]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

We investigated whether the asymmetry of the mutational spectrum is the outcome of selection pressure on infected human cells. Many viruses tend to have codon usage similar to that of their major host due to higher efficiency in protein translation. However, the asymmetric mutational spectrum overall makes viral codon usage more dissimilar from that of humans (Supplementary Fig. 7b). Among the 20 kinds of amino acids, 15 can have uracil in the third position of the codon. When looking at all the synonymous mutations observed in SARS-CoV-2 by amino acid, in all 15 kinds, the change to codons with uracil in the third position was the most frequent. In the codons for 14 of these 15 amino acids (except arginine), the synonymous mutations most frequently produced codons that are the most used in the virus genome. Moreover, we also observed that the mutation spectrum in the noncoding region was almost identical to that in the coding region, although the mutation rate in the noncoding region was slightly higher (13.93 vs. 9.18 mutations/base in the tree of 351,525 samples) (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 7c). Overall, the mutational spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 exhibits an asymmetric, currently unknown mutational process that has been operative during transmission in the human population.

### Rapid incorporation of favipiravir by the fast and permissive viral RNA polymerase complex results in SARS-CoV-2 lethal mutagenesis [^3728102a]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The reactions performed without ATP also showed detectable amounts of GTP:U mismatch products, allowing us to make a direct comparison of the T-1105 incorporation rate with that of a natural GTP:U mismatch (Fig. 4). Reactions using 50 µM GTP and 1 µM T-1105-RTP show ~5-fold more T-1105:U produced relative to GTP:U. Considering the concentration difference, T-1105 incorporation may be as much as ~250-fold more efficient than the native GTP mismatch, the most common naturally occurring transition mutation. Such high levels of incorporation may exceed the capacity the CoV error-correcting mechanisms, consistent with our infectious virus data, although it remains to be determined if nsp14 can excise T-705/T-1105, as is the case for ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil.

Fig. 4
Comparison of T-1105-RTP:U and natural GTP:U mismatch incorporation levels.

a Elongation reactions with the PT substrate done in the absence of ATP with 50 µM each GTP, UTP and CTP show rapid addition of the first uracil followed by slow misincorporation of a GTP:U mismatch. In the presence of 1 µM T-1105-RTP (with 50 µM each GTP, UTP and CTP) the analogue incorporation is on a similar timescale as the native GTP:U mismatch. b Analysis of incorporation levels show a burst phase followed by linear product buildup over a 60-s timeframe that is consistent with the measured lifetime of the nsp12-7L8-8 elongation complex. Both the burst amplitude and linear rate indicate that 1 µM T-1105-RTP is incorporated ~5-fold faster than the natural GTP:U mismatch at 50 µM GTP. Quantitation reflects slopes and intercepts with standard errors obtained from a linear curve fit to the initial rate data (0–60 s).

### Occurrence of RNA post-transcriptional modifications in plant viruses and viroids and their correlation with structural and functional features [^085e21ea]. Virus Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Characterization of HAMR-predicted modifications in viral and viroid genomes. A. Identification of RNA modifications in viral and viroid pathogens and Arabidopsis mRNAs. B. Total number of modifications identified in viral and viroid pathogens and Arabidopsis mRNAs. C. Total number of modifications identified in viral and viroid pathogens and Arabidopsis mRNAs normalized to genome size. ✱ = significantly enriched, # = significantly depleted. Viruses and viroids indicated with * used low astringent prediction values in HAMR as indicated in the Materials and Methods section.

In order to compare the occurrence of these modifications, we normalized the results to the genome size of the pathogens (Fig. 2 C and Supplementary Fig. 1). In general, sequence analysis of viruses and viroids generated a higher proportion of RCMs (except for ORSV, CYMMV and TYLCV) in comparison with mRNAs of Arabidopsis. This was expected since sRNAs produced from viruses and viroids accumulate at a higher proportion than mRNA-derived sRNAs. Genomic RNAs from RNA viruses (CMV, PYVV, TCV and RSV) and mRNAs produced by DNA virus (CaMV and ToLCV) were the most enriched in nucleotide modifications (approximately 166-fold on average, in comparison with endogenous mRNAs) (Fig. 2 C). Viral transcripts from DNA viruses are not only produced from RNA polymerase II, but also from RNA polymerases IV and V (Pol II, IV and V), which might explain why the presence of RCMs was higher than in some canonical Pol II transcripts (Fig. 2 C). All viruses contained variable amounts of modifications with TCV, RSV, CMV, ToLCV and PYVV having proportionally higher levels of modifications (approximately 215, 197, 189, 152 and 142-fold, respectively, in comparison with endogenous mRNAs) and CYMMV and ORSV (0.7 and 0.5-fold, respectively, in comparison with endogenous mRNAs) containing the lowest amount of modifications (Fig. 2 C). Finally, viroids contained a low number of modifications (7–18), but proportionally higher (between 28 and 60-fold, in comparison with endogenous mRNAs) than some RNA viruses (for example BYSMV, ORSV, TuMV, SMV, CYMMV and PVX). Moreover, PLMVd, the chloroplast-replicating viroid, was slightly enriched in modifications (60-fold more than mRNAs) compared to the two nuclear-replicating viroids analyzed, PSTVd and HSVd (59-fold and 28-fold, respectively, in comparison with endogenous mRNAs). This observation may be linked to the existence of specific RNA editing in the chloroplast which has been proposed as a factor contributing to the higher mutation rate of chloroplast-replicating viroids. According to these new results, we cannot exclude that the mutation rate of viroids, which has been categorized as the highest reported for any biological entity, might be over-estimated to a certain extent. Some of the modified nucleotides were significantly enriched in viral genomes when compared to endogenous mRNAs (Fig. 2 A–C, Fisher exact test with significance level < 0.05). CMV, RSV and CaMV were significantly enriched in m3C (Fig. 2 A). Additionally, CMV was also enriched in Ψ (Fig. 2 A). A common scenario observed in our analysis was the significant depletion of some modifications. For example, several marks were significantly reduced in multiple viruses including m2G/m2,2 G in CMV, PYVV, TCV, RSV and CaMV, and Ψ in PYVV, TCV, RSV, ToLCV and CaMV. Additionally, i6A/t6A, D and m1A/m1I/ms2i6A were significantly reduced in CMV and m1G and m3C were reduced in TCV. In summary, our analysis indicated the presence, enrichment, and depletion of different modifications in viral and viroid genomes.

### Advances in the development of nucleoside and nucleotide analogues for cancer and viral diseases [^0945e0c8]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2013). Medium credibility.

Nucleoside analogues have been in clinical use for almost 50 years and have become cornerstones of treatment for patients with cancer or viral infections. The approval of several additional drugs over the past decade demonstrates that this family still possesses strong potential. Here, we review new nucleoside analogues and associated compounds that are currently in preclinical or clinical development for the treatment of cancer and viral infections, and that aim to provide increased response rates and reduced side effects. We also highlight the different approaches used in the development of these drugs and the potential of personalized therapy.

### Single virus fingerprinting by widefield interferometric defocus-enhanced mid-infrared photothermal microscopy [^eb1f746a]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Here, we present the development and validation of a widefield interferometric defocus-enhanced MIP (WIDE-MIP) microscope (Fig. 1a) for fingerprint analysis of bionanoparticles. As photothermal signal is a modulation of visible beam intensity, it is commonly believed that an optimal MIP contrast is generated when the bright field contrast is maximized. Yet, this wisdom does not hold for interferometric MIP microscopy where the signal strongly depends on the relative phase between the particle-scattered photons and the substrate-reflected reference field. Instead, we find that by fine-tuning the focus position of the objective, the defocused interferometric imaging results in a greatly improved MIP contrast (Fig. 1b). We constructed a theoretical framework that calculates the defocused interferometric photothermal images of single nanoparticles with different sizes. This framework provides the optimal MIP detection focus position relative to the nominal focus position of the particles. Compared to reported scanning methods –, we demonstrate vibrational detection of 100 nm polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) particles at a similar signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) level but with three orders of magnitude higher throughput. By tuning the IR wavenumber, WIDE-MIP spectra of single viruses are acquired from the hyperspectral images (Fig. 1c). We systematically recorded the fingerprints of single vaccinia viruses (VACV), a DNA poxvirus related to Monkeypox, single vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSV), the prototype RNA virus, and varicella-zoster viruses (VZV), a DNA virus included in the herpesvirus group. Dramatically, the spectra provide signatures of not only viral proteins, but also nucleic acids of individual viruses. Nucleic acid peaks of thymine (T) and uracil (U) residue vibrations in VACV and VSV were detected respectively, indicating unique IR signatures of DNA and RNA viruses. Besides the contents, WIDE-MIP data further suggests a β-enriched sheet structure in VZV, showing the potential of analyzing protein secondary structure in a single virus.

### In vitro synergistic antiviral effects of β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine and teriflunomide in combination against a broad range of RNA viruses [^78975b43]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Effective antiviral is unlikely to be available for newly emerging viruses at least at the beginning of the epidemics unless the new viruses fall within the same group of and share similar antiviral sensitivity with already circulating viruses with existing antivirals. Predevelopment of antivirals in anticipation for new viruses may be complicated by the narrow spectrum of most specific antivirals. A broad‐spectrum antiviral is more likely to be effective against a new virus. Currently available broad‐spectrum antivirals may be less potent than antivirals specifically developed for each virus and have limited clinical efficacy. Drug combination is an important approach to improve efficacy and reduce resistance. In addition to emerging viruses, many important endemic viral diseases still lack effective antivirals. Some are considered neglected diseases with poor investment in antiviral development. An effective broad‐spectrum antiviral combination may also provide a solution for treatment of these diseases.

Why is molnupiravir considered for treatment — mechanism, early safety, and EUA context are summarized as follows: "Molnupiravir is an oral antiviral that targets the genetic machinery that is responsible for SARS COV-2 replication". It is "an oral pro-drug that is converted to β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine, which acts as a substrate for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase", and "after it is incorporated into the viral RNA, serial mutations develop, resulting in a virus that is less fit for ongoing viral replication". Early evaluation notes that "One phase I RCT evaluated the safety and tolerability of molnupiravir in healthy adults without COVID-19 [235]" and "The study reported molnupiravir to be well tolerated, with no increased reports of serious adverse events among persons in the molnupiravir arm compared to those receiving placebo". The regulatory summary states that "The FDA granted EUA to molnupiravir on December 23, 2021, for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults (≥ 18 years) who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death".

### Clinical interpretation and management of genetic variants [^9e413070]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2020). Medium credibility.

Identification of DNA as the genetic material, about 75 years after the discovery of nucleic acids by Miescher, spearheaded a series of intense research to define the structure of DNA. Erwin Chargaff discovered that the number of purine (adenine and guanine) nucleotides equaled the number of pyrimidine (thymine and cytosine) nucleotides in the DNA. The finding coupled with the x-ray crystallographic images of DNA by Rosalind Franklin, guided James Watson and Francis Crick to describe DNA as a double-stranded helix formed by specific base pairings. The Watson-Crick specific base-pairs provided a copying mechanism for DNA replication.

The DNA replication machinery is extremely exquisite and precise. The major unit of this complex, namely the DNA polymerase, which was discovered by Arthur Kornberg in 1955, is blazingly fast and amazingly accurate, albeit it is not perfect. The replication machinery incorporates approximately 1 wrong nucleotide per every 100 million nucleotides that it synthesizes (the error rate is ∼1.3 × 10 −8 per nucleotide). Given the size of the human genome being approximately 3.2 × 10 9 base pairs, the error rate of the DNA replication machinery introduces approximately 50 de novo point mutations and a lesser number of larger mutations with each genome replication. Thus, each offspring differs from the parents by about 50 novel genetic variants. The replication error rate is not uniform across the human genome and varies according to complexity of the genome, with some spots being more prone to mutations. It is this rare error rate of the DNA replication machinery that is mainly responsible for human genetic diversity, and hence, the basis for variation in susceptibility to disease, response to therapy, and the clinical outcomes. The error, however, is not restricted to those occurring during DNA replication but also encompasses mutations that occur during recombination, DNA damage, and impaired repair mechanisms. For example, slippage strand mispairing, which typically occurs at the tandem repeats, leads to expansion of di- and trinucleotide repeats in the genome, which are the causes of the so-called triplet repeat syndromes. It is not unreasonable to surmise that the rare error rate of DNA replication is the essence of life, because in its absence, the eugenic human species would have been amenable to extinction by invading germs or diseases. The current pandemic of coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, which is itself a product of a rare error of the replication machinery, is a prime example of the interindividual variability in susceptibility to COVID-2 and its clinical outcomes.

### Programmable DNA pyrimidine base editing via engineered uracil-DNA glycosylase [^51b48214]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Screening UNG and its mutants from other species for more efficient thymine base editing

To further enhance thymine excision efficiency, we redirected our attention to UNG derived from various species. Employing protein sequence alignment, we specifically selected UNG from Escherichia coli (Ec), Deinococcus radiodurans (Dr), Human Herpesvirus 1 (HHV1), and Vaccinia virus (VACV). Utilizing homologous protein sequence alignment, we identified the corresponding amino acids in these UNG variants analogous to N204 and Y147 of hUNG. We then introduced mutations to these amino acids, changing them to D and A, respectively, to assess their efficacy in excising cytidine and thymine. We found that HHV1_UNG(N147D) achieved higher cytidine editing efficiency than hUNG(N204D), while EcUNG(N123D) was comparable to hUNG(N204D) (Supplementary Fig. 1). Regarding thymine editing, we found that wild-type DrUNG has comparable editing efficiency to hUNG(Y147A), while DrUNG(Y85A) exhibited the highest efficiency, nearly five times greater than that of hUNG(Y147A) (Fig. 2a). Despite this notable enhancement, there is still room for improvement in thymine editing efficiency when compared to cytidine editing. Consequently, we attempted further optimizations for the thymine base editor.

### Β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine inhibits SARS-CoV-2 through lethal mutagenesis but is also mutagenic to mammalian cells [^cbf0b556]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Mutagenic ribonucleosides can act as broad-based antiviral agents. They are metabolized to the active ribonucleoside triphosphate form and concentrate in genomes of RNA viruses during viral replication. β-d-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC, initial metabolite of molnupiravir) is > 100-fold more active than ribavirin or favipiravir against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with antiviral activity correlated to the level of mutagenesis in virion RNA. However, NHC also displays host mutational activity in an animal cell culture assay, consistent with RNA and DNA precursors sharing a common intermediate of a ribonucleoside diphosphate. These results indicate highly active mutagenic ribonucleosides may hold risk for the host.

Results

Engineering of human UNG enables cytosine and thymine base editing

The active site pocket of UNG has primarily evolved to excise uracil (U). Despite the structural similarities among the pyrimidines, cytosine, thymine and uracil exhibit distinct differences, particularly the methyl group at the 5th position of thymine(Fig. 1c). Based on structural analysis, amino acids G143-D145, Y147, and N204 play a role in influencing the size of its active site pocket in human UNG (hUNG)(Fig. 1b). Therefore, there is a possibility to introduce mutations in these amino acids, enabling the entry of C and T into the active site pocket and facilitating programmable C or T base editing (Fig. 1d).

### In vitro synergistic antiviral effects of β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine and teriflunomide in combination against a broad range of RNA viruses [^7e4dd404]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

Emerging and important endemic viral diseases without effective antiviral are important public health threat. An effective broad-spectrum antiviral can be a pivotal tool to mitigate future epidemics and provide a solution for endemic viral diseases. Molnupiravir, a pyrimidine analog, is known for the COVID-19 treatment. It has been shown to inhibit a broad range of RNA viruses. Inhibition of de novo pyrimidine synthesis by teriflunomide, a dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitor, also showed potent antiviral activity against various RNA viruses. Mechanistically, pyrimidine synthesis inhibition should enhance the activity of molnupiravir as it reduces competition of native nucleotides to incorporate into nascent viral RNA. Molnupiravir and teriflunomide combination has been recently shown to have synergistic effect against SARS-CoV-2. Here we show that the combination of β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine, the active form of molnupiravir, and teriflunomide also showed synergistic activity against many RNA viruses. This combination may offer an effective antiviral regimen not only for future emerging viral diseases but also existing important viral diseases.

### The variants question: what is the problem? [^de550921]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Coronaviruses such as SARS‐CoV‐2 are relatively stable thanks to a proofreading mechanism that operates during replication. Many genomic studies have nevertheless revealed changes in their genomes, including mutations and deletions. As the terms mutation, variant, and strain are often used interchangeably in describing the epidemiology of SARS‐CoV‐2, the distinctions appear to be crucial. The genetic material of SARS‐CoV‐2 is RNA. To replicate, and therefore establish the infection, the virus must hijack the host cell and use the cell's machinery to duplicate itself. Errors often occur during this entire process which is the RNA replication. This results in viruses that are similar but not exact copies of the original one. Those errors are called mutations, and viruses with these mutations are called variants. Variants could differ by a single or many mutations. A variant is referred to as a strain when it starts to present distinct physical properties. Such differences could involve a variant binding to a different cell receptor, or replicating more quickly, or transmitting more efficiently, and enhancement in its virulence. Essentially, all strains are variants, but not all variants are strains.

### Methotrexate inhibits SARS-CoV-2 virus replication "in vitro" [^8c800d69]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

In early 2020 the new respiratory syndrome COVID‐19 (caused by the zoonotic SARS‐CoV‐2 virus) spread like a pandemic, starting from Wuhan, China, causing severe economic depression. Despite some advances in drug treatments of medical complications in the later stages of the disease, the pandemic's death toll is tragic, as no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment is currently available. By using a systems approach, we identify the host‐encoded pathway, which provides ribonucleotides to viral RNA synthesis, as a possible target. We show that methotrexate, an FDA‐approved inhibitor of purine biosynthesis, potently inhibits viral RNA replication, viral protein synthesis, and virus release. The effective antiviral methotrexate concentrations are similar to those used for established human therapies using the same drug. Methotrexate should be most effective in patients at the earliest appearance of symptoms to effectively prevent viral replication, diffusion of the infection, and possibly fatal complications.

### A proofreading-impaired herpesvirus generates populations with quasispecies-like structure [^86516436]. Nature Microbiology (2019). High credibility.

RNA virus populations are composed of highly diverse individuals that form a cloud of related sequences commonly referred to as a 'quasispecies' 1–3. This diversity arises as a consequence of low-fidelity genome replication 4,5. By contrast, DNA virus populations contain more uniform individuals with similar fitness 6. Genome diversity is often correlated with increased fitness in RNA viruses, while DNA viruses are thought to require more faithful genome replication. During DNA replication, erroneously incorporated bases are removed by a 3'-5' exonuclease, a highly conserved enzymatic function of replicative DNA but not RNA polymerases. This proofreading process enhances replication fidelity and ensures the genome integrity of DNA organisms, including large DNA viruses 7. Here, we show that a herpesvirus can tolerate impaired exonucleolytic proofreading, resulting in DNA virus populations, which, as in RNA viruses 8, are composed of highly diverse genotypes of variable individual fitness. This indicates that herpesvirus mutant diversity may compensate for individual fitness loss. Notably, in vivo infection with diverse virus populations results in a marked increase in virulence compared to genetically homogenous parental virus. While we cannot exclude that the increase in virulence is caused by selection of and/or interactions between individual genotypes, our findings are consistent with quasispecies dynamics. Our results contrast with traditional views of DNA virus replication and evolution, and indicate that a substantial increase in population diversity can lead to higher virulence.

### Rates of evolutionary change in viruses: patterns and determinants [^761338ba]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2008). Medium credibility.

Understanding the factors that determine the rate at which genomes generate and fix mutations provides important insights into key evolutionary mechanisms. We review our current knowledge of the rates of mutation and substitution, as well as their determinants, in RNA viruses, DNA viruses and retroviruses. We show that the high rate of nucleotide substitution in RNA viruses is matched by some DNA viruses, suggesting that evolutionary rates in viruses are explained by diverse aspects of viral biology, such as genomic architecture and replication speed, and not simply by polymerase fidelity.

### Detection of low-level K65R variants in nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-naive chronic and acute HIV-1 subtype C infections [^0316f6be]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

To substantiate reports of greater emergence of the K65R nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) mutation in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype C, we examined natural low-level K65R expression in subtype C relative to subtypes B and AE. We used allele-specific polymerase chain reaction to screen HIV-1 amplified by reverse-transcription high-fidelity polymerase chain reaction from subtype C-infected South African women and infants and CRF01(subtype AE) from Thailand; all subjects were NRTI naive. We found low-level K65R of unknown clinical significance in NRTI-naive subtype C-infected women and infants at frequencies above the natural occurrence in subtypes B and AE. The frequent appearance of subtype C frameshift deletions at codon 65 supports a propensity for transcription error in this region.

### Human endonuclease V is a ribonuclease specific for inosine-containing RNA [^d4c65c22]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

Next, we tested whether hEndoV could cleave dsDNA substrates containing deoxyinosine. While both eEndoV and hEndoV could cleave ssDNA substrates containing deoxyinosine (Supplementary Fig. S2), differential cleavage functions were observed for dsDNA substrates. In dsDNA substrates containing deoxyinosine paired with either deoxythymine (dI:dT) or deoxycytosine (dI:dC), eEndoV exhibited cleavage activity; however, hEndoV had very little activity towards both of these substrates (Supplementary Fig. S2), suggesting that hEndoV required regions of ssDNA within the dsDNA for cleavage of the second and third phosphodiester bonds 3′ to the deoxyinosine. Interestingly, despite this inability to efficiently cleave dsDNA containing dI:dT or dI:dC, hEndoV had an affinity for ssDNA/dsDNA containing deoxyinosine (Supplementary Fig. S2) and for dsDNA containing no deoxyinosine (Supplementary Fig. S3). Moreover, as eEndoV appeared to have a broad substrate specificity, we tested whether hEndoV cleaved DNA-damaged substrates containing AP sites, O 6 -methylguanine, 8-oxoguanine, 5-methylcytosine, cis -syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers or pyrimidine(6–4)pyrimidone photoproducts. However, we did not observe these nuclease activities of hEndoV with these ssDNA substrates (Supplementary Fig. S4).

### Mutations in the HPV16 genome induced by APOBEC3 are associated with viral clearance [^d89fce88]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

There was no disparity between the mutation burden of nonsynonymous (i.e. missense or nonsense) and synonymous somatic mutations in controls, suggesting that these mutations are likely recent somatic mutations arising during a woman's infection which would not have had time to be selectively removed from the viral population (i.e. ineffective purifying selection). These mutations were also most often rare in our population (i.e. observed in < 1% of women) or singletons (i.e. observed in only one woman among 3500+), further suggesting that most of them arose recently within the host. It is possible that a minority of the rare low VAF variants could be due to PCR error or artifacts, although given our stringent quality control including the requirement that all variants be present in > 10 sequence reads, our low assay error rate, and the specific enrichment of APOBEC3 signature mutations in controls at a low VAF instead of random mutations across all samples (as would be expected from errors), this is likely minimal. We observed a significantly higher proportion of viral nonsynonymous APOBEC3-induced mutations compared with that for other non-APOBEC3 mutations. This is consistent with the Tp C dinucleotide depletion at the third codon position observed in the viral open-reading frame, which would result in our observed viral APOBEC3-induced mutations primarily occurring at the first and second codon positions and thus causing the enrichment of nonsynonymous changes. Given that 95% of the APOBEC3-induced mutations were nonsynonymous and more frequent in the controls, we presume these mutations were deleterious to viral persistence and thus constrained the viability of HPV16. Alternatively, it is also possible that these APOBEC3-induced mutations are a biomarker of an innate immune response to the virus.

### Unmasking the information encoded as structural motifs of viral RNA genomes: a potential antiviral target [^032b819c]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2013). Low credibility.

RNA viruses show enormous capacity to evolve and adapt to new cellular and molecular contexts, a consequence of mutations arising from errors made by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase during replication. Sequence variation must occur, however, without compromising functions essential for the completion of the viral cycle. RNA viruses are safeguarded in this respect by their genome carrying conserved information that does not code only for proteins but also for the formation of structurally conserved RNA domains that directly perform these critical functions. Functional RNA domains can interact with other regions of the viral genome and/or proteins to direct viral translation, replication and encapsidation. They are therefore potential targets for novel therapeutic strategies. This review summarises our knowledge of the functional RNA domains of human RNA viruses and examines the achievements made in the design of antiviral compounds that interfere with their folding and therefore their function.

### Mutation rate of the hepatitis C virus NS5B in patients undergoing treatment with ribavirin monotherapy [^602668a1]. Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Error catastrophe from an increase in mutation rate may be a possible mechanism of action of ribavirin in chronic hepatitis C (CHC). We sought to evaluate the mutagenic potential of ribavirin in vivo and to determine if conserved regions of hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B are mutated during ribavirin therapy.

Methods

Thirty-one patients with CHC genotype 1 who participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of ribavirin for 48 weeks were studied. After 48 weeks, patients on placebo were crossed-over to open-label ribavirin for 48 weeks. Viral RNA was extracted from paired, stored sera at day 0 and week 24 during the randomized phase and weeks 48, 52, and 72 during the cross-over phase. The entire NS5B region was sequenced and the mutation rates were calculated.

Results

An increase in mutation rate was observed after 4 weeks (4.4 x 10(-2) vs 2.1 x 10(-3) per site/y, P = 0.02) but not after 24 weeks (4.0 x 10(-3) vs. 5.5 x 10(-3) per site/y, P = 0.1) in patients who crossed over to ribavirin. Similarly, during the randomized phase no increase in the number of mutations or the mutation rate was observed at week 24 between the ribavirin- and placebo-treated patients 6.6 vs 4.3 x 10(-3) per site/y, respectively (P = 0.4). No mutations were observed in conserved regions of NS5B.

Conclusions

Ribavirin therapy is associated with an early, transient increase in the mutation rate of HCV. Lethal mutagenesis and error catastrophe is unlikely to be the sole mechanism of action of ribavirin during therapy for CHC.

### Utilizing HIV proviral DNA to assess for the presence of HIV drug resistance [^91ad084e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

HIV proviral DNA resistance testing — limitations, sensitivity, and reporting — are summarized as follows: At the time of therapy failure, RNA resistance testing is preferred since resistance mutations are detected in the plasma earlier than in DNA, and in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-suppressed individuals the negative-predictive value of HIV DNA resistance tests is lower than cumulative historical RNA-based resistance tests performed at failure. It is uncertain whether HIV DNA resistance testing information will lead to better treatment choices than clinical judgment, and sampling constraints mean only a subset of as much as 2 to 3 million peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is assessed; sensitive assays sometimes detect < 20% of all viral quasi-species and minority resistant variants may be overlooked, with an overall decreased sensitivity of HIV DNA testing compared with RNA testing. Selection of therapy based on the absence of drug resistance mutations (DRMs) in an HIV DNA test may therefore be risky, especially when switching to a regimen with a lower genetic barrier to resistance. On the other hand, DNA resistance testing may overestimate resistance because the viral reservoir is constituted primarily of defective proviruses, mainly due to large internal deletions and not just due to APOBEC-induced mutations, and some DRMs detected in proviral DNA may occur in nonviable viruses and thus unlikely to cause virologic failure, so avoiding a certain treatment based on such DRMs may be too restrictive and disqualify beneficial therapeutic options. The conclusions state that the use of HIV DNA resistance tests can lead to an underestimation of DRMs due to technical limitations and to a low negative-predictive value, as well as possible overestimation due to APOBEC3-induced defective proviruses; HIV drug-resistance testing using DNA may have added value for the indications described in this article, but given the limitations and technical challenges, vigorous quality control is warranted, it is important that reports clearly indicate when resistance results are based on DNA, and implementation in clinical practice with increased confidence will require additional rigorous clinical investigation.

### Future prospects for the treatment of rapidly evolving viral pathogens: insights from evolutionary biology [^de6c64be]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

The evolutionary dynamics of viruses must be taken into consideration in designing preventive and therapeutic treatments. Here we review mechanisms by which viruses adapt in response to antiviral interventions. We propose combination therapy and multiepitopic vaccines as adequate to circumvent virus adaptability. An alternative design, termed lethal mutagenesis or virus entry into error catastrophe is presented. It exploits the high error rates inherent in RNA virus replication, to provoke virus extinction through excess of mutations.

Ultraviolet radiation (UV) — the wavelength of UV radiation ranges from 328 nm to 210 nm (3280 A to 2100 A) and its maximum bactericidal effect occurs at 240–280 nm; mercury vapor lamps emit more than 90% of their radiation at 253.7 nm, near the maximum microbicidal activity. Inactivation of microorganisms results from destruction of nucleic acid through induction of thymine dimers, and UV has been employed in the disinfection of drinking water, air, titanium implants, and contact lenses. Bacteria and viruses are more easily killed by UV light than are bacterial spores, and effectiveness and use are influenced by organic matter; wavelength; type of suspension; temperature; type of microorganism; and UV intensity.

### P53 enhances the fidelity of DNA synthesis by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase [^41e37c8f]. Oncogene (2001). Low credibility.

The tumor suppressor protein p53 plays a critical role in the maintenance of genetic integrity. p53 possesses 3'→ 5' exonuclease activity, however, the significance of this function in DNA replication process remains elusive. It was suggested that 3'→ 5' exonuclease activity of p53 may provide a proofreading function for DNA polymerases. In order to better understand the significance of this activity, the purified wild-type recombinant p53 was further evaluated for substrate specificity and for contribution to the accuracy of DNA synthesis. p53-associated 3'→ 5' exonuclease displays 3' terminal nucleotide excision from RNA/DNA template-primer using ribosomal RNA as a template. The data demonstrate that p53 is highly efficient in removing a terminal mispair. Analysis of mispair excision opposite the template adenine residue shows that p53 catalyzes 3' terminal mismatch excision with a specificity of A: G > A: A > A: C. Hence, the observed specificity of mismatch excision indicates that p53 exonucleolytic proofreading preferentially repairs transversion mutations. The influence of the p53 on the accuracy of DNA synthesis was determined with exonuclease-deficient human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT), a key enzyme in the life cycle of the virus, that contributes significantly to the low accuracy of proviral DNA synthesis. Using an in vitro biochemical assay with recombinant purified HIV-1 RT, p53 and defined RNA/DNA or DNA/DNA template-primers, two basic features related to fidelity of DNA synthesis were studied: the misinsertion and mispair extension. The misincorporation of non-complementary deoxynucleotides into nascent DNA and subsequent mispair extension by HIV-1 RT were substantially decreased in the presence of p53 with both RNA/DNA and DNA/DNA template-primers. In addition, the productive interaction between polymerization (by HIV-1 RT) and exonuclease (by p53) activities was observed; p53 preferentially hydrolyzes mispaired 3'-termini, permitting subsequent extension of the correctly paired 3'-terminus by HIV-1 RT. Taken together the data demonstrate that preferential excision of mismatched nucleotides by 3'→ 5' exonuclease activity of wild-type p53 enhances the fidelity of DNA synthesis by HIV-1 RT in vitro, thus providing a biochemical mechanism to reduce mutations caused by incorporation of mismatched nucleotides. The fact that p53 is reactive with both RNA/DNA and DNA/DNA template-primers raises an interesting possibility of the existence of functional cooperation between p53 and HIV-1 RT in cytoplasm during the reverse transcription process, which may be important for maintaining HIV genomic integrity.

### Utilizing HIV proviral DNA to assess for the presence of HIV drug resistance [^64769c1d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

APOBEC3-mediated hypermutation in proviral DNA — interpretation and reporting: The near-universal presence of APOBEC-mediated G-to-A hypermutation at some level in PBMC HIV DNA and the action of APOBEC 3F and 3G (mutating GG to AG and GA to AA, respectively) can yield sequences with stop codons; DRMs resulting from G-to-A hypermutation are likely to be in replication-incompetent viruses with other crippling mutations. Eighteen DRMs arise within an APOBEC3-mediated dinucleotide context. For NGS, 2 approaches can be applied to account for APOBEC3-mediated DRMs: exclude hypermutated reads or determine the proportion of hypermutated sequences and report only APOBEC3-context DRMs above that proportion; studies using long-read NGS showed that stop codons and G-to-A hypermutation are mostly on the same read. It is essential that laboratory drug-resistance reports confirm that APOBEC3-mediated mutations have been purged from DNA resistance results when using NGS sequencing, and for Sanger sequencing laboratory reports should acknowledge this limitation and indicate which mutations may be mediated by APOBEC.

### MicroRNA-21 guide and passenger strand regulation of adenylosuccinate lyase-mediated purine metabolism promotes transition to an EGFR-TKI-tolerant persister state [^ecbdbe75]. Cancer Gene Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nucleic acids including deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are macromolecules that are central to all biological functions. Nucleic acid molecules consist of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides. Purine and pyrimidine nucleic acids include adenosine (A), guanosine (G), as well as cytosine (C), thymine (T), and uracil (U). The process of purine nucleoside metabolism is mainly catalyzed by metabolic enzyme activities leading to the creation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP). For example, adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) is an essential enzyme involved in purine metabolism. It catalyzes two reactions in the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway: the conversion of succino-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside (succino-AICAR or SAICAR) to AICAR (or acadesine) and the conversion of adenylosuccinate (S-AMP) to AMP. The metabolic enzymes mediating purine metabolism are finely controlled at the transcriptional or post-translational level. For example, the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) regulates methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2) enzyme at the transcriptional level contributing to purine synthesis. However, it is not clear how the processes for purine metabolism are controlled after genetic transcription. Thus, it is interesting to understand which molecules are involved in purine biosynthesis at the post-transcriptional level.

### Energy efficiency trade-offs drive nucleotide usage in transcribed regions [^9cde9a39]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

where S = 2 N e s with effective population size N e. On the lagging strand, u and v switch places, and thus

For non-transcribed sites, we assume that S = 0, and we obtain = μ, with the relative skew in mutation rates. Thus, the skew expected due to mutational biases alone equals the relative difference in mutation rates. The same equations hold for AT skew if we interpret u as the mutation rate from T to A on the leading strand, v as the reverse mutation rate from A to T, and s as the selection coefficient favouring A over T in transcribed sequences. Supplementary Figure 2 shows the dependence of γ on S for different values of μ.

If the scaled selection coefficient is small (S < 1), selection on individual sites is weak and correspondingly hard to detect. However, when pooling many genomic sites, as done for the calculations of γ, we gain the statistical power to detect even relatively small values of S.

We assume that the mutational bias μ of non-transcribed DNA is constant within any given genome, although it may vary between genomes, for example, due to differences in repair enzymes. An interaction between transcription and replication (caused, for example, by collisions between the replication and transcription machineries) may lead to an amplification of the mutational bias in transcribed sequences, quantified by an amplification factor τ; we assume that τ is a global, species-independent constant determined by basic cell biology. This assumption of a species-independent amplification factor is supported by a strong linear relationship between estimates of mutational bias for non-transcribed and transcribed sequences (see below). In a first approximation, we also assume that the scaled selection coefficient S is a genome-wide constant independent of transcription rate (see below for an analysis that explicitly considers transcription rates).

### Single amino acid substitution in the methyltransferase domain of paprika mild mottle virus replicase proteins confers the ability to overcome the high temperature-dependent Hk gene-mediated resistance in capsicum plants [^1c74af5b]. Virus Research (2009). Low credibility.

Capsicum plants harboring the Hk gene (Hk) show resistance to Paprika mild mottle virus (PaMMV) at 32 degrees C but not 24 degrees C. To identify the viral elicitor that activates the Hk-mediated resistance, several chimeric viral genomes were constructed between PaMMV and Tobacco mosaic virus-L. Infection patterns of these chimeric viruses in Hk-harboring plants revealed responsibility of PaMMV replicase genes for activation of the Hk-mediated resistance. The comparison of nucleotide sequence of replicase genes between PaMMV and PaHk1, an Hk-resistance-breaking strain of PaMMV, revealed that the adenine-to-uracil substitution at the nucleotide position 721 causes an amino acid change from threonine to serine at the 241st residue in the methyltransferase domain. Introduction of the A721U mutation into the replicase genes of parental PaMMV overcame the Hk resistance at 32 degrees C. The results indicate that Hk-mediated resistance is induced by PaMMV replicase proteins and that methyltransferase domain has a role in this elicitation.

### Innate immune control of influenza virus interspecies adaptation via IFITM3 [^f25af3e1]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

RNA viruses generally adapt to new host species by producing mutations arising from error-prone polymerases. Beneficial mutations that allow the virus to replicate more efficiently are enriched by outcompeting the parental virus and other mutants. Indeed, influenza virus and several other viruses replicate to higher titers in Ifitm3 −/− versus WT mice. which represents a plausible mechanism for enhanced adaptation in these animals. Similarly, our results indicate that IFITM3 deficiency also relaxes the infection bottleneck present at initial inoculation. In our current study, mutations in the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus passages that drive adaptation in mice were primarily observed in the viral polymerase subunits. Indeed, PB2 mutations at the E158 position are consistently reported in mouse-adapted versions of this virus. Moreover, the relative impact of E158 mutations on polymerase activity is in accord with viral replication and virulence levels observed in our in vivo experiments. We also identified a novel N373H mutation in PA from one H1N1 passage series, which emerged subsequent to the E158G mutation. The dual mutations were associated with enhanced replication in vivo compared to E158G alone. The mechanistic impact of the PA N373H mutation remains to be determined and may provide future insights into influenza virus replication and adaptation. Interestingly, we do not see an overall increase in variants in our IFITM3 KO-passaged virus stocks. Rather, in all four of our IFITM3 KO passaging experiments, the stock generated from the 10th KO passage contains the fewest number of minor variants as compared to parental virus and WT passages. This suggests that IFITM3 deficiency may promote viral adaptation by allowing adaptive variants to more efficiently outcompete other viruses in the quasispecies, perhaps by allowing infection of more cells per animal as our in vitro experiments would suggest.

### Structural basis of deoxynucleotide addition by HIV-1 RT during reverse transcription [^ebfd9dec]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Evolution of state R-2 into T 8sec required a boost of activation energy; this intermediate state was achieved with samples exposed to temperatures between 30 and 37° C immediately before plunge-freezing. The structure for the state T 8sec shows density in the Coulomb potential map that can accommodate two dATP conformers (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 5). The α-phosphate of dATP-i moves within ~4 Å of the 3′-OH primer and merges into the coordination sphere of the Mg 2+ site A*. This observation is unique among all previous structural (and time-resolved) work on DNA/RNA polymerases since high-temperature data collection could not be achieved for X-ray crystallographic experiments.

Employing the nucleoside analog 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine (EFdA)Salie et al. obtained intermediates of the RT inhibition reaction including a (pre-catalytic) EFdA-MP complex bound to a 3′-OH chain terminated RT-T/P binary complex; and two post-incorporation complexes where EFdA-MP was extended by deoxythymidine-MP or an additional EFdA-MP. However, the former included a 3′-OH terminated primer (inert substrate), and the latter was thermodynamically stable. Conversely, our cryo-EM structures feature primer extensions of a catalytically active RT-T/P binary complex using natural substrates. In particular, it was possible to capture snapshots of a primer extension where the structure of P 2min evolved into P 6min (Fig. 5a–c). The former features a mixture of transient (i.e. position and coordination of metal A*) and product states with a population of non-translocated and translocated particles (i.e. partial occupancies of the 2′-O-methylated dCMPs at positions +2, +3, +4 and +5). Conversely, in P 6min most or all particles have translocated one position. Moreover, state P 6min captures two conformers of the dATP in the binding pocket: (1) a pre-translocated dATP, or a reacting molecule, and (2) an inserted dAMP forming a phosphodiester bond with the primer and the released PPi, or reaction products. PPi is coordinated by metal B and stabilized through H-bonds with the surrounding residues. PPi release is likely concomitant with metals release as previous structures of RT with incorporated nucleotides on the N-site do not retain Mg +2 in either sites A or B; however, our structures do not allow us to confirm these observations.

What are Viral Variants and Why are They Important?

RNA viruses, including coronaviruses, acquire mutations quickly during viral replication in the host cytoplasm. Despite the presence of RNA proofreading activity that yields high replication fidelity, coronaviruses have several features that provide opportunities to acquire mutations compared with DNA viruses. The term mutation refers to the change in amino acid sequence of the virus. For example, one of the first described mutations of SARS-CoV-2 was an aspartic acid-to-glycine substitution at amino acid position 614 of the spike (S) protein (referred to as D614G). Viral genomes that differ in sequence are referred to as variants. New variants can potentially lead to challenges in clinical management due to greater disease transmissibility and virulence, as well the ability to cause disease in subjects who received vaccines that were developed for the wild-type SARS-CoV-2.

### Uracil in the carbonaceous asteroid (162173) ryugu [^df4af2d0]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The pristine sample from the near-Earth carbonaceous asteroid (162173) Ryugu collected by the Hayabusa2 spacecraft enabled us to analyze the pristine extraterrestrial material without uncontrolled exposure to the Earth's atmosphere and biosphere. The initial analysis team for the soluble organic matter reported the detection of wide variety of organic molecules including racemic amino acids in the Ryugu samples. Here we report the detection of uracil, one of the four nucleobases in ribonucleic acid, in aqueous extracts from Ryugu samples. In addition, nicotinic acid (niacin, a B 3 vitamer), its derivatives, and imidazoles were detected in search for nitrogen heterocyclic molecules. The observed difference in the concentration of uracil between A0106 and C0107 may be related to the possible differences in the degree of alteration induced by energetic particles such as ultraviolet photons and cosmic rays. The present study strongly suggests that such molecules of prebiotic interest commonly formed in carbonaceous asteroids including Ryugu and were delivered to the early Earth.

The C terminus of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) accessory protein vpr acts in viral cell cycle arrest, nuclear localization, and apoptosis. Polymorphisms in this region are described in series of long-term nonprogression cases. We determined vpr sequences of archived baseline specimens from 96 participants in a historical trial of single- versus double-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors. These sequences were then analyzed by study-entry and -outcome characteristics such as baseline absolute CD4(+) T cell count, prior treatment, CD4(+) T cell response, and clinical endpoints. Frequency of C-terminal mutations did not correlate to any measures of disease intensity. Changes in that portion of vpr did not attenuate disease.

### SARS-CoV-2: March toward adaptation [^f85808a3]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), the novel human pathogen, first detected in China quickly became a global health emergency, culminating with the World Health Organization publicly proclaiming the SARS‐CoV‐2 outbreak as a pandemic (11 March 2020). So far, more than 7 million people have been infected and more than 400 thousand have died, causing profound economic disruption and unsettling consolidated human traditions. SARS‐CoV‐2 is an enveloped +single‐stranded RNA virus, belonging to the Betacoronavirus genus, which includes two other RNA viruses that have caused recent important epidemics: SARS caused by SARS‐CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS‐CoV. SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV have caused more than 10 000 cumulative cases in the past 2 decades, with mortality rates of 9.6% for SARS‐CoV and 37% for MERS‐CoV, respectively.,

Viral fitness of RNA viruses is influenced by their very high frequency of mutation, which, in turn, can affect infection speed and evolution rate. However, the resulting genetic variability needs to be balanced between the maintenance of genetic information integrity and survival within the host. The viral genome mutagenic process is depended on several factors, including viral enzymes responsible for nucleic acids replication, which may have few or no proofreading and/or postreplicative nucleic acid repair capability. In addition, host enzymes, spontaneous nucleic acid damages due to physical and chemical mutagens, and recombination events can contribute to the genomic variability, together with particular genetic elements responsible for the production of new variants. Mutation rates are modulated also by additional factors such as determinants of the template sequence and structure involved in viral replication. In most viruses, RNA polymerase lacks proofreading capability, with some exceptions such as Nidovirales order (to which the Betacororonavirus belongs). In Nidoviruses, complex machinery originated as cleavage products of the viral ORF1a and ORF1b, composed of a polymerase (RNA‐depended RNA polymerase) and nonstructural proteins, is responsible for virus replication and transcription. Biological characterization of viral mutations provide precious insights for assessing viral drug resistance, immune escape, and pathogenesis‐related mechanisms. In addition, viral mutation studies are crucial for designing new vaccines, antiviral drugs, and diagnostic assays.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Emtricitabine: FTC, a synthetic nucleoside analog of cytidine, is phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form emtricitabine 5′-triphosphate. Emtricitabine 5′-triphosphate inhibits the activity of the HIV-1 RT by competing with the natural substrate deoxycytidine 5′-triphosphate and by being incorporated into nascent viral DNA, which results in chain termination. Emtricitabine 5′-triphosphate is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerase α, β, ε, and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ.

Rilpivirine: RPV is a diarylpyrimidine non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor of HIV-1 and inhibits HIV-1 replication by non-competitive inhibition of HIV-1 RT. RPV does not inhibit the human cellular DNA polymerases α, β, and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ.

Tenofovir DF: TDF is an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate diester analog of adenosine monophosphate. TDF requires initial diester hydrolysis for conversion to tenofovir and subsequent phosphorylations by cellular enzymes to form tenofovir diphosphate. Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits the activity of HIV-1 RT by competing with the natural substrate deoxyadenosine 5′-triphosphate and, after incorporation into DNA, by DNA chain termination. Tenofovir diphosphate is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases α, β, and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ.

### CDC scientists become first in history to directly sequence the… [^4d7dc79a]. archive.cdc.gov (2023). Medium credibility.

Information determining the makeup of nearly every living thing is stored in dual-stranded DNA. The complete set of these DNA instructions for an organism is called its "genome. " A genome is like a blueprint for how any given organism, including a person, is made. However, while the genomes of people and other living things consist of DNA, some things that aren't technically "living, " such as viruses, have genomes coded by RNA instructions instead. Influenza viruses are an example of an RNA virus. For decades, scientists who wanted to research the genome of RNA viruses, such as influenza, had to do so using an indirect and time-consuming method that involved first converting the single-stranded RNA into double-stranded DNA. This method, often referred to as "reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction", works well for clinical purposes, such as identifying specific viruses from respiratory samples taken from sick patients.

However, scientists believe that certain small features of the virus may get lost during the conversion from RNA to DNA. The new method described in this study has the potential to allow researchers to decode the genome of an RNA virus with greater detail than ever before. For example, compare an original photograph to a copy of the same photograph. The copy will give you a pretty good idea of the original, but the copy may lack the resolution and granularity of all the details found in the original photo. Whereas a computer decodes a series of binary numbers, DNA and RNA are encoded into a series of four letters. For DNA, these letters are A, C, G and T. For RNA, the T becomes a U, so the letters are A, C, G and U. The T stands for "Thymine, " whereas the U stands for "Uracil.

" According to Keller, this is one of the main differences between DNA and RNA, and why translating RNA into DNA can sometimes result in information loss. Now that Keller et al have managed to directly sequence RNA for the first time, the group hopes to find details of the influenza A virus' genome that are otherwise hidden and extremely difficult to detect. Keller says this research may shed new light on the intricate lifecycle of an influenza virus as it replicates its genome and itself.

Emtricitabine, Rilpivirine, and TDF: The triple combination of FTC, RPV, and TDF was not antagonistic in cell culture.

Emtricitabine: The antiviral activity of FTC against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was assessed in lymphoblastoid cell lines, the MAGI-CCR5 cell line, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The 50% effective concentration (EC50) values for FTC were in the range of 0.0013–0.64 µM. FTC displayed antiviral activity in cell culture against HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, and G (EC50values ranged from 0.007–0.075 µM) and showed strain specific activity against HIV-2 (EC50values ranged from 0.007–1.5 µM). In drug combination studies of FTC with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (abacavir, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, zidovudine), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (delavirdine, EFV, nevirapine, and RPV), and protease inhibitors (amprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir), no antagonistic effects were observed.

### Stable inhibition of human thymidylate synthase expression following retroviral introduction of an siRNA gene [^676e1501]. Cancer Gene Therapy (2006). Low credibility.

Thymidylate synthase (TS) is an essential enzyme that synthesizes thymidylic acid in the de novo biosynthetic pathway. Inhibiting TS enzyme activity with substrate or cofactor analogs leads to inhibition of DNA replication and cell death. For this reason, TS is an important target enzyme for cancer chemotherapeutic drugs. We describe an alternative approach to reducing cellular TS enzyme activity using short interfering RNA (siRNA) technology to lower TS mRNA levels. Plasmids that direct the synthesis of siRNAs that target nucleotides 898–916 and 965–983 (relative to the A of the translational start codon) of human TS mRNA were highly effective at reducing TS enzyme levels in transient transfection assays. Infection of HeLa cells with retroviruses that contain the effective siRNA genes led to a stable 80–95% reduction of TS enzyme and mRNA. A similar percent reduction in TS expression was observed in a cell line that overproduces TS enzyme 100-fold due to TS gene amplification. Cells that exhibited the greatest reduction in TS enzyme level grew poorly in medium that lacked thymidine. These observations suggest that siRNA approaches may provide an alternative therapeutic strategy to reduce TS enzyme levels.

### Mechanisms of telomerase inhibition by oxidized and therapeutic dNTPs [^6a0a033c]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The oxidative stress-induced telomere shortening observed upon MTH1 inhibition has been attributed to telomerase 8-oxodGTP insertion which prevents further elongation. Our biochemical results indicate that oxidized dATPs can also contribute to telomerase inhibition in MTH1-depleted cells. Although 8-oxo-dATP is a very poor telomerase substrate, it inhibits processivity. Polymerase studies with 8-oxo-dATP are lacking, but mammalian DNA polymerases insert dTTP or dGTP opposite a template 8-oxodA and accommodate the base pairs through base tautomerization and interactions with active site residues. Telomerase may lack contacts required to stabilize an 8-oxodA base pair for catalysis, or 8-oxo-dATP may occupy the active site in a non-productive manner blocking natural dNTP access, similar to telomerase inhibitor 5-MeCITP. In contrast, a 2-OH-dATP:rU base pair is well tolerated in the telomerase active site since 2-OH-dATP insertion opposite rU is only 2-fold less efficient than dATP. 2-OH-dATP can pair with thymine or uracil either in an enol tautomeric form with Watson–Crick hydrogen bonding, or in a keto form through wobble base pairing. Similarly, HIV-1 and avian myeoblastosis virus RTs preferentially insert 2-OH-dATP opposite dT or rU more efficiently than replicative polymerases. Translesion DNA polymerases harbor a larger binding pocket to accommodate lesions, however, not all can incorporate 2-OH-dATP. Pol η incorporates 2-OH-dATP opposite all template bases except dA, whereas Pol ι cannot. Our data indicate that telomerase insertion of 2-OH-dATP more closely resembles other RTs compared to replicative and TLS polymerases, consistent with a similar binding pocket.

### Amantadine [^d6b62c5b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Pharmacodynamics

 Mechanism of Action: Antiviral

The mechanism by which amantadine exerts its antiviral activity is not clearly understood. It appears to mainly prevent the release of infectious viral nucleic acid into the host cell by interfering with the function of the transmembrane domain of the viral M2 protein. In certain cases, amantadine is also known to prevent virus assembly during virus replication. It does not appear to interfere with the immunogenicity of inactivated influenza A virus vaccine.

Antiviral Activity

Amantadine inhibits the replication of influenza A virus isolates from each of the subtypes, i.e. H1N1, H2N2 and H3N2. It has very little or no activity against influenza B virus isolates. A quantitative relationship between the in vitro susceptibility of influenza A virus to amantadine and the clinical response to therapy has not been established in man. Sensitivity test results, expressed as the concentration of amantadine required to inhibit by 50% the growth of virus (ED50) in tissue culture vary greatly (from 0.1 μg/mL to 25 μg/mL) depending upon the assay protocol used, size of virus inoculum, isolates of influenza A virus strains tested, and the cell type used. Host cells in tissue culture readily tolerated amantadine up to a concentration of 100 μg/mL.

The ribozyme-cleaved RNA was purified on by 10% denaturing PAGE and re-folded at 65 °C for 3 min at 2–5 mg/mL in a buffer containing 2.5 mM MgCl 2 and 10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, and then allowed to equilibrate to room temperature before a final concentration of 0.5 mM spermidine was added to the RNA. Crystal Screens I and II and Natrix I and II screens from Hampton Research were used in initial screens at 4 °C, 16 °C, 20 °C, and 24 °C. Crystals were optimized using custom screens. The RNAs used for the final structure determination were crystallized in 50 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 2.5 M ammonium sulfate, 20 mM MgCl 2, 1.0 mM spermine, and 2 mM hexamine cobalt chloride. Crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for x-ray diffraction with the addition of 20–30% glycerol in the same crystallization buffer. Diffraction data were collected at Advanced Light Source Beamline 4.2.2 using "shutterless" collection at 100°K; 180° datasets with "oscillation" images of 0.2°. Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using X-ray diffraction and spectroscopy. Pointless from the CCP4 suitedetermined the space group was I222 and Phenixwas used to determine a molecular replacement solution based on these parameters and a search model consisting of residues 1–26 and 32–82 of the TYMV TLS lacking ligands (PDB ID:). Iterative rounds of model building and refinement using COOT, and Phenixwere used to generate a complete model of the RNA.

### Engineering a fidelity-variant live-attenuated vaccine for chikungunya virus [^01c7afd9]. NPJ Vaccines (2020). Medium credibility.

A risk of virulent reversion is inherent to any live-attenuated vaccine (LAV) candidate and poses a significant barrier to large human trials and regulatory agency approvals. RNA viruses like CHIKV are at heightened risk of reversion due to error-prone replication from RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs), which usually lack the proofreading capacities possessed by DNA polymerases. The typical viral RdRP incorporates an erroneous nucleotide during replication at a rate of 1 per 10 3 to 10 5 nucleotides, versus 1 in 10 4–10 6 nucleotides by non-error-correcting DNA polymerases. Furthermore, mismatch repair mechanisms help drive DNA replication error rates down to just 1 in 10 6–10 8 nucleotides. Replication fidelity of RdRPs can be manipulated through serial passage in the presence of nucleoside analogs, artificially selecting for polymerases that more stringently incorporate target nucleotides –. We previously reported on two such mutations in the CHIKV replication complex, RdRP mutation nsP4 C483Y, and protease/helicase mutation nsP2 G641D. Combined, these replication complex variants reduce the observed CHIKV error rate by as much as 50% when assessed by targeted bacterial cloning-based sequencing of the envelope 1 (E1) surface glycoprotein. Recently, however, our lab employed next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches to resolve error type and frequency derived by these variants at greater resolution with mixed results. While the antimutator phenotype of CHIKV strain 06–049 nsP2 G641D /nsP4 C483Y (CHIKV-06-049-P2.P4) is maintained in targeted sequencing approaches, a broad survey of nucleotide substitution rates measured by NGS revealed elevated error incorporation in progeny virus populations compared to the wild-type sequence, raising concerns that the sequencing methodology used can influence antimutator assignation.

### African swine fever virus vaccine strain asfv-G-∆ I177l reverts to virulence and negatively affects reproductive performance [^4fe1fe19]. NPJ Vaccines (2025). Medium credibility.

To get a complete picture of the changes that occurred during passaging, these regions were PCR amplified, including all the longer poly G/C stretches, from viruses of each passage, and sequenced the amplicons (Fig. S1). Comparing the size of the poly G/C stretches of the passaged viruses with that of the P0 virus showed that they occasionally diverged 1–2 nucleotides in the different passages but without an obvious direction (Table S8). Mutations or polymorphisms were not detected in the transgenic region, demonstrating that the sequence of the transgene (mCherry regulated by the p72 promoter) remained stable throughout the passages (Table S12). The B385R ORF exhibited a polymorphic nucleotide at position 104908 (cytosine/thymine) in passages 2 and 3 but reverted to its original cytosine form and became homogenous again in passage 4 (Tables S11, S12).

The only changes showing some successions were detected in three separate nucleotide positions in the C257L gene. At position 86868, cytosine became polymorphic (cytosine/thymine) in passages 2 and 3, and subsequently changed to thymine in passage 4, resulting in an amino acid change from glutamic acid to lysine. The C257L ORF contains a homopolymer stretch of seven thymine residues at nucleotide position 87231–87237, which was reduced to four thymines in passage 4, causing a deletion of one lysine residue in the C257L protein. At position 87086, guanine exhibited polymorphism (guanine/adenine) in passages 3 and 4. In the late passages, the transition from guanine to adenine resulted in an alanine to valine amino acid substitution (Tables S11, S12, Fig. 3). NGS sequencing of the full genome of passage 4 virus confirmed the sequencing results of the PCR amplicons, and no other additional mutations were found in the virus genome. To determine the relative position of the three SNPs in the virus quasispecies, the C257L gene was PCR amplified and cloned. From the resulting clones, 5 were sequenced. Four out of the five clones carried the C86868T and the three thymine deletions at position 87231–87237 in combination, while the remaining clone carried only the latter, and the adenine mutation at position 87086 could not be detected in any of the clones.

### The folate antagonist methotrexate diminishes replication of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and enhances the antiviral efficacy of remdesivir in cell culture models [^7d8580c7]. Virus Research (2021). Medium credibility.

The search for successful therapies of infections with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing. We tested inhibition of host cell nucleotide synthesis as a promising strategy to decrease the replication of SARS-CoV-2-RNA, thus diminishing the formation of virus progeny. Methotrexate (MTX) is an established drug for cancer therapy and to induce immunosuppression. The drug inhibits dihydrofolate reductase and other enzymes required for the synthesis of nucleotides. Strikingly, the replication of SARS-CoV-2 was inhibited by MTX in therapeutic concentrations around 1 µM, leading to more than 1000-fold reductions in virus progeny in Vero C1008 (Vero E6) and ~100-fold reductions in Calu-3 cells. Virus replication was more sensitive to equivalent concentrations of MTX than of the established antiviral agent remdesivir. MTX strongly diminished the synthesis of viral structural proteins and the amount of released virus RNA. Virus replication and protein synthesis were rescued by folinic acid (leucovorin) and also by inosine, indicating that purine depletion is the principal mechanism that allows MTX to reduce virus RNA synthesis. The combination of MTX with remdesivir led to synergistic impairment of virus replication, even at 100 nM MTX. The use of MTX in treating SARS-CoV-2 infections still awaits further evaluation regarding toxicity and efficacy in infected organisms, rather than cultured cells. Within the frame of these caveats, however, our results raise the perspective of a two-fold benefit from repurposing MTX for treating COVID-19. Firstly, its previously known ability to reduce aberrant inflammatory responses might dampen respiratory distress. In addition, its direct antiviral activity described here would limit the dissemination of the virus.

### Direct translation of incoming retroviral genomes [^c6f81c55]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Viruses that carry a positive-sense, single-stranded (+ssRNA) RNA translate their genomes soon after entering the host cell to produce viral proteins, with the exception of retroviruses. A distinguishing feature of retroviruses is reverse transcription, where the +ssRNA genome serves as a template to synthesize a double-stranded DNA copy that subsequently integrates into the host genome. As retroviral RNAs are produced by the host cell transcriptional machinery and are largely indistinguishable from cellular mRNAs, we investigated the potential of incoming retroviral genomes to directly express proteins. Here we show through multiple, complementary methods that retroviral genomes are translated after entry. Our findings challenge the notion that retroviruses require reverse transcription to produce viral proteins. Synthesis of retroviral proteins in the absence of productive infection has significant implications for basic retrovirology, immune responses and gene therapy applications.

### Clinical and infection prevention applications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 genotyping: an Infectious Diseases Society of America / American Society for Microbiology consensus review document [^26c711bd]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Medium credibility.

TEXT

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has coincided with growing abilities in infectious disease genomics, resulting in an explosion of data. With more than 2 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes available as of summer 2021, SARS-CoV-2 is now defined by a multitude of different lineages. To put this in context, there are currently fewer than 500 publicly available genomes for the four seasonal human coronaviruses combined. While SARS-CoV-2 variants may be associated with multiple clinical outcomes, the clinical utility of providing SARS-CoV-2 genotype results remains unclear. Here, we describe the potential roles of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing for clinical care and the challenges faced by laboratories endeavoring to implement this process.

SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the family Coronaviridae and has a large RNA genome at around 30 kb. Coronaviruses are able to propagate large genomes in part due to mutation rates substantially lower than those of other RNA viruses, achieved by means of viral accessory proteins compensating for the lack of intrinsic proofreading among RNA polymerases. As a result, the observed evolutionary rate for SARS-CoV-2 is roughly one mutation per genome per 2 weeks (corresponding to approximately two generations of host infection). Coronavirus evolutionary rates are much slower than those of other common RNA viruses, such as influenza virus or HIV, leading to a lower observed genotype sequence variation among SARS-CoV-2 isolates on a per-nucleotide basis.

For SARS-CoV-2, we are still learning which nucleotide sequence differences convey clinically significant information. The short time frame of study has been matched by a plethora of clinical studies and incipient abilities to profile mutation function at scale. At this point, a handful of known SARS-CoV-2 mutations have been associated with substantial in vivo effects.

### Different viral rebound following discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy in cases of infection with viruses carrying L74V or thymidine-associated mutations [^8c028060]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

A total of 76 patients discontinued treatment with didanosine plus hydroxyurea after 1 year of maintenance therapy. The greatest human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-RNA rebounds were seen in 10 patients harboring an L74V mutation, and the presence of viruses with this mutation rapidly waned. In contrast, viral rebounds were significantly less pronounced (P < 0.01) in 12 subjects harboring thymidine-associated mutations; these mutations persisted in all instances. Thus, selection of an L74V mutation during didanosine therapy may compromise HIV replication in vivo.

### An improved strategy for the synthesis of [¹ ⁸ F]-labeled arabinofuranosyl nucleosides [^83a16318]. Nuclear Medicine and Biology (2012). Low credibility.

The expression of the herpes simplex virus type-1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-tk) gene can be imaged efficaciously using a variety of 2'-[(18)F]fluoro-2'-deoxy-1-b-D-arabinofuranosyl-uracil derivatives [[(18)F]-FXAU, X = I(iodo), E(ethyl), and M(methyl)]. However, the application of these derivatives in clinical and translational studies has been impeded by their complicated and long syntheses (3-5h). To remedy these issues, in the study at hand we have investigated whether microwave or combined catalysts could facilitate the coupling reaction between sugar and nucleobase and, further, have probed the feasibility of establishing a novel approach for [(18)F]-FXAU synthesis. We have demonstrated that the rate of the trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTf)-catalyzed coupling reaction between the 2-deoxy-sugar and uracil derivatives at 90 °C can be significantly accelerated by microwave-driven heating or by the addition of Lewis acid catalyst (SnCl(4)). Further, we have observed that the stability of the α- and β-anomers of [(18)F]-FXAU derivatives differs during the hydrolysis step. Using the microwave-driven heating approach, overall decay-corrected radiochemical yields of 19%-27% were achieved for [(18)F]-FXAU in 120min at a specific activity of > 22MBq/nmol (595Ci/mmol). Ultimately, we believe that these high yielding syntheses of [(18)F]-FIAU, [(18)F]-FMAU and [(18)F]-FEAU will facilitate routine production for clinical applications.

### Clinical and infection prevention applications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 genotyping: an Infectious Diseases Society of America / American Society for Microbiology consensus review document [^87b7c4c6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has coincided with growing abilities in infectious disease genomics, resulting in an explosion of data. With > 2 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes available as of summer 2021, SARS-CoV-2 is now defined by a multitude of different lineages. To put this in context, there are currently < 500 publicly available genomes for the 4 seasonal human coronaviruses combined. While SARS-CoV-2 variants may be associated with multiple clinical outcomes, the clinical utility of providing SARS-CoV-2 genotype results remains unclear. Here, we describe the potential roles of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing for clinical care, and the challenges faced by laboratories endeavoring to implement this process.

SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the family Coronaviridae and has a large RNA genome, at about 30 kilobases. Coronaviruses are able to propagate large genomes in part owing to mutation rates substantially lower than for other RNA viruses, achieved by means of viral accessory proteins compensating for the lack of intrinsic proofreading among RNA polymerases. As a result, the observed evolutionary rate for SARS-CoV-2 is roughly 1 mutation per genome per 2 weeks (corresponding to approximately 2 generations of host infection). Coronavirus evolutionary rates are much slower compared with other common RNA viruses, such as influenza virus or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), leading to a lower observed genotype sequence variation among SARS-CoV-2 isolates on a per-nucleotide basis.

### Remdesivir (Veklury) [^d66d1436]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In Clinical Trials

SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding results from GS-US-540-5776 (ACTT-1) indicate that remdesivir does not significantly reduce the amount of detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs or plasma samples in hospitalized patients compared to placebo, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding results from GS-US-540-9012 indicate that remdesivir does not significantly reduce the amount of detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs in non-hospitalized patients compared to placebo.

In Cell Culture

SARS-CoV-2 isolates with reduced susceptibility to remdesivir have been selected in cell culture. In a selection with GS-441524, the parent nucleoside of remdesivir, virus pools emerged expressing amino acid substitutions at V166A, N198S, S759A, V792I, C799F, and C799R in the viral RdRp (nsp12). When these substitutions were individually introduced into a wild-type recombinant virus by site-directed mutagenesis, 1.7- to 3.5-fold reductions in susceptibility to remdesivir were observed.

In a cell culture resistance selection experiment with remdesivir, nsp12 substitution E802D emerged, resulting in a 1.4- to 2.5-fold reduction in susceptibility to remdesivir. In another selection with remdesivir using a SARS-CoV-2 isolate containing the P323L substitution in the viral polymerase, a single amino acid substitution at V166L emerged. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 with substitutions at P323L alone or P323L+V166L in combination exhibited 1.3- and 1.5-fold reductions in remdesivir susceptibility, respectively.

Cell culture resistance profiling of remdesivir using the rodent CoV murine hepatitis virus identified two substitutions (F476L and V553L) in the viral RdRp (nsp12) at residues conserved across CoVs. Introduction of the corresponding substitutions (F480L and V557L) into SARS-CoV resulted in 6-fold reduction in susceptibility to remdesivir in cell culture and attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model. When individually introduced into a SARS-CoV-2 recombinant virus, the corresponding substitutions at F480L and V557L each conferred 2-fold reduced susceptibility to remdesivir.

### Cell culture-adaptive mutations in the NS5B gene of hepatitis C virus with delayed replication and reduced cytotoxicity [^776c258a]. Virus Research (2009). Low credibility.

Remarkable advances have been made through recent demonstrations of hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication in cultured cells transfected with in vitro synthesized viral genome RNA. From the HCV JFH1 (genotype 2a) subcultured successively in Huh-7 cells we have identified several missense mutations near the junction of NS5A and NS5B genes. Reverse genetic analysis indicated that two mutations in the N-terminal region of NS5B replicase caused delayed viral RNA replication and protein expression in the early stage of infection. However, the mutant viruses showed significantly alleviated effects on cell growth inhibition, proteolysis of viral proteins, apoptotic DNA cleavage, and induction of antiviral responses, giving rise to a 100-fold higher titer compared to the parental JFH1 virus in a more extended time period. These results suggested that delayed replication and reduced cytotoxicity can be characteristic features of cell culture-adaptive mutants with enhanced infectivity.

### Nucleic acid binding by SAMHD1 contributes to the antiretroviral activity and is enhanced by the gpsN modification [^d549ad57]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Mutations that impair formation of the oligonucleotide-bound tetramer abolish the antiretroviral activity of SAMHD1, but not its ability to deplete dNTPs

Finally, we used site-directed mutagenesis to evaluate the contribution of oligonucleotide binding to the antiretroviral function of SAMHD1. Oligonucleotides and nucleotide triphosphates bind at overlapping sites and the protein can form mixed-occupancy tetramers, making it difficult to explore the function of these distinct ligands independently using mutagenesis. We generated point mutants — H376A, R352A, and K523A — of three residues making similar hydrogen bonds with the triphosphate segment of dNTP bound in A2. The key difference between the three residues is that H376 mediates a critical interaction in oligonucleotide binding and is highly conserved in prokaryotic SAMHD1-like enzymes, whereas R352 and K523 do not interact with oligonucleotides and their conservation in prokaryotes is less pronounced (Fig. 5c–e). In agreement with structural data, H376A diminished oligonucleotide binding by SAMHD1 as evaluated by fluorescence anisotropy (Fig. 6a) and SEC (Fig. 6c), whereas R352A and K523A displayed similar oligonucleotide-binding affinities to WT and could both form dimers upon oligonucleotide binding. As expected, all three mutants diminished the ability of the protein to tetramerize in the presence of GTP/dNTP and displayed comparable reductions in the dNTPase activity in vitro (Fig. 6b, c). Notably, this partial in vitro dNTPase defect did not impair the ability of the enzyme to deplete dNTP levels in U937 cells as monitored by the primer extension assay following MTA-induced differentiation (Fig. 6d, e). All three mutations abolished the antiretroviral activity of SAMHD1, despite the ability of the mutant enzymes to deplete cellular dNTPs (Fig. 6d, f). We also evaluated whether the protein expression levels had an effect on the ability of the protein to deplete dNTPs and to restrict HIV replication (Supplementary Fig. 5). To this end, we investigated distinct stably transduced cell lines whose expression levels of WT and H376A variants of SAMHD1 differed up to fourfold. We observed that differences in SAMHD1 abundance had no significant effect on the efficiency of dNTP depletion or HIV restriction. Intriguingly, we observed small, but reproducible, differences in the dNTP depletion efficiency between WT and H376 variants in this series of experiments, which indicated that some important features of dNTP depletion may not be fully captured in the measurements of the total cellular dNTP content (see "Discussion"). Overall, the retroviral restriction defect correlated with the inability of all three mutations to form mixed-occupancy tetramers in the presence of oligonucleotides and nucleotide triphosphates (Fig. 6 c, f). This was further supported by oligonucleotide titration experiments analyzed by SEC (Supplementary Fig. 5), which revealed a twofold increase in the oligonucleotide-binding stoichiometry of the R352 and K523 mutants compared to D311A variant. These observations suggest that oligonucleotide-dependent SAMHD1 dimerization is not sufficient for restriction, whereas formation of the oligonucleotide-bound, mixed-occupancy SAMHD1 tetramer that is lost in all three mutants H376A, R352, and K523, is required for the antiretroviral activity of the protein.

### Silent mutations are selected in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and affect enzymatic efficiency [^27191e42]. AIDS (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Missense mutations in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase are frequently selected in response to therapy; we examined whether silent mutations were also selected for by HIV therapy.

Design

Retrospective, observational analysis. Biochemical assays.

Methods

A comparison of the reverse transcriptase gene, from antiretroviral- naive (N = 812) and experienced individuals (N = 2212), reveals two silent mutations (K65K and K66K) that are strongly associated with treatment experience. To assess reverse transcription efficiency, steady-state kinetic assays were carried out using recombinant purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and a series of synthetic RNA/DNA template/primer substrates. The RNA templates spanned codons 60–77 in the reverse transcriptase and included different combinations of mutations at codons 65, 66, 67, and 70.

Results

Silent AAG mutations (or mixtures) at reverse transcriptase codons 65 and/or 66 were observed in 812 samples from 351 patients and 2129 samples from 829 patients, respectively. In clade B samples, there was a very strong relationship between the silent mutations and the thymidine analogue mutations, in particular D67N. Steady-state kinetic experiments demonstrated that HIV-1 reverse transcriptase exhibited a strong tendency to pause and/or dissociate at codons 65 and 66 on RNA templates that contained the D67N and K70R mutations. However, when the K66 or K66 AAA to AAG mutations were added to the background of the 67 and 70 mutational changes, these pausing and/or dissociation events were largely alleviated.

Conclusion

Silent mutations at codons 65 and/or 66 are strongly coselected with thymidine analogue mutations. These data provide the first evidence for an RNA-level mechanism of direct relevance to drug resistance.

### Didanosine [^8d36d3be]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Didanosine is a synthetic nucleoside analogue of the naturally occurring nucleoside deoxyadenosine in which the 3'-hydroxyl group is replaced by hydrogen. Intracellularly, didanosine is converted by cellular enzymes to the active metabolite, dideoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate. Dideoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase both by competing with the natural substrate, deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate, and by its incorporation into viral DNA causing termination of viral DNA chain elongation.

Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture

The anti-HIV-1 activity of didanosine was evaluated in a variety of HIV-1 infected lymphoblastic cell lines and monocyte/macrophage cell cultures. The concentration of drug necessary to inhibit viral replication by 50% (EC50) ranged from 2.5 to 10 μM

(1 μM = 0.24 mcg/mL) in lymphoblastic cell lines and 0.01 to 0.1 μM in monocyte/macrophage cell cultures.

Resistance

HIV-1 isolates with reduced sensitivity to didanosine have been selected in cell culture and were also obtained from patients treated with didanosine. Genetic analysis of isolates from didanosine-treated patients showed mutations in the reverse transcriptase gene that resulted in the amino acid substitutions K65R, L74V, and M184V. The L74V substitution was most frequently observed in clinical isolates. Phenotypic analysis of HIV-1 isolates from 60 patients (some with prior zidovudine treatment) receiving 6 to 24 months of didanosine monotherapy showed that isolates from 10 of 60 patients exhibited an average of a 10-fold decrease in susceptibility to didanosine in cell culture compared to baseline isolates. Clinical isolates that exhibited a decrease in didanosine susceptibility harbored one or more didanosine resistance-associated substitutions.

### Dysregulated metabolites and lipids in serum of patients with acute hepatitis E: a longitudinal study [^ff818cf3]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2023). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis E is a disease associated with acute inflammation of the liver. It is related to several dysregulated metabolic pathways and alterations in the concentration of several metabolites. However, longitudinal analysis of the alterations in metabolites and lipids is generally lacking. This study investigated the changes in levels of metabolites and lipids over time in sera from men with acute hepatitis E compared to healthy controls similar in age and gender. Untargeted measurement of levels of various metabolites and lipids was done using mass spectrometry on 65 sera sequentially sampled from 14 patients with acute hepatitis E and 25 serum samples from five controls. Temporal changes in intensities of metabolites and lipids were determined over different times at 3-day periods for the hepatitis E virus (HEV) group. In carbohydrate metabolism, glucose levels, fructose 1-6-bisphosphate and ribulose-5-phosphate were increased in the HEV-infected persons compared to the healthy controls. HEV infection is significantly associated with decreased levels of inosine, guanosine, adenosine and urate in purine metabolism and thymine, uracil and β-aminoisobutyrate in pyrimidine metabolism. Glutamate, alanine and valine levels were significantly lower in the HEV group than in healthy individuals. Homogentisate of tyrosine metabolism and cystathionine of serine metabolism were increased, whereas kynurenate of tryptophan metabolism decreased in the HEV group. Metabolites of the bile acid biosynthesis, urea cycle (arginine and citrulline) and ammonia recycling (urocanate) were significantly altered. Co-enzymes, pantothenate and pyridoxal, and co-factors, lipoamide and FAD, were elevated in the HEV group. The acylcarnitines, sphingomyelins, phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), lysoPC and lysoPE tended to be lower in the HEV group. In conclusion, acute hepatitis E is associated with altered metabolite and lipid profiles, significantly increased catabolism of carbohydrates, purines/pyrimidines and amino acids, and decreased levels of several glycerophospholipids.

### Ascertaining cells' synaptic connections and RNA expression simultaneously with barcoded rabies virus libraries [^bd18cbb9]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

We first developed a PCR-based strategy to flexibly engineer bipartite barcodes, generated through combinatorial diversity, into circular DNA plasmids (Supplementary Fig. 1b), followed by transformation and plate-based growth conditions optimized to retain DNA plasmid barcode diversity (Supplementary Fig. 2b, c). We also created a rabies rescue system — achieving equivalent viral titers threefold faster than the current, field-standard protocol — that minimized barcode loss and disproportionate amplification during viral replication (Supplementary Fig. 2d). To assess viral barcode diversity and distribution, we used single-molecule sequencing (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 1c), for which we developed analysis methods to identify and correct for PCR and sequencing mutations (Supplementary Fig. 2b and Methods).

We used this approach to generate an EnvA-pseudotyped rabies library with a 20 bp randomer encoded in the 3′ UTR of EGFP of SAD-dG-B19 (EnvA-RV dG - EGFP VBC; Supplementary Fig. 1a). We compared the total number of unique barcodes and their relative abundances across each production stage (Fig. 1d–g and Supplementary Fig. 1a). After PCR and circularization, nearly every sequenced plasmid contained a unique barcode. This diversity was reduced by bacterial amplification, though without substantially distorting representation of the retained barcodes. Rabies rescue induced barcode loss and abundance distortions and was mildly exacerbated by EnvA-pseudotyping. Deeper sequencing of the final EnvA-RV dG - EGFP VBC genomes (6.4 unique molecular identifiers (UMI) per viral barcode on average) quantified the relative abundances of 1.29 million unique, error-corrected barcodes (Fig. 1f).

### Mutations in the HPV16 genome induced by APOBEC3 are associated with viral clearance [^76aa3043]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

HPV16 causes half of cervical cancers worldwide; for unknown reasons, most infections resolve within two years. Here, we analyze the viral genomes of 5,328 HPV16-positive case-control samples to investigate mutational signatures and the role of human APOBEC3-induced mutations in viral clearance and cervical carcinogenesis. We identify four de novo mutational signatures, one of which matches the COSMIC APOBEC-associated signature 2. The viral genomes of the precancer/cancer cases are less likely to contain within-host somatic HPV16 APOBEC3-induced mutations (Fisher's exact test, P = 6.2 x 10–14), and have a 30% lower nonsynonymous APOBEC3 mutation burden compared to controls. We replicate the low prevalence of HPV16 APOBEC3-induced mutations in 1,749 additional cases. APOBEC3 mutations also historically contribute to the evolution of HPV16 lineages. We demonstrate that cervical infections with a greater burden of somatic HPV16 APOBEC3-induced mutations are more likely to be benign or subsequently clear, suggesting they may reduce persistence, and thus progression, within the host.
