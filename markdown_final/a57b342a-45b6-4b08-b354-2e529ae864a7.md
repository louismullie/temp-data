## Question

Elevated tsh

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing an elevated TSH result. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormality and excluding transient causes. Then, I should classify the biochemical pattern into overt, subclinical, or discordant categories. Next, I will consider etiologies by pattern, including primary, central, and assay-related issues. After that, I need to tailor management to severity, patient context, and special populations. Finally, I will outline monitoring and follow-up, and close with a concise decision algorithm that integrates evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and exclude transient causes before labeling disease, because TSH has substantial biological and analytical variability and many mild elevations normalize on retesting. I should repeat TSH in 3 to 6 months, ideally under steady-state conditions, and add free T4 to distinguish subclinical from overt hypothyroidism; I also need to check for recent illness, acute psychiatric admission, medications like amiodarone, and biotin use, and consider assay interference if results are discordant with the clinical picture, since up to 40% of mild TSH abnormalities can revert without intervention [^114bqgrE] [^116e2Ezy] [^113XpJMe] [^112jhSYv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should classify the biochemical pattern carefully. Overt primary hypothyroidism is defined by elevated TSH with low free T4, subclinical hypothyroidism by elevated TSH with normal free T4, and discordant patterns such as elevated TSH with elevated free T4 or non-suppressed TSH with high thyroid hormones suggest central etiologies or assay interference; I need to ensure I interpret results in the correct clinical context and population, including age, pregnancy status, and medications [^111trvZ4] [^11777Vu1] [^113Fad1b].

> Next, I should review likely etiologies by pattern. For overt hypothyroidism, autoimmune thyroiditis is most common, so I will check thyroid peroxidase antibodies and consider imaging only if atypical features are present; for subclinical hypothyroidism, Hashimoto's is again frequent, with progression risk linked to antibody positivity and higher TSH, and I should remember that many cases normalize spontaneously, especially in older adults; for discordant results with high thyroid hormones and non-suppressed TSH, I must consider TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma and resistance to thyroid hormone, and systematically exclude assay interference before committing to rare diagnoses [^11777Vu1] [^11385f4o] [^115tWPPB].

> I will now examine management thresholds, but I need to ensure I align with high-quality evidence. For overt hypothyroidism, treatment with levothyroxine is indicated; for subclinical hypothyroidism, a strong recommendation against routine levothyroxine applies to most adults, with treatment considered when TSH is 10 mIU/L or higher, or in selected patients with symptoms, positive antibodies, or cardiovascular disease; in older adults, I should individualize and consider more relaxed TSH targets, and in pregnancy or preconception I should treat at lower thresholds, typically aiming TSH below 2.5 mIU/L in the first trimester; I should double-check that I am not extrapolating beyond guideline exceptions, such as very high TSH or severe symptoms, where treatment may still be warranted despite the general recommendation [^114LBMH9] [^111trvZ4] [^117X9d1Y] [^113wii52].

> Wait, let me verify special populations and contexts so I do not overgeneralize. In pregnancy and women planning pregnancy, I should treat subclinical hypothyroidism at lower TSH thresholds and monitor more frequently, given maternal-fetal risks; in children and adolescents, I should avoid overdiagnosis, repeat testing for mild elevations, and refer urgently if TSH is markedly elevated with low free T4; in older adults, I should avoid overtreatment and consider age-adjusted reference ranges; in patients on amiodarone, I should anticipate complex TFT patterns and manage clinically rather than by TSH alone; and in suspected central hypothyroidism, I must rely on free T4 rather than TSH to diagnose and titrate therapy [^113wii52] [^113uC6tY] [^114KEbR5] [^117X9d1Y] [^113XpJMe] [^116Rq9QT].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up to ensure safe, evidence-based care. After initiating or adjusting levothyroxine, I will recheck TSH in about 6 to 8 weeks and titrate to a TSH within the reference range, acknowledging that some older adults may be managed with more permissive targets; once stable, annual monitoring is reasonable, but I should increase frequency during pregnancy or with interacting drugs; I need to remember that TSH can lag after changes in thyroid status, so in early treatment or after therapy for hyperthyroidism, free T4 may better guide dosing until TSH stabilizes [^112VJzEn] [^113uC6tY] [^116o1x3e].

> But wait, what if the initial result reflects assay interference or a transient non-thyroidal illness pattern; I should double-check for heterophile antibodies, biotin use, and unusual binding proteins, and if discordance persists, send samples to a reference lab and consider alternative platforms or dilution studies; if high free T4 and or T3 coexist with non-suppressed TSH, I should proceed to pituitary MRI and, when appropriate, genetic testing for resistance to thyroid hormone after excluding artifacts, recognizing that dynamic testing has limitations and overlapping responses [^112jhSYv] [^115tWPPB] [^11385f4o].

> Let me reconsider the overall decision flow to ensure internal consistency. First, repeat TSH with free T4 to confirm persistence and classify the pattern; second, assess symptoms, antibodies, cardiovascular risk, age, and pregnancy status; third, treat overt hypothyroidism, avoid routine treatment for most with subclinical disease unless higher TSH or specific risk factors are present, and investigate discordant patterns for central causes or interference; finally, monitor TSH and or free T4 at appropriate intervals and adjust therapy to patient-centered targets, documenting shared decision-making when evidence is equivocal [^111trvZ4] [^114LBMH9] [^113Fad1b].

---

An elevated TSH most often reflects **primary hypothyroidism** (autoimmune thyroiditis) [^11777Vu1] or **subclinical hypothyroidism** (elevated TSH with normal free T4) [^111trvZ4]. Confirm with **repeat TSH and free T4** [^116XK1nC], check **anti-TPO antibodies** [^notfound], and assess for symptoms, goiter, or risk factors. Treat overt hypothyroidism with levothyroxine [^113mkwj1]; for subclinical disease, treat if TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L [^1119RUsp], symptomatic, or pregnant [^notfound], and monitor others. Persistent TSH elevation despite therapy suggests nonadherence, malabsorption, or drug interactions [^114JDqUJ]; consider alternate formulations or delivery methods [^notfound].

---

## Definition and clinical significance

Elevated TSH is defined as a TSH above the **upper limit of normal (typically 4.0–4.5 mIU/L)** [^113kszhz]. It indicates reduced thyroid hormone feedback and is most often due to primary hypothyroidism [^113mkwj1] or subclinical hypothyroidism [^111trvZ4].

---

## Common causes of elevated TSH

| **Category** | **Specific causes** |
|-|-|
| Primary hypothyroidism | - Autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's) [^113mkwj1] <br/> - Iatrogenic (post-thyroidectomy, radioactive iodine) [^112z44sk] <br/> - Congenital hypothyroidism [^117E5gPa] <br/> - Medications (amiodarone, lithium, interferon-alpha) [^113XpJMe] |
| Subclinical hypothyroidism | - Early autoimmune thyroiditis [^11777Vu1] <br/> - Mild iodine deficiency [^notfound] <br/> - Recovery from non-thyroidal illness [^113XpJMe] |
| Central or pituitary causes | - TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma (rare) [^115N9GwJ] <br/> - Thyroid hormone resistance (RTHβ) [^11385f4o] |
| Assay interference | - Heterophile antibodies [^115tWPPB] <br/> - Biotin supplementation [^114fiaqB] <br/> - Analytical errors [^112jhSYv] |

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Initial laboratory tests

- **Repeat TSH**: Confirm persistence; TSH varies day-to-day and can normalize [^114bqgrE].
- **Free T4**: Differentiate overt (low) from subclinical (normal) hypothyroidism [^1129gwkb].
- **Anti-TPO antibodies**: Assess autoimmune etiology and progression risk [^112wUhU4].

---

### Additional tests (as indicated)

- **Free T3**: Evaluate T3-toxicosis if TSH is suppressed with normal T4 [^112AZiH6].
- **Pituitary MRI**: If TSH is inappropriately normal/elevated with elevated free T4/T3 (suspect TSHoma or RTHβ) [^115N9GwJ].
- **Genetic testing**: For suspected thyroid hormone resistance [^11385f4o].

---

## Clinical implications and risks

Elevated TSH is associated with:

- **Symptoms**: Fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, cognitive slowing [^114GYrqH].
- **Cardiovascular risk**: Higher risk of CAD, HF, and dyslipidemia, especially if TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L [^11777Vu1].
- **Progression**: Risk of overt hypothyroidism, higher with positive anti-TPO and TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L [^11777Vu1].

---

## Management strategies

### Overt hypothyroidism (elevated TSH, low free T4)

Treat with **levothyroxine**, titrating to normalize TSH [^113mkwj1]. Monitor TSH every 6–8 weeks until stable, then annually [^112wUhU4].

---

### Subclinical hypothyroidism (elevated TSH, normal free T4)

- **Treat if**: TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L, symptomatic, pregnant, or high cardiovascular risk [^111trvZ4] [^113wii52] [^1168sTdk].
- **Observe if**: TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L, asymptomatic, low risk; repeat TSH in 3–6 months [^116vHLh6].
- **Pregnancy**: Treat to keep TSH trimester-specific (typically < 2.5–3.0 mIU/L) [^113wii52].

---

### Persistent TSH elevation despite therapy

Persistent elevation despite therapy suggests **nonadherence, malabsorption, or drug interactions** [^114JDqUJ]; consider alternate formulations (liquid, soft-gel) or different brands, and review timing with food, calcium, iron, PPIs, and sucralfate [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Elderly**: Higher TSH may be physiologic; individualize targets and avoid overtreatment [^113kszhz] [^117X9d1Y].
- **Children**: Use age-specific ranges; treat if TSH > 10 mIU/L or symptomatic [^1113zLtn].
- **Assay interference**: Suspect if results are discordant; repeat on a different platform or after stopping biotin [^115tWPPB].

---

Elevated TSH most often reflects **primary hypothyroidism or subclinical hypothyroidism**; confirm with repeat TSH and free T4, assess etiology and symptoms, and treat overt disease. For subclinical disease, treat if **TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L**, symptomatic, or pregnant; otherwise monitor. Persistent elevation despite therapy warrants reassessing **adherence, absorption, and interactions**.

### How do you approach the problem of TSH elevation in a patient on high-dose thyroid hormone replacement? [^114JDqUJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Persistent elevation of TSH levels in patients under treatment for hypothyroidism is a relatively common clinical problem in endocrinology practice. The most common cause for this phenomenon is poor patient compliance with their thyroid hormone tablets. In the compliant patient, however, multiple aetiologies are possible and a methodological and stepwise approach to the patient's problem will uniformly identify a cause, or at least a resolution.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116gv3zG]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

This work addressed diagnosis alone. Extrapolation of our findings appears logical, and there is no apparent a priori reason as to why TSH levels should be preferred over thyroid hormone levels in the context of monitoring thyroid treatments. Randomized trials might, nevertheless, reveal that additional considerations apply in these circumstances. Though there was no suggestion in the studies that we examined of a difference with individuals on thyroid hormone replacement, their numbers were small.

In summary, there is now matching theoretical and empiric evidence from a variety of sources suggesting that the thyroid status of an individual is better defined by thyroid hormone levels than TSH levels. There is evidence of a continuum of thyroid hormone effects along the continuum of thyroid hormone levels, with a possible optimum around the middle of the reference range. Though TSH levels remain good screening tests for overt thyroid dysfunction, it is theoretically and empirically more sound to rely on thyroid hormone and especially fT4 levels to classify the thyroid state.

This work should result in a simplification of the understanding of thyroid physiology and pathophysiology, and bring it more into line with the understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of other parameters, whereby the status of a parameter is judged by its level rather than the level of any controlling factor. Reconsideration of the TSH-based diagnostic approach to thyroid function appears to be indicated. In turn, this would appear to have implications for clinical guidelines, research methodology, and the rationale of underlying physiological principles.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111w8THM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease, a term applied to patients with no or minimal thyroid-related symptoms with abnormal laboratory values, is diagnosed more frequently with the use of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening and newer high-sensitivity assays. These are laboratory diagnoses, with subclinical hypothyroidism defined as an elevated TSH with a normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentration, and subclinical hyperthyroidism as a subnormal TSH with normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. Although studies defining which patients require treatment are few, decisions should be individualized based upon laboratory values and symptoms. This article reviews the etiologies, diagnoses, treatments and indications, and monitoring of patients with subclinical thyroid disease.

### The TSH upper reference limit: where are we at? [^113kszhz]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2011). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism — serum TSH levels above and T(4) levels within the laboratory reference ranges — depends critically on the upper limit of the TSH reference interval. Calls have been made to lower the current upper TSH reference limit of 4.0 mU/l to 2.5 mU/l to exclude patients with occult hypothyroidism. However, data from population studies do not indicate that the distribution of TSH is altered owing to inclusion of such individuals. The opposite suggestion has also been put forward; the TSH upper reference limit is often too low, especially in the elderly, in women and in white individuals, which may lead to unnecessary or even harmful therapy. Studies in elderly individuals have shown that although aging may be associated with increased TSH levels, paradoxically, overt hypothyroidism in this population may be associated with a less robust TSH response than in young individuals. This Review highlights the interindividual and intraindividual variability of TSH levels and discusses the current controversy that surrounds the appropriateness of reference ranges defined on the basis of age, race, sex and amount of iodine intake. Moreover, the current evidence on lowering or increasing the upper limit of the TSH reference interval is reviewed and the need to individualize levothyroxine treatment in patients with elevated TSH levels is discussed.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^111trvZ4]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112pWQ61]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — variability and potential overdiagnosis: Management of patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L is described as more controversial, with a likely large magnitude of overdiagnosis and overtreatment from screening; the high variability of TSH secretion and frequent reversion to normal underscore the importance of not relying on a single abnormal laboratory value, and it is not possible to differentiate those who will progress from those who will remain stable or normalize, so treating the latter yields no benefit and can cause harms from antithyroid medications, ablation therapy, and long-term thyroid hormone therapy.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism [^11777Vu1]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on subclinical hypothyroidism:

- **Definition**: Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined by elevated serum TSH levels with normal circulating thyroid hormone concentrations, indicating mild thyroid dysfunction. It is a biochemical diagnosis made through thyroid function testing and is most prevalent in women and older adults. The condition is graded as mild (TSH < 10 mU/L) or moderate (TSH ≥ 10 mU/L).
- **Pathophysiology**: Autoimmunity is the most common cause of subclinical hypothyroidism.
- **Epidemiology**: Subclinical hypothyroidism affects up to 10% of adults in iodine-sufficient populations, with prevalence increasing with age and occurring more frequently in women. The condition is often transient, with many individuals reverting to normal thyroid function over time. Age-related increases in TSH levels without true thyroid disease may contribute to overestimation of its prevalence.
- **Disease course**: Subclinical hypothyroidism, particularly grade 1, is usually asymptomatic and rarely associated with classic hypothyroid or neuropsychiatric symptoms. When symptoms occur, they are generally mild and more likely in grade 2 disease, presenting as subtle memory or mood disturbances. In older adults, hypothyroid symptoms are often absent even in overt disease, and QoL is typically similar to that of euthyroid individuals. About 2.5% of patients progress to clinically overt hypothyroidism each year, with a higher rate of progression in patients with thyroid autoantibodies and higher thyroid stimulating hormone levels. Thyroid function normalizes spontaneously in up to 40% cases.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Subclinical hypothyroidism in younger patients (< 65 years of age) is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease, HF and cerebrovascular accident.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomised controlled trials, which could alter practice.

Current Practice

Current guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

Recommendation

The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH > 20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤ 30 years old).

How This Guideline Was Created

A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

The Evidence

The systematic review included 21 trials with 2192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

Understanding The Recommendation

The panel concluded that almost all adults with SCH would not benefit from treatment with thyroid hormones. Other factors in the strong recommendation include the burden of lifelong management and uncertainty on potential harms. Instead, clinicians should monitor the progression or resolution of the thyroid dysfunction in these adults. Recommendations are made actionable for clinicians and their patients through visual overviews. These provide the relative and absolute benefits and harms of thyroid hormones in multilayered evidence summaries and decision aids available in MAGIC (https://app.magicapp.org/) to support shared decisions and adaptation of this guideline.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^114Zketr]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism with TSH persistently below the lower limit of normal but ≥ 0.1 mU/L — observation is acceptable for asymptomatic patients under age 65 without cardiac disease or osteoporosis, who can be observed without further investigation of the etiology of the subnormal TSH or treatment (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). In this range, treatment should be considered for older subjects, but it is not recommended for subjects < 65 years of age; younger subjects should be monitored at regular 6- to 12-month intervals, and treatment should be considered if the TSH persistently decreases to < 0.1 mU/L. In patients with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, a trial of β-adrenergic blocking agents may be useful to determine whether symptomatic therapy might suffice.

### Hyperthyroidism: diagnosis and treatment [^116xqtXM]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hyperthyroidism, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain serum TSH level measurement in the initial evaluation of suspected thyrotoxicosis.

---

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^1119RUsp]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Potential harms and treatment thresholds in thyroid dysfunction emphasize that the harms of treatment have not been well-studied, with the most important potential harms being false-positive results, labeling, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment; false positives occur because TSH secretion is highly variable and sensitive to several common factors and determining true- versus false-positive results is complicated by a lack of consensus on a normal reference interval; no clinical trial data support a treatment threshold to improve outcomes, and on the basis of expert opinion, a TSH level greater than 10.0 mIU/L is generally considered the threshold for initiation of treatment.

---

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^112nDjxo]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 97 — diagnosis of TSH-secreting pituitary tumor should be based on an inappropriately normal or elevated serum TSH level associated with elevated free T4 estimates and T3 concentrations, usually associated with a pituitary tumor on MRI and the absence of a family history or genetic testing consistent with thyroid hormone resistance in a thyrotoxic patient (1/+00).

---

### Reference intervals in the diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction: treating patients not numbers [^1117izyA]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Although assigning a diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction appears quite simple, this is often not the case. Issues that make it unclear whether thyroid function is normal include transient changes in thyroid parameters, inter-individual and intra-individual differences in thyroid parameters, age-related differences, and ethnic variations. In addition, a statistically calculated distribution of thyroid analytes does not necessarily coincide with intervals or cutoffs that have predictive value for beneficial or adverse health outcomes. Based on current clincial trial data, it is unclear which individuals with mild thyroid-stimulating hormone elevations will benefit from levothyroxine treatment. For example, only a small number of patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone values of more than 10 mIU/L have been studied in a randomised manner. Even if therapy is initiated for abnormal thyroid function, not all treated individuals are maintained at the desired treatment target, and therefore might still be at risk. The consequence of this is that each patient's thyroid function needs to be assessed on an individual basis with the entire clinical picture in mind. Monitoring also needs to be vigilant, and the targets for treatment reassessed continually.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^1146eDFj]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

ATA/AACE guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults — this table indexes diagnostic questions and highlights two explicit directives. Questions include "When should antithyroid antibodies be measured?", "What is the role of clinical scoring systems in the diagnosis of patients with hypothyroidism?", "What is the role of diagnostic tests apart from serum thyroid hormone levels and TSH in the evaluation of patients with hypothyroidism?", and "What are the preferred thyroid hormone measurements in addition to TSH in the assessment of patients with hypothyroidism?". Explicit recommendations state "Do not use clinical scoring systems to diagnose hypothyroidism" and "Do not use indirect tests to diagnose hypothyroidism".

### The evidence for a narrower thyrotropin reference range is compelling [^112t6NpZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Debate and controversy currently surround the recommendations of a recent consensus conference that considered issues related to the management of early, mild, or so-called subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Intimately related to the controversy is the definition of the normal reference range for TSH. It has become clear that previously accepted reference ranges are no longer valid as a result of both the development of more highly sensitive TSH assays and the appreciation that reference populations previously considered normal were contaminated with individuals with various degrees of thyroid dysfunction that served to increase mean TSH levels for the group. Recent laboratory guidelines from the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry indicate that more than 95% of normal individuals have TSH levels below 2.5 mU/liter. The remainder with higher values are outliers, most of whom are likely to have underlying Hashimoto thyroiditis or other causes of elevated TSH. Importantly, data indicating that African-Americans with very low incidence of Hashimoto thyroiditis have a mean TSH level of 1.18 mU/liter strongly suggest that this value is the true normal mean for a normal population. Recognition and establishment of a more precise and true normal range for TSH have important implications for both screening and treatment of thyroid disease in general and subclinical thyroid disease in particular.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^11385f4o]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Genuinely Raised (Free) T4 and (Free) T3 With Nonsuppressed TSH

After excluding confounding causes (eg, measurement interference, effects of concomitant comorbidities or drug therapies) outlined above, genuinely raised, circulating FT4 and T3 with nonsuppressed TSH concentrations are compatible with either a genetic (RTHβ) or acquired (TSH-secreting pituitary tumor or thyrotropinoma, TSHoma) condition. Over 900 families with RTHβ, a dominantly inherited disorder caused by different (∼230 known), heterozygous mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor β gene (THRB), have been recorded worldwide. Greater detection of TSHomas likely mediates their higher prevalence (2.8 per million) than previously recorded. The age and gender of patients, and magnitude or pattern of elevation in free THs or TSH concentrations does not distinguish between these disorders. Although, in principle, a combination of genetic testing (for RTHβ) and pituitary imaging (for TSHoma) should readily differentiate these entities, a number of issues can cause diagnostic difficulties, as highlighted below.

Possibly due to sooner ascertainment, a greater proportion (25–30%) of TSHomas now present as microadenomas, with some pituitary lesions not discernible using standard magnetic resonance imaging and being associated with a paucity or even absence of hyperthyroid signs and symptoms. Conversely, clinical features of hyperthyroidism can also be present in RTHβ and incidental abnormalities on pituitary imaging are found in a significant proportion (20%) of genetically-proven RTHβ cases.

Although dynamic endocrine tests (rise in TSH in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone; inhibition of TSH following T3 administration) can differentiate between RTHβ and TSHoma, these investigations have limitations. For instance, thyrotropin-releasing hormone is not available in many countries. Moreover, although one case series confirmed that the TSH response is normal or exaggerated in RTHβ but blunted in TSHoma, with the authors specifying a greater than 5-fold TSH increase being a cut-off that differentiates these entities, there may be a "gray zone" (3- to 5-fold TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone) compatible with either diagnosis (Gurnell, unpublished observations). T3 administration is not advisable in elderly individuals or those with underlying cardiac disease or psychiatric disturbance; furthermore, although circulating TSH is higher in TSHoma than RTHβ cases following the T3 suppression test, there is an overlap in TSH values with no discrete cut-off that distinguishes between these entities.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^116e2Ezy]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — overdiagnosis and natural history observations note that many persons labeled with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism spontaneously revert to a euthyroid state over time and that this especially includes those with "subclinical" disease who have "mildly elevated" TSH levels of 4.5 to 10.0 mIU/L.

Hospitalized but not critically ill hypothyroid patients with elevated thyrotropin — re-evaluation of therapy: In hospitalized patients with a pre-established diagnosis of hypothyroidism who are found to have an elevated thyrotropin measurement, consideration should be given to institution or adjustment of levothyroxine replacement, with relevant considerations including the degree of clinical and biochemical hypothyroidism, active comorbidities, and details of levothyroxine administration. Strong recommendation. Low-quality evidence.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^117PVhnp]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Thyroid dysfunction definitions — Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an asymptomatic condition in which a patient has a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level exceeding the upper threshold of a specified laboratory reference interval (commonly defined as 4.5 mIU/L) but a normal thyroxine (T4) level, and patients with subclinical hypothyroidism are often further classified as having TSH levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L or greater than 10.0 mIU/L; "overt" hypothyroidism has been defined biochemically by an elevated TSH level and a low T4 level.

Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation — management of TSH elevations recommendation: In women who achieve pregnancy following controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, TSH elevations should be treated according to the recommendations outlined in Section VII, whereas in nonpregnant women with mild TSH elevations following controlled ovarian stimulation, serum TSH measurements should be repeated in 2–4 weeks because levels may normalize; this is a weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.

### Subclinical thyroid disorders: significance and clinical impact [^115tf2US]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases are defined by abnormal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels associated with normal thyroid hormone concentrations. The diagnosis of these conditions depends on defining the 'normal' euthyroid TSH range; in this review, arguments for and against lowering the upper limit of TSH are summarised. Although, subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism are frequently encountered, their long-term consequences are debated due to conflicting results from many observational studies. The causes, effects and outcomes of treatment of both subclinical diseases are described, and the direction of future research in these conditions is outlined.

Subclinical hypothyroidism, defined as an elevated serum thyrotropin (often referred to as thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH) level with normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) affects up to 10% of the adult population.

Observations

Subclinical hypothyroidism is most often caused by autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis. However, serum thyrotropin levels rise as people without thyroid disease age; serum thyrotropin concentrations may surpass the upper limit of the traditional reference range of 4 to 5 mU/L among elderly patients. This phenomenon has likely led to an overestimation of the true prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism in persons older than 70 years. In patients who have circulating thyroid peroxidase antibodies, there is a greater risk of progression from subclinical to overt hypothyroidism. Subclinical hypothyroidism may be associated with an increased risk of heart failure, coronary artery disease events, and mortality from coronary heart disease. In addition, middle-aged patients with subclinical hypothyroidism may have cognitive impairment, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, and altered mood. In the absence of large randomized trials showing benefit from levothyroxine therapy, the rationale for treatment is based on the potential for decreasing the risk of adverse cardiovascular events and the possibility of preventing progression to overt hypothyroidism. However, levothyroxine therapy may be associated with iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis, especially in elderly patients, and there is no evidence that it is beneficial in persons aged 65 years or older.

Conclusions and Relevance

Subclinical hypothyroidism is common and most individuals can be observed without treatment. Treatment might be indicated for patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and serum thyrotropin levels of 10 mU/L or higher or for young and middle-aged individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism and symptoms consistent with mild hypothyroidism.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^115nFvNi]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Thyroid dysfunction definitions — subclinical hyperthyroidism involves TSH below the thyroid reference interval (usually 0.4 mIU/L) with normal T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) levels, and it is further classified as low but detectable (about 0.1 to 0.4 mIU/L) or undetectable (< 0.1 mIU/L) TSH levels; despite its name, overt hyperthyroidism does not require symptoms and is defined biochemically by a low or undetectable TSH level and an elevated T4 or T3 level.

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations? [^116SUZCg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). However, it is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l), and we suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively. Together, these patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys. There are a number of causes for this picture, which include endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects and concomitant nonthyroidal illness. Treatments commonly employed in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH but have not been shown to improve clinical outcome or symptoms. There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance about whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111mVjnY]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thyroid function testing (1,23) are based on the measurement of thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Patients are therefore classified as having euthyroidism (normal TSH and thyroid hormone levels), overt thyroid dysfunction (abnormal TSH and thyroid hormone levels), subclinical thyroid dysfunction (abnormal TSH/normal thyroid hormone levels), and isolated hyper/hypothyroxinemia (normal TSH/abnormal thyroid hormone levels).

This classification of thyroid function is based on the concept of TSH levels being the most sensitive indicator of thyroid function such that subclinical thyroid dysfunction as currently defined is believed to be more significant than isolated hyper/hypothyroxinemia, as indicated by the alternative term for the latter, "euthyroid hyper/hypothyroidism".

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is common and comprises most cases of thyroid dysfunction with a population prevalence of ∼5%, increasing to 15% in older adults. Even though it is generally asymptomatic or associated only with non-specific symptoms, subclinical thyroid dysfunction has been associated with many adverse outcomes across a variety of organ systems. Therefore, despite the lack of convincing evidence of significant benefit, treatment for subclinical thyroid dysfunction has been recommended in certain circumstances.

It has previously been suggested by some authors that the earlier definition of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is overly simple and that its diagnosis should not be based solely on the TSH level being outside of a general population range. Rather, it is claimed that more accuracy may be achieved by defining a normal reference range for the combination of thyroid hormones and TSH.

However, any model whereby judgment of the thyroid status includes consideration of the TSH level is anomalous, in that the levels of other physiological parameters are not judged by the levels of their controlling hormones. For example, whether or not an individual has hypoglycemia or hypercalcemia is not determined by reference to insulin or parathyroid hormone levels, respectively. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels, though helpful in diagnosing adrenal autonomy, are not considered diagnostic for Cushing's syndrome. In general, the level of a controlling hormone is used to determine the cause of a disturbance rather than identifying whether or not there is a disturbance.

Hypothyroidism epidemiology and definitions — hypothyroidism may be either subclinical or overt, defined by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (T4) levels; subclinical hypothyroidism is characterized by a serum TSH above the upper reference limit with a normal free T4 and is only applicable when thyroid function has been stable for weeks or more, the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis is normal, and there is no recent or ongoing severe illness, whereas an elevated TSH, usually above 10 mIU/L, with a subnormal free T4 characterizes overt hypothyroidism.

TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma — diagnosis (Recommendation 121) states that diagnosis should be based on an inappropriately normal or elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with elevated free thyroxine (T4) and total triiodothyronine (T3), generally with a pituitary tumor on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) and the absence of a family history or genetic testing consistent with resistance to thyroid hormone, with a strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Technical remarks note that elevated a-subunit levels are not useful in postmenopausal women and that the molar a-subunit/TSH ratio can be calculated by dividing a-subunit (ng/mL) by TSH (mU/L) and multiplying by 10, where a ratio greater than 1 favors a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma. The guideline also cites rarity with an incidence of 0.15 per 1 million inhabitants and a prevalence of 2.8 cases per million.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113XTMCx]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

The evidence also suggests that, regardless of the method used, the classification of thyroid function into normal, subclinical disease and overt disease is arbitrary. Thyroid hormones, as previously suggested, similar to many other biological parameters, exert a continuum of effects across the normal range. There is no clear border between normal and abnormal. There are advantages and disadvantages associated with all levels. Individuals with relatively low levels of fT4, for example, are less likely to develop AF but more likely to develop metabolic syndrome; the converse applies for individuals with higher fT4 levels. At the extremes, the disadvantages clearly outweigh the advantages, and individuals are likely to become symptomatic.

On the other hand, any excursion from the middle of the range has an association with some pathology or other. Some individual pathologies, for example, frailty, mortality, and dementia may increase with deviations either side of the middle of the range. It seems likely that evolutionary mechanisms have arisen to minimize variation from the middle of the reference range of thyroid hormones.

The fact that TSH levels reliably identify overt thyroid dysfunction can also be explained by the negative population relationship between TSH and fT4, that is, its extension into the abnormal ranges of fT4. This extension is due merely to the fact that the vast majority of all overt thyroid dysfunction is primary rather than secondary. This situation differs from other endocrine pathology, for example Cushing's syndrome, where ACTH levels cannot be used as a screening test on account of the likelihood that Cushing's syndrome may be secondary, that is, be due to a disorder of ACTH regulation. The fact that TSH levels are thereby very sensitive screening tests for overt thyroid dysfunction does not imply that TSH levels are very specific, that is, that an abnormal TSH level implies thyroid dysfunction. Our work indicates that an abnormal TSH level per se is an imprecise indicator of tissue or organ hyper/hypothyroidism as compared with thyroid hormone levels.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^115tWPPB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Measurement of free thyroid hormones (THs) and thyrotropin (TSH) using automated immunoassays is central to the diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction. Using illustrative cases, we describe a diagnostic approach to discordant thyroid function tests, focusing on entities causing elevated free thyroxine and/or free triiodothyronine measurements with nonsuppressed TSH levels. Different types of analytical interference (eg, abnormal thyroid hormone binding proteins, antibodies to iodothyronines or TSH, heterophile antibodies, biotin) or disorders (eg, resistance to thyroid hormone β or α, monocarboxylate transporter 8 or selenoprotein deficiency, TSH-secreting pituitary tumor) that can cause this biochemical pattern will be considered. We show that a structured approach, combining clinical assessment with additional laboratory investigations to exclude assay artifact, followed by genetic testing or specialized imaging, can establish a correct diagnosis, potentially preventing unnecessary investigation or inappropriate therapy.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American college of endocrinology position statement on thyroid dysfunction case finding [^113SKFsA]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can be readily diagnosed and can be treated in a safe, cost-effective manner. Professional organizations have given guidance on how and when to employ thyroid-stimulating hormone testing for the detection of thyroid dysfunction. Most recently, the United States Preventive Services Task Force did not endorse screening for thyroid dysfunction based on a lack of proven benefit and potential harm of treating those with thyroid dysfunction, which is mostly subclinical disease. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) is concerned that this may discourage physicians from testing for thyroid dysfunction when clinically appropriate. Given the lack of specificity of thyroid-associated symptoms, the appropriate diagnosis of thyroid disease requires biochemical confirmation. The Thyroid Scientific Committee of the AACE has produced this White Paper to highlight the important difference between screening and case-based testing in the practice of clinical medicine. We recommend that thyroid dysfunction should be frequently considered as a potential etiology for many of the nonspecific complaints that physicians face daily. The application and success of safe and effective interventions are dependent on an accurate diagnosis. We, therefore, advocate for an aggressive case-finding approach, based on identifying those persons most likely to have thyroid disease that will benefit from its treatment.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening performance and variability — test characteristics and limitations are outlined: specificity is "about 92%", most laboratories "define an abnormal TSH test result by using the upper and lower limits of the 95% reference interval for a particular assay (generally about 0.4 to 4.5 mIU/L)", and among older adults "12% of persons aged 80 years or older with no evidence of thyroid disease have been found to have TSH levels greater than 4.5 mIU/L". Day-to-day mean values can vary "by as much as 50%", with "up to 40% variation" in same-time serial measurements; consequently, "All of this confirms the importance of not relying on a single TSH value to establish a diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction" and "Serial TSH measurements are an essential step in establishing that a thyroid disorder is real and persistent", while "TSH secretion is highly sensitive to factors other than thyroid disorders".

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^117KaLMs]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases — subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism — are common clinical entities that encompass mild degrees of thyroid dysfunction. The clinical significance of mild thyroid overactivity and underactivity is uncertain, which has led to controversy over the appropriateness of diagnostic testing and possible treatment. In this Seminar, we discuss the definition, epidemiology, differential diagnoses, risks of progression to overt thyroid disease, potential effects on various health outcomes, and management of subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism. Treatment recommendations are based on the degree to which thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations have deviated from normal and underlying comorbidities. Large-scale randomised trials are urgently needed to inform how to best care for individuals with subclinical thyroid disease.

### How selective are the new guidelines for treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism for patients with thyrotropin levels at or below 10 mIU / L? [^114WgkfX]. Thyroid (2013). Low credibility.

Background

By consensus, a thyrotropin (TSH) level persistently > 10mIU/L is an indication for the treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH). Controversy exists regarding patients whose TSH level is elevated but < 10mIU/L. Recently, the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) published their position about factors that should be considered in the decision on treating SCH. This study evaluated the frequency of these factors among adult (non-pregnant) women with SCH whose TSH levels are ≤ 10mIU/L.

Methods

The presence of the conditions that should be considered for the treatment of SCH according to ATA and AACE was evaluated in 252 women who were diagnosed with SCH and had TSH levels ≤ 10mIU/L. Pregnant women were excluded.

Results

Antithyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOAbs) were detected in 137 (54.3%) women. A high cardiovascular risk was observed in 43 (17%) women. Eighty (31.7%) women who were not at high cardiovascular risk presented at least one classical risk factor (arterial hypertension, elevated level of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol or low level of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, smoking, or first-degree family history of premature coronary artery disease). At least one symptom or sign of hypothyroidism that could not be explained by another condition was observed in 180 (71.4%) women. Two hundred thirty-two (92%) women had positive TPOAbs, or at least one classical cardiovascular risk factor, or at least one symptom or sign of hypothyroidism.

Conclusions

According to the new ATA and AACE guidelines, L-T4 therapy would be considered for 92% of women with SCH and TSH ≤ 10mIU/L.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^113XpJMe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Approach to Diagnosis

Considering the clinical context is helpful when evaluating a patient with discordant thyroid function. For instance, objective abnormalities (eg, goiter, clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, increased uptake on thyroid isotope scan) can suggest that the observed biochemical hyperthyroidism is genuine. Sedation with chloral hydrate (often undertaken in children) prior to blood sampling is a recognized cause of transient, reversible hyperthyroxinemia. Potential confounding factors, including altered physiological states (eg, pregnancy), intercurrent illness or concurrent medication should be considered (also reviewed in detail in).

Amiodarone Therapy

Changes in TFTs are almost universal in amiodarone-treated patients, with 2% to 24% developing overt thyroid dysfunction. The drug inhibits TH biosynthesis and pituitary type 2 deiodinase activity, prompting an initial rise in circulating TSH (1 week after commencement), which typically normalizes by 12 weeks. Subsequently, the drug blocks hepatic, type 1 deiodinase activity, inhibiting the conversion of T4 to T3 and breakdown of reverse T3, resulting in a TFT profile of raised/high normal T4, low/low-normal T3, and markedly elevated reverse T3. This pattern may be evident as early as 2 weeks after commencement of treatment and can persist after drug withdrawal, with the changes in TFTs being dose dependent. Due to inhibition of T4 to T3 conversion, patients with amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism may require T4 replacement in supraphysiologic dosage to normalize TSH and therefore exhibit concurrently raised FT4 and TSH levels.

Nonthyroidal Illness

Prolonged or severe critical illness is often associated with abnormal TFTs; typically, circulating FT3 and FT4 fall (usually to low-normal levels), reverse T3 rises, and TSH values are low or low-normal. The degree of excursion in hormones is related to illness severity. Recovery is heralded by a rise in TSH with subsequent normalization of T4 and T3. Notably, changes in TFTs are not restricted to critical illness, with a low FT3, raised TSH and FT4 pattern being recorded in patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery and in the weeks following myocardial infarction.

Acute Psychiatric States

True hypothyroidism or thyrotoxicosis can be associated with psychiatric abnormalities. Conversely, transient hormonal changes (typically elevated circulating FT4 with nonsuppressed TSH) are seen in patients (∼15%) admitted with acute psychiatric states, with this pattern being short lived, reversible, and not associated with a particular psychiatric condition.

Methods to Detect Analytical Interference in Assays or Diagnose Entities

The ability to detect assay interference, and to estimate the true concentration of circulating THs or TSH, will depend on additional methods available in the clinical laboratory. Some additional tests can be undertaken in a general laboratory, whereas other measurements are best performed in a specialist reference laboratory. As even the simple methods described here cannot be used on every sample, interpreting results in conjunction with clinical context (eg, discordance between TFTs and clinical status of patient) or knowledge of laboratory systems (eg, an unexpected change in TFT pattern compared with previous measurements) can be very helpful. Grossly discordant, widely variable, or extremely deranged results usually raise suspicion of interference; unhelpfully, it is more subtle interference, causing plausible biochemical patterns, which can lead to diagnostic confusion and possibly unnecessary further investigation or intervention. Furthermore, in some situations, the presence of assay interference precludes accurate estimation of true TSH or TH values, requiring management of patients using clinical thyroid status rather than laboratory measurements.

### Hypothyroidism [^113mkwj1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common condition in which the thyroid gland provides insufficient amounts of thyroid hormone for the needs of peripheral tissues. The most common cause in adults is chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto thyroiditis), but there are many other causes. Because most of the clinical features of hypothyroidism are nonspecific, the diagnosis requires laboratory testing. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement is the best diagnostic test; an elevated TSH level almost always signals primary hypothyroidism. Serum free thyroxine levels may be below the reference range (overt hypothyroidism) or within the reference range (subclinical hypothyroidism). All patients with overt hypothyroidism should be treated, but those with subclinical hypothyroidism do not always benefit from treatment, especially elderly patients and those with baseline TSH levels below 10 mU/L. Oral L-thyroxine is the treatment of choice because of its well-demonstrated efficacy, safety, and ease of use. Therapy goals are symptom relief and maintenance of serum TSH levels within the reference range. Myxedema coma is a life-threatening form of decompensated hypothyroidism that must be treated with aggressive L-thyroxine replacement and other supportive measures in the inpatient setting.

### Subclinical but significant? updated review of pediatric hypothyroidism [^112Wvvia]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aims of this review are to describe the rates of diagnosis of true thyroid disease (and subsequent treatment) in children with an elevated TSH referred to pediatric endocrinology, risk factors associated with elevated TSH secondary to thyroid disease, and TSH threshold level associated with thyroid disease.

Methods

To accomplish these aims, our team searched through four databases to curate 211 articles regarding TSH values in healthy children ages 1–18 years without an underlying risk for hypothyroidism.

Results

Five studies met our criteria and were analyzed to create the conclusions about rates of hypothyroidism requiring treatment (6.3–59%), risk factors to developing hypothyroidism (TSH > 10 mIU/L, goiter, and anti-thyroid antibodies), and high-risk TSH value (9.6 mIU/L when averaged among four studies).

Conclusions

The results are helpful in guiding practitioners about when to repeat TSH value before considering referral to endocrinology, when to refer, and when to anticipate the need of thyroid hormone replacement.

Background

Hypothyroidism has multiple etiologies and manifestations. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions. This paper describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the clinical management of hypothyroidism in ambulatory patients.

Methods

The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) in association with American Thyroid Association (ATA). AACE and the ATA assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this article. The authors examined relevant literature and took an evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated their knowledge and experience to develop a series of specific recommendations and the rationale for these recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach outlined in the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Protocol for Standardized Production of Clinical Guidelines-2010 update.

Results

Topics addressed include the etiology, epidemiology, clinical and laboratory evaluation, management, and consequences of hypothyroidism. Screening, treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and areas for future research are also covered.

Conclusions

Fifty-two evidence-based recommendations and subrecommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with hypothyroidism and to share what the authors believe is current, rational, and optimal medical practice for the diagnosis and care of hypothyroidism. A serum thyrotropin is the single best screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction for the vast majority of outpatient clinical situations. The standard treatment is replacement with L-thyroxine. The decision to treat subclinical hypothyroidism when the serum thyrotropin is less than 10 mIU/L should be tailored to the individual patient.

### The thyroid – too much and too little across the ages. the consequences of subclinical thyroid dysfunction [^112BNBRM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Mild thyroid dysfunction is common, and more prevalent than overt hyper- and hypothyroidism. Subclinical (mild) thyroid dysfunction is a biochemical entity characterized by an abnormality of serum TSH associated with normal serum thyroid hormone concentrations. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is thus defined as low or suppressed serum TSH with normal serum-free T4 and T3, while subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as raised serum TSH with normal circulating T4. These biochemical abnormalities are part of the much wider spectrum of thyroid dysfunction which includes overt hyperthyroidism and overt hypothyroidism, but by no means always indicate underlying thyroid disease. There is much debate about the significance of mild abnormalities of thyroid function in terms of symptoms and potential associations with long-term morbidity and mortality and hence much debate about whether to screen for these abnormalities, and, once identified, whether to treat or monitor, and if so, how? Our knowledge base has increased significantly in recent years, principally because studies of large cohorts have begun to define the epidemiology and associations of mild thyroid dysfunction (including short-term and long-term outcomes) and a small but increasing number of randomized-controlled intervention studies have been reported. There is, however, much to learn about these disorders and, given their prevalence, their impact on health.

Thyroid hormone (TH) measurements complement TSH — Serum TSH concentration is the single best biomarker to confirm a diagnosis and also the magnitude of primary thyroid disease, but T4 (and for specific constellations also T3) measurements are often added when TSH values fall outside the reference interval to classify disease into overt or subclinical and can direct therapeutic options. TH measurement is also required to complement TSH measurement in clinical situations such as pregnancy, intercurrent illness when TSH can be suppressed, and the initial treatment of hypo- or hyperthyroidism as the response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed after a change in thyroid status.

Ninety-four percent of patients with primary hypothyroidism given ® TRH in clinical trials responded with a rise in TSH of 2.0 μU/mL or greater. Since this response is also found in normal subjects, TRH testing does not differentiate primary hypothyroidism from normal.

Secondary (pituitary) and tertiary (hypothalamic) hypothyroidism: In the presence of clinical and other laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism, the finding of a baseline TSH level less than 10 mU/mL should suggest secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism. In this situation, a response to TRH of less than 2 μU/mL suggests secondary hypothyroidism since this response was observed in about 60% of patients with, secondary hypothyroidism and only approximately 5% of patients with tertiary hypothyroidism. A TSH response to TRH greater than 2 μU/mL is not helpful in differentiating between secondary and tertiary hypothyroidism since this response was noted in about 40% of the former and about 95% of the latter.

Establishing the diagnosis of secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism requires a careful history and physical examination along with appropriate tests of anterior pituitary and/or target gland function. The TRH test should not be used as the only laboratory determinant for establishing these diagnoses.

Assisted reproductive technology (ART) in subclinical hypothyroidism — treatment target and threshold: Subclinically hypothyroid women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) should be treated with LT4, and the goal of treatment is to achieve a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration < 2.5 mU/L; it therefore seems prudent to recommend treatment of subclinically hypothyroid women seeking pregnancy with ART for any TSH elevation > 2.5 mU/L. Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — tests and interval: The serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test is the primary screening test for thyroid dysfunction, and multiple tests should be done over a 3- to 6-month interval to confirm or rule out abnormal findings; follow-up testing of serum thyroxine (T4) levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 levels) and "overt" (abnormal T4 levels) thyroid dysfunction. The optimal screening interval for thyroid dysfunction (if one exists) is unknown.

### Elevated TSH levels: a database study of general practitioners' course of action [^117QX9Z3]. Endocrine Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate general practitioners' course of action after detection of elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels regarding repeat testing, direct levothyroxine replacement, or neither.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of adults without prior evidence of thyroid disease and with a first detection of elevated TSH levels from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2020, using data from electronic medical records of a Swiss primary care database. We determined the occurrence of either repeat TSH testing or direct levothyroxine initiation in primary care during 12-month follow-up and determined associations with demographic and clinical factors.

Results

Of the 1 591 patients included (median age 65 years, 64.4% female, median TSH 5.7 mIU/L), 34.3% received repeat TSH testing and 12.4% received direct levothyroxine replacement in primary care during follow-up. Repeat TSH testing showed the strongest association with overt hypothyroidism and was more common among patients with high primary care utilization and among patients aged 40–64 years compared to patients aged < 40 years. Direct levothyroxine initiation was more likely for TSH levels > 7 mIU/L, overt hypothyroidism, female patients, and nonurban practices.

Conclusions

While the degree of thyroid dysfunction was the main driver of follow-up, we identified important gaps in the primary care-based monitoring of elevated TSH levels in young patients and in patients with infrequent consultations. We also observed potential overtreatment of women and patients in nonurban areas. Our findings highlight the need for standardization and dissemination of guidelines for the management of elevated TSH levels among general practitioners.

### Hypothyroidism [^114GYrqH]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common condition of thyroid hormone deficiency, which is readily diagnosed and managed but potentially fatal in severe cases if untreated. The definition of hypothyroidism is based on statistical reference ranges of the relevant biochemical parameters and is increasingly a matter of debate. Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism range from life threatening to no signs or symptoms. The most common symptoms in adults are fatigue, lethargy, cold intolerance, weight gain, constipation, change in voice, and dry skin, but clinical presentation can differ with age and sex, among other factors. The standard treatment is thyroid hormone replacement therapy with levothyroxine. However, a substantial proportion of patients who reach biochemical treatment targets have persistent complaints. In this Seminar, we discuss the epidemiology, causes, and symptoms of hypothyroidism; summarise evidence on diagnosis, long-term risk, treatment, and management; and highlight future directions for research.

### Rationalizing thyroid function testing: which TSH cutoffs are optimal for testing free T4? [^113KVT47]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Thyroid function testing often uses thyrotropin (TSH) measurement first, followed by reflex testing for free thyroxine (T4) if TSH is outside the reference range. The utility of different TSH cutoffs for reflex testing is unknown.

Objective

To examine different TSH cutoffs for reflex free T4 testing.

Design, Setting, and Patients

We analyzed concurrent TSH and free T4 results from 120,403 individuals from a single laboratory in Western Australia (clinical cohort) and 4568 Busselton Health Study participants (community cohort).

Results

In the clinical cohort, restricting free T4 measurement to individuals with TSH < 0.3 or > 5.0 mU/L resulted in a 22% reduction in free T4 testing compared with a TSH reference range of 0.4 to 4.0 mU/L; using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L resulted in a 34% reduction in free T4 testing. In the community cohort, the corresponding effect was less: 3.3% and 4.8% reduction in free T4 testing. In the clinical cohort, using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L, elevated free T4 would go undetected in 4.2% of individuals with TSH levels of 0.2 to 0.4 mU/L. In most, free T4 was marginally elevated and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hyperthyroidism. Low free T4 would go undetected in 2.5% of individuals with TSH levels of 4 to 6 mU/L; in 94%, free T4 was marginally reduced and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hypothyroidism.

Conclusions

Setting TSH cutoffs at 0.1 to 0.2 mU/L less than and 1 to 2 mU/L greater than the reference range for reflex testing of free T4 would reduce the need for free T4 testing, with minimal effect on case finding.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111C2vCG]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

We, therefore, aimed at determining whether or not a systematic review of the literature might indicate the relative merits of thyroid hormone levels and TSH levels, in terms of associations with a broad range of clinical parameters. Because of the strong negative population correlation between free thyroxine (fT4) and TSH, we expected to find associations between both TSH and fT4 levels and the clinical features of thyroid dysfunction. We further reasoned that if the clinical features were associated better with TSH levels, the current rationale for thyroid function testing and the current consequent clinical and research classifications and practices would be supported, but, if the clinical features were associated better with thyroid hormone levels, these classifications and practices would warrant review. In this latter circumstance, the previously noted associations of clinical features with TSH levels could be attributed to the aforementioned strong negative population correlation between fT4 and TSH.

Third generation thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) assays have emerged as the single most useful test of thyroid function, and are used widely and appropriately as a screening test. TSH measurement alone may be misleading in complicated patients and those undergoing treatment for thyroid dysfunction. Before obtaining thyroid function tests, clinicians need to consider whether the patient might have pituitary or hypothalamic disease or severe nonthyroidal illness, and whether assessment of the pituitary-thyroid axis reflects steady-state conditions. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with adverse effects on the skeleton and the heart, and is best assessed by measurement of serum TsH with a third-generation assay.

These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency. Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^112AZiH6]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation states that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test in suspected hyperthyroidism and should be used as an initial screening test; when hyperthyroidism is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when both a serum TSH and free T4 are assessed at the initial evaluation. The relationship between free T4 and TSH is an inverse log-linear relationship, so small changes in free T4 result in large changes in serum TSH, and serum TSH levels are considerably more sensitive than direct thyroid hormone measurements for assessing excess. In overt hyperthyroidism, both serum free T4 and T3 estimates are usually elevated and serum TSH is undetectable, whereas in milder hyperthyroidism serum T4 and free T4 can be normal, only serum T3 may be elevated, and serum TSH will be < 0.01 mU/L (or undetectable), a pattern called "T3-toxicosis"; assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated than those for free T4, so measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred in clinical practice.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^116o1x3e]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 11 — patient follow-up after RAI therapy for GD: Follow-up within the first 1–2 months after RAI therapy for GD should include an assessment of free T4, total T3, and TSH, and biochemical monitoring should be continued at 4- to 6-week intervals for 6 months, or until the patient becomes hypothyroid and is stable on thyroid hormone replacement; strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Most patients respond with normalization of thyroid function and symptom improvement within 4–8 weeks, and hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks, with 40% hypothyroid by 8 weeks and > 80% by 16 weeks. Beta-blockers started prior to RAI should be tapered when free T4 and total T3 return to the reference range; as free T4 and total T3 improve, methimazole (MMI) can usually be tapered. Most patients eventually develop hypothyroidism indicated by free T4 below normal; levothyroxine should then be instituted, TSH should not be used initially to determine the need, and replacement dose should be adjusted based on free T4 with careful titration. Once euthyroidism is achieved, lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended at least annually, and since TSH may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves, interpret TSH cautiously and only with free T4 and total T3.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation and assay pitfalls state that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test used in the evaluation of suspected thyrotoxicosis and should be used as an initial screening test; when thyrotoxicosis is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when a serum TSH, free T4, and total T3 are assessed at the initial evaluation. In overt hyperthyroidism, serum free T4, T3, or both are elevated, and serum TSH is subnormal (usually < 0.01 mU/L in a third-generation assay); in mild hyperthyroidism, serum T4 and free T4 can be normal with only serum T3 elevated and serum TSH low or undetectable; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a normal serum free T4 and normal total T3 or free T3, with subnormal serum TSH concentration, and a normal serum TSH level precludes the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis in the absence of a TSH-producing pituitary adenoma or thyroid hormone resistance or spurious interfering antibodies. Assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated and less robust than those for free T4; therefore, measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred over free T3 in clinical practice. The term euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia refers to elevated T4 (and frequently elevated total serum T3) without hyperthyroidism from protein-binding abnormalities such as elevations in T4 binding globulin or transthyretin, familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia, and rarely immunoglobulins that directly bind T4 or T3; spurious results may arise from heterophilic antibodies causing high TSH, which should be ruled out by repeat testing, serial dilution, or anti-mouse antibody measurement, and ingestion of high doses of biotin may cause spuriously low results in assays that utilize a streptavidin–biotin separation technique.

Introduction

Hypothyroidism affects approximately 5% of the United States population, and synthetic thyroxine in the form of levothyroxine (LT4) is the most prescribed therapy for this common condition. Autoimmune hypothyroidism is generally progressive, with a decrement in endogenous thyroid function occurring over time, such that overt hypothyroidism would occur if the thyroid hormone deficiency is untreated. However, at the current time hypothyroidism may initially be diagnosed when it is mild or subclinical, at a time that the serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is minimally elevated below 10 mIU/L and the serum thyroid hormone levels are normal. Symptoms of hypothyroidism are not always specific for this condition, and each of the symptoms generally associated with hypothyroidism may also have non-thyroid causes. As attribution of the cause of symptoms is not a simple matter, many physicians may err on the side of treating mild TSH elevations with the expectation that symptoms may improve. Thus, treatment with LT4 may be initiated for borderline TSH elevations. The authors also hypothesize that LT4 may even be prescribed for unconfirmed serum TSH elevations, or even without TSH elevation, based on the symptoms that the patient is experiencing.

LT4 is being prescribed with increasing frequency, both in the United States, and in other countries. Several studies have shown that the TSH threshold at which LT4 therapy is initiated has fallen over time, such that an increasing number of cases of subclinical hypothyroidism are being treated and the mean or median TSH value at which therapy is initiated has decreased over time.– This trend for increasing treatment and decreasing thresholds has been documented both in the United States, and in Europe. Moreover, a recent study showed that if LT4 therapy was discontinued in patients undergoing treatment, while 39% of patients did in fact become hypothyroid as manifest by an elevated TSH, 61% maintained a normal TSH, perhaps suggesting that their treatment was unnecessary. However, the follow-up period in this study was relatively brief at 6–8 weeks, thus hypothyroidism being manifest later during follow-up cannot be excluded. Although national databases show a trend for an increasing number of LT4 prescriptions being provided over time, part of this apparent increase may be accounted for by a reduction in the length of prescriptions by prescribers, such that more prescriptions are being generated for the same number of patients each year.

Hypothyroidism in pregnancy — definition, prevalence, and reference limits: Primary overt maternal hypothyroidism is generally defined as the presence of an elevated TSH and a decreased serum FT4 concentration during gestation, with both concentrations outside the trimester-specific reference ranges; at least 2%–3% of healthy, pregnant women of childbearing age have an elevated TSH, and thyroid autoantibodies can be detected in approximately 30%–60% of pregnant women with an elevated TSH concentration. In the 2011 ATA guidelines, the upper reference limit for TSH was set at 2.5 mU/L in the first trimester and 3.0 mU/L in the second and third trimesters based on six pregnancy studies comprising approximately 5500 subjects, while subsequent larger cohorts combine data from over 60,000 subjects and demonstrate substantial population differences in the TSH upper reference limit; differences may be partly attributable to iodine status and TSH assays and are influenced by BMI, geography, and ethnicity, making it difficult to precisely define a universal TSH cutoff above which LT4 therapy should be initiated for all pregnant women.

2.0 Criteria for Diagnosis

2.1 Biochemical criteria for use in the decision to initiate treatment in an infant with high TSH and/or low FT4 concentration

Recommendations

2.1.1 We recommend starting treatment immediately after baseline serum TSH and FT4 determination if DBS TSH concentration is ≥ 40 mU/L of whole blood. If DBS TSH concentration is < 40 mU/L of whole blood, the clinician may postpone treatment, pending the serum results, for 1–2 days (1|⊕⊕○).

2.1.2 We recommend starting treatment immediately if serum FT4 concentration is below the norm for age, regardless of TSH concentration (1|⊕⊕⊕).

2.1.3 We suggest that treatment should be started if venous TSH concentration is persistently > 20 mU/L, even if serum FT4 concentration is normal (2|⊕○○).

2.1.4 When venous TSH concentration is between 6 and 20 mU/L in a well baby with an FT4 concentration within the normal limits for age, we suggest diagnostic imaging to try to establish a definitive diagnosis (2|⊕○○). If TSH concentration remains high for more than 3 to 4 weeks, we suggest (in discussion with the family) either starting L-T 4 supplementation immediately and retesting, off treatment, at a later stage; or retesting 2 weeks later without treatment (2|⊕○○).

2.1.1–2.1.4 Evidence

L-T 4 treatment must be started immediately if venous FT 4 or TT4 levels are low, given the known adverse effect of untreated decompensated CH on somatic growth and neurodevelopment. Previous work has shown that the likelihood of decompensated hypothyroidism is high if DBS TSH values are above 40 mU/L, justifying immediate treatment if DBS TSH concentration is above this value. Given that the period between birth and the age of 3 years is a critical time for neurocognitive development, most clinicians would advocate treatment when TSH concentration is > 20 mU/L, carefully monitoring thyroid function to avoid overtreatment, and retesting after 3 years if the thyroid is normally located. Management remains a matter of debate for cases in which TSH concentrations are high, but to a lesser extent (6–20 mU/L), and FT4 levels are normal. The family should be informed that this is a "gray area" but that many clinicians would advise "playing safe" and treating during early childhood in this situation.

### Pediatric reference intervals for thyroid hormone levels from birth to adulthood: a retrospective study [^1113zLtn]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Interestingly, in the longitudinal subgroup of 32 children with initially elevated TSH levels in the first serum sample, TSH decreased to normal without treatment within 3–6 months. Decision not to treat these children was based on the clinical status, since it did not correspond to subclinical or clinical hypothyroidism even though the initial TSH value was elevated. This phenomenon suggests the presence of transient benign conditions affecting thyroid function. We therefore recommend that patients with initially elevated TSH values should be retested in approximately 3 to 6 months interval, before considering replacement therapy. In addition the levels of fT3, fT4, the presence of thyroperoxidase antibodies, and, in specific cases, the degree of stimulated TSH elevations should be taken into account before classifying a child or adolescent as hypothyroid. Further prospective studies in children, similar to that of Huber et al. in adults, are needed to study the spontaneous course of subclinical hypothyroidism in children and adolescents, and to determine risk factors for the development of overt hypothyroidism.

Apart from the age group 15–18 years, differences were observed to the published reference intervals for adult populations, especially for TSH. Recently, some authors argued for a reduction of the upper cut off range for TSH to 2.5 mU/L or somewhat more moderate to 3.0 mU/L in adults. Applying this upper range to pediatric patients might lead to a considerable high number of false diagnoses of hypothyroidism and result in unnecessary lifelong replacement therapy. A similar scenario has already been described for TSH reference values for adults.

In conclusion, this study provides pediatric reference intervals for thyroid function tests from birth to young adulthood for a middle European population. Thyroid hormone levels markedly change during childhood without showing significant sex differences, except for fT3. Moreover, differences of our reference intervals compared to previous studies were observed, likely caused by different antibody characteristics of various analytical methods, different populations or unknown geographic covariates. Our results argue in favor that adult reference intervals are not universally applicable to children. These reference intervals may serve as a tool for the correct interpretation of individual thyroid hormone results of children and adolescents.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1155cNLx]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

fT4 is not the active thyroid hormone at the cellular nuclear level. The strong relationships of parameters, especially AF (risk increased up to 9 × across the normal reference range (30)), with levels of fT4 indicate that the active intracellular triiodothyronine generated by thyroid hormone transporters and deiodinases appears to be, at least in the heart, proportional to circulating fT4. Any discrepancy, indicating local regulation of thyroid effect, may be more prominent in more severe pathophysiological circumstances, and therefore more relevant in the circumstances of multisystem entities such as frailty, death, and metabolic disturbance.

Our results do not imply that no information can be gleaned from the presence of an abnormal TSH level. In the presence of normal thyroid hormone levels, such TSH levels indicate that the thyroid gland physiology is abnormal. However, for the function of other tissues and organs, the TSH level required to maintain a given level of thyroid hormones appears generally not to be relevant.

It remains possible too that additional analyses might find that TSH levels are providing an additional signal to fT4 levels, in some populations for some conditions. It has been suggested that TSH itself may have physiological effects apart from the stimulation of thyroid hormone levels, and such effects rather than via the reflection of thyroid status might explain such a TSH signal. Empirically, thus far, the evidence suggests that any of these TSH effects are small.

The association of thyroid hormone and particularly fT4 levels, rather than TSH levels, with clinical features has been noted by many authors, covering many individual parameters. In particular, the meta-analysis regarding AF noted the association with fT4 but not with TSH. Authors also previously found evidence of associations of clinical parameters with fT4 in the absence of an association with subclinical thyroid dysfunction as currently diagnosed. One of these studies also showed associations with TSH.

### European society for paediatric endocrinology consensus guidelines on screening, diagnosis, and management of congenital hypothyroidism [^115KDSiz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Recommendations

3.3.6 If a precise diagnosis is sought, L-T 4 should be phased out over a 4 to 6-week period (depending on the size of the maintenance dose) and a full re-evaluation carried out at the end of this period, with biochemical testing and thyroid imaging if hypothyroidism is confirmed (2|⊕○○).

3.3.7 If the clinician wishes to establish the presence or absence of primary hypothyroidism rather than to obtain an exact diagnosis, L-T 4 dose may be decreased by 30% for 2 to 3 weeks. If an increase in TSH concentration to ≥ 10 mU/L is observed during this period, then continuing hypothyroidism can be assumed. By contrast, if thyroid function remains normal, the dose may be reduced further, followed by retesting (2|⊕⊕○).

3.3.6–3.3.7 Evidence

By the age of 2 to 3 years, the severity of thyroid impairment may be evident from a lower dose requirement or, if compliance has been imperfect, high TSH levels despite treatment.

3.4 Treatment and monitoring in pregnant women with CH

Recommendations

3.4.1 For women with CH who are planning a pregnancy, even greater efforts should be made to ensure that maternal thyroid hormones are optimal. In newly pregnant patients, we recommend an immediate increase in L-T 4 dose by 25 to 30% after a missed menstrual cycle or positive home pregnancy test (1|⊕○○).

3.4.2 TSH and FT4 (or TT 4) levels should be evaluated as soon as pregnancy is confirmed, every 4 to 6 weeks during the pregnancy, and 4 weeks after every change in dose (1|⊕⊕⊕).

3.4.3 The goal of the treatment is to maintain TSH concentration below 2.5 mU/L in the first trimester and below 3 mU/L later in pregnancy (1|⊕○○).

3.4.1–3.4.3 Evidence

There is currently no specific evidence for treatment schedules in pregnant women with CH. We therefore refer to the guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and The Endocrine Society regarding the management of thyroid disease during pregnancy.

Subacute thyroiditis — diagnostic and natural history features include an initial thyrotoxic phase in about 50% of patients due to unregulated release of preformed thyroid hormone; the serum TSH level is suppressed and the free T4 level may be elevated preferentially compared to the total T3 level; radioiodine uptake is low; and inflammatory markers are commonly elevated with mild anemia and elevated WBC count, while up to 25% have low antithyroid antibodies. The thyrotoxic phase usually lasts 3–6 weeks, about 30% subsequently enter a hypothyroid phase that can last up to 6 months, most patients become euthyroid within 12 months although 5%–15% have persistent hypothyroidism, and recurrence rates of 1%–4% have been reported.

### The "slightly" abnormal thyroid test: what is the pediatrician to do? [^116JxCS5]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Thyroid disorders are common in pediatrics. Tests of thyroid function are widely available and frequently ordered in the pediatric healthcare setting. This is sometimes driven by common signs or symptoms of thyroid disease. All too often, it is driven by patients and their parents requesting thyroid tests for nonspecific symptoms, such as fatigue, obesity or family history of thyroid disease. The decision to order thyroid tests, as well as which test(s) of thyroid function to order, deserves careful thought rather than a reflexive "thyroid panel" for every patient. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is the single most appropriate test of thyroid function when screening a pediatric or adolescent for thyroid disorders. Adding more tests only increases the likelihood that a minor (and often insignificant) abnormality will be found. These incidental abnormalities can create anxiety for the parent and child, and usually results in additional testing, referral to a pediatric endocrinologist, and further expense. This review will aim to guide the pediatric primary care provider on the choice of appropriate screening test(s) for acquired thyroid dysfunction in children and adolescents, as well as the proper interpretation of the test(s). Emphasis will be placed on the "slightly" abnormal thyroid screening test. Specific thyroid tests to be reviewed include TSH, (free) T4, (free) T3, and thyroid antibodies. Finally, this review will aim to guide decisions on follow-up, additional testing, and reasons for referral to a pediatric endocrinologist. Congenital hypothyroidism, including abnormalities on state newborn screening, will not be discussed.

### The management of subclinical hyperthyroidism by thyroid specialists [^1126fhy5]. Thyroid (2003). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is a relatively common condition for which prospectively derived evidenced-based management guidelines do not exist. We have conducted a case-based mail survey to solicit opinions from members of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) about various issues that arise in the management of patients with this disorder. The survey was completed and returned by 185 of 300 (62%) of the original survey recipients. Four hypothetical cases varying in age, thyrotropin (TSH) level and underlying etiology were presented. The majority of respondents recommended further evaluation of all cases, most commonly choosing a radioactive iodine uptake (42%-71%), thyroid scan (39%-68%) and antithyroid (TPO/Tg) antibodies (49%-55%) as the additional tests to be ordered. The large majority (84%) recommended observation rather than active treatment for a young patient with a low but detectable serum TSH level. A small majority also recommended observation alone for a young woman with an undetectable serum TSH level (58%) and for an older woman with a low but detectable serum TSH value (63%). However, the majority (66%) favored treating an older woman with an undetectable serum TSH. When treatment was advised in the patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism, the respondents strongly favored anti-thyroid drugs when the etiology was Graves' disease and radioactive iodine when the etiology was toxic nodular thyroid disease. In the absence of adequate evidence-based guidelines, it is hoped that this survey of expert opinions may provide useful guidance for physicians providing care for patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism.

### The ages and TSH values of patients being prescribed levothyroxine [^113YxiQr]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Background:

Levothyroxine is a commonly prescribed medication. Some data suggest that levothyroxine may be initiated for mild degrees of hypothyroidism and used without considering age-specific reference ranges or individual patient factors when prescribing.

Methods:

The electronic medical record of a health care system operating in the Washington, DC and Maryland area was interrogated to determine the number of patients who were being prescribed levothyroxine during the time period 2008–2016, the number of prescriptions supplied to these individuals, an associated diagnosis of hypothyroidism, and whether the prescriptions were new or existing prescriptions. Information was also extracted about the age of patients receiving prescriptions and the thyroid stimulating hormone level documented prior to levothyroxine initiation.

Results:

Although the number of levothyroxine prescriptions provided annually increased over this time period, when corrected for the number of patients in the database, the percentage of patients receiving levothyroxine prescriptions showed a slight downward trend. Levothyroxine was both most frequently prescribed and frequently initiated in those of ages 50–59 years and 60–69 years. The doses of levothyroxine most commonly prescribed were 50 µg and 100 µg and the pattern of levothyroxine doses being used was unaffected by whether a diagnosis of hypothyroidism was documented or not. Levothyroxine prescription initiation was associated with mean thyroid stimulating hormone values that were modestly elevated and in the range of 7.5–13.8 mIU/L.

Conclusion:

This analysis showed that although the percentage of patients being prescribed levothyroxine is stable or slightly declining, with most decrement in those without a diagnosis of hypothyroidism, there is nevertheless continued initiation of levothyroxine in those with mild degrees of thyroid stimulating hormone elevation, and in those of older age, raising concerns about both unnecessary treatment and iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis. Such data suggest the need for great consideration of both the degree of thyroid stimulating hormone elevation and the patient context when considering whether treatment of an elevated thyroid stimulating hormone value, versus ongoing monitoring, is indicated.

### Hypothyroidism: diagnosis and treatment… [^112wUhU4]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis TSH elevation indicates hypothyroidism. Low-end normal TSH is 0. 4 mIU per L |-| If the TSH level is low, hyperthyroidism is possible. 18 If the TSH level is high, a serum FT 4 level should be obtained. A low FT 4 level indicates clinical hypothyroidism, specifically autoimmune hypothyroidism if the TPO antibody test result is elevated). Table 1 lists other causes. 1–4 An elevated FT 4 level may suggest a TSH-secreting tumor, and referral to endocrinology is warranted. An FT 4 level within the reference range indicates subclinical hypothyroidism. Rare other causes include adrenal insufficiency, drugs, post-nonthyroidal illness, or thyroid hormone resistance syndrome. 26 TSH should be evaluated in pregnant patients with symptoms of hypothyroidism, a goiter, a history of thyroid disease, TPO antibody positivity, or autoimmune disease. 26 Patients with a TSH level greater than 2.

5 mIU per L who are TPO antibody–positive have a higher risk of pregnancy-related complications, including preterm birth and pregnancy loss. 7 More than 50% of patients older than 55 years with TSH levels of 5. 0 to
9. 9 mIU per L will normalize, whereas only 13% and 5% of patients normalize if the TSH level is greater than 10 mIU per L or greater than 15 mIU per L, respectively. 33 Patients with elevated TPO antibody titers are at an increased risk of progression to clinical hypothyroidism. 34 Annual progression from subclinical to clinical hypothyroidism is 5. 6% for a TSH level greater than 6 mIU per L.
34. Most adults older than 30 years with elevated TSH but normal FT 4 levels do not benefit from thyroid hormone therapy, and 60% normalize within five years. 37, 42 Patients who have a TSH level greater than 10 mIU per L are at higher risk of fracture, ischemic heart disease, and heart failure compared with patients who have a TSH level of 2. 0 to
2. 5 mIU per L.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism: deciding when to treat… [^112VJzEn]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

4 level — is referred to as subclinical hypothyroidism. The term "subclinical" may not be strictly correct, since some of these patients may have clinical symptoms, but no better term has been proposed. The elevation of TSH levels reflects the sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis to small decreases in circulating thyroid hormone; as the thyroid gland fails, the TSH level may rise above the upper limit of normal when the free T 4 level has fallen only slightly and is still within the normal range. Course What happens to patients who are found to have an elevated TSH level without other findings. In some cases, the TSH level will be normal if measured again several months later; we would then attribute the initial elevation to laboratory error or, perhaps, to an episode of silent thyroiditis with a transient hypothyroid phase. In other cases, the subclinical hypothyroidism remains unchanged.

The third possibility, progression to overt hypothyroidism, occurs at a rate of about 5 percent per year in patients with raised TSH levels and detectable antithyroid antibodies. Should We Treat Subclinical Hypothyroidism. Indications for treatment in subclinical hypothyroidism are not established, but general guidelines can be offered. Greater magnitude and duration of TSH elevation and higher titers of antithyroid antibodies increase the probability that the condition will progress to overt hypothyroidism and, therefore, increase the potential benefit of treatment with levothyroxine. In short, it seems reasonable to treat patients who have a TSH level that is consistently elevated above 10 μU per mL, especially if titers of antithyroid antibodies are increased.

Also, patients who complain of fatigue, dry skin, constipation, muscle cramps or other common symptoms of hypothyroidism may possibly benefit from treatment even if their TSH level is elevated only into the 5 to 10 μU per mL range. An algorithm summarizing this approach is presented in Figure 1. The goal is to maintain the TSH level within normal limits; the dosage of levothyroxine should be increased if the TSH level remains above normal and should be decreased if the TSH level falls below normal. Once the correct dosage of thyroxine is established, the frequency of TSH measurement may be decreased to every six to 12 months.

### When to begin treatment in patients with elevated TSH… [^114Ch9kj]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

The author recommends an "individualized" approach and gives several parameters to aid in decision-making. One important factor is missing from this discussion: the lipid panel. Patients with "mild thyroid failure" usually have dyslipidemia, which may be improved with thyroid hormone replacement. Indeed, mild hypothyroidism is a risk factor for atherosclerosis. I had the benefit of serving on two expert panels on this illness. However, lead investigators have convinced me that all patients with an elevated TSH level should be treated unless a contraindication is present. Improvement in several health parameters are often observed in patients who receive treatment, including improved well-being, improved lipid panel, and modest weight loss.

These patients are often overweight and lose weight much easier when their TSH is normal. In summary, I consider patients with an elevated TSH level as having hypothyroidism, and patients with normal free thyroxine level as having mild thyroid failure, which is a real condition. Why should physicians wait to treat these patients until they, if ever, progress to worse disease. Early treatment is beneficial, especially considering the lipid profile that results from an elevated TSH level. 1 on hypothyroidism in AFP. The issue of small elevations of thyroid-stimulating hormone with normal thyroxine levels is still controversial. While it is recognized that hypothyroidism is clearly associated with elevations in cholesterol, 2 there are no population-based data showing that persons with subclinical hypothyroidism are more likely to have higher cholesterol levels. However, given these limitations, a patient at high risk for cardiac disease treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism with low doses of thyroxine probably carries more benefits than risks. For elderly, white women with low risk of cardiac disease, the risk of osteopenia from excessive thyroid use may outweigh any benefits of thyroid replacement. Therefore, I think we must individualize care for our patients with this condition rather than advocating blanket therapy with thyroxine.

### Thinking through testing for primary thyroid disease… [^114xt31k]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Unnecessary levothyroxine treatment of subclinical disease may lead to increased fractures and cardiac arrhythmias. For patients with symptoms of thyroid disease, and when there is clinical suspicion for thyroid disease, testing for TSH levels is preferred initially. 1, 2 If TSH levels are elevated, free T 4 levels should be obtained. 1 If TSH levels are below normal limits, free T 4 and total T 3 levels should be obtained for diagnosis of hyperthyroidism.
2. 8 Measuring TSH levels is also recommended as the first-line test for pregnant patients with a personal or family history of thyroid disorders, type 1 diabetes, or a clinical concern for thyroid disease. In pregnant patients with hypothyroidism, TSH levels should be maintained between the trimester-specific lower limit and 2.

5 mIU/L, and TSH measurement should be obtained every 4 to 6 weeks to ensure appropriate levels of levothyroxine.
8. When treating primary hypothyroidism, levothyroxine dosing should be adjusted based on normalizing TSH and not free T 4 levels. Treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is recommended if TSH is greater than 10 mIU/L or thyroid peroxidase antibody is elevated. 1 A previous American Family Physician article discusses dosing recommendations for hypothyroidism.

1. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by suppressed TSH and normal free T 4 levels. TSH should be retested in 3 to 6 months to confirm subclinical hyperthyroidism before starting treatment. If a patient is at high risk of complications from untreated subclinical hyperthyroidism, TSH and free T 4 should be retested within 2 to 6 weeks.

9 Because hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and decreased bone mineral density, the American Thyroid Association recommends treating subclinical hyperthyroidism if TSH levels are less than 0. 1 mIU/L in two groups: adults 65 years and older and adults younger than 65 years who have heart disease, osteoporosis, or symptomatic hyperthyroidism. 2, 9.
