## Question

Management clear cell rcc pTa1

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of clear cell renal cell carcinoma staged as pT1a, including staging clarification, surgical approach, adjuvant therapy, surveillance, and special scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the TNM stage and what pT1a implies. Then, I should verify the preferred surgical approach and when partial nephrectomy is not feasible. Next, I will review whether adjuvant therapy is indicated. After that, I need to outline evidence-based surveillance. Finally, I should consider special populations and synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant plan with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the staging so I don't anchor on an incorrect assumption: pT1a denotes a tumor ≤ 4 cm confined to the kidney with negative nodes and no metastases, which corresponds to stage I disease. Wait, I should verify that mapping to stage I is correct, and yes, TNM stage I includes T1 N0 M0, which fits pT1a when N0 and M0 are confirmed.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about surgery type. I need to check the preferred operative approach for pT1a clear cell RCC. The standard of care is partial nephrectomy to preserve renal function with oncologic equivalence to radical nephrectomy in appropriately selected T1 tumors. I should confirm that both AUA and EAU align here, and they do, recommending partial nephrectomy as preferred for T1 masses when technically feasible [^1155rM1f] [^116uQYu1].

> I should double-check when radical nephrectomy is acceptable. Radical nephrectomy is reserved for cases where partial nephrectomy is not technically feasible due to tumor location, size, or patient anatomy, or when partial nephrectomy cannot achieve negative margins. Let me verify that EAU explicitly discourages minimally invasive radical nephrectomy when partial is feasible, which it does, reinforcing the nephron-sparing priority in T1 disease [^116LVDVM] [^1161NYoT].

> Next, I should review adjuvant therapy. Wait, let me verify whether any systemic therapy is indicated after complete resection of pT1a clear cell RCC. The answer is no — adjuvant pembrolizumab is indicated for intermediate-high and high-risk localized disease (for example, pT2 with grade 4 or sarcomatoid features, pT3–4, or node-positive disease), and pT1a does not meet these risk thresholds; thus, adjuvant therapy should not be offered after complete resection of pT1a disease [^111wactk] [^114rhhkC].

> I will now examine surveillance. I need to ensure the follow-up cadence matches contemporary risk-adapted models. For low-risk localized RCC, which includes pT1a with favorable histology, imaging with cross-sectional studies at 6 and 12 months, then annually for up to 5 years, is reasonable. Let me verify that this aligns with Leibovich-based risk stratification and AUA guidance, which it does, noting that many patients with T1 disease are cured and recurrence risk is low but not zero [^1161NYoT].

> But wait, what if the patient is elderly or has significant comorbidities and a limited life expectancy? I should consider whether active surveillance could be appropriate in select cases. For patients with decreased life expectancy or extensive comorbidities, active surveillance of a small renal mass can be a primary consideration, with intervention triggered by growth or progression; I need to ensure this is framed as an alternative for select patients rather than the default for pT1a, which it is [^1161NYoT].

> Let me synthesize the final, guideline-concordant plan and make sure nothing is missing: for pT1a clear cell RCC, perform partial nephrectomy when feasible to preserve renal function. If partial nephrectomy is not technically feasible, proceed with radical nephrectomy. Do not offer adjuvant systemic therapy after complete resection. Implement risk-adapted surveillance with abdominal imaging at 6 and 12 months, then annually for 5 years. Consider active surveillance only in carefully selected patients with limited life expectancy or prohibitive surgical risk, with clear triggers for intervention [^1155rM1f] [^116uQYu1] [^111wactk] [^1161NYoT].

---

For clear cell RCC pT1a, **partial nephrectomy is the standard of care** [^116uQYu1] to maximize oncologic control and preserve renal function [^1155rM1f]; **radical nephrectomy is reserved** for cases where partial nephrectomy is not technically feasible [^1161NYoT]. Active surveillance is appropriate for select patients with limited life expectancy or comorbidities [^1161NYoT], and ablation is an option for those unfit for surgery [^notfound]. Adjuvant therapy is **not indicated** after complete resection [^111wactk]. Follow-up should include periodic history, exam, and imaging (ultrasound or CT/MRI) every 6–12 months for 5 years, then annually thereafter [^notfound].

---

## Surgical management

### Partial nephrectomy (nephron-sparing surgery)

- **Standard of care**: Partial nephrectomy is the preferred surgical approach for pT1a clear cell RCC [^1161NYoT], providing excellent oncologic outcomes while preserving renal function [^1155rM1f].

- **Oncologic outcomes**: Partial nephrectomy achieves oncologic outcomes comparable to radical nephrectomy in T1a tumors [^notfound].

- **Approach**: Open, laparoscopic, or robotic approaches can be utilized based on surgeon expertise and patient factors [^115qXbUo].

---

### Radical nephrectomy

Radical nephrectomy is **reserved** for cases in which partial nephrectomy is not technically feasible due to tumor location, size, or patient anatomy [^1161NYoT]. Although effective, it carries a higher risk of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular complications than partial nephrectomy [^notfound].

---

## Non-surgical management

### Active surveillance

Active surveillance is appropriate for patients with **limited life expectancy**, **significant comorbidities**, or those who prefer to avoid surgery [^1161NYoT]. It involves regular imaging (ultrasound, CT, or MRI) and clinical assessments to monitor tumor growth or progression [^notfound].

---

### Ablative techniques

Ablative techniques such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or cryoablation are options for patients who are **surgically unfit** or prefer minimally invasive approaches [^111JQYg4]. These techniques provide acceptable oncologic control with lower morbidity than surgery, though recurrence rates may be slightly higher than with surgical excision [^notfound].

---

## Adjuvant therapy

Adjuvant therapy is **not indicated** for pT1a clear cell RCC after complete surgical resection, as the recurrence risk is low and the potential benefits do not outweigh the risks [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

Regular follow-up is essential to detect recurrence early and manage complications. The **recommended schedule** includes history, physical examination, and imaging (ultrasound or CT/MRI) every 6–12 months for the first 5 years, then annually thereafter [^notfound]. Risk stratification using validated prognostic models (e.g. Leibovich score) can help tailor follow-up intensity to individual risk profiles [^111JQYg4].

---

## Prognosis

pT1a clear cell RCC has an **excellent prognosis**, with 5-year cancer-specific survival rates exceeding 95% following surgical excision [^notfound]. Recurrence rates are low, particularly after partial nephrectomy, and are influenced by tumor grade, size, and patient factors [^114L5T63].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Treatment modality** | **Indication** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Partial nephrectomy | Standard of care for pT1a tumors | Strongly recommended |
| Radical nephrectomy | Not feasible for partial nephrectomy | Reserved |
| Active surveillance | Limited life expectancy or comorbidities | Appropriate |
| Ablative techniques | Surgically unfit patients | Alternative |
| Adjuvant therapy | Not indicated after complete resection | Not recommended |
| Follow-up | Regular surveillance | Every 6–12 months for 5 years, then annually |

---

Partial nephrectomy is the **preferred treatment** for pT1a clear cell RCC, with radical nephrectomy reserved for cases in which partial nephrectomy is not feasible. Active surveillance and ablative techniques are alternatives for select patients, and adjuvant therapy is not indicated. Regular follow-up is essential to monitor for recurrence and manage complications.

Clinical Challenges in Renal Cancer Management

In this section, we will discuss some of the current challenges in patient with renal cancer management (Fig. 1).

Figure 1.
Clinical challenges in renal cancer management. Listing some of the major challenges within patients with renal cancer management. A, For small renal masses, the dilemma is between operating or taking a watchful waiting strategy. B, For localized disease, risk stratification is needed. Does the patient need further treatment after curatively intended surgery? C, For metastatic disease, which treatment to offer is the main challenge. Immunotherapy should be administered only to patients most likely to respond to the treatment. (Adapted from an image created with BioRender.com.)

Localized disease

Localized RCC can be treated in various curatively intended ways, depending on the size and positioning of the tumor within the kidney. Nephron-sparing surgery is a valid treatment option for the pT1 tumors, whereas larger tumors primarily are removed by a radical nephrectomy. Cryoablation is also an established treatment option for pT1a tumors, given they are not placed in close vicinity of the renal pelvis or larger vessels. Here hydrodissection can be used to spare the neighboring organs. Finally stereotactic radiotherapy can be used in selected patients unfit for surgery or cryoablation technique. Patients with stage I/II RCC go on an active surveillance program following surgery, however the rate of recurrence (local or metastatic) after definitive surgery ranges widely dependent on the given risk assessment. Predicting RCC recurrence risk is based on prognostic systems or nomograms, with the Leibovich score system being one of the most widely used. The Leibovich score system is used to risk stratify patients with localized disease into "low", "intermediate", and "high risk" groups, based on histologic features and the tumor–node–metastasis (TNM) stage. The Leibovich score is used to determine the amount of follow-up offered; the low risk group will have CT scans at year 1, 3, and 5, "intermediate" at 6 and 12 months, and then yearly for 5 years, whereas the "high risk" group will have CT scans every 6 months for 3 years and then yearly up to 5 years.

### European Association of Urology guidelines on renal cell carcinoma: the 2019 update [^116kUP4x]. European Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

The European Association of Urology Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) Guideline Panel has prepared evidence-based guidelines and recommendations for the management of RCC.

Objective

To provide an updated RCC guideline based on standardised methodology including systematic reviews, which is robust, transparent, reproducible, and reliable.

Evidence Acquisition

For the 2019 update, evidence synthesis was undertaken based on a comprehensive and structured literature assessment for new and relevant data. Where necessary, formal systematic reviews adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were undertaken. Relevant databases (Medline, Cochrane Libraries, trial registries, conference proceedings) were searched until June 2018, including randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and retrospective or controlled studies with a comparator arm, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. Where relevant, risk of bias (RoB) assessment, and qualitative and quantitative syntheses of the evidence were performed. The remaining sections of the document were updated following a structured literature assessment. Clinical practice recommendations were developed and issued based on the modified GRADE framework.

Evidence Synthesis

All chapters of the RCC guidelines were updated based on a structured literature assessment, for prioritised topics based on the availability of robust data. For RCTs, RoB was low across studies. For most non-RCTs, clinical and methodological heterogeneity prevented pooling of data. The majority of included studies were retrospective with matched or unmatched cohorts, based on single- or multi-institutional data or national registries. The exception was for the treatment of metastatic RCC, for which there were several large RCTs, resulting in recommendations based on higher levels of evidence.

Conclusions

The 2019 RCC guidelines have been updated by the multidisciplinary panel using the highest methodological standards. These guidelines provide the most reliable contemporary evidence base for the management of RCC in 2019.

Patient Summary

The European Association of Urology Renal Cell Carcinoma Guideline Panel has thoroughly evaluated the available research data on kidney cancer to establish international standards for the care of kidney cancer patients.

### NCCN guidelines updates: management of metastatic kidney cancer [^112GvHBW]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). Medium credibility.

The NCCN Guidelines for Kidney Cancer have undergone a major shift in the risk categorization used for designating "preferred" and "other recommended" or "useful under certain circumstances" first-line treatments. In the most recent version of the guidelines, "favorable risk" is now its own risk category and "intermediate risk" and "poor risk" are combined into one category. The treatment recommendations for clear cell renal cell carcinoma are continually revised and more new options are anticipated based on encouraging results from pivotal trials. In his presentation at the NCCN 2019 Annual Conference, Dr. Jonasch described these promising findings.

### Renal cell carcinoma 2005: new frontiers in staging, prognostication and targeted molecular therapy [^1167Y1BU]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has traditionally been staged using a purely anatomical staging system. Although current staging systems provide good prognostic information, data published in the last few years has led to significant controversies as to whether further revisions are needed and whether improvements can be made with the introduction of new, more accurate and predictive prognostic factors not currently included in traditional staging systems. This review highlights such controversies and provides an update on current staging modalities, prognostic factors and targeted molecular therapy for RCC.

Materials and Methods

A comprehensive review of the peer reviewed literature was performed on the topic of current staging modalities, validated prognostic factors, predictive nomograms, molecular markers and targeted molecular therapy for RCC.

Results

A staging system for malignant disease such as RCC uses various characteristics of tumors to stratify patients into clinically meaningful categories, which can be used to provide patients with counseling regarding prognosis, select treatment modalities and determine eligibility for clinical trials. The TNM staging system is currently the most extensively used one. However, it has undergone recent systematic revision due to rapidly emerging data from longer patient followup. The identification of various histological and symptomatic factors has led groups at many centers to develop more comprehensive staging systems that integrate these factors and include patients with metastatic and local disease. While integrated staging systems have improved RCC staging, the recent discovery of molecular tumor markers is expected to revolutionize RCC staging in the future and lead to the development of new therapies based on molecular targeting.

Conclusions

Staging systems for RCC serve as a valuable prognostic tool. Several new patient and tumor characteristics have been reported to be important prognostic factors and they have been integrated into current staging systems. In addition, the field of RCC is rapidly undergoing a revolution led by molecular markers and targeted therapies. With this information urologists will be updated with the most current and comprehensive staging strategies, and be provided with a glimpse of the molecular and patient specific staging and treatment paradigms that will in our opinion transform the future management of this malignancy.

### Evolving principles of surgical management and prognostic factors for outcome in renal cell carcinoma [^111ZKiCH]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

The generally accepted principles for the surgical management of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were first described more than 30 years ago. Since then, much has changed in the understanding of the basic biology and genetics of kidney cancer. Improvements in cross-sectional imaging has allowed for more accurate preoperative clinical staging of renal tumors, and the necessity of completing all the components of the radical nephrectomy have been questioned. Surgical techniques have also evolved, and technology has advanced to make possible new methods of managing renal tumors. The TNM staging system is currently the most extensively used system to provide prognostic information for RCC. However, data published in the last few years has led to significant controversies as to whether further revisions are needed and whether improvements can be made with the introduction of new, more accurate and predictive prognostic factors. Furthermore, the recent discovery of molecular tumor markers are expected to revolutionize the staging of RCC and lead to the development of new therapies based on molecular targeting. This review will examine the evolving principles in the surgical management of RCC as well as provide an update on current staging modalities and prognostic factors.

### Management of renal cell carcinoma: promising biomarkers and the challenges to reach the clinic [^112gFvDf]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is increasing worldwide, yet research within this field is lagging behind other cancers. Despite increased detection of early disease as a consequence of the widespread use of diagnostic CT scans, 25% of patients have disseminated disease at diagnosis. Similarly, around 25% progress to metastatic disease following curatively intended surgery. Surgery is the cornerstone in the treatment of RCC; however, when the disease is disseminated, immunotherapy or immunotherapy in combination with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor is the patient's best option. Immunotherapy is a potent treatment, with durable treatment responses and potential to cure the patient, but only half of the patients benefit from the administered treatment, and there are currently no methods that can identify which patients will respond to immunotherapy. Moreover, there is a need to identify the patients in greatest risk of relapsing after surgery for localized disease and direct adjuvant treatment there. Even though several molecular biomarkers have been published to date, we are still lacking routinely used biomarkers to guide optimal clinical management. The purpose of this review is to highlight some of the most promising biomarkers, discuss the efforts made within this field to date, and describe the barriers needed to be overcome to have reliable and robust predictive and prognostic biomarkers in the clinic for renal cancer.

### Management of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma: ASCO guideline [^112Rw3jP]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma — patient and clinician communication emphasizes factors that both patients and clinicians should consider and address throughout the emotional and medical journeys of someone facing metastatic renal clear cell carcinoma, noting that the first-line treatments outlined in these recommendations will likely provide a survival benefit to many patients. When disease is no longer controlled, patients may benefit by focusing on QoL and time spent with loved ones, and Palliative care can provide important benefits for this patient group, even when active treatment plans are in play. The panel adds that Second opinions with kidney cancer content experts should become an accepted practice for patients and that case conferences or tumor boards should focus on collaborating on difficult cases to the greatest extent possible. Shared decision making is highlighted, and the care of patients with mRCC requires input from multidisciplinary team members. Patients and caregivers should be encouraged to reach out to family members, friends, and other patients to ensure they can avoid the loneliness, depression, and poor decision making that frequently occur by those attempting to go it alone.

### Surgical outcomes in the management of isolated nodal recurrences: a multicenter, international retrospective cohort [^113p3moV]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

We report a multicenter international cohort representing what is to our knowledge the largest surgical experience with managing isolated retroperitoneal nodal recurrence of renal cell carcinoma, a unique subset of locoregional disease, yet to be described in detail.

Materials and Methods

Patients with isolated nodal recurrence of pTanyN+M0 disease after nephrectomy were identified by retrospective chart review at 3 independent institutions. Progression-free survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and used to compare survival outcomes between primary T(1–2)N(any)M0 and T3N(any)M0 tumors as well as clear cell and nonclear cell histology renal cell carcinoma.

Results

A total of 22 patients met study inclusion criteria. Median time to local postoperative recurrence was 31.5 months (IQR 12.9–43.3). After resection of isolated nodal recurrence 10 patients (46%) had a secondary recurrence at a median of 11.2 months (IQR 8.1–18.4), of whom 2 (9%) died of the disease. Overall median progression-free survival was 12.7 months, including 24.8 months for T(1–2)N(any)M0 tumors, 9.9 months for T3N(any)M0 tumors, and 13.4 and 17.6 months for clear and nonclear cell renal cell carcinoma, respectively.

Conclusions

Surgical resection represents the best curative option for patients who present with isolated retroperitoneal lymph node recurrence of renal cell carcinoma. Durable postoperative progression-free survival is attainable in many patients regardless of histology or clinical TNM stage. In addition, our cohort showed a lower renal cell carcinoma related mortality rate than in previous series of local metastasis. As such, all patients free of precluding comorbidities should be considered candidates for complete surgical resection performed by an experienced genitourinary surgeon.

### Renal cell carcinoma guideline [^1159d28F]. European Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

The European Association of Urology (EAU) Guideline Group for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) prepared this guideline to help urologists assess the evidence-based management of RCC and to incorporate the guideline recommendations into their clinical practice.

Methods

The recommendations provided in the current guideline are based on a systematic literature search using MedLine, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and publications and review articles.

Results

A limited number of prospective randomised studies are available with high-level evidence. Most publications concerning RCC are based on retrospective analyses, including some larger multicentre validation studies and well-designed controlled studies.

Conclusions

It must be stressed that the current guideline contains information for the treatment of an individual patient according to a standardised general approach. Updated recommendations concerning diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up can improve the clinical handling of patients with RCC.

### EAU guidelines on renal cell carcinoma: 2014 update [^114ad6ap]. European Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Context

The European Association of Urology Guideline Panel for Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) has prepared evidence-based guidelines and recommendations for RCC management.

Objectives

To provide an update of the 2010 RCC guideline based on a standardised methodology that is robust, transparent, reproducible, and reliable.

Evidence Acquisition

For the 2014 update, the panel prioritised the following topics: percutaneous biopsy of renal masses, treatment of localised RCC (including surgical and nonsurgical management), lymph node dissection, management of venous thrombus, systemic therapy, and local treatment of metastases, for which evidence synthesis was undertaken based on systematic reviews adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Relevant databases (Medline, Cochrane Library, trial registries, conference proceedings) were searched (January 2000 to November 2013) including randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and retrospective or controlled studies with a comparator arm. Risk of bias (RoB) assessment and qualitative and quantitative synthesis of the evidence were performed. The remaining sections of the document were updated following a structured literature assessment.

Evidence Synthesis

All chapters of the RCC guideline were updated. For the various systematic reviews, the search identified a total of 10,862 articles. A total of 151 studies reporting on 78,792 patients were eligible for inclusion; where applicable, data from RCTs were included and meta-analyses were performed. For RCTs, there was low RoB across studies; however, clinical and methodological heterogeneity prevented data pooling for most studies. The majority of studies included were retrospective with matched or unmatched cohorts based on single or multi-institutional data or national registries. The exception was for systemic treatment of metastatic RCC, in which several RCTs have been performed, resulting in recommendations based on higher levels of evidence.

Conclusions

The 2014 guideline has been updated by a multidisciplinary panel using the highest methodological standards, and provides the best and most reliable contemporary evidence base for RCC management.

Patient Summary

The European Association of Urology Guideline Panel for Renal Cell Carcinoma has thoroughly evaluated available research data on kidney cancer to establish international standards for the care of kidney cancer patients.

### Management of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma: ASCO guideline [^114gUMWS]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — management recommendations for metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) state that the diagnosis of metastatic ccRCC should be made using tissue biopsy of the primary tumor or a metastatic site with the inclusion of markers and/or stains to support the diagnosis, and The International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium risk criteria should be used to inform treatment. Cytoreductive nephrectomy may be offered to select patients with kidney-in-place and favorable- or intermediate-risk disease, and for those who have already had a nephrectomy, an initial period of active surveillance may be offered if they are asymptomatic with a low burden of disease. For systemic therapy, patients with favorable-risk disease who need systemic therapy may be offered an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) in combination with a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI); patients with intermediate or poor risk should be offered a doublet regimen (no recommendation was provided between ICIs or an ICI in combination with a VEGFR TKI), and for select patients, monotherapy with either an ICI or a VEGFR TKI may be offered on the basis of comorbidities; Interleukin-2 remains an option, although selection criteria could not be identified. Recommendations are also provided for second- and subsequent-line therapy as well as the treatment of bone metastases, brain metastases, or the presence of sarcomatoid features, and Participation in clinical trials is highly encouraged for patients with metastatic ccRCC.

QUESTION: WHAT ARE THE PREFERRED OPTIONS FOR FIRST-LINE SYSTEMIC TREATMENT OF mRCC. Active surveillance may be considered for a subset of carefully selected patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who have a more indolent disease course. Patients with lower IMDC risk score, limited number of metastatic sites, long intervals from nephrectomy to developing metastatic disease, and low disease volume might be better candidates for this approach. Metastasis-directed therapy such as surgery, radiation, or thermal ablation may be considered for select patients on surveillance. For patients with IMDC intermediate- or poor-risk disease who are candidates for treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, a combination regimen including an ICI should be used for the first-line systemic treatment. A detailed discussion with the patient and shared decision making is the recommended approach.

Although QoL was evaluated in several of the studies, differences in QoL methodology and assessment limit the use of the information for decision making among the different treatment regimens. vsunitinib) and the hazard ratio for death was 1. 19 among the exploratory efficacy population of favorable-risk patients. Therefore, the ipilimumab and nivolumab combination is currently approved for IMDC intermediate- and poor-risk patients and ICI + vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor combination regimens are recommended for patients with IMDC favorable-risk mRCC, in addition to the intermediate- and poor-risk groups. Although combination therapy including ICIs is the preferred management strategy, use of VEGFR TKI monotherapy 12or ICI monotherapy such as pembrolizumab 13may be considered in select patients. Risk group and/or coexisting medical issues may preclude use of ICIs or VEGFR TKIs.

QUESTION: WHAT IS THE OPTIMAL SECOND OR LATER LINE SYSTEMIC TREATMENT FOR mRCC. Most patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma will experience disease progression on first-line therapy but will generally have an adequate performance status to consider second-line therapies or beyond. The choice of therapy will depend on which agents were used in first-line therapy, magnitude, and duration of response, toxicities, patient preferences, and comorbidities. Clinical trial participation is strongly suggested. 10Patients can be grouped into those who had TKI alone, immunotherapy alone, or combination TKI with immunotherapy.

### First-line therapy for metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma: how to choose between different combinations… [^113FCK4H]. ASCO Daily News (2022). Medium credibility.

Key Points:

- Most patients who need systemic therapy for metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma should receive combination therapy, which has shown consistent benefits for progression-free and overall survival compared with single-agent sunitinib.
- Combination immunotherapy is an important option for intermediate-/poor-risk RCC given its durable response and long-term survival data, and the excellent tolerability of single-agent nivolumab maintenance therapy. However, this combination has higher rates of immune toxicity and lower objective response rates than immunotherapy/tyrosine kinase inhibitor combinations. 1 This led to its U. S. Food and Drug Administration approval in 2018 as a first-line combination therapy option for patients with metastatic RCC.

Subsequently, multiple combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors and antiangiogenesis VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors also showed superior progression-free survival and, in many cases, improved OS compared with sunitinib. immediatesystemic therapy. Some patients who do not experience rapid disease progression, who have limited disease burden, and who are asymptomatic from their disease may do well with careful active surveillance. This was shown in a phase 2 trial in which patients treated with surveillance alone waited a median of 14. 9 months until initiation of systemic therapy. Patients with sarcomatoid features are a special population within clear cell RCC. Across multiple trials, it has been clear that sarcomatoid clear cell RCC tends to respond well to IO-based therapy but has worse response rates to VEGFR TKIs. Given the demonstrated 18. 9% complete response rate and
60.

8% ORR with ipilimumab plus nivolumab in the sarcomatoid subgroup of CheckMate-214, this is our preferred first-line regimen for patients with metastatic sarcomatoid clear cell RCC. Conclusion First-line therapy for patients with metastatic clear cell RCC has been revolutionized by combination therapy and will continue to evolve rapidly. Future directions being explored in first-line trials include the use of novel agents, such as the HIF-2α inhibitor belzutifan, and further intensification of therapy with triplet regimens. Major open questions include whether the current armamentarium of first-line combination therapies remains equally effective for patients who receive adjuvant IO, and whether predictive biomarkers may allow for personalized treatment.

### Personalizing first-line management of metastatic renal cell carcinoma: leveraging current and novel therapeutic options [^116cG8gm]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). Medium credibility.

The treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been revolutionized by advances in immunotherapeutic and targeted agents. Therapeutic approaches to RCC in these categories have recently evolved to include immune checkpoint inhibitors, novel vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and combinations of those agents. Multiple regimens within each category have been approved for use in the first-line treatment of clear cell and non-clear cell RCC. However, few of these regimens have been directly compared, leading to a new clinical challenge for physicians: how to select a first-line treatment regimen for an individual patient from among multiple approved options. In the modern era of RCC management, the initial treatment selection therefore becomes highly personalized and depends on numerous patient-specific factors, including histopathologic and clinical features of the disease, comorbid conditions, and psychosocial and economic factors. This review details current first-line treatment options for the management of metastatic RCC and proposes a framework whereby treatment selection can be optimized for individual patients.

Several well-established prognostic factors are now available for RCC and have proven utility for patient counseling and management. Consideration of these factors allows for a rational stratification of patients into clinical trials and facilitates the comparison of reports from diverse institutions. Tumor stage remains the most important prognostic factor for RCC, but compelling data have also been accumulated in support of various clinical signs and symptoms, tumor grade, size, histologic subtype, and DNA content and nuclear morphometry. Novel efforts to integrate these factors show great promise and are likely to incorporate molecular factors in the near future.

### Management of renal cell carcinoma: promising biomarkers and the challenges to reach the clinic [^112AymeU]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is increasing worldwide, yet research within this field is lagging behind other cancers. Despite increased detection of early disease, as a consequence of the widespread use of diagnostic CT scans, a quarter of patients have disseminated disease at diagnosis. Similarly, around a quarter progress to metastatic disease following curatively intended surgery.

Surgery is the cornerstone in the treatment of localized RCC, however when the disease is disseminated, immunotherapy (IO) or immunotherapy in combination with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI-IO) is the patient's best option.

When counseling patients on surgical or medical treatments, urologists, and oncologists are utilizing variables such as age, performance status, blood chemistry, and histology in their decision making. These patient characteristics (biomarkers) are guiding treatment decisions to some extent, but not sufficiently for optimal risk stratifying.

In this review, we describe the current clinical needs for biomarkers in patient with renal cancer care, and discuss the challenges of biomarker development, including a highlight of the most promising biomarkers today.

### What can molecular pathology contribute to the management of renal cell carcinoma? [^113GLZ87]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2011). Medium credibility.

The incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is increasing and outcomes remain poor. One-third of patients with localized disease will relapse, and 5-year survival for patients with metastatic disease is less than 10%. No molecular test is currently available to identify which patients who have undergone 'curative' surgery will relapse, and which patients will respond to targeted therapy. Some well characterized biochemical pathways, such as those associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease, are aberrantly regulated in RCC and are associated with histological subtype, but the understanding of these pathways contributes little to the clinical management of patients with RCC. Gene expression and sequencing studies have increased our understanding of the genetic basis of the disease but have failed to establish any unified classification to improve molecular stratification or to predict which patients are likely to relapse or respond to targeted therapy. Instead, they have served to highlight that RCC is heterogeneous at histological, morphological, and molecular levels, and that novel approaches are required to resolve the complexity of RCC prognostication and prediction of treatment response.

### European Association of Urology guidelines on renal cell carcinoma: the 2022 update [^111cnxUQ]. European Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Context

The European Association of Urology (EAU) Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) Guideline Panel has prepared evidence-based guidelines and recommendations for the management of RCC.

Objective

To present a summary of the 2022 RCC guideline, which is based on a standardised methodology including systematic reviews (SRs) and provides transparent and reliable evidence for the management of RCC.

Evidence Acquisition

For the 2022 update, a new literature search was carried out with a cutoff date of May 28, 2021, covering the Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. The data search focused on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and retrospective or controlled comparator-arm studies, SRs, and meta-analyses. Evidence synthesis was conducted using modified GRADE criteria as outlined for all the EAU guidelines.

Evidence Synthesis

All chapters of the RCC guideline were updated on the basis of a structured literature assessment, and clinical practice recommendations were developed. The majority of the studies included were retrospective with matched or unmatched cohorts and were based on single- or multi-institution data or national registries. The exception was systemic treatment of metastatic RCC, for which there are several large RCTs, resulting in recommendations that are based on higher levels of evidence.

Conclusions

The 2022 RCC guidelines have been updated by a multidisciplinary panel of experts using the highest methodological standards. These guidelines provide the most reliable contemporary evidence base for the management of RCC in 2022.

### Prognostic factors of renal cell carcinoma [^1111GfKh]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Determination of prognostic factors is essential for the management of renal cell carcinoma. Stage, histological grade and type, and performance status are now well known and commonly used. During the last decade numerous predictors of patient outcome were tested. This review summarizes the most important studies, explores and compares the results, and tries to respond to the question, "Today, what do we expect of clinical, molecular and genetic factors concerning survival of patients with renal cell carcinoma?"

Materials and Methods

Based on MEDLINE literature searches we comprehensively reviewed the literature on the prognostic factors associated with the tumor, the patient and the treatment.

Results

During the last decades numerous factors have been studied but few of them maintained independent significance in terms of overall survival as assessed by multivariate analysis. Results are more often controversial from one series to another. No known molecular or cytogenetic tumor marker has been identified to help diagnose, manage or confirm renal cell carcinoma remission, progression or relapse.

Conclusions

The classical prognostic factors remain histological grade, histological type, performance status, patient age, number and location(s) of metastatic sites, time to appearance of metastases and prior nephrectomy. The only striking advancement during the last few years has been the proven contribution of radical nephrectomy for metastatic disease in patients with good performance status.

### ASCO guidelines… [^1123SUiB]. ASCO (2022). Medium credibility.

Dr. Tian Zhang: This is probably our most extensive section, as first-line systemic treatments have changed and expanded greatly over the past five years. First, we recommend considering active surveillance for select patients with the following criteria: those who have IMDC favorable or intermediate-risk disease, those with limited or no disease-related symptoms, and also those with a long interval between nephrectomy and the development of metastasis. Second, we recommend IMDC risk stratification to then determine treatment selection. Those with IMDC intermediate or poor risk factors should be offered combination treatment with either two immune checkpoint inhibitors or an immune checkpoint inhibitor with an anti-angiogenic VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

We provide strong level of evidence with the completed phase three trials in this first-line setting of ipilimumab and nivolumab, axitinib with pembrolizumab, axitinib with avelumab, cabozantinib with nivolumab, and lenvatinib with pembrolizumab. For patients with IMDC favorable-risk disease, we recommend an immune checkpoint inhibitor with a VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor which may be offered over VEGF TKI alone for those patients who are candidates for immunotherapy. In addition, VEGF monotherapy or an immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy may be offered for select patients who have certain coexisting medical conditions. We recommend nivolumab or cabozantinib for patients who had prior progression on a VEGF TKI alone based on the large phase three trials CheckMate 025 and METEOR respectively that gain the approvals for nivolumab and cabozantinib. For patients with disease progression on a combination immunotherapy, a VEGF TKI should be considered.

Those who progress after initial combination therapy with a VEGF TKI and an immune checkpoint inhibitor should then be offered an alternative VEGF TKI as a single agent. And finally, for patients who have sarcomatoid features on pathology, an immune checkpoint inhibitor-based combination should be chosen in the first line setting. And this is based on multiple phase three trials that have shown improvement in clinical outcomes for patients treated with immunotherapy combinations compared to sunitinib alone. Brittany Harvey: Thank you for viewing all these recommendations. The guideline expert panel certainly covered a lot of questions on the treatment and management of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma.

### Medical treatment of renal cancer: new horizons [^112Vtd6v]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Management of early stage disease

The expansion in cross-sectional imaging over the last few decades means that the majority of early stage RCC diagnoses are now the result of incidental findings. This has led to a debate over how to best manage small lesions of unknown significance, particularly in frail, elderly patients in whom the increased competing cause mortality tips the balance towards active surveillance. Further work is required in terms of both radiological and serological markers to aid decision-making.

Localised (T1 and T2) RCC is cured by surgery alone in the majority of cases with 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) in patients undergoing surgery for T1 and T2 disease of 95% and 74%, respectively (Table 1).

Open radical nephrectomy was for four decades the standard of surgical care for RCC. Partial nephrectomy was initially adopted as a nephron-sparing procedure for selective indications (solitary kidney and poor renal function), but is now standard treatment for organ-confined tumours at the renal poles measuring < 7 cm (T1 disease). In patients with locally advanced (T3 and T4 disease), there is no proven role for adrenalectomy or routine lymph node dissection in the absence of radiological evidence of lymph node or adrenal involvement.

### Selecting targeted therapies for patients with renal cell carcinoma [^112YpnSV]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2011). Low credibility.

Advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a heterogeneous disease with variable histology, biology, and response to treatment. In the past 5 years, 6 new agents have been approved for the treatment of RCC, and many more are in clinical development. With an ever-increasing number of treatment options, selecting among them for a particular patient can be a daunting task for clinicians. This article describes how treatment choice can be guided by the disease setting and histology, as well as patient characteristics, comorbidities, and preference within the context of available data.

Treatment selection in metastatic ccRCC

As the predominant histological type within RCC, this is the group of patients for which there is the greatest evidence base to guide management. Renal cell carcinoma can sometimes follow an indolent course, therefore a period of observation can be considered before starting treatment. Immediate treatment is advised however where there is extensive multisite, progressive or symptomatic disease. First-line treatment in mRCC depends heavily on the prognostic category, with differing recommendations for favourable and intermediate-risk disease vs poor-risk disease.

### European Association of Urology guidelines on renal cell carcinoma: the 2025 update [^116WxZUa]. European Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

The European Association of Urology (EAU) renal cell carcinoma (RCC) guideline panel has updated their evidence-based guidelines and recommendations for the management of RCC. Here we present a summary of the 2025 RCC guidelines updated with standardised methodology to provide reproducible evidence for the management of RCC.

Methods

For the 2025 update, a literature search was performed covering the period from May 1, 2023 to May 1, 2024 using the Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Libraries. The data search focused on meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and retrospective or controlled comparator-arm studies. Evidence was synthesised as outlined for all EAU guidelines.

Key Findings and Limitations

Clinical practise recommendations were updated in all chapters of the RCC guidelines on the basis of a structured literature search. The studies included were predominantly retrospective with matched or unmatched cohorts based on single- or multi-institutional data. Several prospective studies and RCTs provided data that resulted in recommendations based on higher levels of evidence. Specifically, updates include new recommendations on stereotactic body radiotherapy for localised RCC, adjuvant therapy, systemic therapy for clear-cell RCC in later lines, other subtypes, and a new chapter on hereditary RCC.

Conclusions and Clinical Implications

The 2025 RCC guidelines have been updated by a multidisciplinary panel of experts using methodological standards to provide a contemporary evidence base for the management of RCC.

Implications for practice

Biological discoveries in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have translated into the development of multiple treatment options. Over the past 3 decades, the treatment paradigm has dramatically shifted with the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), now the cornerstone of metastatic RCC management either alone or in combination with targeted agents. Although these advances have revolutionized treatment options for metastatic RCC, questions remain on how to optimally approach management of relapsed or refractory disease. This article will explore the pivotal findings regarding the pathogenesis of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and how these discoveries have influenced novel treatments for this disease.

Metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma — multiple chronic conditions (MCC) considerations emphasize that creating recommendations for patients with two or more chronic conditions is challenging, that any treatment plan needs to take into account the complexity and uncertainty created by MCC with shared decision making, and that clinicians should review all other chronic conditions when formulating treatment and follow-up plans. The guideline notes that practice guidelines should provide information on how to apply recommendations for patients with MCC and that some or all recommended care options may be modified or not applied; evidence may be limited because clinical trials often exclude MCC populations, constraining recommendations.

### Current staging of renal cell carcinoma [^1132Kv7w]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Most (> 80%) cancers involving the kidney are renal cell carcinoma (RCC). One third of patients diagnosed with kidney cancer have evidence of metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, and as many as half of patients treated for localized disease eventually relapse. As is true for any other malignancy, one must determine which tumor features, patient factors, and laboratory techniques will provide diagnostic and prognostic information for patients with RCC. This article focuses on the history and rationale of the current staging systems for RCC as well as the potential for improvements by the addition of other clinical, pathologic, and molecular prognostic markers.

### Renal cell carcinoma [^1129psNR]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

The landscape of the management of renal cell carcinoma has evolved substantially in the last decade, leading to improved survival in localised and advanced disease. We review the epidemiology, pathology, and diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma and discuss the evidence for current management strategies from localised to metastatic disease. Developments in adjuvant therapies are discussed, including use of pembrolizumab-the first therapy to achieve overall survival benefit in the adjuvant setting. The treatment of advanced disease, including landmark trials that have established immune checkpoint inhibition as a standard of care, are also reviewed. We also discuss the current controversies that exist surrounding the management of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, including the use of risk assessment models for disease stratification and treatment selection for frontline therapy. Management of non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma subtypes is also reviewed. Future directions of research, including a discussion of ongoing clinical trials and the need for reliable biomarkers to guide treatment in kidney cancer, are also highlighted.

NCCN Kidney Cancer — management of stage I (T1a) disease prefers partial nephrectomy, allows either open or laparoscopic approaches, recommends radical nephrectomy when partial is not feasible, and includes active surveillance for selected patients with small tumors. The Panel prefers surgical excision by partial nephrectomy for the management of clinical stage I (T1a) renal masses, and both open and laparoscopic approaches to partial nephrectomy can be considered. Some localized tumors may not be amenable to partial nephrectomy, in which case radical nephrectomy is recommended, and radical nephrectomy is also listed as an alternative for T1a RCC if partial nephrectomy is not technically feasible as determined by the urologic surgeon. Other options in selected patients include active surveillance and ablative techniques; active surveillance is an option that should be a primary consideration for those with decreased life expectancy or extensive comorbidities, and short- and intermediate-term outcomes indicate that an appropriate strategy is to initially monitor small renal masses (< 3 cm) and treat for progression if required.
