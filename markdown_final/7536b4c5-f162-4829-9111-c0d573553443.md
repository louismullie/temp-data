## Question

How long to treat toenail fungus with oral terbinafine?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long to treat toenail fungus with oral terbinafine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard FDA-labeled regimen and whether it distinguishes fingernails from toenails. Then, I should verify guideline recommendations that sometimes extend beyond the label. Next, I will review comparative evidence on continuous versus pulse dosing and whether longer courses improve outcomes. After that, I need to consider special populations and when to extend therapy. Finally, I should confirm safety monitoring, expected time to visible improvement, and what to do if response is suboptimal, anchoring to high-quality sources like the FDA label, Cochrane, and major guidelines [^1158ekVa] [^113UMTeu] [^114oMws9].

> Let me first confirm the labeled regimen. The FDA prescribing information specifies terbinafine 250 mg orally once daily for 12 weeks for toenail onychomycosis, and 6 weeks for fingernail disease, with the optimal clinical effect appearing months after mycological cure due to the time needed for healthy nail outgrowth, which is the foundation I should not deviate from without a compelling reason [^1158ekVa].

> Wait, let me verify guideline nuances before concluding. The British Association of Dermatologists recommends terbinafine 250 mg daily for 12 to 16 weeks for toenail disease, which allows for extension in more extensive or slow-responding cases, so a 12-week course is standard, but 16 weeks can be reasonable in selected patients with matrix involvement or slow nail growth [^114oMws9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about pulse regimens. I initially thought pulse terbinafine might be equivalent, but I should double-check head-to-head data. A randomized, double-blind VA trial showed continuous terbinafine 250 mg daily for 12 weeks was superior to pulse terbinafine 500 mg daily for 1 week monthly for 3 months on mycologic and clinical cure endpoints, so continuous therapy remains preferred when feasible [^111DaRFd]. A more recent comparative study similarly favored continuous over pulse dosing for clinical cure, reinforcing that continuous 12-week therapy is the evidence-based standard [^1166f1K9].

> I need to check whether extending beyond 12 weeks improves outcomes. A network meta-analysis suggested that terbinafine 250 mg daily for 24 weeks had higher odds of mycological cure than 12 weeks, indicating that in refractory or very severe disease, a longer continuous course may be beneficial, though this must be balanced against tolerability and monitored carefully [^111ewRAN]. But wait, I should verify that this extension strategy is not the routine for everyone; it is better reserved for poor responders or extensive disease rather than replacing the standard 12-week regimen [^111ewRAN].

> Next, I should review special populations and when to individualize. In elderly patients, continuous terbinafine 12 weeks remains effective and well tolerated, with some protocols allowing an additional 4 weeks if response is suboptimal at 6 months, which aligns with the BAD's 12–16 week flexibility and pragmatic extension in slow responders [^115bLJ93] [^114oMws9]. In patients with diabetes, terbinafine maintains comparable efficacy and safety profiles without meaningful hypoglycemia signals, supporting the standard 12-week course with routine monitoring as indicated [^113SmEUL] [^116yW8Qy].

> I should confirm safety prerequisites and monitoring. Before starting, assess for chronic or active liver disease and obtain baseline liver function tests, especially in patients with risk factors or concomitant hepatotoxic drugs, and monitor LFTs if treatment is prolonged or if symptoms arise, which is consistent with FDA warnings and dermatology guidelines [^1158ekVa] [^114oMws9] [^117QA1qW] [^117BnDuN]. Let me also remind myself to counsel on rare but serious adverse effects and drug interactions, and to advise sun protection given photosensitivity reports, even though serious events are uncommon [^117QA1qW] [^111MzgGz].

> I will now examine expected time to clinical improvement to set expectations. Even though the drug is taken for 12 weeks, visible clearing lags as the nail grows out; the FDA notes optimal clinical effect is seen months after mycological cure, and clinical trials commonly assess outcomes at 48–72 weeks, with mean time to overall success around 10 months for toenails, so patients should be counseled accordingly to avoid premature discontinuation or retreatment [^1158ekVa] [^115fPpcw] [^115TjF1U] [^111DaRFd].

> But wait, what if the response is inadequate at 12 weeks. I should double-check early predictors of failure. Positive mycology at 12 or 24 weeks strongly predicts poor long-term outcomes, so if cultures or microscopy remain positive at those checkpoints, extending terbinafine to 16 weeks or considering combination strategies is reasonable, with some clinicians adding a topical agent such as efinaconazole or amorolfine to leverage synergistic mechanisms and improve clearance in refractory cases [^113ydY2o] [^114oMws9] [^112D9kKM] [^115zhYmo] [^115h9xfz].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure internal consistency. Standard treatment is terbinafine 250 mg orally once daily for 12 weeks for toenail onychomycosis, with the understanding that nails will continue to improve for months thereafter; extend to 16 weeks in selected extensive or slow-responding cases per guidelines, avoid substituting pulse regimens for continuous therapy given inferior efficacy, and reserve longer continuous courses for refractory disease after reassessment of adherence, severity, and mycology [^1158ekVa] [^114oMws9] [^111DaRFd] [^111ewRAN].

---

The standard duration of oral terbinafine for toenail fungus is **12 weeks** [^1158ekVa] at 250 mg once daily [^114GBEnn], with clinical improvement continuing for months as the nail grows out [^1158ekVa]. Extending therapy to 16 weeks may be considered for severe or slow-responding cases [^115bLJ93], but **longer courses beyond 16 weeks are not routinely recommended** due to limited evidence and increased risk of adverse effects. Pulse regimens are less effective than continuous dosing [^111DaRFd] and should be avoided. Baseline and periodic liver function monitoring is advised, especially in patients with liver disease or those taking hepatotoxic drugs [^117BnDuN].

---

## Standard treatment duration

The **standard duration** is 12 weeks of oral terbinafine 250 mg once daily [^1158ekVa] for toenail onychomycosis [^114GBEnn]. The **clinical effect** continues to improve for months after therapy because nails grow slowly [^1158ekVa].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the 12-week regimen

Multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses show that a 12-week course achieves high mycological and clinical cure rates:

- **Mycological cure**: ~70% in RCTs [^115fPpcw].
- **Clinical cure**: ~38% in RCTs [^notfound].
- **Effective treatment**: ~59% (mycological cure plus ≥ 5 mm of clear nail growth) [^115fPpcw].

These outcomes are **superior to placebo** [^113UMTeu] and to many alternative antifungals [^115kNiXD].

---

## Circumstances requiring extended treatment

Extending therapy beyond 12 weeks may be considered in selected scenarios, though evidence is limited:

- **Severe involvement**: > 50% nail involvement or multiple nails.
- **Slow response**: Minimal improvement after 12 weeks.
- **Immunocompromised**: Patients with impaired immune function.

The British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) suggests that therapy can be extended to **16 weeks** in severe or refractory cases [^114oMws9].

---

## Risks and benefits of extended treatment

### Benefits

Potential benefits include **higher cure rates** in severe or refractory disease and sustained mycological clearance with improved clinical appearance.

---

### Risks

Potential risks include an **increased incidence of hepatotoxicity** with prolonged use and added expense and monitoring needs.

---

## Alternative dosing regimens

Alternative regimens, such as pulse dosing, have been studied but are generally **less effective** than continuous therapy [^111DaRFd]. Pulse terbinafine (e.g. 500 mg daily for 1 week monthly for 3 months) yields lower mycological and clinical cure rates than continuous 12-week therapy and is **not recommended as first-line treatment** [^1158mkjV].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Baseline and periodic **liver function tests** are recommended, especially in patients with liver disease or those taking hepatotoxic medications [^117BnDuN]. Clinical and mycological assessments at 12, 24, and 48 weeks help gauge response and detect recurrence [^113ydY2o].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended duration** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Standard toenail onychomycosis | 12 weeks | High |
| Severe or refractory cases | 16 weeks | Moderate |
| Immunocompromised patients | 16 weeks | Moderate |
| Pulse dosing | Not recommended | High |

---

The standard duration of oral terbinafine for toenail fungus is **12 weeks** [^1158ekVa], with extension to 16 weeks for severe or refractory cases [^115bLJ93]. Continuous therapy is superior to pulse regimens [^111DaRFd], and monitoring for hepatotoxicity is essential [^117QA1qW].

Background

Fungal infection of the toenails, also called onychomycosis, is a common problem that causes damage to the nail's structure and physical appearance. For those severely affected, it can interfere with normal daily activities. Treatment is taken orally or applied topically; however, traditionally topical treatments have low success rates due to the nail's physical properties. Oral treatments also appear to have shorter treatment times and better cure rates. Our review will assist those needing to make an evidence-based choice for treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral antifungal treatments for toenail onychomycosis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to October 2016: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We sought to identify unpublished and ongoing trials by correspondence with authors and by contacting relevant pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing oral antifungal treatment to placebo or another oral antifungal treatment in participants with toenail onychomycosis, confirmed by one or more positive cultures, direct microscopy of fungal elements, or histological examination of the nail.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 48 studies involving 10,200 participants. Half the studies took place in more than one centre and were conducted in outpatient dermatology settings. The participants mainly had subungual fungal infection of the toenails. Study duration ranged from 4 months to 2 years. We assessed one study as being at low risk of bias in all domains and 18 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain. The most common high-risk domain was 'blinding of personnel and participants'. We found high-quality evidence that terbinafine is more effective than placebo for achieving clinical cure (risk ratio (RR) 6.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.96 to 9.08, 8 studies, 1006 participants) and mycological cure (RR 4.53, 95% CI 2.47 to 8.33, 8 studies, 1006 participants). Adverse events amongst terbinafine-treated participants included gastrointestinal symptoms, infections, and headache, but there was probably no significant difference in their risk between the groups (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.47, 4 studies, 399 participants, moderate-quality evidence). There was high-quality evidence that azoles were more effective than placebo for achieving clinical cure (RR 22.18, 95% CI 12.63 to 38.95, 9 studies, 3440 participants) and mycological cure (RR 5.86, 95% CI 3.23 to 10.62, 9 studies, 3440 participants). There were slightly more adverse events in the azole group (the most common being headache, flu-like symptoms, and nausea), but the difference was probably not significant (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.12; 9 studies, 3441 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Terbinafine and azoles may lower the recurrence rate when compared, individually, to placebo (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.38, 1 study, 35 participants; RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.07, 1 study, 26 participants, respectively; both low-quality evidence). There is moderate-quality evidence that terbinafine was probably more effective than azoles for achieving clinical cure (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95, 15 studies, 2168 participants) and mycological cure (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.88, 17 studies, 2544 participants). There was probably no difference in the risk of adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.17; 9 studies, 1762 participants, moderate-quality evidence) between the two groups, and there may be no difference in recurrence rate (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.79, 5 studies, 282 participants, low-quality evidence). Common adverse events in both groups included headache, viral infection, and nausea. Moderate-quality evidence shows that azoles and griseofulvin probably had similar efficacy for achieving clinical cure (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.96, 5 studies, 222 participants) and mycological cure (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.51, 5 studies, 222 participants). However, the risk of adverse events was probably higher in the griseofulvin group (RR 2.41, 95% CI 1.56 to 3.73, 2 studies, 143 participants, moderate-quality evidence), with the most common being gastrointestinal disturbance and allergic reaction (in griseofulvin-treated participants) along with nausea and vomiting (in azole-treated participants). Very low-quality evidence means we are uncertain about this comparison's impact on recurrence rate (RR 4.00, 0.26 to 61.76, 1 study, 7 participants). There is low-quality evidence that terbinafine may be more effective than griseofulvin in terms of clinical cure (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.72, 4 studies, 270 participants) and mycological cure (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.90, 5 studies, 465 participants), and griseofulvin was associated with a higher risk of adverse events, although this was based on low-quality evidence (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.82, 2 studies, 100 participants). Common adverse events included headache and stomach problems (in griseofulvin-treated participants) as well as taste loss and nausea (in terbinafine-treated participants). No studies addressed recurrence rate for this comparison. No study addressed quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

We found high-quality evidence that compared to placebo, terbinafine and azoles are effective treatments for the mycological and clinical cure of onychomycosis, with moderate-quality evidence of excess harm. However, terbinafine probably leads to better cure rates than azoles with the same risk of adverse events (moderate-quality evidence). Azole and griseofulvin were shown to probably have a similar effect on cure, but more adverse events appeared to occur with the latter (moderate-quality evidence). Terbinafine may improve cure and be associated with fewer adverse effects when compared to griseofulvin (low-quality evidence). Only four comparisons assessed recurrence rate: low-quality evidence found that terbinafine or azoles may lower the recurrence rate when compared to placebo, but there may be no difference between them. Only a limited number of studies reported adverse events, and the severity of the events was not taken into account. Overall, the quality of the evidence varied widely from high to very low depending on the outcome and comparison. The main reasons to downgrade evidence were limitations in study design, such as unclear allocation concealment and randomisation as well as lack of blinding.

### Monotherapy for toenail onychomycosis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1158mkjV]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail caused by dermatophytes, yeasts and nondermatophyte moulds that accounts for approximately 50% of all nail-related disease.

Objectives

This study aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of monotherapy and combination treatments for toenail onychomycosis using a network meta-analysis (NMA).

Methods

Quality of evidence was assessed using Cochrane-compliant rules and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. Efficacy and safety outcomes were compared using a random-effects NMA to estimate pooled odds ratios (ORs) of direct and indirect comparisons among oral and topical treatments (PROSPERO 2015: CRD42018086912). There were not enough eligible combination and device-based therapy trials to include in the NMA.

Results

Of 77 randomized controlled trials, 26 were included in the ORs (8136 patients). There were no significant inconsistencies between the direct and indirect evidence. Relative effects show that the odds of mycological cure with continuous terbinafine 250 mg or continuous itraconazole 200 mg are significantly greater than topical treatments. Fluconazole, pulse regimens of terbinafine and itraconazole, and topical treatments did not differ significantly in the odds of achieving mycological cure. The ORs of adverse events occurring with oral or topical treatments were not significantly different from each other. For mycological cure, evidence was of moderate or high quality while evidence ranged from very low to high quality for adverse events.

Conclusions

Our review suggests that oral and topical treatments for toenail onychomycosis are safe and effective in producing mycological cure. What's already known about this topic? Topical treatments traditionally have lower success rates than oral treatments. Oral treatments have the advantage of shorter treatment durations, but also present challenges in cases of drug-drug interactions or immunosuppression. A network meta-analysis (NMA) gathers data from indirect evidence to gain confidence about all treatment comparisons and allows for estimation of comparative effects that have not been investigated in head-to-head randomized clinical trials (RCTs). What does this study add? This NMA of efficacy and safety includes all RCTs of oral, topical, combination and device-based treatments for toenail onychomycosis, adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement for NMA. The odds of achieving mycological cure with continuous terbinafine 250 mg or continuous itraconazole 200 mg were significantly greater than topical treatments. Fluconazole, pulse regimens of terbinafine and itraconazole, and topical treatments did not differ significantly in the odds of achieving mycological cure.

### Single-blind, randomized, prospective study on terbinafine and itraconazole for treatment of dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis in the elderly [^115bLJ93]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The 2 most common agents used to treat dermatophyte onychomycosis of the toe are terbinafine (continuous) and itraconazole (pulse). Although comparative studies have been performed evaluating the efficacy of these 2 agents in adults, no such studies have been reported specifically in the elderly subset.

Objective

This prospective, randomized, single-blind, non — industry-sponsored, comparative study evaluated the efficacy and safety of terbinafine (continuous) and itraconazole (pulse) therapies in the treatment of dermatophyte onychomycosis of the toe in the elderly population.

Methods

Elderly patients (≥ 60 years old) with dermatophyte onychomycosis of at least 1 great toe were randomly assigned to receive either terbinafine 250 mg/day for 12 weeks or itraconazole (pulse) 200 mg twice a day for 1 week, given for 3 pulses. At month 6 from the start of therapy, if there was less than 50% reduction in the affected nail plate area compared with baseline, or if there was less than 3 mm outgrowth of unaffected nail plate as measured in midline, then patients who had been administered terbinafine (continuous) therapy were given an extra 4 weeks of the drug (total of 16 weeks of therapy), and those who had received itraconazole (pulse) therapy were given an extra pulse (fourth pulse). Patients were evaluated at 1.5, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months from the start of therapy. The efficacy measures included mycologic cure rate and clinical efficacy (mycologic cure plus clinical cure or clinical improvement so that 10% or less of nail plate was clinically involved).

Results

There were 101 elderly patients enrolled in the study with 50 and 51 patients receiving terbinafine and itraconazole, respectively. The terbinafine group consisted of 28 men and 22 women, age (mean ± standard error [SE]) 68.0 ± 0.9 years, duration of onychomycosis (mean ± SE) 18.2 ± 1.4 years, number of nails involved (mean ± SE) 5.5 ± 0.5, and percent baseline nail plate area involved (mean ± SE) 67.5% ± 4.2%. The corresponding figures for the itraconazole (pulse) group were 24 men and 27 women, age (mean ± SE) 68.8 ± 0.8 years, duration of onychomycosis (mean ± SE) 16.1 ± 1.7 years, number of nails involved (mean ± SE) 6.0 ± 0.7, and percent baseline nail plate area involved (mean ± SE) 74.9% ± 3.8%, respectively, with no significant difference between the groups. At month 6, the number of patients that required an extra 4 weeks of terbinafine in the allylamine group or an extra itraconazole pulse in the triazole group was 13 of 50 and 23 of 51, respectively. The mycologic cure rate and clinical efficacy at 18 months from the start of therapy for the terbinafine group were 64.0% and 62.0%, respectively. The corresponding figures for the itraconazole (pulse) group were 62.7% and 60.8%, respectively, with no significant difference between the 2 groups. There were no dropouts during therapy. For both groups the drug appeared safe with no significant adverse events (AEs) or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities. All the AEs were mild and transient. There was high compliance with both regimens.

Conclusions

In the elderly, for the treatment of dermatophyte toe onychomycosis, both terbinafine (continuous) and itraconazole (pulse) therapies are effective, safe, and associated with high compliance.

### Pulse versus continuous terbinafine for onychomycosis: a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial [^111DaRFd]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Effective treatments for onychomycosis are expensive. Previous studies suggest that less costly, pulsed doses of antifungal medications may be as effective as standard, continuous doses. Terbinafine is the current treatment of choice for toenail onychomycosis.

Objective

Our purpose was to determine whether pulse-dose terbinafine is as effective as standard continuous-dose terbinafine for treatment of toenail onychomycosis.

Methods

We conducted a double-blind, randomized, noninferiority, clinical intervention trial in the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The main inclusion criteria for participants were a positive dermatophyte culture and at least 25% distal subungual clinical involvement. Six hundred eighteen volunteers were screened; 306 were randomized. Terbinafine, 250 mg daily for 3 months (continuous) or terbinafine, 500 mg daily for 1 week per month for 3 months (pulse) was administered. The primary outcome measure was mycological cure of the target toenail at 18 months. Secondary outcome measures included clinical cure and complete (clinical plus mycological) cure of the target toenail and complete cure of all 10 toenails.

Results

Results of an intent-to-treat analysis did not meet the prespecified criterion for noninferiority but did demonstrate the superiority of continuous-dose terbinafine for: mycological cure of the target toenail (70.9% [105/148] vs 58.7% [84/143]; p = 0.03, relative risk [RR] of 1.21 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02–1.43]); clinical cure of the target toenail (44.6% [66/148] vs 29.3% [42/143]; p = 0.007, RR = 1.52 [95% CI, 1.11–2.07); complete cure of the target toenail (40.5% [60/148] vs 28.0% [40/143]; p = 0.02, RR = 1.45 [95% CI, 1.04–2.01); and complete cure of all 10 toenails (25.2% [36/143] vs 14.7% [21/143]; p = 0.03, RR = 1.71 [95% CI, 1.05–2.79). Tolerability of the regimens did not differ significantly between the groups (chi2 = 1.63; p = 0.65).

Limitations

The study population primarily consisted of older men with severe onychomycosis.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated the superiority of continuous- over pulse-dose terbinafine. We also found this expensive therapy to be much less effective than previously believed, particularly for achieving complete cure of all 10 toenails.

### Therapeutic recommendations for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis in the US [^115MkSxK]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis affects around 14% of individuals in North America and Europe and is undertreated. Treatment is challenging as toenail growth can take 12&ndash;18 months, the nail plate may prevent drug penetration, and disease recurrence is common. National guidelines/consensus documents on onychomycosis diagnosis and treatment were last published more than 5 years ago and updated medical guidance is needed.

Methods

This document aims to provide recommendations for the diagnosis and pharmaceutical treatment of toenail onychomycosis following a roundtable discussion with a panel of dermatologists, podiatrists, and a microbiologist specializing in nail disease.

Results

There was a general consensus on several topics regarding onychomycosis diagnosis, confirmatory laboratory testing, and medications. Onychomycosis should be assessed clinically and confirmed with microscopy, histology, and/or culture. Terbinafine is the primary choice for oral treatment and efinaconazole 10% for topical treatment. Efinaconazole can also be considered for off-label use for maintenance to prevent recurrences. For optimal outcomes, patients should be counseled regarding treatment expectations as well as follow-up care and maintenance post-treatment.

Conclusions

This article provides important updates to previous guidelines/consensus documents to assist dermatologists and podiatrists in the diagnosis and treatment of toenail onychomycosis. J Drugs Dermatol. 2021;20(10):1076–1084. doi:10.36849/JDD.6291.

### A randomized, placebo-and active-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre, investigator-blinded study of four treatment regimens of posaconazole in adults with toenail onychomycosis [^111d6YZp]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis accounts for up to 50% of all onychopathies.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of four posaconazole regimens compared with placebo in the treatment of toenail onychomycosis, to assess the safety and tolerability of posaconazole, and to estimate the relative efficacy of posaconazole against terbinafine.

Methods

A phase 2B, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre, investigator-blinded (double blind for placebo) study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00491764). Onychomycosis patients aged 18–75years (n = 218) were randomized equally to one of six treatment regimens: posaconazole (oral suspension) 100, 200 or 400mg once daily (24weeks); posaconazole 400mg once daily (12weeks); terbinafine (tablets) 250mg once daily (12weeks); or placebo (24weeks). The primary efficacy variable was complete cure (negative mycology and 0% nail involvement) at week 48.

Results

All posaconazole treatment arms had a significantly (P ≤ 0.012) greater proportion of patients with complete cure at week 48 compared with placebo. The proportions of patients with complete cure were numerically higher for posaconazole 200mg/24weeks (54.1%) and 400mg/24weeks (45.5%), but lower for 400mg/12weeks (20%) compared with terbinafine (37%; differences were not statistically significant). Posaconazole was well tolerated. Seven patients receiving posaconazole withdrew because of asymptomatic liver enzyme increases, as mandated by protocol discontinuation criteria.

Conclusions

The efficacy and favourable safety profile of posaconazole suggest a potential new treatment for onychomycosis. The availability of low-cost generic terbinafine may limit posaconazole use to second-line treatment of infections refractory to, or patients intolerant of, terbinafine, or nondermatophyte mould infections.

Recently, treatment outcomes in patients with toenail onychomycosis have improved considerably due to more effective oral antifungal medications such as terbinafine and itraconazole. These medications can either be used continuously for several weeks at a lower dose or intermittently (pulsed) at a higher dose. Previous literature comparing pulse and continuous therapy has generated mixed results.&nbsp; Our study aims to compare the efficacy, in terms of clinical cure rate, of continuous vs pulse dose terbinafine regimens for toenail onychomycosis. Sixty patients with onychomycosis of Fitzpatrick skin types IV to VI, between 15 and 65 years of age, were divided into a continuous treatment group receiving 250 mg terbinafine once daily for 12 weeks and a pulse treatment group receiving 250 mg twice daily terbinafine for 1 week repeated every 4 weeks for 12 weeks. Each patient was followed up at weeks 4, 8, and 12.&nbsp; Efficacy of the continuous treatment group was significantly greater at 76.67% compared with 26.67% in the pulse treatment group. Thus, we conclude that the clinical cure rate of a continuous dose regimen of terbinafine is a superior treatment option for toenail onychomycosis. However, we also suggest further studies including combinations of multiple agents and hybrid regimen models for the optimal onychomycosis treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp; J Drugs Dermatol. 2023;22(10):&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; doi:10.36849/JDD.7323R1.

### Topical amorolfine for 15 months combined with 12 weeks of oral terbinafine, a cost-effective treatment for onychomycosis [^113BNeHc]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

This open randomized study examined the efficacy of a combination of oral terbinafine and topical amorolfine in the treatment of severe dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis with matrix area involvement.

Patients/Methods

A total of 147 patients were randomized to one of three treatment groups: 15 months of once-weekly topical amorolfine lacquer in combination with 6 weeks (Group AT6) or 12 weeks (Group AT12) of oral terbinafine, 250 mg once daily: or terbinafine monotherapy for 12 weeks (Group T12). Patients were followed for a total of 18 months. The primary efficacy variable was the result of mycological examination after 3 months of therapy; secondary efficacy variables were mycological and clinical examination at 3-monthly intervals, with an additional clinical evaluation at 18 months. Safety and tolerance were also assessed.

Results

Negative mycological results, assessed at 3 months, were recorded for 14 of 40 patients (35%) in Group AT6, 11 of 44 (27.5%) in Group AT12 and 7 of 41 (17.1%) in Group T12. At 18 months, the global response (mycological and clinical cure) was seen in 22 of 50 patients (44%), 34 of 47 (72.3% and 18 of 48 (37.5%) in the AT6, AT12 and T12 groups, respectively.

Conclusions

These results suggest that a combination therapy regime with oral and systemic treatment is superior in efficacy to monotherapy with a systemic drug alone in the treatment of severe onychomycosis. In addition, the cost per cure ratio was better in the combination groups.

### Cumulative meta-analysis of systemic antifungal agents for the treatment of onychomycosis [^1179TFEz]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is a common nail disease that is often chronic, difficult to eradicate, and has a tendency to recur. The most common oral therapies for dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis include terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole.

Objectives

A cumulative meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for antimycotic agents was performed to determine whether the pooled estimate of the cure rates has remained consistent over the years. Furthermore, for each agent we compared the overall meta-analytical average of both mycological and clinical response rates of RCTs vs. open studies.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE (1966 to November 2002) for relevant studies evaluating the efficacy of the oral antifungal agents terbinafine, itraconazole (pulse or continuous), fluconazole and griseofulvin for treating dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis. Studies included in this meta-analysis required a standard accepted dosage regimen, treatment duration and follow-up period. To determine the cumulative meta-analytical average, studies were sequentially pooled by adding one study at a time according to the date of publication (i.e. earliest to the most recent).

Results

There were 36 studies included in the analyses. For RCTs the change in efficacy of mycological cure rates from the first trial to the overall cumulative meta-average for each drug comparator is as follows (with 95% confidence interval): terbinafine, 78 ± 6% (n = 2 studies, 79 patients) to 76 ± 3% (n = 18 studies, 993 patients) (P = 0.68); itraconazole pulse, 75 ± 10% (n = 1 study, 20 patients) to 63 ± 7% (n = 6 studies, 318 patients) (P = 0.25); itraconazole continuous, 63 ± 5% (n = 1 study, 84 patients) to 59 ± 5% (n = 7 studies, 1131 patients) (P = 0.47); fluconazole, 53 ± 6% (n = 1 study, 72 patients) to 48 ± 5% (n = 3 studies, 131 patients) (P = 0.50); and griseofulvin, 55 ± 8% (n = 2 studies, 109 patients) to 60 ± 6% (n = 3 studies, 167 patients) (P = 0.41). The cumulative meta-analytical average of mycological cure rates when comparing RCTs vs. open studies was: terbinafine, 76 ± 3% (n = 18 studies, 993 patients) vs. 83 ± 12% (n = 2 studies, 391 patients) (P = 0.0028); itraconazole pulse, 63 ± 7% (n = 6 studies, 318 patients) vs. 84 ± 9% (n = 3 studies, 194 patients) (P = 0.0001); and fluconazole, 48 ± 5% (n = 3 studies, 131 patients) vs. 79 ± 3% (n = 3 studies, 208 patients) (P = 0.0001).

Conclusions

The cumulative meta-analysis of cure rates for RCTs suggests that over time, as new RCTs have been conducted, the efficacy rates have remained consistent. The efficacy rates of open studies are substantially higher compared with RCTs and may therefore overestimate cure rates.

### Oral medications to treat toenail fungal infection [^115kNiXD]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Which oral antifungal medication is associated with the highest clinical (ie, normal appearance of the toenail) and mycological (negative culture, microscopy, or both) cure rates vs placebo or other antifungals when used to treat fungal infections?

Bottom Line

Both terbinafine and azole-based medications were associated with higher clinical and mycological cure rates compared with placebo (high-quality evidence). Azoles were associated with lower cure rates than terbinafine when compared directly.

### Relative impact of traditional vs. newer oral antifungals for dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis: a network meta-analysis study [^111ewRAN]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

There is a paucity of evidence regarding the relative therapeutic efficacy of treatments for onychomycosis.

Objectives

We determined the relative efficacy of monotherapies for dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis with Bayesian network meta-analyses (NMAs).

Methods

We searched PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE (Ovid) and CINAHL to identify studies that investigated the efficacy of monotherapy with oral antifungals for dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis in adults. In this paper, 'regimen' corresponds to a given agent and its dosage. The relative effects and surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values of the various regimens were estimated; evidence quality was assessed at the study level and across networks.

Results

Data from 21 studies were used. Our two efficacy-related endpoints were: (i) mycological and (ii) complete cure at 1year; safety — related endpoints were: (i) 1-year count of any adverse event (AE), (ii) 1-year odds of discontinuation due to any AE, (iii) 1-year odds of discontinuation due to liver issues. Thirty-five regimens were identified; the newer agents among these included posaconazole and oteseconazole. We compared the efficacy of newer regimens with traditional ones like 'terbinafine 250mg daily for 12 weeks' and 'itraconazole 200mg daily for 12 weeks. We found that an agent's dosage was associated with its efficacy; for example, the 1-year odds of mycological cure with terbinafine 250mg daily for 24 weeks (SUCRA = 92.4%) were significantly greater than those of terbinafine 250mg daily for 12 weeks (SUCRA = 66.3%) (odds ratio 2.62, 95% credible interval 1.57–4.54). We also found that booster regimens can increase efficacy. Our results showed that some triazoles could be more effective than terbinafine.

Conclusions

This is the first NMA study of monotherapeutic antifungals - and their various dosages - for dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis. Our findings could provide guidance for the selection of the most appropriate antifungal agent, especially amid the growing concerns about terbinafine resistance.

### A multicentre, randomized, controlled study of the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of a combination therapy with amorolfine nail lacquer and oral terbinafine compared with oral terbinafine alone for the treatment of onychomycosis with matrix involvement [^115zhYmo]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is common, accounting for up to 50% of all nail disorders. Toenail onychomycosis can cause nail deformity, embarrassment, pain and walking difficulties. Some populations, such as individuals with diabetes, are at higher risk for developing secondary complications such as infections. Treatment takes many months and therapeutic choices can increase clinical effectiveness, lower toxicity and minimize healthcare costs.

Objectives

Based on the results of a previous pilot study, the objective of the present study was to show, in a larger population, the enhanced efficacy of a combination of amorolfine nail lacquer and oral terbinafine in the treatment of onychomycosis with matrix involvement. In addition, a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed.

Methods

In this multicentre, randomized, open-label, parallel group study, patients were randomized to receive either a combination of amorolfine hydrochloride 5% nail lacquer once weekly for 12 months plus terbinafine 250 mg once daily for 3 months (AT group) or terbinafine alone once daily for 3 months (T group). The study duration was 18 months including a 6-month treatment-free phase following the 12-month active treatment phase for the AT group and a 15-month treatment-free phase following the 3-month active treatment phase for the T group. The primary efficacy criterion was overall response, dichotomized into success or failure, success being the combination of clinical cure and negative mycology at month 18. This criterion was used as the effectiveness measure in the pharmacoeconomic analysis, conducted from a payer perspective.

Results

In total, 249 patients were included into the study: 120 in the AT group and 129 in the T group. A significantly higher success rate was observed for patients in the AT group relative to those in the T group at 18 months (59.2% vs. 45.0%; P = 0.03). Both treatment regimens were safe and well tolerated. Treatment cost per cured patient was lower for the combination than for terbinafine alone in all countries.

Conclusions

Study results confirmed that, in the treatment of dermatophytic toenail onychomycosis with matrix involvement, amorolfine nail lacquer in combination with oral terbinafine enhances clinical efficacy and is more cost-effective than terbinafine alone.

### Terbinafine (lamisil) treatment of toenail onychomycosis in patients with insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: a multicentre trial [^113SmEUL]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetes mellitus (DM) affects an estimated 175 million people world-wide. Approximately one-third of patients with DM have toenail onychomycosis.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of terbinafine treatment of toenail onychomycosis in patients with DM receiving insulin and/or oral antidiabetic agents. Special interest was focused on potential drug interactions with oral hypoglycaemic substances.

Methods

In a multicentre trial, patients suffering from insulin-dependent DM (IDDM) or non- insulin-dependent DM (NIDDM) with toenail onychomycosis were treated for 12 weeks with oral terbinafine 250 mg daily and followed up to 48 weeks. In addition to clinical, mycological and laboratory investigations, blood glucose levels were monitored.

Results

At the end of the trial (week 48), a mycological cure rate of 73% was achieved. The rates of clinical cure and complete cure (mycological cure plus clinical cure) were 57% and 48%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the NIDDM and IDDM groups with respect to the cure rates (P > 0.05). No hypoglycaemic episode was reported and none of the patients had hypoglycaemia during the treatment phase.

Conclusions

With excellent cure rates and a good tolerability profile, terbinafine should continue to be a drug of choice for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis in the rising number of NIDDM patients receiving multiple medication.

### Prediction of outcome in the treatment of onychomycosis [^114ne5EN]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Patients with toenail onychomycosis remain a therapeutic challenge despite the introduction of new systemic therapies. Around 20% of patients remain uncured even with optimal oral therapy, but the reasons for treatment failure are unclear. Thus far there are no data to suggest that treatment failures can be identified on the basis of their presenting features or progress during treatment. In a series of patients, we have attempted to identify clinical parameters that determine the patient response to 12 weeks of oral terbinafine for confirmed dermatophyte onychomycosis. As part of a dose-defining randomized multicentre study, 35 patients were followed for 48 weeks. The unaffected nail length, growth rate, hyperkeratosis, onycholysis and presence of a dermatophytoma were assessed prospectively. To confirm our findings, at the end of the study period we analysed retrospectively photographs that had been taken regularly throughout the trial. The average degree of hyperkeratosis was less severe in the group achieving a disease-free nail, meaning clinical and mycological cure. For mycological cure alone, no predictive factors could be identified.

### Toenail onychomycosis: current and future treatment options [^117TENkv]. Dermatologic Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common disease affecting as much as 8% of the general population. Treatment of onychomycosis is challenging, complicated by low cure rates and relatively high relapse rates. This paper reviews the efficacy of current oral, topical, and surgical treatment options. Currently, the treatment of choice for toenail onychomycosis is oral terbinafine because of its high efficacy, low relapse rates, and cost-effectiveness. Oral itraconazole or fluconazole could be considered for infections caused by Candida. Topical therapies may be a useful adjunct to these systemic therapies, but are less effective when used alone. More research is needed to determine the best measures for preventing reinfection.

### Single-blind, randomized, prospective study of sequential itraconazole and terbinafine pulse compared with terbinafine pulse for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis [^114iJMev]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Efficacy and safety of sequential pulse therapy with itraconazole and terbinafine were compared with pulse terbinafine alone in the treatment of toenail onychomycosis.

Methods

This was a 72-week prospective, single-blind, randomized, multicenter, comparative, parallel group, nonindustry-sponsored trial. A total of 190 patients were recruited from 3 outpatient dermatology offices in North America. Patients were at least 18 years old and had a clinical and mycologic diagnosis of dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis. Patients were randomly assigned to receive sequential pulse therapy (IIT) with 2 pulses of itraconazole followed by 1 or 2 pulses of terbinafine (itraconazole pulse is 200 mg twice daily for 1 week and terbinafine pulse is 250 mg twice daily for 1 week) versus 3 or 4 pulses of terbinafine (TTT). Main outcome measures at week 72 evaluated mycologic cure rate (negative light microscopy and culture), clinical cure (nail appears completely or totally normal), complete cure (clinical and mycologic cure), and effective therapy (mycologic cure and clinical response with at least 5 mm of new, uninvolved nail growth).

Results

At week 72, in the IIT versus TTT groups, the mycologic cure rate was 54 of 75 (72.0%) versus 44 of 90 (48.9%), clinical cure rate was 42 of 75 (56.0%) versus 35 of 90 (38.9%), effective therapy 49 of 75 (65.3%) versus 41 of 90 (45.6%), and complete cure 39 of 75 (52.0%) versus 29 of 90 (32.2%), respectively. Both regimens were well tolerated with no new adverse effects being identified. The rate of permanent discontinuation of therapy because of adverse effects was 2 of 81 (2.5%) with IIT and 2 of 95 (2.1%) with TTT. Each of the adverse effects normalized over time. The number of patients who reported an adverse effect in the 2 groups was 12 of 81 (14.8%) versus 22 of 95 (23.2%), respectively. All these adverse effects were reversible and mild to moderate in severity.

Conclusion

Sequential pulse therapy with itraconazole and terbinafine is effective and safe for the treatment of dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis.

### A phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, dose-ranging study to investigate the efficacy and safety of 4 dose regimens of oral albaconazole in patients with distal subungual onychomycosis [^115mByqm]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is effectively treated with terbinafine and itraconazole. However, frequent repeated dosing is required, and hepatic and cardiac adverse events may occur.

Objectives

Evaluate efficacy and safety of albaconazole, a novel triazole, for once-weekly treatment of distal subungual onychomycosis of the great toenail.

Methods

This double-blind, phase II study randomized 584 patients to receive albaconazole 100 to 400 mg or placebo weekly for 24 or 36 weeks. Effective treatment was measured as mycologic cure and clear or almost clear nail at week 52.

Results

All treatment groups achieved greater effective treatment rates (21%-54%) compared to placebo (1%; P < .001 for all groups) at week 52. Effective treatment was attained at week 24 in ≥ 5% of patients in most groups. Most adverse events were mild or moderate, and treatment-related adverse events were all ≤ 3%. No treatment-related hepatic or cardiac serious adverse events were observed.

Limitations

The follow-up period was likely too short to detect maximal efficacy; cure rates were increasing at study end. The efficacy and tolerability of albaconazole were not compared with other available treatments, and the global change in target toenail scale was subjective.

Conclusions

Albaconazole was well tolerated at all doses and resulted in high cure rates for onychomycosis.

### Assessing treatment outcomes in toenail onychomycosis clinical trials [^115XnbG5]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Several oral and topical medications are available for the treatment of onychomycosis, a widespread fungal infection of the nail. Since efficacy criteria vary greatly among clinical trials for onychomycosis treatment, it is difficult for physicians to compare outcomes and determine the appropriate therapy for a given patient. The present analysis evaluates the efficacy criteria used in intention-to-treat clinical trials of itraconazole, terbinafine, and 8% ciclopirox nail lacquer, drugs approved by the US FDA for the treatment of onychomycosis. Efficacy parameters often appear to use subjective assessment tools and may not include the actual size measurement of the affected target nail as an efficacy variable. Parameters, which assess both mycologic and clinical cure, are frequently omitted from clinical trials. Not surprisingly, clinical trials with stringent efficacy criteria, which assess both mycologic and clinical response/cure without use of subjective methods, appear to have the lowest rates for both therapeutic response and complete cure. Thus, an evaluation of treatment options for onychomycosis cannot solely compare success/failure rates in clinical trials, but requires a critical appraisal of the efficacy criteria utilized in those trials.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of terbinafine tablets in the treatment of onychomycosis is illustrated by the response of subjects with toenail and/or fingernail infections who participated in 3 US/Canadian placebo-controlled clinical trials.

Results of the first toenail trial, as assessed at week 48 (12 weeks of treatment with 36 weeks follow-up after completion of therapy), demonstrated mycological cure, defined as simultaneous occurrence of negative KOH plus negative culture, in 70% of subjects. Fifty-nine percent (59%) of subjects experienced effective treatment (mycological cure plus 0% nail involvement or greater than 5mm of new unaffected nail growth); 38% of subjects demonstrated mycological cure plus clinical cure (0% nail involvement).

In a second toenail trial of dermatophytic onychomycosis, in which nondermatophytes were also cultured, similar efficacy against the dermatophytes was demonstrated. The pathogenic role of the nondermatophytes cultured in the presence of dermatophytic onychomycosis has not been established. The clinical significance of this association is unknown.

Results of the fingernail trial, as assessed at week 24 (6 weeks of treatment with 18 weeks follow-up after completion of therapy), demonstrated mycological cure in 79% of subjects, effective treatment in 75% of the subjects, and mycological cure plus clinical cure in 59% of the subjects.

The mean time to overall success was approximately 10 months for the first toenail trial and 4 months for the fingernail trial. In the first toenail trial, for subjects evaluated at least 6 months after achieving clinical cure and at least 1 year after completing therapy with terbinafine tablets, the clinical relapse rate was approximately 15%.

### Fungal toenail infections [^112Wkie1]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fungal infections are reported to cause 23% of foot diseases and 50% of nail conditions in people seen by dermatologists, but are less common in the general population, affecting 3–5% of people.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of oral treatments for fungal toenail infections? What are the effects of topical treatments for fungal toenail infections? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 11 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: amorolfine, butenafine, ciclopirox, fluconazole, griseofulvin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, mechanical debridement, terbinafine, and tioconazole.

To evaluate the efficacy of fluconazole for the treatment of onychomycosis.

Data Sources

Searches of MEDLINE (1966-May 2009) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-May 2009) were performed. Key search terms included fluconazole and onychomycosis. In addition, reference citations from identified publications were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All articles in English identified from the data sources were evaluated. All studies evaluating oral fluconazole for the treatment of onychomycosis were included in the review.

Data Synthesis

Seven studies evaluating fluconazole treatment for onychomycosis were identified. One study used daily dosing and the rest used once-weekly dosing. Treatment doses ranged from 100 mg to 450 mg weekly and 150 mg daily, and durations ranged from 12 weeks to 12 months. Most of the studies evaluated the efficacy of fluconazole in patients with toenail onychomycosis due to dermatophyte infection. Fluconazole was superior to placebo, with mycologic eradication rates ranging from 36% to 100% in placebo-controlled studies. In one of the comparative studies, the mycologic cure rate was lower with fluconazole (31.2%) compared with terbinafine (75%) and itraconazole (61.1%). Common adverse events reported with fluconazole use were headache, gastrointestinal pain, and diarrhea.

Conclusions

Fluconazole is less effective than terbinafine and itraconazole in the treatment of onychomycosis. However, fluconazole may be preferred in patients unable to tolerate other oral antifungal agents due to the dosing regimen, adverse effect profile, and drug interactions.

### Ciclopirox topical solution, 8% combined with oral terbinafine to treat onychomycosis: a randomized, evaluator-blinded study [^113A8xmL]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

This randomized, evaluator-blind, 3-arm parallel, comparator controlled, multicenter pilot study evaluated the safety and efficacy of ciclopirox nail lacquer topical solution, 8% in combination with oral terbinafine for the treatment of moderate to severe toenail onychomycosis (≥ 60% disease involvement of target nail and/or lunula/matrix involvement) (N = 73). Patients were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms: ciclopirox nail lacquer once daily for 48 weeks plus 4 weeks of terbinafine 250 mg/day, followed by 4 weeks of rest (no terbinafine), then another 4 weeks of terbinafine 250 mg/day (PLs); ciclopirox nail lacquer once daily for 48 weeks plus terbinafine 250 mg/day for 12 weeks (PL12); or terbinafine 250 mg/day for 12 weeks (L12). At week 48, mycological cure (negative microscopy and culture) occurred in 66.7% (14/21) (PL8), 70.4% (19/27) (PL12), and 56.0% (14/25) (L12) of patients confirmed dermatophyte positive, respectively (P: not significant). At this time point, effective cure (simultaneous mycological cure and ≥ 90% reduction in the disease area) was observed in 40.0% (8/20), 33.3% (8/24), and 34.8% (8/23) of patients, respectively (P: not significant). The PLs regimen was well-tolerated and had high compliance. The data suggest that combination therapy (PL8) may be an alternative regimen to continuous terbinafine (L12) in the treatment of moderate to severe dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis.

### Long-term efficacy of antifungals in toenail onychomycosis: a critical review [^115GiqJA]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Modern antifungal drugs achieve high mycological and clinical cure rates in onychomycosis of the toes, but little is known about the long-term evolution of the treated patients.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to analyse the therapeutic results recorded more than 1 year after initiation of therapy.

Methods

We used two endpoints for the analysis: EP1 (the number of patients with negative mycology after follow-up, divided by the number of patients included at day 0, including all patients lost to follow-up), and EP2 (the number of patients with negative mycology after follow-up divided by the number of patients with negative mycology at week 48). Clinical cure rate (EPclin) was the number of patients clinically cured or with minimal residual lesions divided by the number of patients included at day 0.

Results

From a Medline search we identified 17 studies providing results beyond 48 weeks. Ketoconazole 200 mg d(-1) up to 1 year resulted in EP1 of 11% at 18 months, and EP2 of 43%. Griseofulvin 1 g d(-1) for 1 year allowed an EP1 of 43% at 18 months, and EP2 of 71%. The mean EP1 after fluconazole once weekly up to 1 year was 49% at 18 months, and EP2 was 91%. With itraconazole 200 mg d(-1) or 400 mg d(-1) for 1 week each month for 3–4 months, EP1 was 37% at 18 months, and 53% at 2 years; EP2 was 76% at 4 years. Terbinafine 250 mg d(-1) for 12–16 weeks achieved an EP1 of 62% at 18 months, 72% at 2 years, and 60% at 4 years; EP2 was 80% at 18 months, 81% at 2 years, and 71% at 4 years. In the only study planned to compare the long-term efficacy of terbinafine and itraconazole, EP1 at 18 months was significantly higher with continuous terbinafine than with intermittent itraconazole (66% vs. 37%, P < 0.001). The clinical cure rates were 21% at 60 weeks and 37% at 72 weeks with fluconazole. EPclin was 27% at 18 months and 35% at 2 years with itraconazole. EPclin was 48% at 18 months, 69% at 2 years and 50% at 4 years with terbinafine.

Conclusions

Considering the stringency of the criteria we used, this critical review suggests that the long-term efficacy achieved with terbinafine is superior to that obtained with griseofulvin, ketoconazole, fluconazole or itraconazole.

### Fungal toenail infections [^111fLAGQ]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fungal infections are reported to cause 23% of foot diseases and 50% of nail conditions in people seen by dermatologists, but are less common in the general population, affecting 3% to 12% of people.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of oral treatments for fungal toenail infections in adults? What are the effects of topical treatments for fungal toenail infections in adults? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 13 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: amorolfine, butenafine, ciclopirox, fluconazole, itraconazole, terbinafine, tioconazole, and topical ketoconazole.

### Onychomycosis. treatment, quality of life, and economic issues [^113Hpz9N]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a public health concern because of its high worldwide incidence and prevalence, and its potential for spread of fungal elements to others, as well as complications such as cellulitis, bacterial infection, pain, and extensive dermatophytic infections. The incidence of onychomycosis has been increasing, particularly in individuals over 60 years of age, patients with HIV infection, and patients with diabetes mellitus. Onychomycosis may impact upon physical, functional, psychosocial, and emotional aspects of life. Difficulty walking, wearing shoes, and embarrassment are common complaints. Quantification of such quality-of-life changes are significant to clinical practice in that many factors can affect overall patient health. In light of the potential clinical implications on physical and mental health, onychomycosis should be considered a medical condition that deserves rigorous clinical management. Onychomycosis can be treated effectively and with comparative safety with the new generation of oral antifungal agents (itraconazole, fluconazole and terbinafine). Significantly improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles permit markedly reduced duration of administration, individual drug exposure, and ultimately enhanced patient compliance and satisfaction with therapy. In addition, a number of pharmacoeconomic studies have documented the cost effectiveness of these newer agents compared with both traditional pharmacologic treatment and topical therapies. The currency figures quoted are 1997 values. With regard to continuous oral antifungal regimens, terbinafine therapy has been found to be most cost effective in the treatment of toenail onychomycosis, with a drug acquisition cost of $US522.50. However, improved safety, tolerability, efficacy and cost effectiveness have been documented with itraconazole intermittent, pulse regimens. With itraconazole pulse therapy, the drug acquisition cost decreases to $US488.90. Additionally, the total cost of medical management is less for itraconazole therapy compared with that of terbinafine ($US261.00 vs $US306.00). Because sensitivity analyses for itraconazole and terbinafine have been found to be somewhat comparable in terms of mycological cure, clinical response, and relapse rates, other variables such as safety and efficacy profiles, and patient attitudes and expectations toward therapy need to be considered when formulating an onychomycosis pharmacologic treatment plan. The drug aquisition cost of fluconazole given as a 300 mg dose once weekly for 6 months is $US562.76 and given as a 150 mg dose once weekly (for 6 months) $US281.38.

### Terbinafine: a review of its use in onychomycosis in adults [^114NKca6]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Terbinafine, an orally and topically active antimycotic agent, inhibits the biosynthesis of the principal sterol in fungi, ergosterol, at the level of squalene epoxidase. Squalene epoxidase inhibition results in ergosterol-depleted fungal cell membranes (fungistatic effect) and the toxic accumulation of intracellular squalene (fungicidal effect). Terbinafine has demonstrated excellent fungicidal activity against the dermatophytes and variable activity against yeasts and non-dermatophyte molds in vitro. Following oral administration, terbinafine is rapidly absorbed and widely distributed to body tissues including the poorly perfused nail matrix. Nail terbinafine concentrations are detected within 1 week after starting therapy and persist for at least 30 weeks after the completion of treatment. Randomized, double-blind trials showed oral terbinafine 250 mg/day for 12 or 16 weeks was more efficacious than itraconazole, fluconazole and griseofulvin in dermatophyte onychomycosis of the toenails. In particular, at 72 weeks' follow-up, the multicenter, multinational, L. I.ON. (Lamisil vs Itraconazole in ONychomycosis) study found that mycologic cure rates (76 vs 38% of patients after 12 weeks' treatment; 81 vs 49% of recipients after 16 weeks' therapy) and complete cure rates were approximately twice as high after terbinafine treatment than after itraconazole (3 or 4 cycles of 400 mg/day for 1 week repeated every 4 weeks) in patients with toenail mycosis. Furthermore, the L. I.ON. Icelandic Extension study demonstrated that terbinafine was more clinically effective than intermittent itraconazole to a statistically significant extent at 5-year follow-up. Terbinafine produced a superior complete cure rate (35 vs 14%), mycologic cure rate (46 vs 13%) and clinical cure rate (42 vs 18%) to that of itraconazole. The mycologic and clinical relapse rates were 23% and 21% in the terbinafine group, respectively, compared with 53% and 48% in the itraconazole group. In comparative clinical trials, oral terbinafine had a better tolerability profile than griseofulvin and a comparable profile to that of itraconazole or fluconazole. Post marketing surveillance confirmed terbinafine's good tolerability profile. Adverse events were experienced by 10.5% of terbinafine recipients, with gastrointestinal complaints being the most common. Unlike the azoles, terbinafine has a low potential for drug-drug interactions. Most pharmacoeconomic evaluations have shown that the greater clinical effectiveness of oral terbinafine in dermatophyte onychomycosis translates into a cost-effectiveness ratio superior to that of itraconazole, fluconazole and griseofulvin.

Conclusion

Oral terbinafine has demonstrated greater effectiveness than itraconazole, fluconazole and griseofulvin in randomized trials involving patients with onychomycosis caused by dermatophytes. The drug is generally well tolerated and has a low potential for drug interactions. Therefore, terbinafine is the treatment of choice for dermatophyte onychomycosis.

### Terbinafine hydrochloride (terbinafine) [^115Yc3tc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

How should I take terbinafine tablets?

Take terbinafine tablets exactly as your doctor tells you to take them.
Terbinafine hydrochloride comes as a tablet that you take by mouth.
Terbinafine tablets are usually taken:
1 time each day for 6 weeks to treat fungal infections of your fingernail, or
1 time each day for 12 weeks to treat fungal infections of your toenail
Terbinafine tablets can be taken with or without food.
If you miss a dose of terbinafine tablets, take it as soon as you remember. If it is less than 4 hours before your next dose, skip the missed dose. Just take the next dose at your regular time.

If you take too many terbinafine tablets, call your doctor. You may have the following symptoms:

nausea
vomiting
stomach-area (abdomen) pain
dizziness
rash
frequent urination
headache

What should I avoid while taking terbinafine tablets?

Avoid sunlight. Terbinafine tablets can make your skin sensitive to the sun and the light from sunlamps and tanning beds. You can get a severe sunburn. Use sunscreen and wear a hat and clothes that cover your skin if you have to be in sunlight. Talk to your doctor if you get sunburn.

### The efficacy and safety of terbinafine in children [^114RDses]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

In summary, terbinafine is a broad-spectrum allylamine, which has been used to treat superficial fungal infections including onychomycosis, and some systemic mycoses in adults. With a fungicidal activity, low minimum inhibitory concentration value, and high selectivity for fungal squalene epoxidase, terbinafine has demonstrated good efficacy in superficial fungal infections. Its lipophilic nature provides excellent, widespread absorption into hair, skin, and nails where it can eradicate fungal infection. Terbinafine has been shown to be effective and safe in several studies of the treatment of tinea capitis and onychomycosis in children. When treating Trichophyton tinea capitis the length of therapy may be 2 or 4 weeks. Microsporum tinea capitis may require somewhat higher or longer doses of terbinafine for adequate efficacy. These regimens still tend to be shorter than treatment with griseofulvin, and terbinafine may provide a higher compliance and a more cost-effective means of managing tinea capitis. It is possible that even higher cure rates and a shorter duration of therapy may be achieved following further optimization of treatment regimens that use a higher daily dosage of terbinafine than is currently recommended. The evidence is strongly in favor of using terbinafine to treat superficial fungal infections in children.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

[See FDA-Approved Patient Labeling (Patient Information)]

Patients taking terbinafine tablets should receive the following information and instructions:

Patients should take one 250 mg tablet once daily for 6 weeks for treatment of fingernail onychomycosis or once daily for 12 weeks for treatment of toenail onychomycosis. The optimal clinical effect is seen some months after mycological cure and cessation of treatment due to the time period required for outgrowth of healthy nail.

Patients should be advised to report to their physician any signs of taste disturbance, smell disturbance and/or depressive symptoms. Terbinafine tablets treatment should be discontinued.
Patients should be advised to immediately report to their physician or get emergency help if they experience any of the following symptoms: hives, mouth sores, blistering and peeling of skin, swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty swallowing or breathing. Terbinafine tablets treatment should be discontinued.
Patients should be advised to report to their physician any symptoms of new onset or worsening lupus erythematosus. Symptoms can include erythema, scaling, loss of pigment, and unusual photosensitivity that can result in a rash. Terbinafine treatment should be discontinued.
Photosensitivity reactions have been reported with the use of terbinafine tablets. Patients should be advised to minimize exposure to natural and artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using terbinafine tablets.
Measurement of serum transaminases (ALT and AST) is advised for all patients before taking terbinafine tablets.
Patients should be advised that if they forget to take terbinafine tablets, to take their tablets as soon as they remember, unless it is less than four hours before the next dose is due. Patients should also be advised that if they take too many terbinafine tablets they should call their physician.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of terbinafine hydrochloride tablets in the treatment of onychomycosis is illustrated by the response of patients with toenail and/or fingernail infections who participated in three US/Canadian placebo-controlled clinical trials.

Results of the first toenail study, as assessed at week 48 (12 weeks of treatment with 36 weeks followup after completion of therapy), demonstrated mycological cure, defined as simultaneous occurrence of negative KOH plus negative culture, in 70% of patients. Fifty-nine percent (59%) of patients experienced effective treatment (mycological cure plus 0% nail involvement or > 5mm of new unaffected nail growth); 38% of patients demonstrated mycological cure plus clinical cure (0% nail involvement).

In a second toenail study of dermatophytic onychomycosis, in which non-dermatophytes were also cultured, similar efficacy against the dermatophytes was demonstrated. The pathogenic role of the non-dermatophytes cultured in the presence of dermatophytic onychomycosis has not been established. The clinical significance of this association is unknown.

Results of the fingernail study, as assessed at week 24 (6 weeks of treatment with 18 weeks follow-up after completion of therapy), demonstrated mycological cure in 79% of patients, effective treatment in 75% of the patients, and mycological cure plus clinical cure in 59% of the patients.

The mean time to overall success was approximately 10 months for the first toenail study and 4 months for the fingernail study. In the first toenail study, for patients evaluated at least six months after achieving clinical cure and at least one year after completingterbinafine hydrochloride therapy, the clinical relapse rate was approximately 15%.

### British Association of Dermatologists' guidelines for the management of onychomycosis 2014 [^117BnDuN]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for onychomycosis, more specifically with respect to systemic antifungals, BAD 2014 guidelines recommend to consider offering fluconazole (150–450 mg/week for 3 months in fingernail infection and at least 6 months in toenail infection) as an alternative in patients unable to tolerate terbinafine or itraconazole. Obtain baseline LFTs and a CBC. Monitor LFTs in high-dose or prolonged therapy and in patients at risk because of concomitant hepatotoxic drug use.

### Reliability of self-reported willingness-to-pay and annual income in patients treated for toenail onychomycosis [^114MMR7S]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Willingness-to-pay (WTP) is a health economics measure that has recently been used for skin diseases to evaluate patients' quality of life. However, the reliability of this measure has not been investigated in the dermatology literature and is essential in validating its use in health services research.

Objectives

This study evaluated the test-retest reliability of self-reported annual income and WTP, a health economics measure of disease impact, in patients with toenail onychomycosis.

Methods

Forty-six patients enrolled in a randomized clinical trial comparing two different dosing regimens of terbinafine completed a self-administered questionnaire at baseline and 1 month later. The questionnaire asked: (i) how much patients would be willing to pay for a theoretical treatment with a cure rate of 85% for their current onychomycosis (10 categories: $0–50, $51–100, to > $800); and (ii) annual income (10 categories: $0–10,000 to > $200,000).

Results

Forty-four patients reported WTP at both visits, and 55% reported the same WTP. The quadratic-weighted (Fleiss-Cohen) kappa statistic indicated moderate agreement (kappa = 0.50, 95% confidence interval, CI 0.24–0.75, P < 0.01) as did the Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient (r(s) = 0.57, P < 0.01; median difference = 0, P = 0.50). Strong agreement was shown among the 42 patients who reported income at both visits; 71% reported the same annual income category (kappa = 0.72, 95% CI 0.47–0.96, P < 0.01; r(s) = 0.68, P < 0.01; median difference = 0, P = 0.77). Age, disease severity and duration, previous therapy, self-reported annual income, and medication side-effects were not statistically associated with the reliability of WTP.

Conclusions

WTP and annual income demonstrated moderate and strong test-retest reliability, respectively. Self-reported WTP can serve as a reliable measure for future health economics research on onychomycosis.

### Clinical insights about onychomycosis and its treatment: a consensus [^113z5Tm2]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Recently, experience and knowledge have been gained using effective topical treatment for onychomycosis, a difficult-to-treat infection.

Methods

This project aims to help understand and improve patient-focused quality of care for fungal nail infections. A panel of dermatologists who treat onychomycosis convened on several occasions to review and discuss recent learnings in the treatment of onychomycosis. The panel developed and conducted a survey on diagnosis, treatment and prevention, discussed the results, and provided recommendations.

Results

The survey was sent out digitally to the Canadian Dermatology community. Ninety-two dermatologists completed the questionnaires, which were included in the analysis. The survey respondents and panel members agreed that the diagnosis of toe onychomycosis should be confirmed with a positive microscopic examination for fungus or a positive mycological culture when oral therapy and/or topical treatment is prescribed, except when it is not clinically feasible, in which case topical therapy could be started based on clinical presentation. The panel and survey respondents also agreed that treatment is to be based on percentage of nail involvement: less than 20% = topical efinaconazole; 20%-60% = topical efinaconazole ± oral terbinafine (for greater than 3 nails); greater than 60% = oral terbinafine ± topical therapy.

Conclusions

The current treatment paradigm for onychomycosis may have shifted from mainly oral antifungals to topical treatment, improving patient-focused quality of care.

### Onychomycosis: rapid evidence review [^112YLKrj]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the fingernail or toenail bed leading to brittle, discolored, and thickened nails. Onychomycosis is not just a cosmetic problem. Untreated onychomycosis can cause pain, discomfort, and physical impairment, negatively impacting quality of life. Onychomycosis should be suspected in patients with discolored nails, nail plate thickening, nail separation, and foul-smelling nails. Accurate diagnosis is important before initiating treatment because therapy is lengthy and can cause adverse effects. A potassium hydroxide preparation with confirmatory fungal culture, periodic acid-Schiff stain, or polymerase chain reaction is the preferred diagnostic approach if confirmative testing is cost prohibitive or not available. Treatment decisions should be based on severity, comorbidities, and patient preference. Oral terbinafine is preferred over topical therapy because of better effectiveness and shorter treatment duration. Patients taking terbinafine in combination with tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, atypical antipsychotics, beta blockers, or tamoxifen should be monitored for drug-drug interactions. Topical therapy, including ciclopirox 8%, efinaconazole 10%, and tavaborole 5%, is less effective than oral agents but can be used to treat mild to moderate onychomycosis, with fewer adverse effects and drug-drug interactions. Nail trimming and debridement used concurrently with pharmacologic therapy improve treatment response. Although photodynamic and plasma therapies are newer treatment options that have been explored for the treatment of onychomycosis, larger randomized trials are needed. Preventive measures such as avoiding walking barefoot in public places and disinfecting shoes and socks are thought to reduce the 25% relapse rate.

### Terbinafine in fungal infections of the nails: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^114mrBdS]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Historically, there has been a general resistance to treating onychomycosis on the basis that such treatments were protracted and of uncertain outcome. However, modern treatments act more promptly and reliably.

Objectives

To carry out a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of terbinafine in comparison with placebo, itraconazole and griseofulvin.

Methods

The analysis used data from published trials, supplemented where necessary by reference to the original trial reports.

Results

Three trials were included in which terbinafine was compared with placebo. From four trials comparing terbinafine with itraconazole, a statistically significant advantage in favour of terbinafine was observed for negative culture and microscopy at the end of the trials. Furthermore, both patients and physicians reported terbinafine to be better tolerated than itraconazole. From two trials comparing terbinafine with griseofulvin, a significantly higher rate of negative microscopy and culture was observed with terbinafine.

Conclusions

A significant advantage in favour of treatment with terbinafine was observed.

Background

Previously, a double-blind, randomized, multicentre study (LION study) compared the efficacy of continuous terbinafine 250 mg daily for 3 or 4 months with itraconazole pulse therapy 400 mg daily for 3 or 4 months. At the end of the study at week 72 terbinafine proved to be more effective.

Objectives

To perform a 4-year follow-up of the Finnish participants in this study.

Methods

Patients were re-examined clinically and mycologically.

Results

Complete clinical and mycological cure with terbinafine for 4 months was 78% compared with 35% with terbinafine for 3 months, 24% with itraconazole for 4 months and 28% with itraconazole for 3 months.

Conclusions

These results suggest that the initial treatment for onychomycosis should be a 4-month continuous course of terbinafine.

We sought to determine the prevalence of long-term recurrences of toenail onychomycosis caused by dermatophytes cured after systemic antifungal treatment with terbinafine (T) or itraconazole (I) and identify risk factors for recurrences.

Methods

This 7-year prospective study, started in 2000 and ended in 2007, included 73 patients periodically followed after successful treatment of toenail onychomycosis using either T, 250 mg daily (59 patients), or I, 400 mg daily, for 1 week per month (14 patients). Patients were evaluated every 6 months, with clinical and mycological evaluations being performed.

Results

Twelve of 73 patients (16.4%) developed a recurrence of onychomycosis a mean time of 36 months after successful treatment. These included 5 of the 14 patients (35.7%) who had taken I and 7 of the 59 (11.9%) who had taken T (P = 0.046).

Limitations

The number of patients treated with T (59 patients) was more than that for I (14 patients).

Conclusion

The administration of systemic T to treat the first episode of onychomycosis may provide better long-term success than I in those patients with a complete response. Other factors including the presence of predisposing factors, use of nail lacquer as a prophylactic treatment, and the dermatophyte strain isolated were not significantly related to relapse.

### Efficacy of topical resin lacquer, amorolfine and oral terbinafine for treating toenail onychomycosis: a prospective, randomized, controlled, investigator-blinded, parallel-group clinical trial [^113iv1Nj]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Norway spruce (Picea abies) produces resin to protect against decomposition by microbial pathogens. In vitro tests have shown that spruce resin has antifungal properties against dermatophytes known to cause nearly 90% of onychomycosis in humans.

Objectives

To confirm previous in vivo observations that a topical resin lacquer provides mycological and clinical efficacy, and to compare this lacquer with topical amorolfine hydrochloride lacquer and systemic terbinafine for treating dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis.

Methods

In this prospective, randomized, controlled, investigator-blinded study, 73 patients with onychomycosis were randomized to receive topical 30% resin lacquer once daily for 9 months, topical 5% amorolfine lacquer once weekly for 9 months, or 250 mg oral terbinafine once daily for 3 months. The primary outcome measure was complete mycological cure at 10 months. Secondary outcomes were clinical efficacy, cost-effectiveness and patient compliance.

Results

At 10 months, complete mycological cure rates with the resin, amorolfine and terbinafine treatments were 13% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0–28], 8% (95% CI 0–19) and 56% (95% CI 35–77), respectively (P ≤ 0.002). At 10 months, clinical responses were complete in four patients (16%) treated with terbinafine, and partial in seven (30%), seven (28%) and nine (36%) patients treated with resin, amorolfine and terbinafine, respectively (P < 0.05). Resin, amorolfine and terbinafine treatments cost €41.6, €56.3 and €52.1, respectively, per patient (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Topical 30% resin lacquer and topical 5% amorolfine lacquer provided similar efficacy for treating dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis. However, orally administered terbinafine was significantly more effective in terms of mycological cure and clinical outcome than either topical therapy at the 10-month follow-up.

3 RESULTS

During terbinafine monotherapy, the percentage involvement decreased from 53.5 ± 30.8% to 44.0 ± 25.4% after 37.4 ± 15.5 weeks and the effective (i.e. the percentage of those rated as "improved", "markedly improved", and "cured") and cure rates were 16.7% (2/12) and 0% (0/12), respectively. The improvement rate per month was 2.1% ± 3.5%. After terbinafine therapy, all 12 patients showed a positive KOH test result. During the combination therapy with topical efinaconazole, the percentage involvement decreased from 44.0 ± 25.4% to 18.7 ± 18.2% after 28.4 ± 17.8 weeks and the effective and cure rates were 66.7% (8/12) and 16.7% (2/12), respectively. Thus, the combination therapy was more effective than the monotherapy (Figure 1). The improvement rate per month was 12.6% ± 8.3%.

### Topical efinaconazole: a sequential combination therapy with oral terbinafine for refractory tinea unguium [^113J1QsQ]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

This retrospective, single‐center, case series study was approved by the research ethics committee of Noguchi Dermatology Clinic (approval no. 24).

Patients with tinea unguium diagnosed by direct microscopy were treated with oral terbinafine (125 mg daily) for at least 20 weeks. After excluding the patients with a high efficacy rate (> 70%), efinaconazole 10% solution was commenced within 1 month. Among all outpatients with onychomycosis between August 2015 and December 2020, 38 were treated with topical efinaconazole as sequential combination therapy. After excluding 15 patients who never visited and 11 patients whose records were lacking imaging data from after the application of efinaconazole, 12 patients (male, n = 6; female, n = 6; mean age ± standard deviation, 65.4 ± 14.7 years) were analyzed. Of note, one limitation of this retrospective study is that the high dropout rate may have caused a selection bias.

For each patient, one of the big toenails was selected as the target nail. The clinical picture of the target nail was evaluated at every visit, and the percentage involvement (affected nail area relative to the entire nail area) was calculated using the image analysis software program Image J 1.44p (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).

The therapeutic regimen comprised oral terbinafine monotherapy and subsequent consolidation with efinaconazole. Because the therapeutic concentration of terbinafine in the nails lasts for at least 30 weeks after the completion of treatment, the sequential topical efinaconazole application was considered combination therapy.

Treatment progress (efficacy) was rated on a 5‐point scale as cured, markedly improved, improved, slightly improved, or no change based on the following definitions: (i) "cured" was the complete replacement of the affected nail with a healthy nail; (ii) "markedly improved" was the replacement of the affected nail with more than 70% healthy nail; (iii) "improved" was the replacement of the affected nail with 40–70% healthy nail; (iv) "slightly improved" was the replacement of the affected nail with less than 40% healthy nail; and (v) "no change" was no change or an increase in the affected nail area.

A paired t ‐test was used to compare the improvement rate (i.e. decrease in the percentage involvement) between groups.

### Efficacy and safety of topical terbinafine 10% solution (MOB-015) in the treatment of mild to moderate distal subungual onychomycosis: a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 3 study [^113seVHq]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is a recalcitrant fungal nail infection. Topical antifungal agents may be preferred over systemic agents due to lack of systemic adverse effects.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy and safety of topical terbinafine 10% solution (MOB-015) for the treatment of distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis.

Methods

In a multicenter, double-blind, phase III, North American study, patients with mild to moderate distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis involving 20% to 60% of at least 1 great toenail were randomized to once daily application of MOB-015 or matching vehicle for 48 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was complete cure, while the secondary efficacy variables were mycological cure and treatment success. Safety evaluations were also performed.

Results

At week 52, the mycological cure (negative culture and potassium hydroxide microscopy) rate in the MOB-015 and vehicle groups was 69.9% and 27.7%, respectively (P < .001), and complete cure (0% clinical disease involvement and mycological cure) was achieved in 4.5% and 0% of patients, respectively (P = 0.0195). At least 1 adverse event leading to discontinuation of treatment occurred in 2.8% of patients in the MOB-015 group and in 4.2% in the vehicle group.

Limitation

The follow-up period after end of treatment may not be sufficient to accurately reflect cure in distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis.

Conclusions

MOB-015 is a treatment option for onychomycosis with an adverse event profile similar to vehicle.

### Oral terbinafine-induced bullous pemphigoid [^113oiKJ2]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of drug-induced bullous pemphigoid (BP) in an otherwise healthy elderly patient after taking terbinafine for 20 days.

Case Summary

A 78-year-old man presented with distal subungual onychomycosis of the toenails. Oral terbinafine 250 mg/d was started for treatment. Twenty days after the beginning of the treatment, the patient presented with widespread pruritic blistering eruption, more severe on the extremities. He had not received terbinafine before and was not receiving any other drug. The diagnosis of BP was confirmed with histopathologic examination. The patient was treated successfully with oral steroids.

Discussion

Drug-induced BP is a well-known complication of many drugs and represents a spectrum from an acute and self-limited condition to a chronic disease. Terbinafine is frequently used in the elderly. It is known to have less drug interactions and adverse effects compared with the other antifungal agents. Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a probable relationship between BP and terbinafine treatment in this patient.

Conclusions

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report in the English-language literature of BP in a patient taking terbinafine. As with any other medication, oral terbinafine has the potential for severe adverse reactions. Healthcare professionals should be aware of this possibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Efinaconazole is a topical antifungal drug used to treat tinea unguium that was approved by the Japanese government in 2014. A phase 3 study enrolled patients with a nail involvement ratio of 20–50% (mean, 36.7%), and the complete cure rate at 52 weeks was 17.8% (117/656). Furthermore, a multicenter study including severe cases with a mean nail involvement of 49.1% showed that continuous application up to 72 weeks contributed to a relatively high cure rate of 31.1% (68/223). A recent Cochrane review of treatments for onychomycosis confirmed that high‐quality evidence supports the effectiveness of efinaconazole for achieving a complete cure. Oral terbinafine at 250 mg daily for 12 weeks and oral itraconazole pulse therapy (3 cycles of 400 mg daily) are mainly applied internationally, with complete cure rates of 35% and 14%, respectively. Combination therapy can be administrated in parallel or sequentially. Parallel therapy is recommended for patients who are not likely to respond to the therapy (e.g. patients with diabetes), whereas sequential therapy is recommended for patients who have shown a poor response to initial treatment. Combination therapy is one way of improving the cure rate of onychomycosis. We herein report the efficacy of topical efinaconazole in sequential combination therapy with oral terbinafine.

### Topical antifungal treatment prevents recurrence of toenail onychomycosis following cure [^111gW8XQ]. Dermatologic Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Recurrence rates are high for onychomycosis, with prophylactic topical antifungal use proposed to counter recurrence. Although this is a reasonable action for many clinicians, few studies have been conducted on the efficacy of topical prophylaxis. A retrospective chart review (2010–2015) was conducted in patients receiving oral terbinafine or itraconazole for toenail onychomycosis. Following complete cure, a topical antifungal (amorolfine, bifonazole, ciclopirox olamine, or terbinafine spray) was used weekly as prophylaxis. Recurrence was recorded along with patient characteristics including demographics and concomitant medical conditions. Data from 320 patients were collected. Recurrence was significantly lower in patients receiving topical antifungal prophylaxis than in no prophylactic treatment following oral terbinafine (p < .001), but not itraconazole (p = .185). Regardless of oral treatment, the use of topical antifungals as prophylaxis (p < .001) decreased, and the number of affected toenails (p = .048) and family history of fungal infections (p < .001) increased the likelihood that recurrence would occur. This study supports the use of topical antifungal medications as prophylactic treatment to help prevent recurrence of toenail onychomycosis and suggests that those with a family history of fungal infections should be closely monitored.

### The use of terbinafine in the treatment of onychomycosis in adults and special populations: a review of the evidence [^114H1NBN]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Terbinafine is an allylamine with fungicidal activity, first approved for the treatment of onychomycosis in the United Kingdom in the early 1990s, and in the US in 1996. Terbinafine is the most frequently prescribed oral antifungal agent in the US and Canada for onychomycosis. Its efficacy and safety in dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis in adults has been established in many studies. In fact, 18 randomized controlled trials have shown terbinafine to be highly effective, with a meta-average for mycological cure of 76% ± 3% (mean ± standard error). In large surveillance studies, terbinafine exhibited excellent safety profiles consistent with results obtained in pivotal studies. Additionally, terbinafine has been reported to be superior to both itraconazole and fluconazole in comparative studies in the treatment of dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis. Recent studies have reported terbinafine to be more cost effective than griseofulvin, fluconazole, or itraconazole. Terbinafine has also been used to treat onychomycosis effectively and safely in special patient populations, such as children, the elderly, immunocompromised patients, diabetics, and those with Down syndrome. Terbinafine should therefore be considered for the management of onychomycosis in adults based on its effectiveness, broad spectrum, fungicidal nature, established safety profile, and very low occurrence of drug interactions. Furthermore, the data support the use of terbinafine to treat dermatophyte onychomycosis in children and the elderly.

### Treatment of microsporum spp. tinea capitis with pulsed oral terbinafine [^116gH1w5]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Oral terbinafine is widely used in the treatment of superficial dermatomycoses as well as subcutaneous and systemic mycoses. It is also useful in treating tinea capitis, although for Microsporum canis and some ectothrix organisms, the effectiveness of the drug may be less than for some endothrix infections. In this study, we undertook a double-blind randomized trial comparing standard and double doses of terbinafine given in a pulsed protocol (1 week on, 3 weeks off) in treating Microsporum spp. tinea capitis in 42 individuals. We found that pulsed terbinafine at a higher dose did not improve treatment efficacy. However, our data clearly demonstrated that the duration of treatment is an important factor in determining clinical outcome and cure. Two pulses of standard dose terbinafine were found to be sufficient for treating most cases of Microsporum spp. tinea capitis, although additional treatment (a third pulse) may be needed if clinical improvement is not evident at 8 weeks after initiating therapy.

### Topical efinaconazole: a sequential combination therapy with oral terbinafine for refractory tinea unguium [^117HqKy1]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Efinaconazole is a topical antifungal drug approved in Japan for tinea unguium. Although topical treatments generally have low cure rates with a prolonged therapy period, a Cochrane review confirmed that high-quality evidence supports the effectiveness of efinaconazole for the complete cure of tinea unguium. Combination therapy is a way to improve the cure rate of onychomycosis. In this study, topical efinaconazole was administrated to 12 patients who had been treated with oral terbinafine (125 mg daily) for more than 20 weeks with little expected effect. Because terbinafine accumulates for a long time in the nail, treatment immediately followed by other drugs can be considered sequential combination therapy. During terbinafine monotherapy, the percentage involvement decreased from 53.5% to 44.0% after 37.4 weeks and the effective and cure rates were 16.7% and 0%, respectively. During sequential topical efinaconazole therapy combined with lasting terbinafine in the nail, the percentage involvement decreased from 44.0% to 18.7% after 28.4 weeks, and the effective and cure rates were 66.7% and 16.7%, respectively. The improvement rate per month of combination therapy (12.6%) was higher than that with monotherapy (2.1%) (p = 0.002). There were no serious side-effects. This sequential combination therapy with efinaconazole was effective in poor terbinafine responders, making it a promising regimen for improving the cure rate of tinea unguium.

Abstract

Efinaconazole is a topical antifungal drug approved in Japan for tinea unguium. Although topical treatments generally have low cure rates with a prolonged therapy period, a Cochrane review confirmed that high‐quality evidence supports the effectiveness of efinaconazole for the complete cure of tinea unguium. Combination therapy is a way to improve the cure rate of onychomycosis. In this study, topical efinaconazole was administrated to 12 patients who had been treated with oral terbinafine (125 mg daily) for more than 20 weeks with little expected effect.

### Treating onychomycosis [^111mjgYN]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis accounts for one third of fungal skin infections. Because only about one half of nail dystrophies are caused by fungus, the diagnosis should be confirmed by potassium hydroxide preparation, culture or histology before treatment is started. Newer, more effective antifungal agents have made treating onychomycosis easier. Terbinafine and itraconazole are the therapeutic agents of choice. Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not labeled fluconazole for the treatment of onychomycosis, early efficacy data are promising. Continuous oral terbinafine therapy is most effective against dermatophytes, which are responsible for the majority of onychomycosis cases. Intermittent pulse dosing with itraconazole is as safe and effective as short-term continuous therapy but more economical and convenient. With careful monitoring, patients treated with the newer antifungal agents have a good chance of achieving relief from onychomycosis and its complications.

### Toenail onychomycosis in diabetic patients: issues and management [^116yW8Qy]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus may be associated with serious sequelae, such as renal disease, retinopathy, and diabetic foot. A recent large prospective study has shown that onychomycosis is among the most significant predictors of foot ulcer. As the severity of onychomycosis may be associated with the length of time the individual has had the infection, early intervention is advisable owing to the progressive nature of the fungal infection. If left untreated, toenails can become thick, causing pressure and irritation, and thus act as a trigger for more severe complications. In the treatment of onychomycosis, compliance and drug interactions are important considerations, as diabetic patients frequently take concomitant medications. Terbinafine and itraconazole have been investigated for the treatment of onychomycosis in diabetic patients and have been shown to have efficacy and safety profiles comparable to those in the nondiabetic population. Data from clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance suggest that drug interactions resulting in hypoglycemia may not be an important issue when itraconazole and terbinafine are used to treat diabetic patients receiving concomitant hypoglycemic medications. Patient advice and education in improved foot care are an integral part of onychomycosis management, and help achieve long-term cure and reduce the complications of diabetic foot.

### Clinical course, antifungal susceptibility, and genomic sequencing of trichophyton indotineae [^117R56RP]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Dermatophytosis is a common, contagious superficial skin, hair, or nail infection caused by dermatophyte fungi, most commonly by members of the genus Trichophyton. Skin infections are often mild and resolve with topical antifungals. Systemic antifungals, such as terbinafine, a first-line oral antifungal that inhibits the enzyme squalene epoxidase (SQLE), are used to treat refractory or extensive dermatophytosis or infections involving hair follicles or nails.

In the past decade, dermatophytes failing typical doses and durations of antifungal therapy have become a global public health concern, illustrated by major outbreaks of severe, recalcitrant dermatophytosis in South Asia. These outbreaks have been driven by the emergence of a recently described species, Trichophyton indotineae, formerly Trichophyton mentagrophytes genotype VIII. T indotineae causes extensive, pruritic plaques, typically on the trunk, extremities, and groin, which are often minimally inflammatory, do not resolve with topical antifungals alone, and typically fail oral terbinafine treatment, at doses and durations used for tinea infections. Clinical failure with other antifungals, including azoles and griseofulvin, are also reported. Itraconazole is currently recommended for patients who do not respond with terbinafine, but high doses and long treatment durations (> 6 weeks) are required to clear T indotineae infections with reports of relapse occurring.

### Oral treatments for fungal infections of the skin of the foot [^114dh3Nh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

About 15% of the world population have fungal infections of the feet (tinea pedis or athlete's foot). There are many clinical presentations of tinea pedis, and most commonly, tinea pedis is seen between the toes (interdigital) and on the soles, heels, and sides of the foot (plantar). Plantar tinea pedis is known as moccasin foot. Once acquired, the infection can spread to other sites including the nails, which can be a source of re-infection. Oral therapy is usually used for chronic conditions or when topical treatment has failed.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral treatments for fungal infections of the skin of the foot (tinea pedis).

Search Methods

For this update we searched the following databases to July 2012: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and CINAHL (from 1981). We checked the bibliographies of retrieved trials for further references to relevant trials, and we searched online trials registers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of oral treatments in participants who have a clinically diagnosed tinea pedis, confirmed by microscopy and growth of dermatophytes (fungi) in culture.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently undertook study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and data extraction.

Main Results

We included 15 trials, involving 1438 participants. The 2 trials (71 participants) comparing terbinafine and griseofulvin produced a pooled risk ratio (RR) of 2.26 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49 to 3.44) in favour of terbinafine's ability to cure infection. No significant difference was detected between terbinafine and itraconazole, fluconazole and itraconazole, fluconazole and ketoconazole, or between griseofulvin and ketoconazole, although the trials were generally small. Two trials showed that terbinafine and itraconazole were effective compared with placebo: terbinafine (31 participants, RR 24.54, 95% CI 1.57 to 384.32) and itraconazole (72 participants, RR 6.67, 95% CI 2.17 to 20.48). All drugs reported adverse effects, with gastrointestinal effects most commonly reported. Ten of the trials were published over 15 years ago, and this is reflected by the poor reporting of information from which to make a clear 'Risk of bias' assessment. Only one trial was at low risk of bias overall. The majority of the remaining trials were judged as 'unclear' risk of bias because of the lack of clear statements with respect to methods of generating the randomisation sequence and allocation concealment. More trials achieved blinding of participants and personnel than blinding of the outcome assessors, which was again poorly reported.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence suggests that terbinafine is more effective than griseofulvin, and terbinafine and itraconazole are more effective than no treatment. In order to produce more reliable data, a rigorous evaluation of different drug therapies needs to be undertaken with larger sample sizes to ensure they are large enough to show any real difference when two treatments are being compared. It is also important to continue to follow up and collect data, preferably for six months after the end of the intervention period, to establish whether or not the infection recurred.

### Prognostic factors of mycological cure following treatment of onychomycosis with oral antifungal agents [^113ydY2o]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

There is considerable literature on the efficacy and safety of various drugs used in treating onychomycosis; however, little information is available regarding prognostic factors which may be associated with non-response to conventional treatment.

Objectives

To identify parameters influencing mycological cure at 72 weeks following treatment of toenail onychomycosis with oral antifungal agents.

Methods

Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis from a randomized double-blind controlled trial including 496 patients with toenail onychomycosis caused by dermatophytes.

Results

Baseline parameters including patient's age, gender, weight, number of toenails involved, percentage of nail involvement, duration of infection, history of previous treatment were not associated with mycological cure. In the multivariate prognostic factor analysis based on factors assessed at week 12, positive mycological culture at 12 weeks [odds ratio (OR): 0.583; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.370–0.918] was negatively associated with mycological cure at 72 weeks. Similarly, in the multivariate prognostic factor analysis based on factors assessed at week 24, positive direct microscopy at 24 weeks (OR: 0.373; 95% CI: 0.211–0.659) and mycological culture at 24 weeks (OR: 0.293; 95% CI: 0.168–0.513) were negatively associated with mycological cure at 72 weeks.

Conclusions

Mycological culture at 12 and 24 weeks and direct microscopic examination at 24 weeks can help in early identification of patients failing to respond to conventional oral antifungal treatment.

### Meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials comparing particular doses of griseofulvin and terbinafine for the treatment of tinea capitis [^116LiqDw]. Pediatric Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Two oral antifungal agents, griseofulvin and terbinafine, have regulatory approval in the United States, but it is unknown whether one has superior overall efficacy. Genus-specific differences in efficacy are believed to exist for the two agents. It is not clear at what doses and durations of treatment these differences apply. The goals of this meta-analysis were to determine whether a statistically significant difference in efficacy exists between these agents at a given dose and duration of each in tinea capitis infections overall and to determine whether a genus-specific difference in efficacy exists for these two treatments at a given dose and duration of each. We performed a literature search for clinically and methodologically similar randomized controlled trials comparing 8 weeks of griseofulvin (6.25–12.5 mg/kg/day) to 4 weeks of terbinafine (3.125–6.25 mg/kg/day) in the treatment of tinea capitis. A meta-analysis was performed using the Mantel-Haenszel method and random effects model; results were expressed as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials did not show a significant difference in the overall efficacy of the two drugs at the doses specified, but specific efficacy differences were observed based on the infectious species. For tinea capitis caused by Microsporum spp., griseofulvin is superior (p = 0.04), whereas terbinafine is superior for Trichophyton spp. infection (p = 0.04). Our results support species-specific differences in treatment efficacy between griseofulvin and terbinafine and provide a clinical context in which this knowledge may be applied.

### Terbinafine in the treatment of trichophyton tinea capitis: a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, duration-finding study [^116oREFX]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

Terbinafine has been shown to be effective in tinea capitis, using different treatment durations. However, no direct comparison of treatment duration has previously been investigated. This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study was designed to assess the effect of terbinafine treatment duration on the outcome of Trichophyton tinea capitis in a North American population.

Methods

A total of 176 patients with a clinical diagnosis of tinea capitis were enrolled in this study and treated with oral terbinafine (3–6 mg/kg/d) for 1, 2, or 4 weeks. All patients were to be followed until week 12. A total of 159 patients had culture-confirmed tinea capitis attributable to Trichophyton species and constituted the intent-to-treat population used for efficacy analysis (50, 55, and 54 patients in the 1-, 2-, and 4-week arms, respectively).

Results

At the end of study, effective treatment, defined as negative culture and low scores on signs and symptoms, was achieved in 56%, 69%, and 65% of patients who were treated with terbinafine for 1, 2, and 4 weeks, respectively. A negative culture was achieved in 60%, 76%, and 72%, respectively. Overall, the efficacy data showed that both the 2- and 4-week treatment regimens are clinically superior to the 1-week regimen. Terbinafine was well tolerated, and the incidence of adverse events showed no relationship to the duration of therapy.

Conclusion

When efficacy, cost, and compliance are taken into consideration, 2 weeks of terbinafine therapy appears to be the optimal treatment duration for patients with Trichophyton tonsurans tinea capitis.

### Combination of pulse therapy with terbinafine tablets and topical terbinafine cream for the treatment of dermatophyte onychomycosis: a pilot study [^115QS1wr]. The Journal of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

We performed a pilot study to assess the safety and efficacy of pulse therapy with terbinafine tablets in 66 patients with dermatophyte onychomycosis. One pulse consisted of oral terbinafine tablets (500 mg/day) given for 1 week followed by a 3-week interval. Topical 1% terbinafine cream was applied daily. The number of pulses was determined by the extent of improvement in the affected nails and by the patient's requests, up to a maximum of six pulses. Efficacy was assessed based on both clinical and mycological examinations 1 year after treatment initiation. We observed a complete cure in 51 patients (77.3%), marked improvement in five patients (7.6%), improvement in five patients (7.6%) and slight improvement in one patient (1.5%). Four patients (6.0%) showed no change. In the patients who were completely cured, the average number of pulses used was 3.7 ± 1.4 pulses and the treatment duration was 3.3 ± 1.6 months. Nine patients experienced adverse effects, consisting of gastrointestinal disturbance (eight patients) and drug-induced eruption (one patient). There were no abnormal findings in the laboratory tests, including liver function tests. In summary, terbinafine pulse therapy in combination with topical application of terbinafine cream appeared safe and effective in this pilot study.

### Clinical course, antifungal susceptibility, and genomic sequencing of trichophyton indotineae [^115535KA]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this case series is the largest US cohort describing T indotineae infections and highlights several important points. Patients experienced extensive, prolonged pruritic lesions that generally failed monotherapy with topical antifungals and showed inadequate response to typical doses and durations of oral antifungal medications, including prolonged terbinafine therapy at standard doses, consistent with findings from international reports. Diagnostic delays were common, and most patients did not have immunocompromising conditions that might predispose them to severe dermatophytosis. These findings, in addition to others (eg, recent travel to a high-prevalence region and/or initial laboratory culture identification of T mentagrophytes or T interdigitale in patients with compatible physical examination findings and history) should prompt consideration of T indotineae, which requires molecular-based techniques for definitive diagnosis. Because T indotineae identification was retrospective in most cases described in this report, treating dermatologists were often unaware of T indotineae diagnosis at the time of treatment, likely leading to the selection of ineffective or suboptimal antifungal treatment. Data highlight that 100-mg or 200-mg daily dosing of itraconazole for 6 to 8 weeks is the current preferred therapy, yet longer durations and higher doses may be required with reported relapse occurring. Terbinafine at higher than standard doses (500 mg daily) may be effective for some patients. Griseofulvin and fluconazole show limited efficacy.

### Are boosters or supplementation of antifungal drugs of any use for treating onychomycosis? [^1113EWYk]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

It is widely accepted that there is a finite failure rate when treating onychomycosis; a case report from the author serves as an example of multiple failures following treatments of varying duration and combinations, including oral-local, then oral-oral therapies. This article discusses the results obtained by authors who have varied the standard duration of therapy, increased the dosage of the oral antifungal agents, or have used two oral drugs in treating this condition.

### Doubled dose of oral terbinafine is required for microsporum canis tinea capitis [^111h7Js7]. Pediatric Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Fourteen children, ages 1–15 years, with Microsporum canis tinea capitis were given oral terbinafine for 4 weeks at the recommended daily dose according to their weight: 10–20 kg, 62.5 mg; 20–40 kg, 125 mg; > 40 kg, 250 mg. Because none of the patients had clinically responded to treatment by week 4 the dose of terbinafine was doubled (up to 250 mg) for an additional 4–8 weeks in six patients, and continued at the original dose in six patients. Two patients dropped out of the study. On final evaluation, four patients were cured after 8–12 weeks of treatment. All cured patients received the doubled dose of terbinafine, except for one who was on the usual adult dose of 250 mg from the onset. Oral terbinafine was well tolerated by all but one patient, who experienced gastrointestinal disturbance and slightly raised transaminase levels during the first 4 weeks of treatment. Terbinafine side effects were not correlated with dosage or duration of treatment. We conclude that oral terbinafine should be dosed for M. canis tinea capitis at a revised schedule according to body weight: 10–25 kg, 125 mg/day and > 25 kg, 250 mg/day. The appropriate duration of terbinafine treatment remains to be determined.

### Combination therapy for onychomycosis [^112D9kKM]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Combination therapy is one way of improving the cure rate of onychomycosis. The LION Study examined the efficacies of terbinafine and itraconazole. The Icelandic cohort of the study reported that after 5 years only 46% of the terbinafine-treated patients and 13% of the itraconazole-treated patients were still disease-free, suggesting that relapses and reinfections were common in the long term treatment of onychomycosis with monotherapy. Combination therapy is a well-established principle in mycology; the current strategy involves the combination of oral and topical antifungal treatments. A number of specific drug combinations have proved to be useful in the treatment of onychomycosis: tioconazole and griseofulvin, amorolfine and griseofulvin, amorolfine and terbinafine, and amorolfine and itraconazole. However, comparison of the combination trials can be difficult because of the short duration of some of the studies and variation in global cure rates. Although it is necessary to consider these factors it is clear that combination therapy offers advantages when compared with monotherapy. Combination therapy can be administered sequentially or in parallel. Parallel therapy is recommended for patients who are likely to fail therapy (e.g. patients with diabetes), whereas sequential therapy is recommended for patients who show a poor response to initial treatment.

Regarding specific circumstances for onychomycosis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, BAD 2014 guidelines recommend to consider offering griseofulvin (10 mg/kg/day for ≥ 1-month-old, maximum 500 mg; taken with fatty food to increase absorption) as second-line therapy if itraconazole and terbinafine are contraindicated or not tolerated.

### Comparable efficacy and safety of various topical formulations of terbinafine in tinea pedis irrespective of the treatment regimen: results of a meta-analysis [^115EUPbG]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Terbinafine has been widely used with major success as a topical antifungal therapy for tinea pedis (athlete's foot). Its efficacy and safety have been validated in several clinical trials, which have demonstrated clinical efficacy for the drug after only 1 week of treatment when applied once daily, a reflection of the high fungicidal potency of the drug and its ability to form a depot in the upper skin layer. To improve patients' compliance further, a terbinafine-containing film-forming solution has been developed for single-dose therapy of athlete's foot. This novel formulation delivers terbinafine in high amounts and for a prolonged period of time into the skin, making one-shot treatment feasible. Over the past years there have been a variety of trials evaluating use of topical terbinafine addressing different pharmaceutical formulations, treatment durations, and application frequencies, but a detailed meta-analysis of these trials has not been conducted to date.

Objective

The present study is the first meta-analytic evaluation of the available data on the efficacy (clinical and mycologic cure rates) and safety (adverse events) of all topical forms of terbinafine for the treatment of tinea pedis.

Methods

An international, systematic literature search of 12 electronic databases (including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases) using a pre-specified search strategy was conducted in March 2006. This meta-analysis included only randomized controlled trials in which terbinafine had been used for topical treatment of tinea pedis in comparison with placebo or an active control. Studies of all available topical formulations of terbinafine, frequencies of application, and durations of treatment were included.

Results

Of 100 identified articles published between 1990 and 2006, 19 met the criteria for analysis. These 19 studies involved 2899 patients with clinical and mycologic diagnoses of tinea pedis (nine placebo-controlled trials and ten active-controlled trials). Efficacy analysis demonstrated that the mycologic cure rate was significantly superior with terbinafine compared with placebo (relative risk [RR] 3.17; p < 0.001). No significant differences in efficacy were found amongst different formulations of terbinafine, treatment durations, or frequencies of application. Comparable results were obtained with respect to clinical cure rate for terbinafine compared with placebo (RR 2.75; p < 0.001). Comparison of the efficacy of terbinafine versus active control indicated a nonsignificant difference in favor of terbinafine with regard to mycologic cure rate (RR 1.03; p = 0.423) and clinical cure rate (RR 1.09; p = 0.11). The median duration of treatment was also shorter with terbinafine (1 week) compared with active controls (2 weeks). Analysis of the placebo-controlled studies showed that there was no significant difference in the risk of adverse events with terbinafine compared with placebo (RR 1.34; p = 0.34). Likewise, no significant differences in adverse events were found between terbinafine and active controls (RR 1.08; p = 0.72).

Conclusion

Terbinafine is very well tolerated in any topical pharmaceutical formulation and also has high efficacy as a cure for tinea pedis, irrespective of type of pharmaceutical formulation, treatment duration, and frequency of application, including the recently established one-shot regimen. In addition, terbinafine has an apparently unique advantage over other antifungal agents with respect to the required duration of treatment for tinea pedis.

### Treatment-resistant dermatophytosis: a representative case highlighting an emerging public health threat [^112NemLs]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 45-year-old man with a history of portal vein thrombosis on apixaban anticoagulation and hereditary spherocytosis after splenectomy presented to our clinic for evaluation and management of a persistent fungal infection. The patient's symptoms started approximately 20 years before his presentation, at which time he reported disease that was initially limited to his toenails but progressed to involve his feet, thighs, groin, and buttocks. The patient had seen several dermatologists before his presentation and tried multiple therapies that failed, including transient or minimal improvement following oral terbinafine, topical naftifine, and topical steroids (last used several years prior). Given his recalcitrant dermatophytosis, the patient was referred to an immunologist and had an extensive immunodeficiency workup, which was unremarkable with the exception of low IgM antibody levels.

### Topical efinaconazole: a sequential combination therapy with oral terbinafine for refractory tinea unguium [^11522ZcJ]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

In the present study, the terbinafine concentration in the nails lasted throughout subsequent topical efinaconazole therapy. Therefore, we presumed that both efinaconazole and terbinafine in the nail worked cooperatively to induce increased antifungal activity. An antifungal susceptibility study in vitro using the fractional inhibitory concentration index suggested that terbinafine and efinaconazole had synergic or additive effects on most T. rubrum and Trichophyton interdigitale strains investigated. The mechanism underlying the synergy effect may involve the blockage of both SQLE and 14α‐demethylase. These in vitro synergy effects led to favorable clinical efficacy in the patient's nail during our sequential combination therapy.

A patient with refractory dermatophytoma to oral terbinafine successfully treated with topical efinaconazole was reported. The patient applied the medication to the surface of the nail as well as to the hyponychium. Topical efinaconazole targets the fungus from the outside, penetrating the dorsal nail plate, while oral terbinafine works from the inside, penetrating the ventral nail plate. The route of drug delivery to the target site naturally influences the efficacy. Dermatophytoma has been described clinically as a discolored linear band or streak. Not terbinafine but efinaconazole was effective in our case with a longitudinal streak (Figure 1d).

As with our results, topical amorolfine in combination with oral terbinafine was reported to enhance clinical efficacy in comparison to terbinafine alone (59.2% vs. 45.0%). Although it is difficult under the current Japanese insurance system, parallel combination therapy may be necessary to shorten the treatment period and reduce the dropout rate. Sequential combination therapy with efinaconazole is effective for poor responders to terbinafine and may help improve the cure rate of onychomycosis.

### Combined oral terbinafine and long-pulsed 1, 064-nm Nd: YAG laser treatment is more effective for onychomycosis than either treatment alone [^114UfigE]. Dermatologic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Onychomycosis is difficult to cure. Systemic and topical treatments, including the 1,064-nm Nd:YAG laser, are not very effective when used individually.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of combined treatment with a long-pulsed 1,064-nm Nd:YAG laser and oral terbinafine with those of either treatment alone.

Methods

We randomly divided 53 patients with a total of 90 infected nails into 3 treatment groups: the T group received oral terbinafine, the L group received long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser treatment, and the T + L group received both treatments. We evaluated the mycological clearance rate (MCR) and the clinical clearance rate (CCR) of the 3 groups at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24.

Results

The MCR and CCR increased in all 3 groups in a time-dependent manner. The MCR and CCR of the T + L group were significantly higher than those of the T group and the L group at Weeks 8, 12, 16, and 24 (p < .05).

Conclusion

These data indicate that 12 weeks of combined treatment with a long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser and oral terbinafine produce more rapid and effective mycological and clinical clearance in patients with onychomycosis than either treatment alone, without any obvious side effects.

### Topical efinaconazole: a sequential combination therapy with oral terbinafine for refractory tinea unguium [^1155aQtR]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Terbinafine is the most commonly prescribed oral antifungal medicine approved to treat tinea unguium. The recommended regimen for toenail tinea unguium is 125 mg daily for 24 weeks in Japan. In daily clinical practice, oral antifungal drugs are effective in many cases; however, in 5.6% (14/247) of cases in our clinic, onychomycosis did not respond to oral terbinafine therapy during the 2‐year study period from 2016 to 2017. One reason for this might be the presence of terbinafine‐resistant dermatophytes. In 2019, we presented a case of tinea unguium caused by a terbinafine‐resistant Trichophyton rubrum. Terbinafine is an allylamine derivative that inhibits the enzyme squalene epoxidase (SQLE), thus inhibiting functional fungal cell membrane development. The mutated SQLE alleles led to Phe397Leu substitution in the T. rubrum SQLE proteins. Our clinic obtained three terbinafine‐resistant T. rubrum strains (3/95, 3.2%, Leu393Phe substitution) in June 2020.

Although onychomycosis caused by non‐dermatophytes occurs at varying frequencies according to the geographic location, in developed countries, approximately 10% of onychomycoses are caused by non‐dermatophyte moulds. We identified 13 (0.5%) cases of non‐dermatophyte onychomycosis among 2591 onychomycoses in 106703 outpatients over the past 5 years (January 2015–December 2019). The pathogens were Aspergillus species, Fusarium species, Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, and Botryosphaeria dothidea, which is closely related phylogenetically to Neoscytalidium dimidiatum. Non‐dermatophyte moulds showed a poor response to terbinafine.

Efinaconazole 10% solution is recommended for patients with mild to moderate tinea unguium and assigned a grade of B in Japan. Efinaconazole is a triazole derivative that inhibits lanosterol 14α‐demethylase and has a low potential to induce drug resistance in dermatophytes. Furthermore, it shows a broad spectrum of antifungal activities in vitro and used to treat patients with non‐dermatophyte mould onychomycosis caused by Aspergillus species, Fusarium species, and S. brevicaulis.

### Meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials comparing griseofulvin and terbinafine in the treatment of tinea capitis [^116TRXhA]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Griseofulvin has been the standard treatment for tinea capitis but newer antifungal agents, particularly terbinafine, are increasingly being used because of their shorter duration of treatment and more consistent absorption rates.

Objective

We sought to compare the efficacy of oral griseofulvin and oral terbinafine in the treatment of tinea capitis.

Methods

A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials, and the Cochrane Skin Group Ongoing Skin Trials Register was performed up to January 2010 for randomized controlled trials comparing griseofulvin and terbinafine in the treatment of tinea capitis in immunocompetent patients. The primary outcome measure was the complete cure rate. The mycological and clinical cure rates and adverse effects were secondary outcome measures. Pooling of treatment effect was accomplished using a random effects model and the I(2) test was used to check for heterogeneity among the studies.

Results

Seven studies involving 2163 subjects were included. There was no significant difference in efficacy between griseofulvin (mean duration of treatment 8 weeks, range 6–12 weeks) and terbinafine (mean duration of treatment 4 weeks, range 2–6 weeks); odds ratio = 1.22 favoring terbinafine (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.785–1.919; p = 0.37). In the pooled analysis of 5 studies in which Trichophyton species were the predominant (≥ 65%) pathogenic dermatophyte, terbinafine showed a trend toward greater efficacy (odds ratio 1.49; 95% CI = 0.975–2.277; p = 0.065). Subgroup analysis revealed that terbinafine was more efficacious than griseofulvin in treating Trichophyton species (1.616; 95% CI = 1.274–2.051; P < .001) and griseofulvin was more efficacious than terbinafine in treating Microsporum species (0.408; 95% CI = 0.254–0.656; P < .001). Both griseofulvin and terbinafine demonstrated good safety profiles in the studies.

Limitations

Data on efficacy of griseofulvin and terbinafine for separate groups of Trichophyton and Microsporum species were not available from every study. In the subgroup analysis of Microsporum species, data from only 3 studies were available.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis suggests that terbinafine is more efficacious than griseofulvin in treating tinea capitis caused by Trichophyton species, whereas griseofulvin is more efficacious than terbinafine in treating tinea capitis caused by Microsporum species.

Regarding medical management for onychomycosis, more specifically with respect to systemic antifungals, BAD 2014 guidelines recommend to offer itraconazole (200 mg/day for 12 weeks continuously, or alternatively as pulse therapy at a dose of 400 mg/day for 1 week per month, 2 pulses for fingernails and 3 pulses for toenails) as first-line therapy in patients with dermatophyte onychomycosis.

### Terbinafine, 250 mg once daily-12 weeks on, 12… [^112EEv2X]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question What is the best oral monotherapy for toenail onychomycosis in adults. Bottom Line Based on effectiveness, safety, and cost, a regimen of terbinafine, 250 mg once daily for 12 weeks, followed by a 12-week period of no therapy and then a four-week booster, was preferred for onychomycosis in adults for the outcome of complete cure at one year. This POEM aligns with the Canadian Dermatology Association's Choosing Wisely Canada recommendation: Do not prescribe systemic antifungals for suspected onychomycosis without mycologic confirmation of dermatophyte infection. Synopsis The goal of the network meta-analysis was to compare individual oral antifungal regimens directly and indirectly for onychomycosis in adults. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve, a measure of the likelihood that a regimen was more likely to be effective or to cause harms, was calculated for each study and outcome.

The researchers identified a total of 21 studies. Study quality was mixed, with many studies failing to mask participants and/or physicians. An overall assessment of the quality of each study was not provided, although most were at moderate to high risk of bias. The highest complete cure rates at one year were found with terbinafine, 250 mg once daily for 12 weeks, followed by no treatment for 12 weeks and then terbinafine, 250 mg once daily for another four weeks; the same regimen, but with an initial treatment period of eight weeks; and albaconazole, 400 mg once weekly for 36 weeks. Terbinafine, 250 mg once daily for 24 weeks, had the highest likelihood of mycologic cure.

Terbinafine, 250 mg daily for 12 weeks, was found to be significantly safer than albaconazole, 400 mg weekly for 36 weeks; oteseconazole, 600 mg daily for two weeks, then 600 mg weekly for 10 weeks; fluconazole, 300 mg once weekly for 12 months; and posaconazole, 200 mg daily for 24 weeks.

### Long-term effectiveness of treatment with terbinafine vs itraconazole in onychomycosis… [^114pnYKG]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

Design Long-term prospective follow-up study. Setting Three centers in Iceland. Subjects The study population comprised 151 patients aged 18 to 75 years with a clinical and mycological diagnosis of dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis. Interventions. The study population comprised men and women aged between 18 and 75 years with a clinical diagnosis of onychomycosis of the toenail confirmed by positive mycological culture and microscopic findings for a dermatophyte. 9, 10 All patients belonging to the intention-to-treat population were followed up prospectively. From month 18 onward, an additional 12-week course of oral terbinafine, 250 mg/d, was offered on clinical signs of reinfection. If necessary, further additional courses of terbinafine were offered on signs of reinfection or if previously negative mycological findings became positive with signs of clinical disease. Patients with positive mycological findings but with normal nails were not treated.

The primary efficacy criterion was the proportion of patients who remained mycologically cured at the end of follow-up without requiring second intervention treatment with terbinafine. Mycological cure was defined as negative results on both microscopy and culture of samples taken from the target toenail. In the present study, we have shown that terbinafine achieves significantly higher long-term mycological and clinical cure rates than itraconazole in onychomycosis. To our knowledge, this study represents the longest prospective follow-up of patients treated for toenail onychomycosis. The study was done in Iceland, and it is possible that the results would differ with a more heterogeneous study population. We do not find this likely. The patients were recruited from the multinational LION study, and in this study no difference in cure rates was found between individual countries. 9, 10.

It is well recognized that both itraconazole and terbinafine can persist for months after treatment at clinically relevant concentrations in treated nails. 24 Terbinafine is primarily fungicidal in its mode of action as opposed to itraconazole, which is primarily fungistatic. It is tempting to speculate that the fungicidal activity of terbinafine enables it to kill the fungus more rapidly at low concentrations and that this may account for the lower relapse rate observed in this study.
