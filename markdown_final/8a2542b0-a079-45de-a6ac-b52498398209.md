## Question

What are guidelines for PSA testing?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about guidelines for PSA screening. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle of shared decision-making and how it anchors all major guidelines. Then, I should verify age-based recommendations for average-risk men, including when to start and when to stop. Next, I will examine special populations at higher risk and how that modifies timing. After that, I need to check screening intervals and whether repeating an elevated PSA is advised before proceeding. I will then review diagnostic thresholds and the role of MRI and biomarkers to mitigate harms. Finally, I should consider life expectancy, active surveillance, and practical implementation details, and close with a concise, clinically actionable summary that reconciles differences across societies.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: across USPSTF, AUA/SUO, ACS, and the BMJ Rapid Recommendations, shared decision-making is the central requirement for PSA screening in men who might benefit, reflecting the small and uncertain absolute mortality benefit balanced against meaningful harms from false positives, biopsies, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment [^113dMF98] [^1121bo26] [^116uaM9Z] [^113TBkoF].

> I need to verify the age range for average-risk men where screening is considered. The USPSTF gives a C recommendation for men aged 55–69 years, advising an individualized decision after discussing benefits and harms, and recommends against routine screening at age 70 and older due to limited benefit and greater harms. The AUA/SUO similarly focuses on 55–69 years for shared decision-making, while the ACS emphasizes beginning the informed decision process at age 50 for average-risk men with at least a 10-year life expectancy, with earlier discussion for higher-risk groups [^113dMF98] [^112b8sAe] [^116uaM9Z].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about starting earlier. I should double-check high-risk groups. The ACS advises that African American men and men with a first-degree family history begin informed decision-making at age 45, and those with multiple first-degree relatives affected before 65 years should start at 40; ESMO likewise supports earlier baseline PSA and risk-adapted follow-up in higher-risk men, and the AUA/SUO notes that obtaining a baseline PSA at 45–50 can be considered, particularly to inform future screening intensity [^1173wSMU] [^111Hd5nN] [^114guQhz].

> Next, I should review screening intervals. Wait, let me verify whether annual testing is necessary. Modeling and trial designs suggest that every 2–4 years preserves most of the mortality benefit while reducing unnecessary biopsies and overdiagnosis, and the AUA/SUO explicitly supports personalizing intervals based on age, PSA, risk, and preferences. The CAP trial's lack of mortality benefit with a single one-time PSA reinforces that repeated, risk-adapted screening is the relevant strategy when screening is chosen [^1166SAqe] [^117SkRr6] [^116yxJLe].

> I will now examine what to do with an elevated PSA. I need to ensure we avoid reflex biopsies; multiple guidelines advise repeating the PSA after an initial elevation to confirm persistence, then using risk calculators, MRI, and/or additional biomarkers to refine biopsy yield and reduce unnecessary procedures; the EAU-endorsed risk-adapted pathway and contemporary AUA/SUO guidance both emphasize pre-biopsy MRI and selective biomarkers to mitigate overdiagnosis [^114CjTvN] [^115MyCzV] [^112tUzUS].

> Let me consider diagnostic thresholds carefully. Historically, 4.0 ng/mL has been used as a cutoff, but I should confirm that no universal threshold exists. Cancer occurs across the PSA spectrum, and decisions should integrate age, risk factors, and patient preferences, with many guidelines now favoring risk calculators and MRI rather than a fixed PSA trigger, especially in the 2.5–4.0 ng/mL indeterminate range [^113rKUpH] [^114QtBPe] [^115MyCzV].

> But wait, what about life expectancy and stopping rules? I should confirm that men with less than a 10-year life expectancy are not candidates for screening because the delayed benefit does not outweigh near-term harms. This is consistently recommended by ACS, ESMO, and echoed by USPSTF for men 70 and older, with observational data showing substantial low-value screening persists in older men despite these recommendations [^112aReUs] [^112hqno3] [^113HgSM8].

> Next, I should review how to manage screen-detected disease to limit overtreatment. Active surveillance is the preferred approach for low-risk prostate cancer in appropriately selected men, with similar long-term survival compared with immediate treatment and better quality-of-life profiles; this strategy is central to balancing the small mortality benefit of screening against its harms and is emphasized by urologic and oncology guidelines as well as primary care summaries [^112vm4Rq] [^112tUzUS] [^111RMPRS].

> I need to ensure practical implementation aligns with guidance. Clinicians should not raise PSA screening unprompted in all encounters; instead, they should be prepared to engage in shared decision-making when men inquire or when risk and life expectancy make screening reasonable, using decision aids and discussing absolute benefits and harms; the BMJ Rapid Recommendations explicitly allow clinicians to wait for patients to raise the issue, reflecting variability in values and the weak overall recommendation against routine screening [^113PtqpH] [^112K68WZ].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to avoid overgeneralization. For average-risk men, the most consistent, evidence-aligned approach is shared decision-making for ages 55–69, with screening every 2–4 years if chosen, avoidance of routine screening at age 70 and older, and use of confirmatory PSA, risk calculators, MRI, and biomarkers to guide biopsy decisions. For higher-risk men, earlier discussion and possibly earlier baseline PSA are reasonable, with the same principles of risk-adapted follow-up and active surveillance for low-risk disease [^113dMF98] [^114CjTvN] [^112tUzUS].

PSA testing is **not recommended for routine screening** in asymptomatic men due to limited benefit and significant harms [^113TBkoF] [^113dMF98]. For men aged 55–69, **shared decision-making** is essential to weigh a small reduction in prostate cancer mortality against risks of false positives, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment [^113dMF98] [^111cpVHw]. Routine screening is **not recommended for men ≥ 70 years** or those with < 10-year life expectancy [^113dMF98] [^112hqno3]. If screening is chosen, use 2–4 year intervals and consider MRI or biomarkers to reduce unnecessary biopsies [^112vm4Rq] [^117V7Q7Q]. There is no single PSA threshold for biopsy; decisions should be individualized based on risk, age, and patient preferences [^114MFpqg] [^114QtBPe].

---

## Benefits and harms of PSA screening

### Benefits

The primary benefit is a **modest reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality** in men aged 55–69, with an estimated 1.3 fewer prostate cancer deaths per 1,000 men screened over 13 years [^111cpVHw] [^115Grbi1]. Additional benefits include earlier detection of localized disease, enabling more curative treatment options, and a reduction in metastatic disease [^115Grbi1] [^112vm4Rq].

---

### Harms

- **False positives**: Common, leading to unnecessary biopsies, anxiety, and psychological distress [^116C786A] [^117MnhKD].
- **Overdiagnosis**: Detection of indolent cancers unlikely to cause symptoms or death, leading to overtreatment [^114akJ65].
- **Treatment-related harms**: Urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, and bowel dysfunction from surgery or radiation [^116C786A] [^111cpVHw].
- **Biopsy complications**: Infection, bleeding, and pain [^116C786A].

---

## Age-specific recommendations

| **Age group** | **Recommendation** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| < 40 years | Not recommended | Low incidence and limited evidence of benefit [^112b8sAe] |
| 40–54 years | Individualized decision-making | Consider in high-risk men (family history, African ancestry) [^112b8sAe] [^1173wSMU] |
| 55–69 years | Shared decision-making | Potential benefit outweighs harms in some men [^113dMF98] [^113TBkoF] |
| ≥ 70 years | Not recommended | Limited life expectancy and increased harms [^113dMF98] [^114mQpzt] |

---

## Frequency of PSA testing

Optimal screening intervals are **every 2–4 years**; annual screening increases harms without clear additional benefit [^112vm4Rq] [^1166SAqe]. Intervals can be individualized based on baseline PSA, risk factors, and patient preferences [^117SkRr6].

---

## PSA thresholds for biopsy

There is **no universal PSA threshold** for biopsy; decisions should be individualized based on age, risk factors, and patient preferences [^114MFpqg] [^114QtBPe]. Commonly used thresholds include 4.0 ng/mL for average-risk men and 3.0 ng/mL for high-risk men or those with suspicious digital rectal examination (DRE) findings [^1149of81] [^111Q1Yvb].

---

## Role of MRI and biomarkers

Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) is recommended to reduce unnecessary biopsies and improve detection of clinically significant cancer [^112tUzUS] [^117V7Q7Q]. Biomarkers such as the 4K score, Prostate Health Index (PHI), and PCA3 may be considered in specific clinical scenarios to further refine risk assessment [^112c5bk8] [^115MyCzV].

---

## Special populations

- **High-risk men**: Family history, African ancestry, or BRCA mutations may benefit from earlier discussion and individualized screening strategies [^111Hd5nN] [^1173wSMU].
- **Men with limited life expectancy**: Screening is not recommended due to limited benefit and increased harms [^114a5coV] [^112hqno3].

---

## Current controversies and uncertainties

- **Overdiagnosis and overtreatment**: Significant concerns remain regarding the detection and treatment of indolent cancers [^116wQnDq] [^111cpVHw].
- **Optimal screening strategies**: Ongoing research aims to identify the most effective and least harmful screening approaches [^117V7Q7Q] [^111ea5T7].
- **Patient preferences**: Variability in patient values and preferences necessitates shared decision-making [^113dMF98] [^112K68WZ].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Shared decision-making**: Essential for men aged 55–69 considering PSA screening [^113dMF98] [^113TBkoF].
- **Individualized approach**: Tailor screening decisions based on age, risk factors, and patient preferences [^113dMF98] [^1121bo26].
- **Use of MRI and biomarkers**: Consider to reduce unnecessary biopsies and improve detection of significant cancer [^112tUzUS] [^117V7Q7Q].
- **Avoid routine screening**: In men ≥ 70 years or those with < 10-year life expectancy [^113dMF98] [^112hqno3].

---

PSA testing is **not recommended for routine screening** in asymptomatic men due to limited benefit and significant harms. For men aged 55–69, **shared decision-making** is essential to weigh a small reduction in prostate cancer mortality against risks of false positives, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment. Routine screening is **not recommended for men ≥ 70 years** or those with < 10-year life expectancy. If screening is chosen, use 2–4 year intervals and consider MRI or biomarkers to reduce unnecessary biopsies. There is no single PSA threshold for biopsy; decisions should be individualized based on risk, age, and patient preferences.

### The case for tailored prostate cancer screening: an NCCN perspective [^112c5bk8]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2015). Low credibility.

A preponderance of clinical evidence supports a significant public health benefit for screening and early detection of prostate cancer in selected men. The challenge lies in maximizing early diagnosis of potentially aggressive but curable disease while minimizing diagnosis and treatment of indolent disease. A tailored approach to population screening in appropriately counseled men, using an evidence-based strategy with judicious prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, will reduce prostate-cancer mortality yet limit overdetection of clinically insignificant disease. Use of newer biomarkers that increase specificity for prostate cancer detection, including percentage of free PSA, 4Kscore, prostate health index, prostate cancer antigen 3, and multiparametric MRI may be considered under certain circumstances.

### Prostate specific antigen best practice statement: 2009 update [^114MFpqg]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

We provide current information on the use of PSA testing for the evaluation of men at risk for prostate cancer, and the risks and benefits of early detection.

Materials and Methods

The report is a summary of the American Urological Association PSA Best Practice Policy 2009. The summary statement is based on a review of the current professional literature, clinical experience and the expert opinions of a multispecialty panel. It is intended to serve as a resource for physicians, other health care professionals, and patients. It does not establish a fixed set of guidelines, define the legal standard of care or pre-empt physician judgment in individual cases.

Results

There are two notable differences in the current policy. First, the age for obtaining a baseline PSA has been lowered to 40 years. Secondly, the current policy no longer recommends a single, threshold value of PSA, which should prompt prostate biopsy. Rather, the decision to proceed to prostate biopsy should be based primarily on PSA and DRE results, but should take into account multiple factors including free and total PSA, patient age, PSA velocity, PSA density, family history, ethnicity, prior biopsy history and comorbidities.

Conclusions

Although recently published trials show different results regarding the impact of prostate cancer screening on mortality, both suggest that prostate cancer screening leads to overdetection and overtreatment of some patients. Therefore, men should be informed of the risks and benefits of prostate cancer screening before biopsy and the option of active surveillance in lieu of immediate treatment for certain men diagnosed with prostate cancer.

### Early detection, PSA screening, and management of overdiagnosis [^115oDi3a]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment rates have increased significantly since the introduction of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening. Although it was initially thought that most prostate cancers would lead to death or significant morbidity, recent randomized trials have demonstrated that many patients with screening-detected cancer will not die of their disease. Modifications to PSA screening, screening guideline statements, and novel screening markers have been developed to minimize the risk and morbidity associated with overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Less aggressive management strategies such as active surveillance may lead to lower treatment rates in men who are unlikely to benefit while maintaining cure rates.

### Prostate-specific antigen testing as part of a risk-adapted early detection strategy for prostate cancer: European Association of Urology position and recommendations for 2021 [^112tUzUS]. European Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Recommendations against prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing in 2012 have increased advanced-stage diagnosis and prostate cancer-specific mortality rates.

Objective

To present the position of the European Association of Urology (EAU) in 2021 and provide recommendations for the use of PSA testing as part of a risk-adapted strategy for the early detection of prostate cancer.

Evidence Acquisition

The authors combined their review of relevant literature, including the EAU prostate cancer guidelines 2021 update, with their own knowledge to provide an expert opinion, representing the EAU's position in 2021.

Evidence Synthesis

The EAU has developed a risk-adapted early prostate cancer detection strategy for well-informed men based on PSA testing, risk calculators, and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, which can differentiate significant from insignificant prostate cancer. This approach largely avoids the overdiagnosis/overtreatment of men unlikely to experience disease-related symptoms during their lifetime and facilitates an early diagnosis of men with significant cancer to receive active treatment. It also reduces advanced-stage diagnosis, thereby potentially reducing prostate cancer-specific mortality and improving quality of life. Education is required among urologists, general practitioners, radiologists, policy makers, and healthy men, including endorsement by the European Commission to adapt the European Council's screening recommendations in its 2022 plan and requests to individual countries for its incorporation into national cancer plans.

Conclusions

This risk-adapted approach for the early detection of prostate cancer will reverse current unfavourable trends and ultimately save lives.

Patient Summary

The European Association of Urology has developed a patient information leaflet and algorithm for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer. It can identify men who do not need magnetic resonance imaging or a biopsy and those who would not show any symptoms versus those with more aggressive disease who require further tests/treatment. We need to raise awareness of this algorithm to ensure that all well-informed men at risk of significant prostate cancer are offered a prostate-specific antigen test.

American Cancer Society guideline — screening evidence and harms: The ERSPC demonstrated a 20% reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality in men randomized to an invitation to screening compared with controls, whereas the PLCO did not demonstrate a reduction in mortality; although benefits are uncertain, harms are noted, including that it has been estimated that between 23% and 42% of screen-detected cancers would never have been diagnosed in the absence of screening, there is a significant risk of sexual, urinary, and bowel-related symptoms depending on the type of treatment selected, and the abundance of data supports neither a clear mandate to screen nor a proscription against screening.

Executive summary — Although there have been substantive advances since the last American Cancer Society guideline update in 2001, there remain significant uncertainties regarding the overall value of detecting prostate cancer early, and emerging evidence that periodic testing with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) may reduce the likelihood of dying from prostate cancer must be weighed against the serious risks.

Prostate-specific antigen screening in high-risk populations — Test positivity generally increases with advancing age; in men younger than age 50 years, test positivity, based on a 4-ng/mL PSA cutoff, ranges between 2% and 3% and increases up to as high as 28% among men ages 70 years and older, while the prostate cancer detection rate and positive predictive value (PPV) are lower among men younger than age 50 years (1%-2%, and 6%-38%, respectively) compared with older men (13% and 39%-58%, respectively), and specificity decreases with increasing age (from 97% to 98% in younger adults compared with 80% in older adults); in African American men ages 70 to 79 years, based on a 4-ng/mL PSA cutoff, test positivity reportedly may be as high as 54% with a prostate cancer detection rate of 25% and a PPV of 59%.

### Who and when should we screen for prostate cancer? Interviews with key opinion leaders [^111j2B2g]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

A Vickers and S Carlsson: The original question asked " Should PSA be avoided entirely in asymptomatic men, or should screening be restricted to certain subgroups and, if so, whom? ". You seem to agree with the latter: you say that screening should not be abandoned because it " clearly benefits some men ". So which men should be screened?

P Albertsen: Based upon what we know in 2015, PSA testing does benefit some men. For this reason I strongly support the recommendations of the AUA. These guidelines were based extensively on the data provided by the ERSPC. However, we need to do better. I am aware of your work with Hans Lilja, suggesting that a PSA value at age 50 is predictive of the long-term probability of developing clinically significant prostate cancer. I believe we can refine the group of men who should be tested. We also need to incorporate the natural increase in PSA that comes with prostate enlargement that occurs when a man ages through his 50s and 60s. A graphic chart that tracks PSA levels or, possibly, percent free-PSA or the new prostate health index test against age and prostate volume, similar to a pediatric growth chart, might be helpful. Men consistently falling outside the 90th percentile, for example, might undergo MRI testing before considering a prostate biopsy. All of these refinements should be aimed at lowering the incidence of low-volume, low-grade cancer. In my mind, we have yet to define a best practice screening and treatment algorithm. While the AUA recommendations are a start, we have not agreed upon the test(s) needed, the frequency of their application, the value of imaging versus biopsies, nor on which treatments work best for which patients. These are the research gaps that should be addressed by trials. Unfortunately, these trials are often difficult to conduct in the US because of perverse economic incentives and clinicians who are convinced that current practices are the preferred standard of care.

### Evolution and immediate future of US screening guidelines [^111Cwz1i]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Although observational studies and simulation models have shed some interesting light on many of the uncertainties surrounding prostate cancer screening, well-done clinical trials provide the best evidence on screening among the extremes of age, the most appropriate interval to screen, and the best complement of tests to use. Enthusiasm for screening is temporized by the acknowledgment that overdetection leads to frequent overtreatment despite evidence supporting the safety of active surveillance in many men with low-risk disease.

### Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test-NCI-national cancer institute… [^114hmhTx]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

The PSA test measures the level of PSA in the blood. This test is used in several different ways:

- to monitor the progression of prostate cancer in men who have already been diagnosed with the disease
- to follow up on prostate symptoms, such as painful or frequent urination, blood in urine or semen, and pelvic and/or back pain
- to screen for prostate cancer in men who do not have symptoms of the disease. Is the PSA test recommended for prostate cancer screening. The PSA test is not recommended for routine prostate cancer screening in the general population. It was used for this purpose for several decades, beginning in the late 1980s. But by around 2008, as more was learned about both the benefits and harms of prostate cancer screening, many professional medical organizations began to caution against routine population screening with the PSA test.

Most organizations now recommend that individuals who are considering PSA screening first discuss the risks and benefits with their doctors before making a decision. The current recommendation of the United States Preventive Serves Task Force, which applies both to the general population and to those at increased risk due to race/ethnicity or family history, is as follows:

- For individuals aged 55 to 69 years, the decision to undergo periodic PSA-based screening for prostate cancer should be an individual one. Before making the decision, a person should discuss the potential benefits and harms of screening with their clinician and consider these in the context of their own values and preferences.
- PSA-based screening for prostate cancer is not recommended for individuals 70 years and older. In general, a PSA level above 4. 0 ng/mL is considered abnormal and may result in a recommendation for prostate biopsy.

However, because PSA levels increase with age, some doctors apply a higher cutoff for older men and a lower cutoff for younger men. What is done if a screening test shows an elevated PSA level. If someone who has no symptoms of prostate cancer chooses to undergo prostate cancer screening and is found to have an abnormal PSA level, the doctor may recommend another PSA test in 6 to 8 weeks to confirm the original finding. If the PSA level is still elevated, the doctor may recommend continued observation with repeat PSA tests along with digital rectal exams to watch for any changes over time.

Values and preferences

The panel, including the patient partners, felt that this variability in values and preferences contributes to a weak recommendation. The recommendation against screening reflects a belief that most men would value avoiding complications from biopsies and subsequent treatment because the reduction in prostate cancer and death from screening is small and uncertain. Prostate cancer will often, though not always, remain indolent.

Men who place a high value on avoiding complications from biopsies and subsequent treatment are likely to decline screening. In contrast, men who place a higher value on even a small reduction of prostate cancer may opt for screening. Several panel members felt that higher risk patients — such as patients with family history of cancer or of African descent — may be more likely to seek screening because they may worry more about prostate cancer and want to rule out the diagnosis.

For men considering screening, shared decision making is critical to ensure that their decision is in line with their own values and preferences. The evidence summarised in this Rapid Recommendation is available in MAGICapp as decision aids that can support shared decision making.

Practical issues and other considerations

Figure 3 outlines the key practical issues. PSA testing can be performed on any normal blood sample, but prostate biopsies and their follow-up have important implications for daily life.

Fig 3
Practical issues about use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and biopsy for prostate cancer screening

Lower urinary tract symptoms (slow urine stream, sensation of incomplete emptying, increased urinary frequency) are common complaints in adult men that can have a major impact on quality of life. Benign prostatic enlargement is the major cause. Evidence to date indicates that men with these complaints are not at increased risk of prostate cancer.

For men who chose to undergo PSA testing, the optimal frequency of screening remains unknown. Figure 2 summarises the frequency used in the different trials, yet the accompanying systematic review did not find any significant subgroup effect of the effect of screening based on these different frequencies. Given that the ERSPC data are likely at lower risk of bias, PSA screening every four years — rather than, say, every year or only once in a lifetime — may be the optimal interval.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening interval evidence and modeling — Although many U.S. men are tested annually, there is no strong evidence to recommend one interscreening interval over another, and different intervals have not been compared in a randomized controlled trial setting. The ERSPC had a screening interval of 4 years (and a PSA threshold level for biopsy of 3.0 ng/mL) in most centers, and these results provide support for a benefit of screening less frequently than every year. Modeling studies project that screening every 2 years would reduce tests and unnecessary biopsies by 50% while retaining 93% of the years of life saved; another model showed almost 50% fewer tests and unnecessary biopsies and reduced overdiagnosis by 13% while retaining 87% of the years of life saved; a third model retained 95% of the years of life saved. All assumed a PSA cutoff of 4.0 ng/mL with screening starting at 50 years, and one showed similar results starting at 40 years. The average delay in diagnosis when moving from annual screening to every 2 years is estimated as between 5 months and 6 months. In men with very low PSA levels, conversion to a PSA above 4.0 ng/mL within 2 years or even 4 years after the initial test is very unlikely; for example, with an initial PSA < 1.0 ng/mL, only 0.24% had a positive test (PSA > 4 ng/mL) the following year and 0.51% at 2 years, whereas with an initial PSA of 1 ng/mL or 2 ng/mL, only 1.2% were positive at 1 year and 2.6% at 2 years.

### PSAzing up patient care: a quality improvement project for informed cancer screening [^1137VvqF]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Background

Prostate cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer and a leading cause of cancer mortality among men in the USA. The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2025, 313 780 individuals will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, and there will be approximately 35 770 deaths from prostate cancer.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing became clinically valuable for prostate cancer screening in the late 1980s. The Food and Drug Administration then approved the PSA test for monitoring prostate cancer progression in 1986. Subsequently, it was approved in conjunction with digital rectal examinations for screening asymptomatic men for prostate cancer in 1994. The widespread use of PSA testing in the 1990s led to an increase in prostate cancer diagnoses, and initially, PSA testing was recommended for all men aged 50 years and older, predicated on the finding that early detection of clinically significant prostate cancer can increase cure rates. However, following widespread adoption, studies began to show that PSA may not be as effective at screening as initially thought, and there were demonstrated harms associated with overdiagnosis.

Many men found themselves subjected to biopsy, treatment and side effects for slow-growing or indolent forms of prostate cancer that likely would not contribute to mortality. Other potential harms associated with PSA testing include anxiety and stress surrounding the testing process, false positives, which are common in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia and lead to unnecessary procedures, and false negatives, especially those associated with aggressive, non-PSA-producing tumours, leading to confusion for patients who are later diagnosed with prostate cancer. This newfound nuance to testing led to changes in guideline recommendations and the endorsement of shared decision-making (SDM) regarding testing to ensure patients' values and preferences were discussed and respected.

SDM is a collaborative process in which clinicians and patients partner to make healthcare decisions, integrating the best available scientific evidence with patient's values, goals and preferences. Conversations should be comprehensive of benefits, risks and alternatives, with time allocation determined by the complexity of the decision and patient needs rather than a fixed duration. Clinical guidelines from organisations such as the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the American Urological Association endorse this practice, emphasising the need for clinicians to engage patients in meaningful conversations about screening options. In its 2018 recommendations, the USPSTF highlights that men aged 55–69 years should make individual decisions about PSA testing after discussion with their healthcare provider, while discouraging routine screening for men aged 70 years and older due to potential harms outweighing benefits.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a clinical practice guideline [^116wQnDq]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Current practice

Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men and is the leading cause of cancer death in 24 countries, ranking eighth globally, sixth in high income countries, and 12th in low income countries. Prostate cancer screening is with a PSA blood test. A raised PSA level can be a sign of prostate cancer but can also occur due to a non-cancerous enlargement or inflammation of the prostate. Many men have a raised PSA level without having cancer (that is, false positive results). Conversely, a substantial number of men with a low PSA level will subsequently be diagnosed with prostate cancer (false negative results).

Investigations after raised PSA

If PSA is raised, the test is usually repeated. Men with persistently elevated PSA levels typically undergo a transrectal, ultrasound-guided, core-needle biopsy of the prostate to test for prostate cancer (see main infographic). If cancer is detected in the biopsied tissue, management options include surgery, radiation therapy, hormonal treatment, active surveillance, or watchful waiting. Diagnostic imaging studies such as ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bone scan, and computed tomography, are often also performed, especially in men presenting with higher risk disease, to check for disease spread.

Screening controversy

For many reasons, PSA screening remains controversial. Advocates often base their opinions on the European Randomised study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC), which suggests that screening may reduce the long term risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality by at least 9% (relative reduction). They also note that substantial observational evidence indicates a reduction in advanced disease and reduction in prostate cancer mortality, which they attribute to the introduction of PSA screening. Opponents of PSA screening highlight the indolent natural course of prostate cancer, citing systematic reviews that reported little or no impact of PSA screening on overall and prostate cancer-specific mortality. Opponents also suggest that the harms and burden from overdiagnosis and overtreatment resulting in unnecessary prostate biopsies and impaired urinary, sexual, and bowel function as side effects of surgery or radiation therapy outweigh the uncertain and modest benefits.

### Structured population-based prostate-specific antigen screening for prostate cancer: the European Association of Urology position in 2019 [^114eLx7D]. European Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the first three causes of cancer mortality in Europe. Screening in asymptomatic men (aged 55–69yr) using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is associated with a migration toward lower staged disease and a reduction in cancer-specific mortality. By 20yr after testing, around 100 men need to be screened to prevent one PCa death. While this ratio is smaller than for breast and colon cancer, the long natural history of PCa means many men die from other causes. As such, the nonselective use of PSA testing and radical treatments can lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. The European Association of Urology (EAU) supports measures to encourage appropriate PCa detection through PSA testing, while reducing overdiagnosis and overtreatment. These goals may be achieved using personalized risk-stratified approaches. For diagnosis, the greatest benefit from early detection is likely to come in men assessed using baseline PSA levels at the age of 45yr to individualize screening intervals. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging as well as risk calculators based on family history, ethnicity, digital rectal examination, and prostate volume should be considered to triage the need for biopsy, thus reducing the risk of overdiagnosis. For treatment, the EAU advocates balancing patient's life expectancy and cancer's mortality risk when deciding an approach. Active surveillance is encouraged in well-informed patients with low-risk and some intermediate-risk cancers, as it decreases the risks of overtreatment without compromising oncological outcomes. Conversely, the EAU advocates radical treatment in suitable men with more aggressive PCa. Multimodal treatment should be considered in locally advanced or high-grade cancers. PATIENT SUMMARY: Implementation of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening should be considered at a population level. Men at risk of prostate cancer should have a baseline PSA blood test (eg, at 45yr). The level of this test, combined with family history, ethnicity, and other factors, can be used to determine subsequent follow-up. Magnetic resonance imaging scans and novel biomarkers should be used to determine which men need biopsy and how any cancers should be treated.

### Randomized trial results did not resolve controversies surrounding prostate cancer screening [^117Dyxn1]. Current Opinion in Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Prostate cancer screening remains controversial. This review will address recently published results from randomized controlled screening trials as well as current practice guidelines.

Recent Findings

The Prostate Lung Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial found that screening did not decrease prostate cancer mortality after 7 years of follow-up. High-screening rates in the control group, the low number of deaths from prostate cancer, and the relatively short follow-up duration contributed to the negative results. The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer found that screening reduced prostate cancer mortality by 20% during a median 9 years of follow-up. However, the absolute benefit (0.7/1000 reduction) was small and was associated with a 70% increase in prostate cancer diagnosis. Subsequently, the American Urological Association recommended beginning screening at the age of 40 years and not relying on a specific prostate-specific antigen cutoff for biopsy referral. The United States Preventive Services Task Force and American Cancer Society have yet to issue updated guidelines.

Summary

The randomized trials suggest that screening at best will have a small survival benefit but substantial potential risk for overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Patients need to understand these tradeoffs in order to make informed decisions about screening.

PSA thresholds for prompting biopsy — no universal cutoff: In considering whether a biopsy should be performed based on overall or high-grade cancer risk, "no absolute PSA level exists that is applicable to all men". Instead, "the risk level at which a biopsy should be considered should be based on factors related to a man's life expectancy (age, comorbidities) as well as a man's concern regarding his risk", and because detection and treatments can entail harms, "the level of risk at which a biopsy should be undertaken should be based on a man's integration of these considerations into his decision making".

### Screening for prostate cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^114qy1TV]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2008 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on screening for prostate cancer.

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed new evidence on the benefits and harms of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening for prostate cancer, as well as the benefits and harms of treatment of localized prostate cancer.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends against PSA-based screening for prostate cancer (grade D recommendation). This recommendation applies to men in the general U.S. population, regardless of age. This recommendation does not include the use of the PSA test for surveillance after diagnosis or treatment of prostate cancer; the use of the PSA test for this indication is outside the scope of the USPSTF.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and cancer risk — historical thresholds and biopsy-era findings: A PSA value of 4.0 ng/mL was accepted as the upper limit of normal, but prostate cancer rates were significant at lower PSA levels (between 2.5 ng/mL and 4.0 ng/mL), and men with PSA levels < 2.5 ng/mL were believed to have low risk. With biopsies performed across all PSA levels, PSA "should not be considered 'elevated' or 'normal', because prostate cancer was identified at all levels of PSA, including values < 1.0 ng/mL", and "the higher the PSA, the higher the risk of cancer", with aggressive cancers identified at higher levels.

### Association of the USPSTF grade D recommendation against prostate-specific antigen screening with prostate cancer-specific mortality [^114QWnHC]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the 2012 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) Grade D recommendation against prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening for all men associated with prostate cancer–specific mortality (PCSM)?

Findings

This cross-sectional study found statistically significant changes in PCSM rates that coincided with the change in the screening guideline; PCSM rates were decreasing prior to the recommendation and remained steady after the recommendation.

Meaning

This study suggests that the change in the USPSTF PSA screening guideline to a Grade D recommendation against PSA screening for all men may have been associated with the stagnancy of PCSM rates.

### Lifetime benefits and harms of prostate-specific antigen–based risk-stratified screening for prostate cancer [^111DZPBh]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2020). Medium credibility.

It has long been understood that controlling the harm–benefit trade-off of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening is critical for its sustainability. Strategies for reducing harms while preserving benefits include screening less frequently, using higher thresholds for biopsy referral in older men, and tailoring screening algorithms by PSA level.

The recommendation to stratify screening by PSA level is largely based on studies that stored ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid plasma in an unscreened cohort of Swedish men aged 44–60 years in the 1980s. Prostate cancer cases diagnosed up to 25 years later had statistically significantly higher PSA levels at their baseline blood draw than those not diagnosed. There was also a strong association between baseline PSA and prostate cancer mortality: 44% of prostate cancer deaths occurred in men with PSA in the top 10% of the PSA distribution at ages 44–49 years. In addition, only 0.2% of men with PSA below 1.0 ng/mL at age 60 years died from prostate cancer within 25 years. Other studies, including screened and unscreened cohorts, have confirmed that baseline PSA predicts the risk of future prostate cancer diagnosis or prostate cancer death. These studies have motivated proposals to tailor the screening intensity to a man's current PSA level. However, the implications of such stratified policies for clinically important outcomes, such as prostate cancer deaths or overdiagnosis, compared with current practices have not been evaluated. Despite this, some guidelines are already incorporating PSA-stratified screening. The European Association of Urology guideline states that targeting men at a higher risk of prostate cancer (older than age 50 years, or with PSA > 1.0 ng/mL at age 40 years, or > 2.0 ng/mL at age 60 years) might reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies. The American Urological Association guideline suggests that baseline PSA may be used to guide alternative screening strategies that screen less frequently.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^114a5coV]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

American Cancer Society guideline — shared decision-making for prostate cancer screening emphasizes involving men in whether to initiate and continue testing and states that men must have a basic understanding of the potential benefits of early detection, the strengths and limitations of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, and the risks of finding and treating screen-detected cancer. Health care providers can and should play a critical role, and we encourage providers and patients to use prostate cancer screening decision aids; for men who are unable to decide, the screening decision can be left to the discretion of the health care provider, who should factor into the decision his or her knowledge of the patient's general health preferences and values. In view of the delay between diagnosis through screening and the expected mortality benefit, we continue to recommend that men whose life expectancy is less than 10 years not pursue prostate cancer early detection, noting that the likelihood of benefit in these men is sufficiently low to be outweighed by the risk of harms from treatment in the near term.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111cpVHw]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Implications for clinicians and policy makers

This systematic review provides important information for an individual man's decision making about prostate cancer screening. It supported the development of an evidence based clinical practice guideline, as reflected in the accompanying Rapid Recommendation article. Our analysis indicates that PSA screening yields, at best, only a small benefit in prostate cancer specific mortality but does not reduce overall mortality. This small benefit should be weighed against the potential short term complications (biopsy related, false positive and false negative findings) and long term downstream effects (treatment related side effects, in particular related to urinary and sexual function). The latest results of the PIVOT and ProtecT trials should help guideline developers identify the subset of patients with clinically localised prostate cancer who will likely benefit from local, curative treatment while avoiding overtreatment. Although active surveillance is increasingly accepted to treat low risk prostate cancer, it is burdensome to patients due to the need for frequent follow-up visits, PSA testing, digital rectal examinations, prostate biopsies, and, recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The value of MRI in determining which prostate cancers appear clinically relevant versus indolent seems promising but remains uncertain in the context of PSA screening.

Introduction

Guidelines currently recommend shared decision-making between males and their health care clinicians regarding prostate cancer screening using prostate-specific antigen (PSA), taking into consideration patient age and life expectancy. However, it is unclear the extent to which life expectancy is associated with screening practices among older males. We estimated the frequency of PSA-based screening by patient age and estimated life expectancy using data from a national survey.

American Cancer Society (ACS) recommendations for higher-risk men — The ACS continues to recommend that African American men and men who have a family history of a first-degree relative with prostate cancer be provided information about the uncertainties, risks, and potential benefits surrounding prostate cancer screening beginning at age 45 years. For men who have multiple first-degree relatives diagnosed with prostate cancer before age 65 years, this discussion should take place beginning at age 40 years. For men who choose to be screened, the ACS recommends integrating established risk factors into an individualized risk assessment, particularly when PSA levels fall into what currently would be considered the high-normal range of 2.5 ng/mL to 4.0 ng/mL.

### Screening for prostate cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111Dhxgp]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Prostate cancer screening — age-related evidence scope and counseling: The 3 large randomized clinical trials predominantly included men aged 55 to 69 years. There is inadequate evidence on starting screening at a younger age or to obtain a baseline PSA level, and evidence in men 70 years or older does not support routine screening. Although some older men may request screening, men older than 70 years who request screening should be aware of the reduced likelihood of benefit and the increased risk of false-positive test results and complications of diagnosis and treatment.

### Who and when should we screen for prostate cancer? Interviews with key opinion leaders [^113LykA8]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Our personal view is that PSA screening should indeed involve shared decision-making, but we believe the focus should primarily be on behavior, rather than preference. For this purpose, we have published a decision-support tool called the 'Simple Schema', which acknowledges that the majority of harms of screening result from unnecessary treatment of low-risk disease and therefore focuses on the importance of active surveillance as the appropriate, evidence-based management strategy for low-risk cancer. We further believe that PSA screening should be a risk-stratified approach aimed at detecting lethal prostate cancer. This is based on evidence that only a small proportion of men with moderately elevated PSA have aggressive disease and that overdiagnosis is strongly influenced by age and PSA levels. For instance, we have shown that almost half of the excess incidence of cancer associated with PSA testing occurs in men over 70 – a group in which screening is likely of little, if any, benefit – and that the effects of screening men in their 60s is highly dependent on their PSA level, with an excellent ratio of harms to benefits in patients with PSA ≥ 2 ng/mL but zero benefit in patients with a lower PSA. Therefore, the current guidelines in place at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center restrict screening in men over 60 to those with above average PSAs and dramatically restrict screening in men over 70 to a small number of men with exceptional health and high PSA. Additionally, biopsy is recommended only after a repeat PSA and further work-up, and the frequency of screening is stratified depending on baseline PSA, which has been shown to be a very strong predictor of long-term prostate cancer metastasis and death.

We were interested in hearing the experts elaborate on these nuances of screening as we believe this would help us forward in striving to identify the group of men who might benefit from screening and those who might not.

US Preventive Services Task Force prostate cancer screening recommendations — For men aged 55 to 69 years, the decision to undergo periodic prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening for prostate cancer "should be an individual one and should include discussion of the potential benefits and harms of screening with their clinician", and "Screening offers a small potential benefit of reducing the chance of death from prostate cancer in some men". The statement adds "Clinicians should not screen men who do not express a preference for screening.

Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy diagnosed in men and the second leading cause of cancer death for men in the United States. Widespread use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening led to a decrease in mortality; however, PSA screening may have led to overdiagnosis and overtreatment of clinically insignificant cancers. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) released a statement recommending against the use of PSA, which was met with concern from professional organizations.

### Viewpoint: limiting prostate cancer screening [^114UBZ33]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer screening is controversial, and major professional associations offer differing screening guidelines. The author addresses 3 key issues about prostate cancer screening: 1) the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) criteria to recommend a prostate biopsy, 2) the appropriate age to start screening, and 3) the appropriate age to stop screening. The author argues, on the basis of evidence published since 2000, that data supporting the efficacy of PSA screening remain unconvincing. The author recommends that screening should not be expanded to include average-risk men younger than age 50 years or older than age 75 years and that a PSA threshold below 4.0 ng/mL should not be used to trigger biopsy referral.

Update of the 2002 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement about screening for prostate cancer.

Methods

The USPSTF evaluated randomized, controlled trials of the benefits of prostate cancer screening; cohort and cross-sectional studies of the psychological harms of false-positive prostate-specific antigen test results; and evidence on the natural history of prostate-specific antigen-detected prostate cancer to address previously identified gaps in the evidence from the 2002 USPSTF recommendation.

### Prostate cancer screening [^116MUTHh]. Current Oncology Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in American men. Although the use of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test for prostate cancer screening since the 1990s has led to increased early diagnoses, the most recent studies are in conflict about the risks and benefits of routine prostate cancer screening. Recently, evidence has emerged to support the use of the PSA test to lower mortality, but there is still concern that over-diagnosis may lead to over-treatment of cancers that would not significantly affect patients' health for several years. This article describes the results of important recent prostate cancer screening trials, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American Cancer Society screening guidelines, and discusses the implications for clinical practice.

### Prostate cancer screening: common questions and answers [^112vm4Rq]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer is the most diagnosed noncutaneous malignancy and the second most common cause of cancer death among men in the United States. Risk factors include older age, family history of prostate cancer, and Black race. Screening via prostate-specific antigen testing may lead to a small reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality, with no reduction in all-cause mortality, but it can cause significant harms related to false-positive test results, unnecessary biopsies, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment. Shared decision-making is strongly recommended by all national guidelines before initiating screening. Most guidelines recommend screening every 2 to 4 years in men 55 to 69 years of age at average risk. After a positive prostate-specific antigen test result (more than 4 ng/mL), the test should be repeated. If the prostate-specific antigen level is still elevated, next steps include multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, assessment of urine or blood biomarkers, and referral to urology. Active surveillance is increasingly accepted as the preferred standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed low-risk prostate cancer, because it is associated with similar long-term survival and better quality of life than curative treatment. The primary intent of screening is to identify patients with clinically significant prostate cancer who may benefit from curative treatment while minimizing the detection of clinically insignificant cancer.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a clinical practice guideline [^113TBkoF]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

The Rapid Recommendations executive felt this new study — taken together with extended follow-up data from existing trials — required a new appraisal of the body of evidence for patients and clinicians.

Although the results of this study suggest screening is not worthwhile, several guidelines advocate offering screening in some cases. The study was much larger than previous studies, and existing trials had published more extended follow-up results, and the BMJ Rapid Recommendations team felt these merited a new appraisal of the body of evidence. This guideline aims to promptly and transparently translate potentially practice-changing evidence to usable recommendations for clinicians and patients, based on the GRADE framework and following standards for trustworthy guidelines.

The panel suggests against systematic PSA screening (weak recommendation). The panel members judged that most men will decline screening because the benefit is small and uncertain and there are clear harms. However, there is likely considerable variation in values and preferences. Men with family history of prostate cancer, African descent or of lower socioeconomic status, having higher baseline risk of prostate cancer death, may be more likely to choose PSA screening. Shared decision making is needed for men considering screening.

### The new US preventive services task force "C" draft recommendation for prostate cancer screening [^116ds3gH]. European Urology (2017). Low credibility.

The US Preventive Services Task Force has issued a new draft guideline, with a "C" recommendation that men aged 55–69 yr should be informed about the benefits and harms of screening for prostate cancer, and offered prostate-specific antigen testing if they choose it. For men aged ≥ 70 yr, the recommendation remains "D", or "do not screen". This draft represents substantial progress in the right direction towards offering men a fair opportunity to discuss the risks and benefits of screening with their primary care providers. However, the evidence review underlying the draft remains fundamentally inadequate, leading to biased presentations of both benefits and harms of screening. The final guideline and future revisions should reflect formal engagement with subject matter experts to optimize the advise given to men and their physicians.

Men at average risk should receive this information beginning at age 50 years, and men in higher risk groups should receive this information before age 50 years. Men should either receive this information directly from their health care providers or be referred to reliable and culturally appropriate sources, and patient decision aids are helpful in preparing men to make a decision whether to be tested.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a clinical practice guideline [^114sR23Q]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

How this recommendation was created

Our international panel included patient partners (men at risk of prostate cancer), general practitioners, general internists, urologists, epidemiologists, methodologists, and statisticians. They determined the scope of the question that the recommendation should address and what outcomes are most important to patients considering screening.

No person had financial conflicts of interest; intellectual and professional conflicts were minimised and managed (see appendix 1 on bmj.com).

The panel identified eight critical outcomes needed to inform the recommendations: all-cause mortality; prostate cancer mortality; incidence of prostate cancer diagnoses (all stages); incidence of localised cancer (stage I and II); incidence of advanced cancer (stage III and IV); complications from biopsies (such as bleeding, pain, infections, and hospital readmissions), complications from prostate cancer treatment (such as urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction); and quality of life. The panel also identified three additional patient-important outcomes: false positive rates (men with elevated PSA levels who will have negative biopsy); false negative rates (men with a normal PSA result who will subsequently be diagnosed with cancer), and the anxiety and uncertainty related to concerns about having prostate cancer. The panel asked that potential subgroups effects be explored according to age, screening interval, family history, being of African descent, and being of lower socioeconomic level. They also asked for a sensitivity analysis of the effect of screening restricted to trials at lower risk of bias.

To inform the recommendation, the panel members requested two systematic reviews, on the following questions:

What are the benefits and harms of PSA screening versus no screening?
What evidence describes the values and preference of men considering PSA screening?

Two parallel teams conducted these systematic reviews, which are linked to this publication.

The panel met to discuss the evidence and formulate a recommendation. They followed the BMJ Rapid Recommendations procedures for creating a trustworthy recommendation, including use of the GRADE approach to interpret the evidence and create recommendations (see appendix 2 on bmj.com). The panel considered the balance of benefits, harms, and burdens of PSA screening; the quality of the evidence for each outcome; and typical and expected variations in patient values and preferences, as well as feasibility and acceptability. Recommendations can be strong or weak, for or against a course of action. The recommendations take a patient centred perspective which de-emphasises public health, societal, and health payer point of view.

### Screening for prostate cancer in U.S. men ACPM position statement on preventive practice [^114ionZZ]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Prostate cancer is the leading cancer in U.S. men, and the third leading cause of cancer deaths. Principal screening tests for detection of asymptomatic prostate cancer include digital rectal examination (DRE) and measurement of the serum tumor marker, prostate-specific antigen (PSA). There are risks and benefits associated with prostate cancer screening. Randomized controlled trials of screening by DRE and PSA are limited to two previously published studies. Two other large-scale randomized controlled trials are currently in progress.

Methods

This study reviewed the efficacy of DRE and PSA for prostate cancer screening found in the medical literature prior to July 2007.

Results

Applications of PSA screening tests used in clinical practice include (1) a PSA cutoff of 4 ng/ml, (2) age-specific PSA, (3) PSA velocity, (4) PSA density, and (5) percent free PSA. Prostate cancer screening can detect early disease and offers the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality. Prostate cancer screening benefits, however, remain unproven, pending results of ongoing trials. There is currently no convincing evidence that early screening, detection, and treatment improves mortality. Limitations of prostate cancer screening include potential adverse health effects associated with false-positive and negative results, and treatment side effects.

Conclusions

The American College of Preventive Medicine concludes that there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine population screening with DRE or PSA. Clinicians caring for men, especially African-American men and those with positive family histories, should provide information about potential benefits and risks of prostate cancer screening, and the limitations of current evidence for screening, in order to maximize informed decision making.

### Would you recommend prostate-specific antigen screening for this patient? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^115Grbi1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer is the third most common cancer type in the United States overall, accounting for 9.5% of new cancer cases and 5% of cancer deaths. The goal of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening is to identify early-stage disease that can be treated successfully. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) reviewed evidence on the benefits and harms of PSA-based screening and treatment of screen-detected prostate cancer. It found that PSA-based screening in men aged 55 to 69 years prevents approximately 1.3 deaths from prostate cancer over 13 years per 1000 men screened and 3 cases of metastatic cancer per 1000 men screened, with no reduction in all-cause mortality. No benefit was found for PSA-based screening in men aged 70 years and older. On the basis of its review, the USPSTF concluded that the decision for men aged 55 to 69 years to have PSA-based screening should be an individual one and should include a discussion of the potential benefits and harms. Here, 2 experts-an internist and a urologist-discuss the key points of a shared decision-making conversation about PSA-based prostate cancer screening, the PSA-based screening strategy that optimizes benefit and minimizes harm, and the PSA threshold at which they would recommend further diagnostic testing.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening interval — American Cancer Society (ACS) 2010 guideline: Thresholds between 2.0 ng/mL and 4.0 ng/mL were examined, and a conservative cutoff point within this range would be 2.5 ng/mL. The ACS recommends that men whose initial PSA level is below 2.5 ng/mL can reduce their screening frequency to every 2 years, while men with higher PSA values should be tested annually.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^111zjN33]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test thresholds and performance — Using a threshold of 4 ng/mL in average-risk men, the rate of PSA test positivity varies between 9% and 11%, the cancer detection rate is about 3%, the positive predictive value (PPV) ranges from 28% to 32%, and specificity remains high (92%-94%). When lower thresholds are used (2.0 ng/mL or 2.5 ng/mL), PPVs are substantially higher among men with a positive family history (38%-43%) with variable specificity (64%-93%). PSA screening in higher risk populations is characterized by higher detection rates and higher PPVs, but it is stated that we still do not know whether PSA screening performs better in higher risk men in terms of reduced prostate-specific mortality; the ERSPC observed no effect of age on mortality and neither the PLCO nor the ERSPC has reported subgroup analyses examining the impact of ethnicity or family history.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^1161wJgF]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

American Cancer Society prostate cancer early detection guideline — development and methods began by commissioning a series of systematic evidence reviews across early detection of prostate cancer, harms of therapy for localized prostate cancer, and shared and informed decision making in prostate cancer screening; within early detection, searches addressed 1) efficacy of screening in reducing mortality from prostate cancer, 2) test characteristics of prostate cancer screening in asymptomatic men, including sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value, and 3) physical and psychological harms associated with screening; searches related to the harms of treating clinically localized prostate cancer were limited to radical prostatectomy, external-beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, androgen-deprivation therapy, watchful waiting, and active surveillance; IDM/SDM searches targeted asymptomatic men without a diagnosis of prostate cancer and included intervention designs such as randomized controlled trials, randomized controlled trials with preintervention and postintervention, preintervention and postintervention with control, and preintervention and postintervention without control, with IDM/SDM outcomes categorized as 1) knowledge, 2) screening rates, 3) screening intention, 4) decisional conflict, 5) decisional confidence, 6) decisional anxiety, 7) decision/role preferences, 8) satisfaction, and 9) other; studies were identified by searching Medline for articles published between January 1950 and June 2009, with two authors independently reviewing titles, abstracts, and full texts and independently abstracting data, stratifying data when appropriate by characteristics such as age, race, and positive family history of prostate cancer, and resolving discrepancies by discussion; results were provided to all members of the ACS Prostate Cancer Advisory Committee, supplemented by presentations by experts, deliberated in meetings and conference calls, and then the guideline with the supporting document was circulated to peer reviewers and to the ACS Mission Outcomes Committee for review.

Current guidelines on PSA testing

Guidelines vary in their recommendations on PSA testing (see table 1). The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care recommends against PSA screening for men aged 55 to 69 years. However, the US Preventive Services Task Force recently changed its guidance to say that "the decision about whether to be screened for prostate cancer should be an individual one", without clearly suggesting for or against screening: previously it recommended against screening in that group. National Cancer Center Network (NCCN) guidelines (which represents cancer centres in the USA) recommends initiating PSA screening at age 45 years. Guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA)and European Association of Urology (EAU)recommend a discussion about PSA screening with patients.

Table 1
Major guideline recommendations on PSA screening*

Uptake of PSA testing

The incidence of prostate cancer has dramatically increased over the last quarter century. This has been associated with widespread use of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing detecting early stage prostate cancers. There is wide variation in the adoption of prostate cancer screening. In the UK, about 39% of men aged 45–69 years have undergone PSA testing in the past 10 years. In Sweden 23% of men aged 50–69 had a PSA test in the previous 12 months and 58% in the previous 10 years. Although the rates of screening have declined during the past decade in the US, up to half of US men aged 60–74 undergo screening each year. Also, as many as 33% of elderly US men with competing medical comorbidities at high risk of dying from other cause underwent screening, and twice as many of these men recalled discussing the potential benefits rather than harms of screening. African-Americans were less likely to have been screened than non-African US men. Overall, two thirds of men reported no past discussion with physicians about the advantages, disadvantages, or scientific uncertainty and no shared decision making about prostate cancer screening.

### Early detection of prostate cancer: AUA / SUO guideline part I: prostate cancer screening [^1121bo26]. The Journal of Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The summary presented herein covers recommendations on the early detection of prostate cancer and provides a framework to facilitate clinical decision-making in the implementation of prostate cancer screening, biopsy, and follow-up. This is Part I of a two-part series that focuses on prostate cancer screening. Please refer to Part II for discussion of initial and repeat biopsies as well as biopsy technique.

Materials and Methods

The systematic review utilized to inform this guideline was conducted by an independent methodological consultant. The systematic review was based on searches in Ovid MEDLINE and Embase and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (January 1, 2000-November 21, 2022). Searches were supplemented by reviewing reference lists of relevant articles.

Results

The Early Detection of Prostate Cancer Panel developed evidence- and consensus-based guideline statements to provide guidance in prostate cancer screening, initial and repeat biopsy, and biopsy technique.

Conclusions

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based prostate cancer screening in combination with shared decision-making (SDM) is recommended. Current data regarding risk from population-based cohorts provide a basis for longer screening intervals and tailored screening, and the use of available online risk calculators is encouraged.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a clinical practice guideline [^116yxJLe]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

What you need to know

PSA testing has increased the number of men diagnosed with and treated for prostate cancer, but many of these men would never have experienced any symptoms or death from prostate cancer
This guideline makes a weak recommendation against offering systematic PSA screening based on an updated systematic review. The recommendation is weak because there may be a small, though uncertain, benefit of screening on prostate cancer mortality
Men who place more value on avoiding complications from biopsies and cancer treatment are likely to decline screening. In contrast, men who put more value in even a small reduction of prostate cancer mortality (such as men at high baseline risk because of family history or African descent, or those concerned to rule out the diagnosis) may opt for screening
Shared decision making is needed for men considering screening to make a decision consistent with their individual values and preferences. However, clinicians need not feel obligated to systematically raise the issue of PSA screening with their patients

What is the role of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in prostate cancer? An expert panel produced these recommendations based on a linked systematic review. The review was triggered by a large scale, cluster randomised trial on PSA screening in men without a previous diagnosis of prostate cancer published in 2018 (box 1). It found no difference between one-time PSA screening and standard practice in prostate cancer mortality but found an increase in the detection of low risk prostate cancer after a median follow-up of 10 years.

Box 1
Results of the CAP Randomized Clinical Trial

This cluster-randomised trial of 419 582 British men was published in March 2018. After a median follow-up of 10 years, there was no significant difference in prostate cancer-specific mortality in men receiving care by general practices randomised to a single PSA screening intervention compared with men receiving care by practices randomised to standard practice without screening. The detection of low risk prostate cancer cases was higher in the PSA screening group. Although the trial had limitations, such as low adherence to PSA testing in the intervention arm (36%) and a follow-up of only 10 years, its findings do not support the use of single PSA testing for population based screening.

### Low-value prostate-specific antigen screening in older males [^113HgSM8]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Prostate cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in males worldwide. While screening for prostate cancer may reduce prostate cancer–specific mortality, it comes at the risk of overdiagnosis, particularly in older males or those with comorbid medical conditions. Screening with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in males who are unlikely to benefit from intervention for prostate cancer exposes these individuals to anxiety, invasive biopsies, and possible overtreatment, which could lead to unnecessary clinical consequences.

Given the lack of evidence of clinical benefit of PSA screening for prostate cancer in older males, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) published revised guidelines in 2018 that advised against PSA screening for prostate cancer in males 70 years or older due to the risk of false-positive results and overdiagnosis of indolent disease. These guidelines now recommend that males aged 55 to 69 years make the personal decision to undergo PSA screening after discussing its potential benefits and risks with their physician.

To characterize the factors associated with low-value PSA screening in males 70 years or older, we analyzed a cohort of males from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a nationwide survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We hypothesized that, despite the advice to the contrary, PSA screening in older males remains overused.

### A discussion on controversies and ethical dilemmas in prostate cancer screening [^111A6Tei]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the the most common cancers in men. A blood test called prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has a potential to pick up this cancer very early and is used for screening of this disease. However, screening for prostate cancer is a matter of debate. Level 1 evidence from randomised controlled trials suggests a reduction in cancer-specific mortality from PCa screening. However, there could be an associated impact on quality of life due to a high proportion of overdiagnosis and overtreatment as part of the screening. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in 2012 recommended that PSA-based PCa screening should not to be offered at any age. However, considering the current evidence, USPSTF recently revised its recommendation to offer the PSA test to men aged 55–69 years with shared decision-making, in line with earlier guidelines from the American Cancer Society and the American Urological Association. A shared decision making is necessary since the PSA test could potentially harm an individual. However, the literature suggests that clinicians often neglect a discussion on this issue before ordering the test. This narrative discusses the main controversies regarding PCa screening including the PSA threshold for biopsy, the concept of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, the practical difficulties of active surveillance, the current level 1 evidence on the mortality benefit of screening, and the associated pitfalls. It offers a detailed discussion on the ethics involved in the PSA test and highlights the barriers to shared decision-making and possible solutions.

### Prostate cancer screening… [^116fF3YC]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Do not routinely screen for prostate cancer using a prostate-specific antigen test or digital rectal exam. For men who desire PSA screening, it should only be performed after engaging in shared decision making. Screening for prostate cancer using PSA may prevent mortality from prostate cancer for a small number of men, while putting many men at risk for long term harms, such as urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Whether this potentially small benefit in mortality outweighs the potential harms is dependent on the values and preferences of individual men. Therefore, for men who express a desire for prostate cancer screening, it should only be performed following a discussion of the potential benefits and harms. Routine screening for prostate cancer should not be done. PSA-based prostate cancer screening should not be performed in men over 70 years of age. Sources American Academy of Family Physicians.

### EAU guidelines on prostate cancer [^112tSffC]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To develop clinical guidelines for the management of patients with prostate cancer.

Methods

Guidelines were compiled by a working panel based on current literature following a literature review using MEDLINE. Already published structured analysis from national and international guidelines was used, and panel consensus was employed when literature evidence was absent or of poor quality.

Results

The full text of the guidelines is available through the EAU Central Office and the EAU website (www.uroweb.org). This article summarizes the main conclusions from the guidelines concerning the diagnosis and staging, treatment and follow-up of patients with prostate cancer. The diagnosis of prostate cancer should be based on histopathological or cytological examinations. N- and M-staging may be omitted in selected patients with a low serum prostate-specific antigen due to low risk of metastasis. Active treatment is warranted in most stages of prostate cancer but active monitoring is recommended for elderly patients with early stage tumours and is still optional in some other situations. Follow-up is based on a disease-specific history, serum-prostate-specific antigen supplemented by a digital rectal examination. Routine imaging is not necessary in asymptomatic patients.

Conclusions

Prostate cancer is one of the most common malignancies in men. These guidelines have been drawn up to provide support in the management of this large group of patients.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^112aReUs]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

American Cancer Society prostate cancer screening — men for whom screening is not recommended: For localized or regional prostate cancer the 5-year relative survival rate is nearly 100%, potential survival benefits from screening accrue late, and overdiagnosis is common; therefore ACS early detection guidelines have recommended that screening for prostate cancer be offered only to those men who are judged to have at least a 10-year life expectancy, and men who are unlikely to survive for at least 10 years are not suitable candidates. Supporting data include that in the ERSPC the survival curves for screened and unscreened groups did not separate significantly until 9 or 10 years after initiation, and it is estimated that from 23% to 42% of screen-detected cancers represent overdiagnosis, with rates that may exceed 50% in men aged 75 years and older; at age 75 years, about half of men have a life expectancy of 10 years or more.

### Update on PSA testing [^1152tRu9]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2007). Low credibility.

The use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing for prostate cancer screening has increased dramatically over the past decade. Determining the most efficient way to use PSA testing and how to interpret total PSA levels and changes in PSA values over time remain challenging. Guidelines for early detection of prostate cancer have a direct impact on the number of unnecessary tests performed and are critical for developing a successful screening approach for prostate cancer. The age at which PSA screening should begin, PSA testing intervals, and the importance of understanding fluctuations in PSA values over time are discussed in the framework of recent discoveries in the field. Results from ongoing randomized trials will confirm whether prostate cancer screening is an effective method for reducing deaths from prostate cancer and what approaches will provide the most cost-effective screening strategies.

### Screening intervals and… [^114n7ams]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

The AAFP does not recommend routine prostate-specific antigen -based screening for prostate cancer. For men aged 55 through 69 who are considering periodic prostate cancer screening, clinicians should discuss the risks and benefits and engage in shared decision-making that enables an informed choice. Screening for prostate cancer using PSA may prevent mortality from prostate cancer for a small number of men, while putting many men at risk for long term harms, such as urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Whether this potentially small benefit in mortality outweighs the potential harms is dependent on the values and preferences of individual men. Therefore, for men who express a desire for prostate cancer screening, it should only be performed following a discussion of the potential benefits and harms. Routine screening for prostate cancer should not be done. See Clinical Considerations for more information.

The AAFP recommends against screening for prostate cancer in men aged 70 and older. Screening for prostate cancer using PSA may prevent mortality from prostate cancer for a small number of men, while putting many men at risk for long term harms, such as urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Whether this potentially small benefit in mortality outweighs the potential harms is dependent on the values and preferences of individual men. Therefore, for men who express a desire for prostate cancer screening, it should only be performed following a discussion of the potential benefits and harms. The studies of prostate cancer screening used different screening intervals and different PSA thresholds. The ideal screening strategy has not been determined, but single screens were not shown to be effective. For men who choose to undergo screening for prostate cancer, they should not be screened more frequently than every 2 years. A PSA level of 4.

0 ng/mL is a commonly used cutoff, but thresholds vary. Lower thresholds will result in higher rates of false positives, overdiagnosis, and associated harms, while higher thresholds may minimize harms but potentially lower the mortality benefit. Digital Rectal Exam does not improve detection of prostate cancer and should not be performed as a part of screening.

Prostate cancer screening — screening modalities and adjuncts: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening is the usual method, but evidence is insufficient to support one method of PSA-based screening over another, and evidence is also insufficient that a prebiopsy risk calculator (with or without free PSA), genetic tests, or adjunctive imaging meaningfully change benefits and harms; the use of digital rectal examination as a screening modality is not recommended because of lack of evidence and its exclusion from major trials.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^116dPYfz]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

American Cancer Society prostate cancer early detection — PSA thresholds and shared decision-making are outlined as follows: we continue to recommend that men who are at greater risk for developing prostate cancer at earlier ages — African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer in nonelderly relatives — should be provided the opportunity for informed decision-making at a younger age than men who are at average risk. Recognizing that lowering the PSA threshold for biopsy will increase the rate of overdiagnosis, we consider the traditional PSA level of 4.0 ng/mL to be a reasonable threshold for further evaluation. Acknowledging that there is no true PSA cutoff point that distinguishes cancer from noncancer, we suggest that providers consider individualized decision making when PSA levels fall in the indeterminate range between 2.5 ng/mL and 4.0 ng/mL, particularly in men who are at increased risk for high-grade cancer based on non-PSA risk factors. Until that time, however, it will remain incumbent on health care providers and the health care system as a whole to provide men with the opportunity to decide whether they wish to pursue early detection of prostate cancer.

### Prostate cancer screening: the continuing controversy [^117MnhKD]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men, with a lifetime prevalence of 17 percent. Prostate cancer symptoms generally occur in advanced stages, making early detection desirable. Digital rectal examination and prostate-specific antigen testing are the most commonly used screening tools. The goal of screening is to detect clinically significant prostate cancers at a stage when intervention reduces morbidity and mortality; however, the merits and methods of screening continue to be debated. Prostate-specific antigen levels may be less than 4 ng per mL in 15 to 38 percent of men with cancer, indicating a high false-negative rate. The positive predictive value of the prostate-specific antigen test is approximately 30 percent; therefore, less than one in three men with an abnormal finding will have cancer on biopsy. These limitations of the prostate-specific antigen test have led to variations designed to improve its accuracy (e.g., age- and race-specific cutoffs, free prostate-specific antigen tests); however, none of these modifications have been widely adopted because of unclear benefits. Although treatments have improved in the past two decades, therapy for prostate cancer is not benign and may lead to urinary incontinence, sexual dysfunction, or bowel dysfunction. New evidence affecting screening recommendations continues to accumulate, and two large randomized controlled trials of screening will be completed in the next few years. Current guidelines recommend an individualized, targeted, patient-centered discussion to facilitate a shared decision about screening plans.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a clinical practice guideline [^117V7Q7Q]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Costs and resources

Results from a recent cost-effectiveness study modelled for the US suggested that screening between the ages of 55 and 69 years combined with active surveillance for low risk men could only be cost-effective at a $100 000 threshold if the screening frequency remains low (every four years) and active surveillance is offered to all men with low risk prostate cancer (that is, Gleason score ≤ 6 and stage ≤ T2a). Strategies with shorter screening intervals or in which immediate treatment is offered to all men were not cost-effective. Although the Rapid Recommendations panel focused on the patients' priorities rather than those of society, our recommendation is compatible with these findings.

Uncertainties for future research

Recent evidence suggests that incorporating MRI in the investigation of those with a positive PSA test result decreases the false positive rate, and thus the number of patients undergoing unnecessary biopsies, and may also increase the accuracy of biopsies in those who do have prostate cancer. The Rapid Recommendations panel considered addressing this issue in the guideline, but the impact of MRI on long term outcomes of prostate cancer incidence, mortality, and complications of treatment remains uncertain. Sophisticated decision modelling might shed light on this issue, but the panel decided not to conduct such an analysis because of logistic and feasibility considerations, and because the panel's review of the evidence suggests that modelling would introduce further uncertainties regarding the impact of MRI on patient-important outcomes.

Key research question to inform decision makers and future guidelines include

Could new screening and diagnostic techniques reduce the harms and burden of the diagnostic procedure by better identifying non-progressive and slowly progressive cancer from cancer that is likely to become symptomatic and affect quality or length of life? These strategies may include genetic markers or biomarkers, risk stratification tools, or MRI guided biopsy. For example, two recent high quality studies on MRI guided biopsy have shown encouraging results of MRI to reduce overdiagnosis, but the impact of this strategy on long term, patient-important outcomes (such as prostate cancer incidence, mortality, and complications of treatment) remains uncertain.
For men opting for screening, what would be the ideal age range and screening interval? Randomised trials varied in their offer of a one-off or repeated PSA testing and it remains uncertain which strategy is more suitable.
What is the impact of screening on men at higher baseline risk (men with a family history of cancer, of African descent, and of lower socioeconomic status)? Are their values and preferences different from those of men in the general population?

### Screening for prostate cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111rsE6o]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for prostate cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, general population, age 55–69 years, USPSTF 2018 guidelines recommend to individualize the decision on obtaining screening for prostate cancer in males aged 55–69 years with a discussion of potential benefits and harms of screening (based on family history, race/ethnicity, comorbid medical conditions, patient values about the benefits and harms of screening, and treatment-specific outcomes, and other health need). Recognize that screening offers a small potential benefit of reducing the chance of death from prostate cancer in some males of this age, while many males will experience potential harms of screening, including false-positive results requiring additional testing and possible prostate biopsy, overdiagnosis and overtreatment, and treatment complications, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Do not obtain screening in individuals not expressing a preference for screening.

### Screening for prostate cancer: evidence, ongoing trials, policies and knowledge gaps [^117HbLwh]. BMJ Oncology (2023). High credibility.

United States Preventive Services Task Force recommendation

The United States Preventive Services Task Force in 2012 recommended against PSA testing of asymptomatic men, regardless of age. In 2018, the recommendation was changed to: 'For men aged 55 to 69 years, the decision to undergo periodic PSA-based screening for prostate cancer should be an individual one and should include discussion of the potential benefits and harms of screening with their clinician'.

European Union recommendation

The 2003 European Union (EU) Council Recommendation for Cancer Screening did not include prostate cancer. Based on an evidence review concluding that screening with PSA testing and bi-parametric MRI for PSA-positive men reduces overdiagnosis and is likely to be cost-effective for many EU member states, and the significant amount of ongoing opportunistic screening, the EU Council in December 2022 recommended that 'countries should consider a stepwise approach, including piloting and further research, to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the implementation of organised programmes aimed at ensuring appropriate management and quality on the basis of PSA testing for men in combination with additional MRI scanning'.

Lithuania: opportunistic PSA screening in primary care

The Lithuanian Early Prostate Cancer Detection Programme started in 2006. A PSA test is offered to all men aged 50–74 years who visit a general practitioner. Men with PSA ≥ 3 ng/mL are referred to a urologist. During the first 10 years of the programme, 70% of the target population had at least one PSA test. The Lithuanian prostate cancer incidence doubled 2 years after the introduction of the programme.

### PSA-based screening for prostate cancer: how does it compare with other cancer screening tests? [^115JVk8j]. European Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Context

Despite the substantive societal impact of prostate cancer, the medical community is currently divided on the balance between benefit and harm of screening for prostate cancer using prostate-specific antigen (PSA).

Objective

To examine whether PSA-based screening for prostate cancer meets current guidelines on efficacy and effectiveness for screening, and how it compares with other currently implemented cancer-screening methods.

Evidence Acquisition

A literature search was conducted for reviews and individual studies that have examined the performance of screening for colorectal, cervical, breast, and prostate cancer. Each screening method was assessed using the United Kingdom National Screening Committee guidelines. Data on screening test performance (sensitivity, specificity, etc) were extracted from these articles for comparison.

Evidence Synthesis

In common with other cancers for which screening is conducted, prostate cancer represents a significant morbidity and mortality burden. The PSA test can be considered "simple" and "safe" within appropriate boundaries. The sensitivity/specificity profile of PSA is not optimal but has clinical validity: Cases missed at screening detected as interval cases do not have a poor outcome. Early prostate cancer intervention can be beneficial for long-term outcomes, although the benefits need to be weighed against the adverse effects of intervention. Early evidence from screening studies also suggests positive stage and grade shifts, although Level 1 mortality data are still awaited. Robust cost-effectiveness data are still lacking, although current evidence suggests that PSA screening may lie within acceptable limits.

Conclusion

Until better markers become available, PSA can be regarded as an appropriate screening tool for prostate cancer at a population level.

Prostate cancer screening recommendations — men who choose to be screened after considering benefits and risks should follow these directives: Screening is recommended with PSA with or without DRE; screening should be conducted yearly for men whose PSA level is 2.5 ng/mL or greater; for men whose PSA is less than 2.5 ng/mL, screening intervals can be extended to every 2 years; a PSA level of 4.0 ng/mL or greater historically has been used to recommend referral for further evaluation or biopsy, which remains a reasonable approach for men at average risk for prostate cancer; for PSA levels between 2.5 ng/mL and 4.0 ng/mL, health care providers should consider an individualized risk assessment that incorporates other risk factors and may be used to recommend a biopsy, noting that African American race, family history of prostate cancer, increasing age, and abnormal DRE increase risk and that a previous negative biopsy lowers risk.

### Screening for prostate cancer: evidence, ongoing trials, policies and knowledge gaps [^111ea5T7]. BMJ Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in many countries. The disease has a long, asymptomatic, organ-confined stage and is usually incurable when symptomatic. Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing was introduced in the late 1980s to identify asymptomatic men with prostate cancer. Although serum PSA is a sensitive marker of potentially lethal prostate cancer, its specificity is low. Moderately elevated PSA values (3–10 ng/mL) are more often caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia than prostate cancer. As digital rectal examination and transrectal ultrasound cannot rule out clinically significant prostate cancer, a systematic prostate biopsy became the standard diagnostic investigation for men with raised PSA values (≥ 3 or 4 ng/mL). A European, multinational, randomised screening trial shows that prostate cancer mortality can be reduced by screening but also that the use of systematic biopsies leads to unacceptably high rates of overdiagnosis. As latent, microscopic prostate cancer is common in middle-aged and elderly men, this is not surprising.

Over the past couple of decades, research has been devoted to developing diagnostic methods that more selectively identify men with a potentially lethal prostate cancer. An important progress was the introduction of pre-biopsy MRI and lesion-targeting biopsies. Other important advances include biomarkers and nomograms that can aid in identifying men who despite a moderately raised PSA value are unlikely to have a potentially lethal prostate cancer. Moreover, modifications of the Gleason prostate cancer grading system have led to a definition of the lowest grade (Gleason score 6) that now exclusively includes clinically insignificant, slowly progressing cancers with minimal metastatic potential.

These advances recently led the Council of the European Union to recommend the member states to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of organised prostate cancer screening. Our review summarises the results from previous prostate cancer screening trials, relevant diagnostic research, ongoing prostate cancer screening trials and current healthcare policies, and outlines remaining scientific knowledge gaps and practical issues.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^111FcX6A]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Conclusion — prostate cancer early detection emphasizes that the overall value of early detection in reducing morbidity and mortality remains unclear, and states that emerging evidence that early detection may reduce the likelihood of dying must be weighed against serious risks from early detection and treatment. The guideline highlights involving men in the screening decision and provides the core elements needed for decision-making, including the strengths and limitations of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and the risks of finding and treating screen-detected cancer; it emphasizes the role of health care providers in helping men decide and encourages use of prostate cancer screening decision aids to reach a decision commensurate with the patient's values.

### Relationship between baseline prostate-specific antigen on cancer detection and prostate cancer death: long-term follow-up from the European randomized study of screening for prostate cancer [^117VeYxU]. European Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusions

In conclusion, long-term ERSPC data support the EAU guideline recommendations regarding risk-based early detection of PCa among men aged 60 yr with PSA < 2.0 ng/ml. The PSA test when used according to current knowledge is valuable in helping to reduce the burden of PCa and can be used as an aid in decisions to discontinue repeat screening. When implementing currently available knowledge in daily practice, selective identification of men at risk of developing or having aggressive PCa, including elderly men, should remain the focus for further research.

### Shared decision making emphasized for prostate screening [^115yssCo]. Cancer Discovery (2018). Low credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) now recommends that men ages 55 to 69 individually decide, in consultation with their physician, whether to undergo PSA screening for prostate cancer. The guidelines represent a change from 2012, when the USPSTF recommended against screening for all men.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^111Q1Yvb]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Screening test characteristics of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and PSA thresholds — systematic review and Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) findings are detailed. A systematic review of the literature was performed to assess PSA test performance among men at average risk for prostate cancer, noting that although a PSA cutoff value of 4.0 ng/mL has been used historically, many of the countries participating in the ERSPC lowered their threshold to 3.0 ng/mL. Accordingly, the review included prospective studies using either 4.0 ng/mL or 3.0 ng/mL as the cutoff value; after a full-text review of 78 studies, nine prospective studies that examined a PSA cutoff of 4.0 ng/mL in average-risk men were selected. Four studies that used a PSA cutoff of 3.0 ng/mL were deemed eligible for inclusion. In PCPT, men who had PSA levels < 3.0 ng/mL and normal DRE results were included at baseline, underwent annual PSA and DRE, and were recommended for a prostate biopsy if PSA was above 4.0 ng/mL or if DRE was abnormal; at the end of the 7-year follow-up period, all men without a diagnosis underwent a prostate biopsy. Relatively low prostate cancer detection sensitivities of 20.5% and 32.2% were reported for PSA cutoff values of 4.0 ng/mL and 3.0 ng/mL, respectively.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^116TXXUX]. CA (2010). Low credibility.

In 2009, the American Cancer Society (ACS) Prostate Cancer Advisory Committee began the process of a complete update of recommendations for early prostate cancer detection. A series of systematic evidence reviews was conducted focusing on evidence related to the early detection of prostate cancer, test performance, harms of therapy for localized prostate cancer, and shared and informed decision making in prostate cancer screening. The results of the systematic reviews were evaluated by the ACS Prostate Cancer Advisory Committee, and deliberations about the evidence occurred at committee meetings and during conference calls. On the basis of the evidence and a consensus process, the Prostate Cancer Advisory Committee developed the guideline, and a writing committee drafted a guideline document that was circulated to the entire committee for review and revision. The document was then circulated to peer reviewers for feedback, and finally to the ACS Mission Outcomes Committee and the ACS Board of Directors for approval. The ACS recommends that asymptomatic men who have at least a 10-year life expectancy have an opportunity to make an informed decision with their health care provider about screening for prostate cancer after they receive information about the uncertainties, risks, and potential benefits associated with prostate cancer screening. Prostate cancer screening should not occur without an informed decision-making process. Men at average risk should receive this information beginning at age 50 years. Men in higher risk groups should receive this information before age 50 years. Men should either receive this information directly from their health care providers or be referred to reliable and culturally appropriate sources. Patient decision aids are helpful in preparing men to make a decision whether to be tested.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a clinical practice guideline [^113PtqpH]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Understanding the recommendation

The recommendation against PSA screening is weak because of the small and uncertain benefits of screening on prostate cancer mortality and the large variability in men's values and preferences. In practice, a weak recommendation means that shared decision making is important. Clinicians should support men considering screening to make a well informed decision in line with their own risk profile and individual values and preferences. Another implication of our weak recommendation is that clinicians do not need to raise the issue systematically with their patients. They could raise PSA screening or wait for the patient to raise the issue. Both approaches are reasonable. It depends on the patient's context and competing issues in each clinical encounter.

The panel believes that most informed men considering screening would decline it, although some would choose to undergo screening, accepting the diagnostic and therapeutic burden and harms that can result.

Absolute benefits and harms

The main infographic explains the recommendation and provides an overview of the absolute benefits and harms of screening at a 10 year time horizon for consistency and easier communication. However, the individual trials varied in their duration of follow-up from 10 to 20 years (fig 2), and we used the relative estimates of effect, pooled in the linked systematic review, at the longest available follow-up time. For the 10 year time horizon, we used as baseline risk in the non-screening arm of the CAP trial. It provided the most contemporary estimates of risks from a large sample of men representative of a general practice setting.

### Early detection of prostate cancer: AUA guideline [^112b8sAe]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The guideline purpose is to provide the urologist with a framework for the early detection of prostate cancer in asymptomatic average risk men.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review was conducted and summarized evidence derived from over 300 studies that addressed the predefined outcomes of interest (prostate cancer incidence/mortality, quality of life, diagnostic accuracy and harms of testing). In addition to the quality of evidence, the panel considered values and preferences expressed in a clinical setting (patient-physician dyad) rather than having a public health perspective. Guideline statements were organized by age group in years (age < 40; 40 to 54; 55 to 69; ≥ 70).

Results

Except prostate specific antigen-based prostate cancer screening, there was minimal evidence to assess the outcomes of interest for other tests. The quality of evidence for the benefits of screening was moderate, and evidence for harm was high for men age 55 to 69 years. For men outside this age range, evidence was lacking for benefit, but the harms of screening, including over diagnosis and overtreatment, remained. Modeled data suggested that a screening interval of two years or more may be preferred to reduce the harms of screening.

Conclusions

The Panel recommended shared decision-making for men age 55 to 69 years considering PSA-based screening, a target age group for whom benefits may outweigh harms. Outside this age range, PSA-based screening as a routine could not be recommended based on the available evidence.

### Limitations of prostate-specific antigen testing after a prostate cancer diagnosis [^114yvYSC]. European Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is frequently used in isolation to guide treatment decisions in men with recurrent prostate cancer, a practice discouraged by prostate cancer working groups and guidelines. Instead, PSA should be used with imaging and other factors to make treatment decisions.

### An empirical evaluation of guidelines on prostate-specific antigen velocity in prostate cancer detection [^111aSt8m]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American Urological Association guidelines on early detection of prostate cancer recommend biopsy on the basis of high prostate-specific antigen (PSA) velocity, even in the absence of other indications such as an elevated PSA or a positive digital rectal exam (DRE).

Methods

To evaluate the current guideline, we compared the area under the curve of a multivariable model for prostate cancer including age, PSA, DRE, family history, and prior biopsy, with and without PSA velocity, in 5519 men undergoing biopsy, regardless of clinical indication, in the control arm of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial. We also evaluated the clinical implications of using PSA velocity cut points to determine biopsy in men with low PSA and negative DRE in terms of additional cancers found and unnecessary biopsies conducted. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Results

Incorporation of PSA velocity led to a very small increase in area under the curve from 0.702 to 0.709. Improvements in predictive accuracy were smaller for the endpoints of high-grade cancer (Gleason score of 7 or greater) and clinically significant cancer (Epstein criteria). Biopsying men with high PSA velocity but no other indication would lead to a large number of additional biopsies, with close to one in seven men being biopsied. PSA cut points with a comparable specificity to PSA velocity cut points had a higher sensitivity (23% vs 19%), particularly for high-grade (41% vs 25%) and clinically significant (32% vs 22%) disease. These findings were robust to the method of calculating PSA velocity.

Conclusions

We found no evidence to support the recommendation that men with high PSA velocity should be biopsied in the absence of other indications; this measure should not be included in practice guidelines.

### Who and when should we screen for prostate cancer? Interviews with key opinion leaders [^111wR7FR]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Screening for prostate cancer with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is controversial. Screening is currently transitioning from being an all-or-nothing-question, to finding new ways of individualized testing. However, consensus remains to be reached within guideline groups and worldwide experts regarding who – and when – to screen, if at all. In this Q & A, we invite seven of the world's key opinion leaders in the field, both proponents and skeptics, to elaborate on what they believe the current screening policy should be. The authors have all published widely on PSA, and comprise a wide variety of experience in areas such as urology, epidemiology, evidence-based medicine, and medical decision-making.

Currently, only one guideline group, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), recommends against screening for all men. Most other guideline groups recommend shared decision-making, involving a discussion of the pros and cons of screening. To aid in decision-making, some propose using a risk-stratified approach taking into account multiple factors along with a PSA measurement. However, the specifics of such an approach are a subject of debate; for instance, the appropriate age limits of screening remain to be defined. Randomized screening trials, including the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) and the Göteborg trial have provided evidence that regular PSA-screening can reduce prostate cancer mortality by 21–44% at 13–14 years of follow-up; the age groups studied in these trials were 55–69 and 50–64 years, respectively. Thus, the question remains regarding the screening of men outside this age range. There is a growing body of evidence on the benefits of commencing screening in the mid-40s. While the American Urological Association (AUA) bases its recommendation on the 55–69 age group based on the ERSPC results, the European Urological Association recommends a baseline PSA be obtained at 40–45 years of age.

### Viewpoint: expanding prostate cancer screening [^115HeSfD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer screening is controversial, and major professional associations offer differing screening guidelines. The authors address 3 key issues about prostate cancer screening: 1) the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) criteria to recommend a prostate biopsy, 2) the appropriate age to start screening, and 3) the appropriate age to stop screening. The authors argue, on the basis of evidence published since 2000, that data supporting the efficacy of PSA screening are convincing. They recommend screening for risk assessment for average-risk men beginning at age 40 years, screening selected healthy men older than age 70 years, and lowering the PSA threshold for considering biopsy to 2.5 ng/mL for all men.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^116C786A]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

American Cancer Society early prostate cancer detection — core information for informed decision-making states that prostate cancer is an important health concern for men, and screening with the PSA blood test alone or with both PSA and digital rectal examination (DRE) detects cancer at an earlier stage than if no screening is performed. Prostate cancer screening may be associated with a reduction in the risk of dying from prostate cancer; however, evidence is conflicting and experts disagree about the value of screening, and for men whose prostate cancer is detected by screening, it is not currently possible to predict which men are likely to benefit from treatment. Depending on the treatment selected, treatment for prostate cancer can lead to urinary, bowel, sexual, and other health problems that may be significant or minimal, permanent or temporary; the PSA and DRE may produce false-positive or false-negative results, meaning that men without cancer may have abnormal results and get unnecessary additional testing while clinically significant cancers may be missed, and false-positive results can lead to sustained anxiety about prostate cancer risk. Abnormal results from screening with the PSA or DRE require prostate biopsies to determine whether or not the abnormal findings are cancer, biopsies can be painful, may lead to complications like infection or bleeding, and can miss clinically significant cancer, and not all men whose prostate cancer is detected through screening require immediate treatment, but they may require periodic blood tests and prostate biopsies to determine the need for future treatment.

Regarding preventative measures for prostate cancer, more specifically with respect to 5-ARIs, ASCO/AUA 2009 guidelines recommend to consider discussing the benefits of 5-ARIs for 7 years for the prevention of prostate cancer and the potential risks (including the possibility of high-grade prostate cancer) to be able to make a better-informed decision in asymptomatic males with a PSA level ≤ 3.0 undergoing regular screening with PSA or anticipating to undergo annual PSA screening for early detection of prostate cancer, as well as in patients taking 5-ARIs for benign conditions such as LUTS.
