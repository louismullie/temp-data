Possible cat allergy

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing suspected cat allergy, preserving the thinking process and self-verification language throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical history and symptom pattern to establish pretest probability. Then, I should verify the best diagnostic approach, including when to use skin testing versus serum specific IgE and whether component-resolved diagnostics add value. Next, I will review differential diagnoses and the role of provocation testing. After that, I should assess disease severity and comorbid asthma, because this drives management. Then, I will examine environmental control strategies and their evidence base. I will now examine pharmacotherapy options and their limitations. Next, I should review allergen immunotherapy indications, efficacy, and safety. Finally, I will consider emerging therapies and synthesize a practical, stepwise management plan with shared decision-making and follow-up checkpoints.

> Let me first confirm the clinical history anchors the entire evaluation, because symptoms during cat exposure strongly raise suspicion, whereas absence of temporal correlation makes cat allergy less likely; typical features include sneezing, nasal congestion, pruritus, ocular symptoms, cough, wheeze, and chest tightness, and I should also ask about sleep disturbance, fatigue, and quality-of-life impact since these are common and clinically meaningful in cat allergy [^1141g9kN] [^1112UzMt]. Hold on, I should verify that history alone is insufficient; patients frequently misclassify their allergic status, with false-positive rates for cat allergy around 32% when relying on self-report or structured history without testing, so objective confirmation is essential to avoid misdiagnosis and inappropriate advice [^116WoT1Y].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic testing strategy; skin prick testing to standardized cat extracts is highly sensitive and specific, and a wheal threshold around 3–6 mm performs well depending on the reference standard, so I need to ensure I interpret results in the context of symptoms and exposure rather than in isolation [^111civuS] [^112wqa9A]. Wait, let me verify the role of serum specific IgE; it is a reasonable alternative when skin testing is contraindicated or unavailable, but I should remember that sensitization without symptoms can occur, so a positive test must be correlated with clinical exposure and symptoms to establish true allergy [^1112UzMt] [^114gxLmj]. I should also consider component-resolved diagnostics, particularly Fel d 1, Fel d 4, and Fel d 7, because polysensitization to multiple cat components correlates with higher symptom burden and asthma risk, which can refine prognosis and guide therapy selection, though availability and payer coverage vary [^113v349a] [^112rBA59].

> I need to check the differential diagnoses and avoid premature closure; perennial nonallergic rhinitis, infectious rhinosinusitis, occupational or irritant exposures, and early asthma can mimic cat allergy, so I should confirm IgE-mediated sensitization and symptom-exposure concordance before labeling someone as cat-allergic [^111Eyw26]. But wait, what if skin testing and serum IgE are discordant or the history is equivocal; in that case, a supervised nasal allergen challenge can help adjudicate, although it is not routinely required for straightforward cat allergy and is better reserved for complex or research settings [^111KciTY] [^114QZeSx].

> Now, I will assess severity and comorbid asthma because this changes management; cat allergy is a major risk factor for asthma, and more than half of cat-sensitized individuals have comorbid asthma, with higher cat-specific IgE levels linked to greater symptom severity and exacerbation risk, so I should screen for wheeze, nocturnal symptoms, exercise limitation, and use of rescue inhalers, and obtain spirometry when indicated [^1147TrGd] [^114HoXak]. Hold on, I should verify that uncontrolled asthma is a contraindication to initiating immunotherapy and that optimizing asthma control first is prudent to mitigate procedural risk and improve outcomes [^1147TrGd].

> Let me consider environmental control next, but I should double-check the evidence before overpromising benefit; complete avoidance is often impractical because Fel d 1 is ubiquitous and persists for months after cat removal, and guideline panels rate many single-component interventions as low or uncertain benefit, so expectations must be realistic and individualized [^111dFb7K] [^1169t62M]. I should confirm that multicomponent strategies are preferred when attempted: keep the cat out of bedrooms, use HEPA filtration thoughtfully recognizing mixed clinical data, remove or minimize carpets and upholstered reservoirs, increase ventilation, and maintain rigorous cleaning, while counseling that effects are modest and heterogeneous across households [^117FjHb6] [^113aszq5]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought HEPA would reliably improve symptoms, but randomized data show inconsistent clinical benefits despite reductions in airborne allergen, so I need to frame HEPA as an adjunct with uncertain impact rather than a definitive solution [^113aszq5] [^1169t62M].

> I will now examine pharmacotherapy; there is no cat-specific pharmacotherapy, so I should treat rhinitis and asthma per standard pathways using intranasal corticosteroids, oral or intranasal antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and inhaled corticosteroids with bronchodilators for asthma, tailoring to symptom severity and control while acknowledging that up to half of patients report only partial control with medications alone [^1147TrGd]. Hold on, I should verify that pre-exposure prophylaxis with antihistamines can be reasonable for predictable exposures, but this is symptomatic and does not modify disease, reinforcing the need for definitive strategies in selected patients [^115caSFn].

> Next, I should review allergen immunotherapy; AIT is the only disease-modifying option with potential for sustained benefit after discontinuation, but I need to ensure the patient understands the time course, risks, and uncertain magnitude of benefit for cat allergy specifically compared with pollen or mites [^1141g9kN] [^117SWNVk]. Let me verify the evidence base; randomized trials of cat SCIT and SLIT show mixed results, with some signal of benefit in symptom scores and provocation responses but no consistent large-scale efficacy, and adverse reactions including rare anaphylaxis occur, so shared decision-making is essential, especially in patients with asthma or polysensitization [^113SCxQU]. I should confirm that monosensitized patients with persistent moderate-to-severe symptoms despite optimized pharmacotherapy and avoidance are the most appropriate candidates, and that treatment is typically continued for 3–5 years with periodic reassessment of benefit [^116RpAx9] [^113SCxQU].

> I need to ensure safety protocols are explicit; SCIT must be administered in a setting prepared to treat anaphylaxis, with observation after injections and careful dose escalation, and patients on beta-blockers may have blunted epinephrine responsiveness, which complicates risk management and may shift preference toward SLIT or non-immunotherapy options in some cases [^116RpAx9] [^115YTTxV]. Hold on, I should verify that SLIT is generally administered at home after the first supervised dose and may have a more favorable safety profile, though local oral symptoms are common and adherence over years can be challenging [^116RpAx9].

> Let me consider emerging therapies, but I should be cautious not to overstate availability; passive administration of fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibodies targeting Fel d 1 (REGN1908/1909) rapidly suppresses nasal symptoms and prevents early asthmatic responses in controlled exposure settings, with effects lasting weeks after a single dose, suggesting a promising mechanism but still investigational for routine care [^111rkmQv] [^114Fw4dz]. I should double-check that these data support the concept that allergen-specific blocking IgG can functionally neutralize Fel d 1 and reduce effector-cell activation, aligning with the proposed mechanism of AIT-induced protective IgG, but larger and longer-duration trials are needed before clinical adoption [^113gUhdy] [^115XMimE].

> But wait, what if we could reduce the allergen at the source; dietary anti-Fel d 1 IgY fed to cats lowers salivary and hair Fel d 1 and, in a small controlled exposure study, reduced human symptoms, offering a nonmedical, cat-centered approach that may be acceptable to families unwilling to rehome pets, though broader clinical effectiveness data are pending [^1165pZdW]. I should confirm that this strategy aims to shift cats from high to low Fel d 1 producers rather than eliminate the allergen entirely, which fits the total allergen load model and may be sufficient to keep exposures below individual symptom thresholds in some households [^1165pZdW] [^112so4qP].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise plan and verify alignment with guidelines; first, confirm the diagnosis with skin testing or specific IgE tied to a compatible exposure-symptom history, and screen for asthma with spirometry when indicated; second, optimize pharmacotherapy for rhinitis and asthma and document baseline control; third, discuss environmental control options with realistic expectations, emphasizing multicomponent measures if attempted; fourth, consider referral for AIT in appropriately selected, monosensitized patients with persistent symptoms despite optimized care, ensuring asthma is stable and reviewing risks; fifth, consider investigational or cat-centered strategies in specialized settings for refractory cases or when shared preferences prioritize pet retention [^113wgbGF] [^1141g9kN] [^1165pZdW]. Hold on, I should verify that shared decision-making is emphasized throughout, especially for pet-related decisions that carry emotional and quality-of-life tradeoffs, and that follow-up every 3–6 months is reasonable to reassess control, adherence, and the need to escalate therapy or pursue AIT [^117S4QwT] [^1141g9kN].

> Finally, I should confirm key counseling points; cat allergens are ubiquitous in communities, so complete avoidance is impossible, which means management is about reducing personal exposure below symptom thresholds and optimizing control rather than expecting cure; symptoms and control often fluctuate with total allergen load from multiple sources, reinforcing the value of comprehensive trigger assessment and realistic expectations for any single intervention [^111dFb7K] [^112so4qP]. I need to ensure the patient understands that sensitization without symptoms does not mandate treatment, but if symptoms are present and testing is positive, targeted interventions can meaningfully improve quality of life even if they do not eliminate all exposures [^114gxLmj] [^1113vryN].

A cat allergy is an **IgE-mediated hypersensitivity** to cat allergens, most commonly Fel d 1, causing rhinitis, asthma, or skin symptoms on exposure. Diagnosis relies on **history plus skin or serum IgE testing** [^112wqa9A]; component testing can refine risk and guide management [^113v349a]. Management includes **avoidance, pharmacotherapy, and immunotherapy** [^117SWNVk]; emerging options like anti-Fel d 1 monoclonal antibodies [^113gUhdy] and cat diets that reduce Fel d 1 are promising [^1165pZdW]. Prognosis varies: some develop tolerance with exposure, but symptoms often persist without immunotherapy [^115DFoEt].

---

## Allergens involved in cat allergy

The **major cat allergen** is Fel d 1, a salivary/sebaceous protein that adheres to fur/dander and becomes airborne [^113gUhdy] [^1112Zc9w] [^115DFoEt] [^116s4aw4]; **other allergens** include Fel d 2 (serum albumin), Fel d 3 (cystatin), and Fel d 4 (lipocalin), which may cross-react with other animals [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiology

Sensitization occurs when **IgE binds to FcεRI on mast cells/basophils**, and **re-exposure triggers degranulation** with histamine, leukotrienes, and cytokines, causing symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Clinical manifestations

- **Respiratory**: sneezing, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, itchy nose, coughing, wheezing, dyspnea, and asthma exacerbations [^111Eyw26].
- **Ocular**: itching, redness, tearing, and conjunctival swelling [^notfound].
- **Dermatological**: urticaria, eczema, and contact dermatitis [^notfound].
- **Systemic reactions**: rare anaphylaxis, especially in highly sensitized individuals [^112udK7D].

---

## Diagnosis

- **Clinical history**: symptoms temporally related to cat exposure [^1112UzMt].
- **Skin prick testing**: high sensitivity/specificity for cat sensitization [^112wqa9A].
- **Serum-specific IgE**: confirms sensitization; component testing (Fel d 1/4) refines risk and management [^113v349a].
- **Nasal provocation**: reserved for complex or discordant cases [^111KciTY].

---

## Management strategies

### Environmental control

- **Avoidance**: keep cats out of bedrooms, use HEPA filters, wash bedding frequently, and vacuum regularly [^117FjHb6].
- **Cat bathing**: transiently reduces allergen load but effects are short-lived [^115caSFn].
- **Hypoallergenic diets**: feeding cats anti-Fel d 1 IgY reduces environmental Fel d 1 and symptoms in exposed humans [^notfound].

---

### Pharmacological therapy

- **Antihistamines**: relieve rhinitis and ocular symptoms [^notfound].
- **Intranasal corticosteroids**: control nasal inflammation [^notfound].
- **Leukotriene receptor antagonists**: for rhinitis and asthma [^notfound].
- **Bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids**: for asthma symptoms [^1147TrGd].

---

### Immunotherapy

Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) is effective for cat allergy but carries a risk of systemic reactions [^117SWNVk], whereas **sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT)** has a favorable safety profile and is effective in some studies [^116s4aw4]. Emerging therapies such as anti-Fel d 1 monoclonal antibodies (REGN1908/1909) rapidly suppress symptoms in trials [^111rkmQv].

---

## Prognosis

Natural tolerance can develop with prolonged exposure in some individuals, but symptoms often persist without intervention [^117SWNVk]. Immunotherapy offers long-term symptom control and may induce tolerance [^112d4Jqz].

---

## Preventive measures

Early exposure may reduce sensitization risk, though evidence is mixed [^111tTfSx]. Public education on allergen avoidance and management is important [^117S4QwT].

---

Cat allergy is a common IgE-mediated disorder driven largely by Fel d 1; diagnosis hinges on history plus testing, and management spans avoidance, medications, and immunotherapy, with promising advances in monoclonal antibodies and allergen-reducing cat diets [^117SWNVk].

### Allergen-specific IgG antibodies for cat allergy? [^112udK7D]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Increased global prevalence of IgE-mediated allergies has led to increased morbidity. IgE-mediated allergies are caused by exposure to specific allergens in foods, pollen, mold, animals, insects, and others. Allergic diseases include allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. Reactions can be mild to severe. In some cases, like in those with cat allergies, systemic reactions leading to status asthmaticus or anaphylaxis, potentially life-threatening conditions, can occur. Pharmacotherapy to prevent and treat symptoms typically includes antihistamines, β₂-agonists, topical corticosteroids, mast cell stabilizers, and leukotriene inhibitors. At the current time, allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is the only disease‐modifying treatment that alters the course of immune response, with benefits often observed even after cessation of therapy, but now there could be a new approach on the horizon.

The work by Shamji and colleagues (pp.) in this issue of the Journal, and the 2018 study by Orengo and colleagues, report successful AIT for cat allergy and potentially, if verified by larger trials, could lead to a major leap forward for AIT. Allergens used for cat allergy AIT, both sublingual and subcutaneous, have progressed from crude extracts to sophisticated and targeted allergens. Crude cat allergen extracts were used for AIT through the mid-1990s; subsequent studies used extracts of Fel d 1 or recombinant Fel d 1, the major cat allergen. Overall, although some cat AIT studies with crude cat extracts or Fel d 1 have shown promising results in total rhinoconjunctivitis symptom scores, peak expiratory flow rate responses, medication scores, or allergen-specific or nonspecific bronchial provocation tests, others have found no significant differences between placebo and active groups. More recent studies have used an equimolar mixture of seven short synthetic peptides that corresponded to major T-cell epitopes, which were derived from the primary sequence of the major cat allergen Fel d 1 (Cat-PAD). Although initial studies using Cat-PAD for cat allergy showed benefits, a larger 2016 phase 3 trial showed no difference between the placebo and active group in the mean combined score (combined total rhinoconjunctivitis symptom scores and rescue medication use score). Safety data for cat AIT are limited because of the lack of high-quality placebo-controlled trials; however, reports of reactions requiring epinephrine have been reported. AIT may benefit those in whom allergies are not well controlled by pharmacotherapy or those who are monosensitized to Fel d 1.

### Treating cat allergy with monoclonal IgG antibodies that bind allergen and prevent IgE engagement [^113gUhdy]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT) is a treatment option for patients with allergic rhinitis triggered by aeroallergens (such as pollen, animal dander, or dust) when pharmacological therapies, such as antihistamines, are insufficient. SIT is also an investigational treatment for food allergies. SIT is an active immunization process whereby patients are administered increasing doses of the offending allergen, followed by a maintenance dose for up to several years. The goal of SIT is to induce immunological changes that result in symptom amelioration and sustained tolerance and desensitization. Although SIT can provide long-lasting protection from allergic disease, it carries a risk of adverse reactions due to administration of native allergen, has variable efficacy between patients, and can take 3–5 years to induce tolerance.

Several hypotheses exist as to the underlying mechanism of successful SIT. One component is thought to be suppression of the effector T-cell response through the generation of allergen-specific regulatory T-cells, allergen-specific T-cell anergy, and a shift from Th2 cells toward Th1 cells. Notably, a T-cell peptide vaccine seeking to recapitulate this mechanism failed in a Phase 3 study. An alternative hypothesis is that SIT-induced allergen-specific IgG – will compete with IgE for allergen binding, thereby decreasing allergen-induced effector cell activation. While titers of allergen-specific IgG generated through SIT have not consistently correlated with clinical improvement, greater correlation is observed when comparing symptom improvement with the ability of blocking IgG to compete with IgE for allergen bindingand functionally prevent the immediate hypersensitivity response. These data suggest that augmenting the allergen-specific blocking IgG/IgE ratio is critically important to reducing allergic symptoms.

We sought to test the contribution of allergen-specific blocking IgG as the protective mechanism of SIT using pre-selected monoclonal anti-allergen-blocking antibodies to suppress allergic symptoms. To explore this fundamental question and test a therapeutic approach for allergy treatment, we generated two fully human IgG4 antibodies, REGN1908 and REGN1909, specific for Fel d 1, the major cat allergen.

Here, we report that recombinant, allergen-specific blocking IgG antibodies perform comparably to allergen-specific IgG isolated from patients who completed successful SIT in preclinical studies. This effect translates to rapid and sustained reduction in clinical symptoms in patients with cat allergy undergoing nasal allergen provocation, thereby offering evidence that allergen-specific blocking IgG are an integral component of the protective mechanism of SIT, and may be a potential new and more rapid treatment approach for allergies.

### Keep the cat, change the care pathway: a transformational approach to managing fel D 1, the major cat allergen [^112so4qP]. Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

4 CURRENT MANAGEMENT

Several recommendations have been proposed to reduce cat allergenicity, but to date, none of them present convincing evidence.

4.1 Allergen load reduction

Polysensitized individuals will often show more severe symptoms than monosensitized individuals when exposed to environmental allergens, indicating that allergens have an additive effect. 40, 75 This reinforces the concept of total allergen load, which represents the sum of the individual allergens in the environment at that time. If the total allergen load exceeds an individual's allergic threshold, that individual develops allergic symptoms.

The total allergen load and allergic threshold represent the clinical manifestation of the underlying molecular process: similar to the allergic threshold associated with an individual, mast cells and basophils bearing the IgE receptors have a threshold at which degranulation and mediator release are triggered. The cellular threshold has been estimated to required crosslinking of 2000 out of an estimated 500 000‐1 000 000 high‐affinity IgE receptor complexes on the cell surface. 40, 76 High exposure levels of one allergen may be sufficient to trigger degranulation and mediator release, while lower levels do not; however, multiple allergens present at subthreshold levels may have a cumulative effect that exceeds the threshold and triggers the chain of events leading to allergic symptoms. 40 The number of IgE receptors bound, not the identity of the allergen(s), determine if the process is initiated.

If the allergen load can be reduced by avoiding or reducing the level of exposure to one or more of the contributing allergens, the cumulative level of allergen exposure may fall below an individual's threshold and improve or prevent allergy symptoms. 40, 75

3 CAT ALLERGIES: A COMMON PROBLEM WITH CONSEQUENCES FOR HUMANS AND CATS

The prevalence of allergy to furry animals has been increasing, and allergy to cats is a major risk factor for the development of asthma and rhinitis. 43 The diagnosis of cat allergy is now well established. 9 Allergen avoidance is effective, but often has a psychologic impact. Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is not well demonstrated. 44 There is a need for innovative approaches to better manage cat allergy.

3.1 Prevalence

Most people in Western societies spend over 90% of their lives indoor, and indoor allergens play an important role in allergic sensitization and symptoms. The percentage of homes with a pet ranges from around 5% in Spain, 20% in Sweden, 25% in the United States, and up to 65% in New Zealand. 9, 43, 45

Allergies to cat affect 7%‐25% of the population and represent a growing public health concern as these rates increase. 3, 7, 9 The prevalence of cat allergy varies between countries, timing of exposure, and allergic predisposition. 9 Cat allergy is found both in developed and developing countries, 46, 47 starts early in infancy and progresses up to young adulthood, 13, 48 and can be observed in children who live in a house where cats are not present. 49

### Cat allergen exposure in a naturalistic exposure chamber: a prospective observational study in cat-allergic subjects [^1147TrGd]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

The association between cat allergy and asthma is significant; ~30% of allergic asthmatics have a concomitant allergy to cats. Additionally, more than 50% of cat‐sensitized subjects have a diagnosis of comorbid asthma, ranging from intermittent mild to potentially life‐threatening asthmatic exacerbations requiring treatment with short‐ and long‐acting bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids and broad allergen immunotherapy agents. Patients with high concentrations of cat allergen‐specific IgE are at higher risk for oculo‐nasal and/or asthma symptoms. There is an unmet need for improved prophylaxis of cat allergy to reduce cat allergen‐associated asthma exacerbations.

Recommendations for treating allergic rhinitis include allergen avoidance, antihistamines and intra‐nasal corticosteroids and allergen‐specific immunotherapy. Although antihistamines and intra‐nasal corticosteroids are widely used as preventative agents, up to ~50% of patients report poor or only partial symptom control. Specific immunotherapy (SIT), including subcutaneous immunotherapy and sublingual immunotherapy, is indicated when moderate‐to‐severe symptoms persist despite the use of antihistamines and intra‐nasal corticosteroids. However, adverse events (AEs) occur in 40%–50% of patients, ranging from mild reactions (e.g. swelling, injection‐site reactions and urticaria) to life‐threatening reactions (e.g. asthma exacerbation and anaphylaxis); the incidence of severe systemic reactions is estimated to be < 1% with conventional immunotherapy and > 30% with rush immunotherapy. Uncontrolled asthma may be exacerbated by SIT and therefore is contraindicated. Given these factors, there is a significant unmet need to develop novel therapies to treat moderate‐to‐severe allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma due to cat allergy that are efficacious, more rapid and more convenient than currently available therapies, and for novel study designs to determine their efficacy.

### Keep the cat, change the care pathway: a transformational approach to managing fel D 1, the major cat allergen [^114LkEa4]. Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

5.3 Next‐generation care pathways for rhinitis and asthma using ICP

Although environmental factors play a major role in allergic diseases, no guideline or recommendation has included them. Based on the results of POLLAR (Impact of air pollution on asthma and rhinitis, 55 ARIA next‐generation ICPs will embed exposure to environmental factors like pollen and air pollution as well as novel approaches like artificial intelligence that have not been considered up to now. As there is increasing evidence that patients' choices and behaviors have an impact on the planet, this will be the background of ARIA Planetary Health. 117

Another interesting approach is to propose nonmedical approaches to control allergic symptoms. In all allergy textbooks, allergen avoidance is always required but most studies failed to prove efficacy for house dust mites. However, new data in stratified severe asthmatic patients are encouraging. 118 In cat allergy, a reduction in cat allergenicity can represent a revolution in the management of cat‐allergic patients and next‐generation care pathways should recognize the results of the studies when they will be completed. Whether a patient stratification is needed should be further established.

### Keep the cat, change the care pathway: a transformational approach to managing fel D 1, the major cat allergen [^115DFoEt]. Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

4.1.1 Avoidance

Removing the cat from the home is the most commonly recommended measure, although it is not supported by evidence. 8, 9, 19, 77 Fel d 1 is a "sticky" allergen, and it may take months for symptoms to improve following removal of the cat from the household, particularly if the household is carpeted. 78, 79 Wood et al 79 observed that up to 20 weeks were required following removal of the cat for Fel d 1 levels to reduce to those found in homes without cats.

On the other hand, it is suggested that symptomatic patients may become tolerant to the cat after some months of continuous exposure and a specific IgG4 response is associated with tolerance. 80 Tolerance duration is, however, unknown, and many adults who had cats in childhood may develop severe asthmatic reactions when re‐exposed to cats many years later.

So‐called "hypoallergenic pets" have been marketed to allergy sufferers, but their clinical relevance has never been demonstrated. 9, 18 Although patents have been filed for gene editing to produce allergen‐free cats and the topic has received intermittent media attention for more than a decade, the truly allergen‐free cat has been elusive. 81

### The effect of reducing levels of cat allergen (fel D 1) on clinical symptoms in patients with cat allergy [^114Kt5UP]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of cat allergy normally entails removal of the cat from the household, but cat owners are often unwilling to part with their pets, despite clinically relevant allergies.

Objective

To determine whether levels of Fel d 1 can be reduced without removal of the cat and whether this will affect symptoms of cat allergy.

Methods

Cat-allergic patients underwent randomization to either a group instructed in environmental control (EC) and a group with unchanged environment (UE). Dust samples were obtained and settled Fel d 1 measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Patients recorded daily nasal inspiratory flow rates. At baseline, 3 months, and 8 months, patients underwent symptom evaluation.

Results

Eighteen patients were randomized to the EC group and 22 to the UE group; the final number completing the study was 31, 15 in the EC group, and 16 in the UE group. At 8 months, home Fel d 1 levels had diminished to 6.8% of baseline levels in the EC group, whereas no reduction in levels was noted in the UE group. In the EC group, significant improvements were found in nasal inspiratory flow rate and symptoms compared with the UE group. Patients did not have difficulties adhering to EC measures.

Conclusion

A decrease in the allergen load was found in the EC group, which had a significant effect on symptoms of nasal allergy.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^113wgbGF]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Allergen mitigation implementation guidance in asthma emphasizes appropriate targeting and testing: For individuals with asthma who do not exhibit any allergy symptoms or for whom testing has not suggested an allergy to specific indoor substances (eg, dust mites or cat dander), the Expert Panel recommends no specific environmental interventions within the home. For exposure to cockroaches or rodents with allergy symptoms or sensitization by skin testing or specific IgE, the Expert Panel recommends using integrated pest management, which can be used alone or with other interventions to reduce exposure. For suspected dust mite allergy, the Expert Panel recommends using multicomponent interventions to reduce dust mite levels and improve asthma outcomes, and use of pillow and mattress covers alone does not improve asthma outcomes. Overall evidence is of low certainty for benefit, so the Expert Panel recommends tailored allergen intervention strategies only for individuals exposed to specific allergens with symptoms by history or allergy by testing. Allergen mitigation strategies can be used in individuals of all ages and severities of asthma, and clinicians should tailor strategies to symptoms, sensitization, and exposures; clinicians should consider allergen testing when appropriate before committing individuals to burdensome strategies. Given inequities in access to specialists and testing, the panel advises at minimum taking a clinical history of symptoms and exposures for all individuals with asthma. Allergy testing may have false-positive and false-negative results and some allergens may act as irritants; if symptoms worsen with specific aeroallergens, the Expert Panel recommends that the clinician consider mitigating that aeroallergen even if testing is negative.

4.3 Immunotherapy

Davila et al 9 recommended that immunotherapy with cat epithelium would be indicated in patients with allergic respiratory disease under circumstances in which there is exposure, assessing the viability and efficacy of environmental control measures, drug therapy, and patient preferences. However, there is a limited body of high‐quality evidence on the effectiveness and safety of cat AIT from large randomized controlled trials either for subcutaneous (SCIT) or for sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) and no high‐quality data on its cost‐effectiveness. 44 Around 200 patients have been enrolled in double‐blind trials for SCIT, and results are inconsistent. The available evidence on effectiveness is mixed based on studying a limited array of immunological, physiological, and patient‐reported outcome measures. Based on this evidence and extrapolating on the wider evidence base in AIT, it is likely that some patients may benefit from this modality of treatment, particularly those with moderate‐to‐severe disease who are inadequately controlled on allergen avoidance measures and pharmacotherapy and those who are monosensitized to Fel d 1. Further evidence is, however, required from larger trials before more definitive advice can be offered. 44

Many trials with T‐cell peptides have shown limited efficacy and/or led to nonimmediate allergic reactions during treatment 90, 91, 92 although immunologic effects were demonstrated. 93, 94

4.4 Primary Prevention

The role of pet keeping in early life to prevent cat allergy is still a matter of debate. Early exposure to pets before 1 year of age may have a protective effect in preventing allergic sensitizations, but studies to date have produced conflicting results. However, a meta‐analysis from 11 pooled European birth cohorts concluded that there was no evidence for a protective or "harmful" effect of cat ownership on sensitization. 95 To date, there is no consensus regarding animal exposure and preventing later onset of asthma or other allergic diseases.

### Treating cat allergy with monoclonal IgG antibodies that bind allergen and prevent IgE engagement [^117FDNx7]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

REGN1908–1909 reduces symptoms in patients with cat allergy

To determine whether the preclinical protection afforded by REGN1908–1909 could translate into clinical efficacy, we conducted a phase 1b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled proof-of-mechanism study to evaluate if a single subcutaneous (SC) dose of REGN1908–1909 (600 mg; 1:1 ratio) could inhibit cat hair extract-induced allergic symptoms in patients with cat allergy (Fig. 5a). A nasal allergen challenge (NAC) with cat hair extract was selected for proof of mechanism as a reliable, reproducible, and controlled method of measuring allergy symptoms(Supplementary Fig. 6). NAC studies have been used to test the onset of action and duration of efficacy of intranasal steroids, antihistamines, omalizumab, and subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) approaches. Intranasal instillation of allergen causes local allergic symptoms, such as nasal congestion, itching, sneezing, and rhinorrhea, which are associated with IgE-mediated mast cell and basophil degranulation and peak within the EPR. Therefore, the primary efficacy analysis was change in total nasal symptom score (TNSS) area under the curve (AUC) over the first hour after a NAC [TNSS AUC(0–1 h)] from pretreatment challenge to day 8 challenge.

4.1.2 Environmental control

Environmental control measures are also recommended in order to reduce environmental allergen levels, and measures implemented in cat‐sensitized households may include the following:
Excluding the cat from the bedroom 8, 9, 19, 82
Keeping the cat outdoors 8
Use of HEPA filters in vacuums and HVAC systems 8, 9, 19, 83, 84
Removal of carpets 8, 79, 82
Using pillow and mattress covers 9, 82
Removal or covering of upholstered furniture 9, 79
Weekly vacuuming or steam cleaning 79, 82
Wet mopping floors and surfaces 82
Washing walls 82
Ventilation to increase air change rate per hour 85
Changing clothes before moving from an area of high allergen levels to one with lower levels 8
Using nighttime laminar airflow ventilation 9, 78
Regular bathing of cats in the home 2, 9, 86, 87

Allergists' recommendations may include washing the cat to physically remove allergens from its hair. 2, 9, 86, 87 This recommendation has poor compliance, 82 due largely to the feline species' aversion to bathing. In addition, although immersion bathing is effective for lowering allergen levels on the cat's hair, the effects of bathing are transient; allergen levels return to baseline within 24 hours of bathing. 2, 86, 87

Although these measures may reduce the allergen load, 82 they are effort‐intensive, costly, and may be difficult to sustain long term. 77 In addition, the effects may be transient. 8, 19 Multifaceted interventions are recommended for best results. 8, 9 Because Fel d 1 is such a ubiquitous allergen, sensitized individuals that successfully reduce the allergen load in their own homes will still be exposed to potentially high levels of cat allergens at work, in homes of cat‐owning family members or friends, and in public places. 2, 5, 7, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32

Perinasal mechanical barriers are intended to entrap airborne allergens and prevent them from contacting the respiratory mucosa. A hydroxypropyl methylcellulose barrier had positive effects on nasal symptom score, ocular symptom score, total symptom score, and quality of life score in patients with perennial and seasonal AR. 88

4.2 Pharmaceutical interventions

There is no specificity for the treatment of symptoms induced by cats. However, patients with a known cat allergy may prevent the onset of symptoms by using medications before cat exposure. Rapidly acting medications are favored for both asthma and rhinitis. 89

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Standardized Cat Hair extract should not be used if the patient has asthma, cardiovascular disease, emphysema, diabetes, bleeding diathesis or pregnancy, unless a specific diagnosis of Type 1 allergy to cat is made based on skin testing and the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks of an adverse reaction during testing or treatment. Cat extract is not indicated for use in patients who are not clinically allergic to cat or who are not skin reactive to cat allergenic extract. Limitations on treatment should be considered when treating young, or geriatric patients or patients suffering from auto-immune disorders or severe and unstable allergic disorders.

3.3 The allergic burden

Classical symptoms of cat allergy include rhinitis, asthma, and/or conjunctivitis. Quality of life is impaired in patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) or asthma, who may suffer from poor quality sleep, fatigue, reduced alertness, lower work productivity and concentration, and mood changes. 53, 54, 55 Learning may be impaired in children with allergic rhinitis. 53 The direct costs to the allergy sufferer are compounded by the indirect costs to society of impaired productivity and performance. 56 The severity of AR symptoms is the most common factor associated with impairment of productivity, but AR‐related sleep disturbances may contribute to the issue. 56 According to a digitally based mobile health (mHealth) initiative, 90% of app users with uncontrolled AR experienced some work productivity impairment and over 50% experienced severe work impairment. 56 These impairments may result not only from the allergic condition itself, but also from undesired effects of medications taken for symptom prevention and relief. 53, 57

In addition to their role in AR, allergies to cats and dogs are a major risk factor in the development of asthma. 7, 19, 47, 58 It is estimated that pets are the third‐leading cause of IgE‐mediated allergic asthma. Cat‐allergic children experience twice as many days with asthma symptoms and require more frequent dosing of β‐agonists and steroids during the second week of the school term in classrooms with moderate‐to‐high prevalence of home cat ownership. 26 More than 500 000 emergency visits were attributed to cat allergen‐induced asthma attacks in a cat‐sensitive and exposed population of patients with asthma. 58

The psychologic impact of cat allergy is of great concern. Many patients or parents of allergic children fail to comply with their physician's recommendations to avoid the animal; this can be understood especially when there are emotional consequences to making the asked for lifestyle changes.

### Rational approach to allergy testing [^1147AT2D]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Allergy testing is commonly used when symptoms of allergic rhinitis are refractory to symptoms and there is potential for treatment with institution of avoidance measures or immunotherapy. Once the decision for testing has been made, the method of testing by either in vivo skin testing by prick/puncture or intradermal testing or in vitro testing of serum-specific IgE is dictated by factors in the clinical history and an informed decision by the patient. Because there is no perfect testing method, understanding the benefits and limitations of each method is important in selecting the best testing option for each patient.

### Which patients with asthma are most likely to benefit from allergen immunotherapy? [^116hxWCw]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

If allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is to be considered as a treatment option for allergic asthma, it must undergo the same developmental steps as other antiasthmatic drugs. The bronchial allergen challenge model has demonstrated excellent negative predictive value for the development of new therapies for asthma. Subcutaneous immunotherapy appears to have a clinical and significant effect on the early asthmatic response to mite, cat, and birch and grass pollens in children and adults. Use of AIT in children with asthma is widely practiced but not supported by as strong a level of evidence as in adults. House dust mite sublingual immunotherapy tablets demonstrate efficacy in asthma exacerbations and other outcomes when used as add-on therapy in adult patients. Using a biologic to improve the patient's lung functions and asthma control before initiating AIT can transform unsuitable candidates for AIT into appropriate candidates. Because AIT is a form of personalized medicine, phenotyping the most suitable patient is necessary. Field studies of adults and children have suggested that polysensitized patients with rhinitis and Global Initiative for Asthma class 2 to class 4 asthma appear the most likely to be good responders. We hypothesized that AIT responders are those who demonstrate a high eosinophilic response to natural or experimental exposure.

3.4 Allergy's impact on cat welfare and the human‐animal bond

Pet ownership confers numerous health benefits, including positive influences on blood pressure and cardiovascular health, loneliness, depression and mental health, and weight management. 59 Many owners consider their cats part of the family. 45, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63 For these reasons, allergists' guidelines‐based recommendations to remove the cat from the home are often met with resistance. 8, 9, 19, 64

Allergies can limit the interactions between the allergic person and their cat, interfering with the human‐animal bond. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, the human‐animal bond is described as "a mutually beneficial and dynamic relationship between people and animals that is influenced by behaviors essential to both. This includes, among other things, emotional, psychological, and physical interactions of people, animals and the environment". 65 Physical contact plays an important role in the strength and longevity of the human‐cat bond. 66, 67 Many cat owners, and particularly female owners, also value their cat's cleanliness 60; understanding that grooming is an important aspect of cleanliness as well as a primary method for dispersion of cat allergens throughout the cat's hair and subsequently into the environment, this highly desired behavioral feature facilitates allergen exposure for allergic individuals.

Allergy to cats directly impacts cat welfare because allergy is a commonly provided reason for relinquishment of cats to shelters, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72 as well as a barrier to cat adoption and ownership. 72, 73

3.5 Diagnosis of cat allergy

The diagnosis of cat allergy is based on symptoms occurring during exposure and the demonstration of an IgE‐mediated sensitization to cat allergens. 9 Skin prick tests with standardized extracts are reliable. Serum‐specific IgE with a crude extract is equally important. However, the results of these tests should be confronted to symptoms as they only indicate a cat sensitization.

Most recently, molecular‐based (component‐resolved) diagnosis has become available. However, its exact significance in the diagnosis of cat allergy remains to be fully understood. 74 On the other hand, for the prediction of asthma severity 50, 51 or persistence to symptoms, 13 molecular‐based diagnosis may be relevant. One major advantage of the current molecular‐based diagnosis is certainly the determination of the primary sensitization source, which is not feasible by using extracts. This implies, of course, a better management of allergic patients.

Exposure tests are not recommended in routine diagnosis of cat allergy. 9

6.6 Anti‐Fel d 1 IgY is safe for cats

Many cat owners view their cats as part of the family 45, 60, 61, 62 and will often go to great lengths to keep their cat in the home despite allergies. 64 However, although many allergic owners will compromise their own health to keep their cat, they are unlikely to accept approaches that they feel may put their cat's health and well‐being at risk.

All egg products with egg yolk contain IgY. Egg products containing specifically targeted IgY have been used safely in human and veterinary medicine. 138, 139, 140, 141 The anti‐Fel d 1 IgY is safe for cats, based on a comprehensive safety study that fed an egg product ingredient with multiple levels of anti‐Fel d 1 IgY, including levels many times higher than those used in efficacy studies. 142

Based on the principle of allergen load reduction, complete elimination of Fel d 1 production is not necessary. Our approach does not neutralize 100% of the cat's Fel d 1; in essence, it converts moderate and high Fel d 1‐producing cats to the equivalent of low or moderate producers without altering the cat's production of the allergen. Cats produce varying levels of Fel d 1 depending on neuter status, sex, and genetics and can be healthy regardless of their Fel d 1 levels 15, 121; our approach preserves some biologically available Fel d 1 while reducing the active allergen.

6.7 Clinical impact of anti‐Fel d 1 IgY

Reducing the levels of active Fel d 1 in a cat's saliva and hair can reduce the amount of cat allergens shed into the environment on hair and dander, thereby reducing the total allergen load in the environment. If the allergen load is reduced to a level below the individual's allergic threshold, clinical allergy symptoms may be prevented. In order to determine the effects of feeding cats a diet with an egg product containing anti‐Fel d 1 IgY on clinical symptoms in human allergy sufferers, a controlled exposure study was conducted. 143

Volunteer participants (n = 114) were screened for the study. Subjects with asthma were excluded. Subjects were screened and selected for participation if they met the following criteria: history of strong cat sensitivity; positive skin prick test to standardized cat allergen extract; and documented variable response to high vs low levels of Fel d 1 on preliminary testing. Eleven subjects met all criteria and completed the study.

### Local and systemic effects of cat allergen nasal provocation [^114QZeSx]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Exposure to cat allergen in societies such as the United Kingdom and USA where cats are common pets is virtually universal. Homes without cats have significant levels of cat allergen 1, as do day care centres 2, and schools 3. Such exposures are sufficient to impair asthma control 4. Sensitization rates are high: an estimated 17% of the US population is cat‐sensitized 5, increasing to 44% of inner city, moderate–severe asthmatic children 6. Accordingly, cat sensitization is estimated to account for 29% of asthma cases in the United States 5. Furthermore, avoidance measures, such as the use of HEPA filters in the home, have proved ineffective 7, whilst the very high levels of allergen found in some cat‐owning homes appear to have the potential to induce high‐dose tolerance 8.

Currently, the only potentially disease‐modifying treatment for cat allergy is allergen immunotherapy. Whilst use of this treatment is not uncommon, clinical studies of its efficacy and mechanisms are hampered by the difficulty of assessing symptoms in relation to allergen exposure. One solution has been the use of an environmental exposure chamber 9, recently demonstrating the efficacy of a cat allergen peptide immunotherapy. Unfortunately, such facilities are expensive and available in few centres.

Data from clinical studies concerning the systemic effects of nasal mucosal allergen exposure are limited. However, evidence from murine experiments and from human bronchial challenges suggests airway allergen exposure may cause mobilization of bone marrow inflammatory cell precursors, with trafficking back to sites of mucosal inflammation 10, 11, 12. Such systemic immune effects may account for the reciprocal inflammation that can be induced by allergen challenge at either the lower 13 or upper airway 14, and explain the benefit of intranasal corticosteroids on asthma control 15. Of note, mature, peripheral blood basophils have previously been shown to upregulate expression of the beta‐subunit of the high‐affinity IgE receptor after in vivo nasal allergen challenge in grass and ragweed allergic individuals 16.

Asthma — furred pets — Complete avoidance of pet allergens is impossible for sensitized patients as these allergens are ubiquitous outside the home in schools, public transport, and even cat‑free buildings, probably transferred on clothes. Although removal of such animals from the home of a sensitized patient is encouraged, it can be many months before allergen levels decrease, and the clinical effectiveness of this and other interventions remains unproven.

PRECAUTIONS

General Information:

Epinephrine 1:1000 should be available as well as personnel trained in administering emergency treatment. Allergenic extracts are not intended for intravenous injection. For safe and effective use of allergenic extracts, sterile solutions, vials, syringes, etc. should be used and aseptic precautions observed in making dilutions and administering the allergenic extract injection. A sterile tuberculin syringe graduated in 0.1 mL units to measure each dose for the prescribed dilution should be used.

To reduce the risk of an occurrence of adverse reactions, begin with a careful personal and family history plus a physical exam. Confirm your findings with scratch or intradermal skin testing. Patients should be observed for 30 minutes after any test.

Information for Patients: All concentrates of allergenic extracts have the ability to cause serious local and systemic reactions including death in sensitive patients. To minimize this potential hazard, the relative sensitivity of the patient must be assessed from the allergic history and from clinical observations. In certain individuals, life-threatening reactions may occur. Patients should be informed of this risk prior to skin testing and immunotherapy. Patients should be instructed to recognize adverse reaction symptoms that may occur and to report all adverse reactions to a physician. Patients should be told to wait in the office after injections for at least 30 minutes.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Studies have shown that skin tests with cat extract are useful in the diagnosis of cat allergy. As a rule, persons with cat allergy have positive skin reactions when tested with cat extract, and non-allergic individuals rarely react (7, 8, 9). However, the relationship between a positive skin test and the appearance of clinical symptoms after exposure to a cat is not absolute, i.e., some skin-test positive persons do not experience allergic symptoms after exposure (10). Failure to experience symptoms may be dose related, since it is known that cats vary significantly in the amount of Fel d1 they produce (11).

The efficacy of cat extract immunotherapy in the treatment of bronchial asthma has been shown in two studies (12, 13) A reduction in bronchial sensitivity was observed in five patients with cat allergy, whereas no reduction was observed in placebo treated, cat-allergic patients.

Clinician's Summary:

For individuals with asthma who do not exhibit any allergy symptoms or for whom testing has not suggested that they have an allergy to certain indoor substances (eg, dust mites or cat dander), the Expert Panel recommends no specific environmental interventions to reduce these allergens within the home.

For individuals with asthma who are exposed to an allergen within the home and who have allergy symptoms or a positive test result suggesting that they have an allergy to certain indoor substances (eg, dust mites or cat dander), the Expert Panel recommends using a multicomponent intervention to try to control the indoor allergen in question. Single-component interventions often do not work.

For individuals with asthma who are exposed to cockroaches or rodents (eg, mice) in the home and who have allergy symptoms or sensitization to these allergens demonstrated by allergy skin testing or a specific IgE, the Expert Panel recommends using integrated pest management to improve asthma outcomes. Integrated pest management can be used alone or with other interventions to reduce exposure to pest-related allergens in the home.

Asthma environmental allergen mitigation — patient counseling and safety considerations — include that "Some cleaning and integrated pest management interventions may trigger asthma and/or be hazardous. Individuals with asthma need to balance the potential benefits and harms of interventions before implementing them". For pet-related exposures, the page notes "The few studies on pet removal have had inconclusive results", but "if an individual with asthma experiences symptoms around a pet, the individual should consider removing the pet from the home, keeping the pet outdoors, or, if neither of these options is feasible, keeping the pet out of commonly used rooms", and "Testing for sensitization to pets may be particularly worthwhile for those with chronic or uncontrolled symptoms and might help support what can be a difficult decision to remove a pet from the home". It also cautions that in sensitized individuals without symptoms "chronic exposure could have led to the development of clinical tolerance to that allergen in that environment", and that "Allergen-specific mitigation strategies could adversely modify this established balanced relationship between the individual and the environment". Additionally, "Clinicians need to consider the complexity of the patient population and the limitations of the evidence identified", and these approaches "do not replace routine good practices, including regular and frequent house cleaning and laundering of bedding materials".

### Single recombinant and purified major allergens and peptides: how they are made and how they change allergy diagnosis and treatment [^114oaLeb]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Studies Performed to Date

The first studies performed with synthetic peptides of the major cat allergen Fel d 1 did not yield satisfying clinical results,(Table 3). Early studies with higher concentrations of longer Fel d 1–derived peptides (Allervax CAT) administered subcutaneously were only partially encouraging because improved tolerance to cats observed in cat allergic patients was often accompanied by late asthmatic responses in some of the study participants. A clinical study in patients with birch pollen allergyhas shown that recombinant Bet v 1 (rBet v 1) was equally effective as birch pollen extract for subcutaneous immunotherapy (Identifier: NCT00410930). However, rBet v 1 is a fully IgE reactive protein, and therefore patients had to follow an inconvenient up-dosing schedule and monthly maintenance injections to avoid adverse effects. To increase the safety of sublingual immunotherapy, tablets that contained rBet v 1 for sublingual treatment were tested (Identifier: NCT00396149). The mean adjusted symptom scores were significantly decreased relative to placebo in patients receiving once-daily rBet v 1 tablets for 5 months. However, because the tablets need to be taken daily for many years, the adherence of the patients to the regimen is low, and it is also possible that sublingual application of rBet v 1 will induce oral allergy syndrome in some patients because an unmodified allergen that contains all IgE epitopes is applied. The need to reduce the potential adverse effects of AIT led in 2000 to the first AIT trial with recombinant allergen derivatives. Hypoallergenic recombinant fragments of rBet v 1 and rBet v 1 trimer were tested in 124 birch pollen allergic patients in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. This treatment had clinical efficacy, induced allergen-specific blocking IgG antibodies, reduced seasonal boosts of IgE production, and eliminated IgE-mediated immediate adverse effects. However, because most Bet v 1 T-cell epitopes are still maintained in the vaccine, systemic late-phase adverse effects were observed despite eliminated IgE reactivity. Similar findings were made later with long peptides of the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1.

### Furry animal allergy: lipocalins, serum albumins, and secretoglobins-cross-reactivity, diagnosis, and management strategies [^1173szhv]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) is a therapeutic approach that aims to desensitize patients suffering from IgE-mediated allergies. We can primarily distinguish between subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) and oral or sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT), as well as novel options such as intralymphatic immunotherapy. Allergies to various animals, including cats, dogs, horses, rabbits, hamsters, guinea pigs, sheep wool, goats, and parrot feathers, can be treated using both SCIT and SLIT. However, for cow hair and parrot feather allergens, only SCIT is available. Furthermore, available options for treating allergies to rodents remain quite limited. Immunotherapy can be administered using different types of substances. These include natural allergens, typically purified extracts, and allergoids, which are modified allergens with diminished allergenicity.

Additionally, recombinant vaccines are being developed to target specific allergens. An example of a recombinant vaccine is the PreS-Cat 1–5, which combines hypoallergenic peptides from key cat allergens (Fel d 1, Fel d 4, Fel d 7) with a carrier protein derived from the hepatitis B virus (HBV)-PreS. In preclinical studies, this vaccine demonstrated a significant reduction in IgE reactivity and allergenic activity, while also promoting the production of the tolerogenic cytokine IL-10 in cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These molecular vaccines appear to be highly promising, but their efficacy still needs to be validated through clinical trials.

New Treatment Options

Strategies to reduce or eliminate animal allergens have emerged as a recent trend in research aimed at minimizing exposure for individuals who are allergic to them. One such treatment option for Fel d 1 allergic patients is a vaccine administered to cats using virus-like particles that induce strong and enduring anti-Fel d 1 antibody responses in felines. As a result of administering the vaccine to cats, antibodies are produced to neutralize the allergenic Fel d 1 molecule. Consequently, there is a decrease in the reactivity of the Fel d 1 allergen, leading to mitigation or potential prevention of allergic reactions in individuals with hypersensitivity to this allergen. Research conducted by Thoms further showed that individuals with allergies could interact with vaccinated cats for extended periods before experiencing allergic symptoms, resulting in a sustained reduction of such symptoms during the 2-year study period. Currently, the vaccine is unavailable on the market.

NURSING MOTHERS: Data are not available on the secretion of Standardized Cat Hair Extract in human milk and it is not known what effect this might have on the nursing infant.

PEDIATRIC USE: The dose of Standardized Cat Hair Extract recommended for children is the same as that used for adults, except in the injection of large doses of extract for treatment. In this case, the amount of extract given to a child may be modified so that the discomfort of the injection is minimized.

DRUG INTERACTION: The skin test response to Standardized Cat Hair Extract in sensitive persons may be suppressed by previous treatment with antihistamines and drugs with antihistamine activity. Treatment with beta-blocking drugs may make patients refractory to the usual dose of epinephrine, in the event epinephrine is required to control an adverse allergic reaction. Caution should be observed in the following circumstances:

EXTREME SENSITIVITY TO CATS: Determined from previous anaphylaxis following skin testing or natural exposure.

AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE: Individuals with autoimmune disease may be at risk, due to the possibility of routine immunizations exacerbating symptoms of the underlying disease.

MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION: Patients who have experienced a recent myocardial infarction may not be able to tolerate immunotherapy. As in all of the above circumstances, the benefit to risk ratio must be carefully evaluated Standardized Cat Hair Extract should be temporarily withheld from patients if any of the following conditions exist: (1) severe symptoms of rhinitis and/or asthma; (2) infection or flu accompanied by fever, and (3) exposure to excessive amounts of clinically relevant allergen prior to a scheduled injection.

### Passive prophylactic administration with a single dose of anti-fel D 1 monoclonal antibodies REGN1908–1909 in cat allergen-induced allergic rhinitis: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^111rkmQv]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Challenges associated with AIT highlight the need for safer alternatives. A hallmark of successful AIT is the induction of sIgG, which putatively competes directly with IgE for allergen binding. Inhibition of the allergic response by IgG may also be mediated by costimulation of the inhibitory IgG receptor FcεRIIb that can negatively regulate FcεRI signaling and inhibit effector-cell activation. These postulated beneficial roles of IgG-blocking antibodies led to the development of passive administration with sIgG mAbs as a potential new treatment for allergies.

In a clinical study, two fully human mAbs (REGN1908 and REGN1909) directed against Fel d 1 blocked the acute allergic response after intranasal exposure to cat allergen, as measured by the TNSS. Here, we demonstrate that a single subcutaneous dose of the combined antibodies (REGN1908–1909) rapidly suppressed nasal symptoms compared with placebo in adult patients with cat-allergic rhinitis after NAC with cat hair extract within a week of administration. This suppression is in contrast with the slow onset of efficacy for traditional AIT, which typically occurs between 6 and 12 months after treatment initiation. NAC has been shown to correlate with outcomes during immunotherapy studies (both subcutaneous and sublingual) for allergic rhinitis. Therefore, our observations suggest the clinical effectiveness of REGN1908–1909. To further understand the mechanisms underlying symptom improvements, biomarker analyses were performed, including basophil sensitivity to allergen stimulation, secretion of type-2 inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in nasal fluid, and FAB assay.

### The role of aeroallergen sensitization testing in asthma management [^111ssQDf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a global disease affecting almost 400 million people. Simultaneously, the overall burden of allergies is increasing. Although allergies are frequent and commonly recognized triggers of asthma severity and exacerbations, the majority of patients with asthma are not investigated for their underlying aeroallergen sensitizations, despite the potentially preventable consequences and therapeutic options. This review summarizes the current state of aeroallergen sensitization testing for people with asthma. We describe who should be tested and why, how testing can be used to optimize asthma management, list barriers to implementation of effective asthma management strategies, and make recommendations for improving asthma/allergy management by aeroallergen testing. Establishing a diagnosis of asthma and determining whether there is an allergic component is fundamental to an effective treatment plan. Moreover, moving from severity-based to phenotype-based asthma care can improve the care of asthma and allergic diseases. Timely diagnosis of aeroallergen sensitizations forms the basis for individualized treatment plans, which may include allergen remediation strategies when appropriate, and allergen immunotherapy, the only immunomodulating therapy for allergic asthma. Finally, the advent of biologics will expand the number of patients who can benefit from treatment, with decreased symptoms and disease remission a possibility for the first time.

### Clinical and immunological evaluation of cat-allergic asthmatics living with or without a cat [^1122et3c]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite the presence of sIgG₄, WC subjects still experienced nasal, ocular, and respiratory symptoms that required medication use. The sIgG 4 concentrations in naturally exposed WC subjects were substantially lower than those achieved during cat specific AIT, or by passive administration of allergen‐specific IgG 4 monoclonal antibodies, both treatments shown to provide symptomatic benefits in cat‐allergic subjects. AIT has been shown to induce other allergen‐specific IgG subclasses (including IgG₁, IgG₂ and IgG₃), thus IgG 4 may not be the only type of immunoglobulin that is functionally protective.

The similar lung function, nasal patency, rhinitis symptoms and asthma control between WC and WoC subjects may be explained, at least in part, by the higher medication burden among the WC subjects. This medication burden may enable symptomatic control, since continuous natural cat exposure does not sufficiently attenuate the allergic response. There remains a substantial unmet need for more effective management strategies in subjects with cat allergy/asthma who are living with cats. Furthermore, in trials of such management strategies, use of lung function as an endpoint was supported by the consistency between at‐home and in‐clinic spirometry assessments.

Patient population

Eligible participants were 18–55 years of age with cat-induced allergic rhinitis and cat sensitization confirmed at screening. To confirm cat-sensitization, participants underwent screening at two visits, day −28 and day −14 (± 2 days). At screening visit 1, participants were screened for allergen-specific IgE, underwent a skin prick test with cat hair extract (cat-SPT, Aquagen, ALK-Abello) and other allergen extracts, and were tested for lung function (FEV1). Participants were eligible for screening visit 2 based on IgE titers specific for Fel d 1 and cat hair extract > 0.35kAU/l each, cat-SPT mean wheal diameter of > 3 mm compared to a negative control SPT, and normal lung function. Patients were excluded if they had prior history of SIT or vaccination with cat allergen, or anti-IgE therapy; SIT to other allergens within 3 months prior to screening; or were living with or chronically exposed to a cat.

At screening visit 2, a single NAC was performed using increasing doses of cat hair extracts (100–33,000 SQ-U/ml). Briefly, cat hair extract was applied intranasally every 10 min for 1 h, or until a TNSS > 7 was reached. TNSS (measured on a 0–12 scale) is a composite patient symptom assessment of congestion, itching, and rhinorrhea (each graded on 0–3 scale, 3 being severe), and sneezing (3 being > 5 sneezes). Cat-sensitized patients were eligible for enrollment based on having a TNSS < 2 prior to the screening NAC (time 0), and peak TNSS > 7 within one hour of NAC initiation. PNIF (measured in nasal patency, l/min) was also measured at screening visit 2.

### Keep the cat, change the care pathway: a transformational approach to managing fel D 1, the major cat allergen [^112rBA59]. Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

3.2 Mono‐ and polysensitization

Cross‐reactivity or co‐sensitization exists between some animal allergens, and many patients are allergic to cats and dogs, but also to other furry animals. However, since the major cat allergen Fel d 1 does not cross‐reacts with other animals, co‐sensitization is more likely.

In the BAMSE cohort, 13 sensitizations to Fel d 1 in childhood were significantly associated with symptoms to cat at age 16 years. Polysensitization to 3 or more allergen molecules from cat was a better longitudinal predictor of cat symptoms than results of IgE tests with cat allergen extract. Cross‐sectionally, cat‐polysensitized children had higher IgE levels and more frequent symptoms to cat than monosensitized children.

In the West Sweden Asthma Study, the characterization of sensitization to furry animal allergen components was assessed in an adult population. 3 Fel d 1 was the most prevalent cat component in monosensitized individuals, whereas all cat allergens including Fel d 1 were detected in polysensitized individuals. This study may be of relevance for the stratification of patients who would be exposed to low‐allergencity cats.

Sensitization to furry animal allergen components is an important predictor of asthma, rhinitis, and markers of asthma severity. 50 Current asthma and asthma symptoms following contact with cats were associated with co‐sensitization to Fel d 1 and Fel d 4. This association was seen already at moderate‐level sensitization (1‐15 ISU) to Fel d 4, at which level most children were sensitized to Fel d 1, as well. 51 There is a wide heterogeneity among cat‐allergic individuals with multiple clusters of sensitization. Each sensitization cluster (nonsensitized, Fel d 1‐driven sensitized, and multisensitized clusters) was associated with substantial increased risk of asthma, rhinitis, concomitant asthma, and rhinitis. 50 There was, however, no association with asthma exacerbations, FEV1 predicted values, emergency visits, or regular oral steroid use. In another study, children with severe allergic asthma had higher serum IgE levels to cat, dog, and horse. Molecular‐based allergy diagnostics revealed a more complex molecular spreading of allergen components (polysensitization) in children with the most severe disease. 52

### Passive prophylactic administration with a single dose of anti-fel D 1 monoclonal antibodies REGN1908–1909 in cat allergen-induced allergic rhinitis: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^115XMimE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Sensitization to the major cat allergen, Fel d 1 (Felis domesticus allergen 1), is a main contributor to persistent allergic rhinitis with or without asthma. The risk of asthma-like respiratory symptoms upon cat allergen exposure increases with increasing levels of the allergen-specific IgE (sIgE) for cat dander.

Although cat allergy management relies on oral antihistamines and nasal corticosteroids, allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is indicated for those who do not respond to symptomatic pharmacotherapy. AIT involves repeated long-term subcutaneous administration of the sensitizing allergen for at least 3 years. AIT is clinically effective for allergic rhinitis and asthma, but efficacy is equivocal for cat allergy. Furthermore, because AIT may be associated with severe and occasionally life-threatening reactions in people with asthma, it is contraindicated for people with moderate-to-severe asthma who have a cat-induced allergy.

The disease-modifying effects of AIT are attributed to shifts from T-helper cell type 2 (Th2) to Th1 responses, the induction of regulatory T cells, and the production of allergen-neutralizing antibodies, with the induction of allergen-specific IgG (sIgG) antibodies consistently being observed (,–). Through direct competition with IgE for allergen binding, IgG-associated blocking antibodies are believed to inhibit the allergen-induced release of inflammatory mediators from basophils and mast cells, thus preventing early-phase allergic reactions (,–). Elevation of the sIgG/sIgE ratio has been also reported to correlate with symptom improvement during AIT.

Recently, two fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against two distinct, nonoverlapping epitopes on Fel d 1 were developed using Regeneron's VelocImmune Human antibody mouse platform (REGN1908 and REGN1909). Both molecules bind noncompetitively to these epitopes. A phase 1b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-mechanism study determined that passive administration of neutralizing sIgG for Fel d 1 could inhibit cat hair extract–induced allergic nasal symptoms in patients with cat allergy. A single subcutaneous dose of the combined mAbs (REGN1908–1909; 600 mg, 1:1 ratio) in patients with cat allergy rapidly reduced total nasal symptoms by blocking the early-phase allergic response to nasal allergen challenge (NAC) with cat allergen and significantly reduced mean wheal size after skin prick testing with cat allergen within a week of initial dosing.

### Mechanisms of subcutaneous and sublingual aeroallergen immunotherapy: what is new? [^112d4Jqz]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is considered to be the only treatment option with the promise of healing and induction of long-lasting allergen tolerance, persisting even after discontinuation of therapy. Despite a more than 100-year-long history, still only a minority of patients are being treated with AIT. Substantial developments took place in the last decade to overcome problems in standardization, efficacy, safety, high costs, long duration of treatment; and new guidelines have also been implemented. Major advancements in the understanding of AIT mechanisms with the focus on recent findings of subcutaneous and sublingual AIT have been summarized.

### Orphan immunotherapies for allergic diseases [^116SHfgo]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

As confirmed by systematic reviews and meta-analyses, allergen immunotherapy is clinically effective in the treatment of allergic diseases. In particular, subcutaneous immunotherapy is a pivotal treatment in patients with severe reactions to Hymenoptera venom, whereas subcutaneous immunotherapy and sublingual immunotherapy are indicated in the treatment of allergic rhinitis and asthma by inhalant allergens. Other allergies related to animal dander (other than cat, which is the most studied), such as dog, molds, occupational allergens, and insects, have also been recognized. For these allergens, immunotherapy is poorly studied and often unavailable. Thus, use of the term orphan immunotherapies is appropriate.

Data Sources

We used MEDLINE to search the medical literature for English-language articles.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled, masked studies for orphan immunotherapies were selected. In the remaining cases, the available reports were described.

Results

The literature on food desensitization is abundant, but for other orphan allergens, such as mosquito, Argas reflexus, dog, or occupational allergens, there are only a few studies, and most are small studies or case reports.

Conclusion

Orphan immunotherapy is associated with insufficient evidence of efficacy from controlled trials, an erroneous belief of the limited importance of some allergen sources, and the unlikelihood for producers to have a profit in making commercially available extracts (with an expensive process for registration) to be used in few patients. It should be taken into consideration that adequate preparations should be available also for orphan allergens.

### Shared decision-making in the care of a patient with food allergy [^114MKhdV]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Shared decision-making is a patient-centered approach that involves a mutual discussion about management or treatment options, which account for the patient's underlying values and preferences for therapy. Little is known about the role of shared decision-making in the care of patients with food allergy.

Data Sources

A narrative review of the shared decision-making and food allergy outcomes literature in the past 20 years was performed.

Results

In shared decision-making, care must be taken to help clarify the patient's values regarding their care options, but not instill the clinician's values or preferences into that choice. It is essential to understand the mutual roles of the clinician in the process of providing evidence-based options for care, advocating for treatments that are aligned with their goals and preferences, and allowing patients to make fully informed decisions within this paradigm. Decision support tools such as decision aids can assist patients in the values clarification process, particularly in which preference-sensitive care exists, in which options hold significant tradeoffs and varying outcomes, and the decision is reflective of personal values and preferences. There are multiple potential preference-sensitive care scenarios in food allergy in which shared decision-making could be optimized, including the development of decision aids. These areas include early allergenic solid introduction, preemptive epinephrine use in which there is allergen exposure but no symptoms, automatic activation of EMS after using epinephrine, and choices of food allergy treatment. Only one decision aid in food allergy exists.

Conclusion

Shared decision-making is an approach that could greatly enhance food allergy care and improve patient-reported outcomes.

### Is structured allergy history sufficient when assessing patients with asthma and rhinitis in general practice? [^116WoT1Y]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Many United Kingdom patients with asthma and rhinitis are allergic, but in primary care few diagnostic and management decisions are made with formal allergy assessment. Arguably, knowing a patient's atopic status might be helpful in distinguishing the cause of disease and in selecting appropriate treatments.

Objectives

Our objective was to estimate the extent to which a formal allergy assessment (a structured allergy history and skin prick tests to 5 common aeroallergens) would improve the precision of allergy diagnosis compared with a patient's self-report or the structured allergy history alone.

Methods

One hundred twenty-seven patients with asthma, rhinitis, or both were recruited from 4 general practices in Wessex, United Kingdom. Allergy status based on the patient's opinion and on structured allergy history alone was compared with formal allergy assessment. Assessments were validated by an independent allergy specialist reviewing the files. Patients were given written advice specific to their allergies and followed up 3 months later to assess satisfaction, recall, and effect on health and behavior.

Results

Self-reporting misclassified allergic status in many patients. A structured allergy history alone was little better and resulted in false-positive rates for cat allergy of 32%, grass pollen of 48%, house dust mite of 75%, tree pollen of 54%, and dog of 27% compared with formal allergy assessment. Skin prick testing combined with a structured history was essential to reach a correct causative diagnosis. Three months later, 41% patients had made changes to lifestyle, medications, or both, and 18% reported clinical improvement.

Conclusions

Skin prick testing improves the accuracy of an assessment of allergic status based on patient opinion or a structured allergy history alone.

### Clinical and immunological evaluation of cat-allergic asthmatics living with or without a cat [^116Vt5ax]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

KEYMESSAGES

Cat‐allergic asthmatics who live with cats have significantly higher medication requirements to control symptoms compared with cat‐allergic asthmatics who do not live with cats.
Basophils are less sensitive to Fel d 1 stimulation in those who live with cat, which may be due to higher serum concentrations of allergen‐specific IgG4.
Fel d 1‐specific Th2A responses are higher in those who live with cats relative to those who do not, and correlate with Fel d 1 sIgE levels.

Diagnostics

In 2022, the European Academy of Allergy and Immunology published guidelines in Molecular Guide 2.0 on the treatment of allergies to cats, dogs, and horses. This methodology involves taking a clinical history, including questions about contact with animals or the presence of pets at home. Further steps involve conducting SPT or measuring specific IgE levels and, in some instances, using nasal provocation tests to confirm the diagnosis.

SPT is a widely utilized method that involves applying an extract to the skin while observing the reaction. It serves as the initial diagnostic step for allergic diseases and is both cost-effective and reliable. However, caution is necessary when addressing dog allergies, as the concentrations of major dog allergens in commercially available extracts vary among manufacturers. The use of the extract in allergy diagnosis may lead to the underdiagnosis of patients with dog allergies.

Another step in diagnosis involves measuring IgE levels in patients' serum for specific allergens. This method utilizes enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Depending on the individual patient's profile, including the range and variety of symptoms experienced, physicians select either a single allergen or a set of allergens for the diagnostic process. Assessing antibodies for specific IgE against cat, dog, or horse allergens is crucial for identifying the source of primary sensitization. Current guidelines do not recommend measuring the total IgE concentration in a patient's blood, as it does not contribute to diagnosis. Among component-resolved diagnostic tests, we distinguish multiplex tests — ImmunoCAP ISAC, ALEX2 ®, (and the newly announced version of the ALEX3 ®) — and a singleplex test, ImmunoCAP ™. Summary of information regarding these diagnostic methods is present in Table 5.

Table 5
Comparison of component-resolved diagnostic test

CCD, cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants

The final method, NPT, is optional for patients with animal allergies. The nasal provocation test is recommended for complex cases, such as patients allergic to multiple dog molecules. However, in cases of cat allergy, provocation tests are generally unnecessary, as diagnosis using skin tests and sIgE is typically sufficient. Nevertheless, it can be a helpful method when discrepancies exist between SPT and sIgE results or in cases of polysensitization.

Diagnostic guidelines have been established for commonly encountered animals, including cats, dogs, and horses. However, there is still a gap in guidelines for allergies related to less popular animal species. As noted in the review by Rosada et al. which explores the diagnostic options for animal allergies, new guidelines are necessary for less prevalent animals.

Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) for allergic rhinitis (AR) and/or AA — discussion and expected effects: Clinicians should discuss AIT options with their patients with AR and/or AA whose symptoms are inadequately controlled with medical therapy, allergen avoidance, or both, or who have preference for immunomodulation. AIT has been shown to improve symptoms and quality of life (QOL) while reducing rescue medication intake; it also has the potential to reduce new allergic sensitizations and the development of asthma. AIT is the only treatment option that has been shown to result in continued control of the symptoms of AR after cessation of therapy.

### Standardized cat hair [^115YTTxV]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

Standardized allergenic extract is intended for use by physicians who are experienced in the administration of standardized (BAU/mL) allergenic extracts for immunotherapy and the emergency care of anaphylaxis, or for use under the guidance of an allergy specialist. Standardized allergenic extracts are not directly interchangeable with other allergenic extracts. The initial dose must be based on skin testing as described in the dosage and administration section of this insert. Patients being switched from other types of extract to standardized allergenic extracts should be started as though they were coming under treatment for the first time. STANDARDIZED CAT HAIR EXTRACT IS NOT INTERCHANGEABLE WITH STANDARDIZED CAT PELT EXTRACTS, STANDARDIZED CAT EXTRACTS LABELED IN AU/mL, OR WITH NON-STANDARDIZED CAT EXTRACTS.

This product should not be injected intravenously. Deep subcutaneous routes have been safe. Sensitive patients may experience severe anaphylactic reactions resulting in respiratory obstruction, shock, coma and/or death. (See Adverse Reactions)

Serious adverse reactions should be reported to Nelco Laboratories immediately and a report filed to: MedWatch, The FDA Medical Product Problem Reporting Program, at 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Md. 20852–9787, call 1–800-FDA-1088.

Extreme caution should be taken when using allergenic extracts for patients who are taking beta-blocker medications. In the event of a serious adverse reaction associated with the use of allergenic extracts, patients receiving beta-blockers may not be responsive to epinephrine or inhaled brochodialators.

### Inhalant mediated allergy: immunobiology, clinical manifestations and diagnosis [^116MATqQ]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Inhalant allergen–mediated respiratory diseases, including asthma and allergic rhinitis, have become increasing global health issues. While air pollution is believed to favor allergic sensitization and intensify clinical symptoms of allergy, allergen sensitization can vary highly with geographical location, climate, and lifestyle differences. Pollen sensitization is higher in European countries, while dust mite is more common in regions with high humidity. Domestic pet sensitization is on the rising trend in industrialized nations, but the paradoxical effect of intensive cat exposure in early childhood is also observed. Clinical management of inhalant allergic diseases has greatly benefited from the immunological and mechanistic understanding of pathophysiology. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge on inhalant mediated allergic disorders with emphasis on (1) the major immune cells and relevant chemokines and cytokines in the sensitization and effector phase with aeroallergen exposure, (2) their manifestation in asthma and allergic rhinitis, (3) characterization of inhalant allergens, (4) chemical contributions to the development of allergic diseases, and (5) clinical diagnosis of aeroallergen sensitization and management of inhalant allergy. Knowledge on the role of Th2 skewing, IgE, basophil, mast cells, and eosinophils in respiratory allergic diseases are fundamental in the diagnosis and management of these disorders. Skin test, basophil activation test, and specific IgE component–resolved diagnostics are used for diagnosis and facilitate further management. Advances in the development of biologics and allergen-specific immunotherapy will strategize the future approaches in the clinical care of respiratory allergic diseases.

Indoor allergen control and air filtration in asthma — the Work Group categorized this as Reviewed, New-added and reported that evidence has not shown any consistent clinically meaningful or statistically significant benefits for HEPA or NO2 filters across large populations or consistently in asthmatic patients. Single indoor interventions found no significant effects, including acaricides for dust mites, air purification devices, impermeable mattress covers, carpet removal, HEPA vacuums, mold removal, pest control, and pet removal, while multicomponent approaches showed some improvements but not consistently asthma control, rates of asthma exacerbations, quality of life, or hospitalizations. Additional notes include that removal of rodents through IPM is not consistently associated with symptom improvement, cat and dog dander may persist in a home for up to six months after animal removal and the most common recommendation is to rehome an animal for sensitized patients, and studies of HEPA filters have not shown consistent clinical benefit for asthma. Accordingly, the Work Group decided upon a Weak against recommendation.

### Cat hair (standardized cat hair) [^1146mR2i]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Immunotherapy

Allergenic extract should be administered subcutaneously in the outer aspect of the upper arm using a sterile tuberculin syringe and needle. The skin should be cleaned with 70% alcohol and aseptic technique should be observed in removing the extract from the vial. Care must be taken to avoid injecting the extract into a blood vessel because of the potential hazard of anaphylaxis.

Standardized Cat Hair Extract must be diluted before administration to new patients. As a precaution against overdose, a skin test with the intended starting dose should be done to help evaluate the patient's sensitivity to the product. If the skin response is larger than 5/15 mm (edema/erythema), the extract should be diluted before it is given subcutaneously. The doses shown in the Dosage Schedule may be followed unless the patient's skin test response and allergic history indicate that more dilute extract should be used.

Little is known about the required accumulated dosage of Fel d1(and other allergens that may be present in cat extract) that is needed to relieve symptoms. However, studies with other allergenic substances have shown that high dose immunotherapy is most efficacious in the treatment of allergic rhinitis and asthma. The amount of cat extract that is tolerated during immunotherapy depends upon the sensitivity of the patient. In one study in which patients with cat asthma were treated for a period of one year, the accumulated dose of Fel d1varied from 3.6 to 115.8 (median 46.2) units (13). A burning sensation immediately following the injection of extract from the concentrate is due to the glycerol in the extract. It should not be interpreted as an adverse allergic response.

Patients who have received allergenic extract for maintenance therapy SHOULD NOT be given the same dose from a fresh vial of extract. IT IS ADVISABLE TO REDUCE THE DOSAGE OF FRESH EXTRACT TO ONE-FOURTH THE AMOUNT GIVEN FROM A PREVIOUS LOT.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Positive skin tests with allergenic extract are the result of histamine release from mast cells sensitized with allergen specific IgE. The exact mechanisms by which immunotherapy relieves symptoms of allergy are still under investigation. Elevations in allergen-specific IgG antibodies and an increase in the activity of T suppressor lymphocytes appear to be some of the immunologic changes that occur from hyposensitization (4, 5, 6).

### Individualized household allergen intervention lowers allergen level but not asthma medication use: a randomized controlled trial [^117GuwzA]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Environmental exposures to indoor allergens are major contributors to asthma symptoms, particularly in inner cities. The effectiveness of household allergen reduction as an adjunct to National Asthma Education Prevention Program guideline-based pharmacologic therapy in asthma has not been prospectively studied.

Objective

To study the effect of individualized allergen reduction on ability to reduce asthma pharmacologic therapy over 40 weeks.

Methods

We performed a randomized controlled trial to determine the effect of multifaceted indoor allergen avoidance measures on the ability to reduce asthma controller therapy in adults and children residing in New York City who were both sensitized and exposed to at least 1 indoor allergen. Asthma treatment and control were optimized in all subjects before randomization.

Results

A total of 125 subjects were randomized to receive individualized household allergen reduction and 122 received a sham intervention. Subjects in the intervention group significantly reduced all measured allergen levels (cat, dog, dust mite allergens in the bedroom, cockroach and mouse allergens in the kitchen and bedroom); those in the control group reduced only dust mite and mouse allergens in the bedroom and cockroach allergen in the kitchen. Participants in the intervention arm reduced National Asthma Education Prevention Program-based therapy from step 4.4 at randomization to 3.50 postintervention (range, 0–6); participants in the control arm reduced medication from step 4.4 to 3.4 (P = 0.76). There were no differences in other measured asthma outcomes.

Conclusions

Targeted allergen avoidance measures do not allow for reduction in asthma pharmacologic therapy compared with usual care in patients already receiving optimal controller therapy.

### Clinical and immunological evaluation of cat-allergic asthmatics living with or without a cat [^113AMjoZ]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This observational non‐interventional study explored how clinical and immunological characteristics related to cat allergy differ between asthmatic subjects who live with cats and those who do not, albeit in a low number of subjects. We demonstrated that chronic cat allergen exposure modulates the relationship between primary effector cells (basophils) and cat allergen‐specific IgG 4. A unique aspect of the study is that such cohorts have not previously been comprehensively evaluated. In addition, clinical and immunological outcomes were evaluated at serial time points over a 28 days period. Basophil activation was assessed both qualitatively and quantitatively, and the induction of cat allergen‐specific Th2A cells was specifically evaluated. Of particular relevance is that the time points provided evidence of within‐subject and longitudinal robustness of BAT and BST as immunological markers, showing a consistency similar to SPT and serum testing. Additionally, five subjects who had negative Fel d 4 sIgE and seven subjects with negative Fel d 7 sIgE had positive BATs to Fel d 4 and Fel d 7, respectively, suggesting that basophil testing is more sensitive than serology as a marker for allergy, and its use as an outcome measure should be further explored as a potential surrogate of treatment effects.

In both groups of cat allergic individuals, Fel d 1 was the most prevalent cat allergen leading to high serum sIgE levels and significant basophil reactivity. However, WC subjects tended to have higher sIgE levels and basophil reactivity to Fel d 1 compared to WoC, which may result from the continued exposure to additional epitopes on Fel d 1. Chronic exposure to cats might also contribute to sensitisation to other cat allergen components, as we observed significantly higher levels of sIgE against Fel d 4, along with numerically greater basophil reactivity to Fel d 4 and Fel d 7, among WC relative to WoC subjects.

Increased IgG 4 has previously been implicated in ameliorating the IgE‐mediated allergic response and in inducing tolerance. Beyond IgG 4, it has been further suggested that natural cat exposure results in partial clinical and immunological tolerance that may be mediated by other subclasses of IgG, or more specifically by the relative abundance of IgG vs. IgE. The high IgG concentrations obtained with AIT or during passive administration of monoclonal antibodies also increase the IgG/IgE ratio, which has been reported to correlate with clinical symptom improvement. Consistent with these studies, we observed that living with a cat was associated with increased Fel d 1 sIgG 4 levels, which correlated with significantly lower basophil sensitivity to cat dander extract and Fel d 1 protein relative to WoC subjects.

### Treatment set ts344059 [^111SRZAM]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

Individual allergenic extract treatment vial is intended for use by physicians who are experienced in the administration of allergenic extracts for immunotherapy and the emergency care of anaphylaxis, or for use under the guidance of an allergy specialist. Individual allergenic extract treatment vials are not directly interchangeable with other allergenic extracts. The initial dose must be based on skin testing as described in the dosage and administration section of this insert. Patients being switched from other types of extract to individual treatment vials should be started as though they were coming under treatment for the first time. Patients should be instructed to recognize adverse reaction symptoms and cautioned to contact the physician's office if reaction symptoms occur. As with all allergenic extracts, severe systemic reactions may occur. In certain individuals, these reactions may be life-threatening. Patient should be observed for at least 20 minutes following treatment and emergency measures as well as personnel trained in their use should be immediately available in the event of a life-threatening reaction.

This product should not be injected intravenously. Deep subcutaneous routes have proven to be safe. See the warnings, precautions, adverse reactions and overdosage sections below.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^111X1yvD]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Allergy diagnostic testing — skin prick/puncture versus intradermal testing: The skin prick/puncture test is superior to intradermal testing for predicting nasal allergic symptoms triggered by pollen exposure, and it is superior to intradermacutaneous testing for predicting allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma from cat exposure; the skin prick/puncture can be used to rule out allergic rhinitis and asthma triggered by cat exposure; generally, skin prick/puncture testing is more sensitive for identifying sensitization to inhalant allergens and confirming clinical allergy, while specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) assays with defined quantifiable thresholds can also predict positive respiratory responses after allergen exposure.

### Environmental assessment and exposure control: a practice parameter – furry animals [^117FjHb6]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2012). Medium credibility.

Furry animal exposure — evaluation and environmental control of pet-related allergy includes obtaining a history of pet exposure along with skin or in vitro tests for pet specific IgE to assess sensitization status, and treatment includes removal of the pet when feasible with interventions targeted at reducing exposure to reservoirs and blocking pathways from reservoirs to home occupants. It is recommended that cats and dogs be removed from the environment or at least kept out of the bedroom to reduce exposure to these allergens, and because carpeting and bedding serve as significant reservoirs, frequent vacuuming and regular carpet removal should be considered. In addition, the length of hair does not correspond with the allergenicity of a cat or dog, and there is no evidence of the existence of a completely nonallergenic furry animal. Because individual interventions generally are not effective, allergen exposure reduction requires a combination of interventions, including regular washing of the pet, use of denaturants for reservoirs, HEPA air filtration, and regular vacuuming, and it is often possible to demonstrate that a particular intervention, such as use of high-efficiency particulate (HEPA) filters, vacuuming, chemical treatment of carpeting, and use of mattress encasements, are able to reduce environmental exposures, although it is another matter to demonstrate that such reduction improves health because animal allergens are present throughout the environment, making it virtually impossible to avoid all exposure.

### Dose dependence and time course of the immunologic response to administration of standardized cat allergen extract [^117VGZzQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The immunologic response to allergen immunotherapy with 3 serial 5-fold doses of cat extract has been studied after approximately 5 weeks of immunotherapy. The highest dose containing 15 mug of Fel d 1 produced the most consistent and favorable response. It is unknown whether the comparative response on reaching a maintenance dose is maintained with long-term maintenance therapy.

Objective

The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the immunologic responses with these 3 serial doses of cat hair and dander extract at baseline, after reaching the maintenance dose (approximately 5 weeks), and after 1 year of maintenance immunotherapy.

Methods

Twenty-eight patients with cat allergy randomized in a double-blind study were assigned to one of 4 treatment groups: placebo or cat hair and dander extract containing 0.6 mug of Fel d 1, 3 mug of Fel d 1, and 15 mug of Fel d 1 at maintenance. Studies included skin prick tests and late cutaneous reactions with cat hair and dander extract, titrated nasal challenges with the extract, serum cat allergen-specific IgG4 and IgE measurement, and flow cytometric and ELISA analysis of whole blood and intranasal cytokines (TGF-beta, IL-10, IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-5).

Results

Twenty-six subjects completed the study. After both 5 weeks and 1 year, significant and dose-dependent differences were seen with total symptom scores on nasal challenge (P < .0001), with titrated skin prick testing with cat dander extract at 5 weeks (P = 0.014) and 1 year (P < .0001), and with cat-specific IgG4 measurement at 5 weeks (P = 0.004) and 1 year (P = 0.003). At 1 year, neither flow cytometry of whole blood nor ELISA evaluation of nasal cytokines demonstrated any significant differences among the treatment groups.

Conclusion

The response to titrated nasal allergen challenge, titrated skin prick testing, and allergen-specific IgG4 measurement to cat immunotherapy at 5 weeks is predictive of the response at 1 year.

### REGN1908 / 1909 prevented cat allergen-induced early asthmatic responses in an environmental exposure unit [^114Fw4dz]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The dominant allergen in cat dander, Felis domesticus allergen 1 (Fel d 1), is a persistent trigger for allergic rhinitis and asthma symptoms.

Objective

We evaluated the efficacy of Fel d 1 monoclonal antibodies (REGN1908/1909) in preventing cat allergen-induced early asthmatic responses (EARs) in cat-allergic patients with mild asthma.

Methods

Patients were randomized to single-dose REGN1908/1909 600 mg (n = 29) or placebo (n = 27). The FEV₁ was measured for up to 4 hours in a cat allergen environmental exposure unit up to 85 days after dosing. Assessments included between-group differences in change from baseline in FEV₁ area under the curve (AUC; 0–2 hours) and incidence of EAR (FEV 1 reduction ≥ 20%).

Trial Registration

NCT03838731.

Results

Single-dose REGN1908/1909 significantly prevented reductions in FEV 1 on days 8, 29, 57, and 85. Most REGN1908/1909 patients did not have an EAR by 4 hours (the last time point tested). In contrast, placebo-treated patients experienced a ≥ 20% mean FEV₁ reduction on days 8, 29, 57, and 85 after dosing, with most experiencing an EAR within 1 hour. REGN1908/1909-treated patients tolerated 3-fold higher allergen quantities (P < .05 at all time points) versus placebo. REGN1908/1909 substantially reduced skin test reactivity to cat allergen versus placebo at all time points tested (nominal P < .001). REGN1908/1909 was generally well tolerated; no serious adverse events or deaths were reported.

Conclusion

Single-dose REGN1908/1909 significantly prevented reductions in FEV 1 in cat-allergic patients with mild asthma on cat allergen environmental exposure unit exposure at 8 days and up to 85 days after dose.

### Environmental assessment and exposure control: a practice parameter – furry animals [^113aszq5]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2012). Medium credibility.

Air filtration — high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) cleaners run continuously can reduce exposure to dog and cat allergens, but the clinical benefits are unknown (B). In a randomized trial of 36 asthmatic children sensitized and exposed to cat and/or dog, HEPA cleaners in the living room and bedroom failed to change bronchial hyperresponsiveness or allergen exposure; in a crossover study of 20 asthmatic children, cleaners used for 3 months decreased airway hyperresponsiveness but showed no differences in symptom scores or medication use. A systematic review of 10 randomized controlled trials reported decreases in airway responsiveness and lower symptom scores in 2 studies, with medication use not affected; a Cochrane review identified only 2 trials that were too small to provide evidence for or against air filtration. In a randomized controlled trial of 35 cat-allergic patients, bedrooms had active or placebo air cleaners for 3 months; the active-filter group had a significantly decreased airborne exposure to Fel d 1 with no differences in settled-dust levels, and asthma symptoms were not improved. In adults with asthma exposed to cats and/or dogs, placing air cleaners in the living room and bedroom for 12 months alongside HEPA filter vacuum cleaners produced clinical improvement in 67% compared with 20%.

### Cat allergen exposure in a naturalistic exposure chamber: a prospective observational study in cat-allergic subjects [^1114X5mq]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

2.4 Study endpoints

The primary endpoint was the proportion of cat‐allergic asthmatics who attained an EAR within 180 min during the first NEC challenge on day 1. Time to EAR was defined as either the time to a ≥ 20% reduction in FEV1 in the NEC, or when the subject voluntarily departed the NEC due to clinically significant allergic or asthma symptoms. Reductions in FEV1 of ≥ 20% were adjudicated by the investigators by blindly evaluating baseline and subsequent spirometry data, including flow volume loops.

Secondary endpoints (see Table S1) included the proportion of cat‐allergic asthmatics who attained an EAR within 180 min in the NEC on day 28, the proportion who experienced a late asthmatic response (LAR) within 24 h of being in the NEC, and the incidence rates of AEs and serious AEs through the end of the study.

During the on‐site 6‐h observation period, the time to LAR was defined as the time to a ≥ 15% reduction in FEV1 (with spirometry efforts adjudicated by the investigator) from leaving the NEC. During the at‐home monitoring period up to 24 h after the subject exited the NEC, time to LAR was defined as time to a ≥ 15% reduction in FEV₁(confirmed by two spirometry efforts within 5 min) along with either rescue medication use (any medication at any dose) within 1 h or the presence of chest symptoms within 1 h of the drop in FEV1 (adjudicated by the investigator). A subject could not have more than one LAR within 24 h of leaving the NEC.

### Clinical and immunological evaluation of cat-allergic asthmatics living with or without a cat [^1173gGVH]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Cat allergen exposure modulates the relationship between primary effector basophils and allergen‐specific blocking IgG 4, with Fel d 1 appearing to be the primary allergen. Even though we observed immunological changes in WC subjects relative to WoC subjects, the clinical results do not support tolerance with natural cat exposure. Despite the small sample size, which is the primary limitation of this study, the results showed low intra‐subject variability and remarkable robustness in longitudinal measurement of clinical assessments and immunological assays. We also observed immunological differences that could distinguish between the two groups with statistical significance. These immunological differences suggest the importance of designing studies for evaluation of allergy management strategies that specifically reflect the population of interest and their baseline clinical/immunological characteristics. The data also imply a need to stratify the cat allergic population based on living with a cat. Finally, the clinical and immunological markers that we evaluated in this study should be further explored as surrogate measure of therapeutic effects in future clinical trials, and also as biomarkers for mechanistic studies of the allergic response.

### House dust mite respiratory allergy: an overview of current therapeutic strategies [^114rhvAD]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Although house dust mite (HDM) allergy is a major cause of respiratory allergic disease, specific diagnosis and effective treatment both present unresolved challenges. Guidelines for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and asthma are well supported in the literature, but specific evidence on the efficacy of pharmacotherapy treatment for known HDM-allergic patients is weaker. The standard diagnostic techniques — skin prick test and specific IgE testing — can be confounded by cross-reactivity. However, component-resolved diagnosis using purified and recombinant allergens can improve the accuracy of specific IgE testing, but availability is limited. Treatment options for HDM allergy are limited and include HDM avoidance, which is widely recommended as a strategy, although evidence for its efficacy is variable. Clinical efficacy of pharmacotherapy is well documented; however, symptom relief does not extend beyond the end of treatment. Finally, allergen immunotherapy has a poor but improving evidence base (notably on sublingual tablets) and its benefits last after treatment ends. This review identifies needs for deeper physician knowledge on the extent and impact of HDM allergy in respiratory disease, as well as further development and improved access to molecular allergy diagnosis. Furthermore, there is a need for the development of better-designed clinical trials to explore the utility of allergen-specific approaches, and uptake of data into guidance for physicians on more effective diagnosis and therapy of HDM respiratory allergy in practice.

### Advancements and dilemmas in the management of allergy [^112PeuwT]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Recent advances in the diagnosis and management of allergic disease also lead to new clinical decisions for providers. Advances in component (or molecular) diagnostic testing for allergy continue to build in the literature, but diagnosing inhalant allergy remains largely unchanged clinically. Prevention of allergy has been demonstrated by preventing peanut allergy in high-risk infants by intentional oral exposure to promote tolerance. Immunotherapy options have increased, with literature supporting sublingual drops, sublingual tablets, and subcutaneous immunotherapy. Expanded options create clinical questions such as the role of monotherapy in polysensitized patients. This article explores recent advances and their clinical implications.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^111Wrr5L]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Ménière's disease — Allergy testing and treatment: The prevalence of diagnosed allergy is reported to be higher in those with a history of MD than in the general population, and although no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were found for allergy testing/treatment to reduce MD symptoms, many studies have shown a relationship of allergy to MD. Given the low risk to patients, inclusion of allergen avoidance and immunotherapy should be considered in the treatment plan to help control MD symptoms, and recommending allergy control is not unreasonable and is low risk in patients with a history of inhalant or food allergies; the use of immunotherapy, if needed, may be weighed against potential side effects.

### A randomized controlled trial of mite allergen-impermeable bed covers in adult mite-sensitized asthmatics [^113ZC7L3]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Mite-allergic patients with allergic disease should benefit from avoiding mite allergens. Many physicians, however, are yet to be convinced that allergen avoidance can make a significant contribution to asthma management in these patients. Many allergen-avoidance regimes include multiple measures of allergen reduction, but as mite exposure in the home is most likely to be greatest in bed dust, bedding is usually the first target for intervention.

Objective

This study selected adult patients considered to be most likely to benefit from avoiding mite allergens, namely diagnosed asthmatics, sensitized to house dust mites and exposed to mite allergen in their mattresses. Patients were randomized into a placebo-controlled trial of the use of allergen-impermeable bed covers for 12 months, without any other form of mite-reduction measures.

Methods

Adults with asthma were selected from general practices and asthma clinics in south-east London. Their serum IgE to mite allergens and allergen content of mattress dust samples were measured. Those with > 0.70 kU/L mite-specific IgE and > 2 microg/g Der p 1 were randomized into active or placebo treatments. Information was collected on allergic symptoms and medication use and quarterly peak flow diaries were kept throughout the trial. Dog or cat allergic patients were excluded if they had a pet at home to which they were sensitized.

Results

The mean decrease in microg/g Der p 1 was 25.7 (95% CI 8.9, 74.1) in the active group and 4.5 (95% CI 1.8, 11.5) in the placebo group. Der p 1 concentrations in the active and placebo groups at the end of the trial were not significantly different. There was no effect on peak flow or asthma symptoms in a simple comparison of the treatment and placebo groups.

Conclusion

In this group of patients, mite allergen avoidance in the bed by the use of allergen-impermeable bedding alone cannot be recommended as an effective way of relieving asthma symptoms.

### AAAAI position statement on changing electronic health record allergy documentation to "Alerts" to lead to easily understood, actionable labels [^116D5QKd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). High credibility.

Electronic health record (EHR) allergy alerts — simplified data elements needed for an accurate evaluation, documentation, and subsequent management are organized into steps as follows: Step 1: choose agent type (drug, food, topical) as a Required Field; Step 2: identify the specific name of the drug, food, or topical agent from a standardized list as a Required Field; Step 3: choose reason for avoidance (Required field; leads to branching logic) with options including personal preference, predisposition to adverse reaction, and previous adverse reaction; Step 4: choose rationale/evidence for avoidance (Agent and Reason specific, Not a required field) with example elements for a medication previous adverse reaction such as route of exposure, dose, date of last exposure, indication, time to onset of symptoms after first dose of last course, description of symptoms, duration of symptoms, treatment given for symptoms, and any genotyping, phenotyping, clinical condition and/or testing performed that precludes safe reuse, rechallenge, and/or desensitization; Step 5: choose management (Lay language, no expertise required, Required Field but customizable) with example options including strict avoidance of agent and potentially cross-reactive agents, strict avoidance of agent only, contraindicated because of patient-specific predispositions to adverse reaction, use only when alternative options are not available or higher risk, or use only with a prespecified management plan (premedications, altered dosing or observation, specialist involvement). To create a meaningful change at the alert level, it should require documentation that is easy to enter by a medical assistant and patient/parent, and for a label to be entered, the entry should first require a reason.

### Novel mechanisms in immune tolerance to allergens during natural allergen exposure and allergen-specific immunotherapy [^115eeLsW]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) has been used for more than 100 years as a clinical tolerance-inducing and immune tolerance-inducing therapy for allergic diseases and represents a potentially curative method of treatment. AIT functions through multiple mechanisms including early desensitization of basophils and mast cells, regulating T-cell and B-cell responses, changing antibody isotypes, and decreasing activation, mediator release and affected tissue migration of eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells. Similar molecular and cellular mechanisms have been observed in subcutaneous AIT, sublingual AIT and peptide immunotherapy as well as natural tolerance to high doses of allergen exposure in beekeepers and cat owners.

### Practical aspects of allergy-testing [^1163XCVD]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Allergy-testing is a prerequisite for specific allergy treatment, including specific allergen avoidance measures, relevant pharmacotherapy and specific allergy vaccination. All children with persisting, recurrent or severe possible "allergic symptoms" or those with a need for continuous treatment should be tested, irrespective of the child's age. Allergy-testing includes a careful case history and a determination of IgE sensitisation by skin prick test or the measurement of allergen-specific IgE in serum by standardised and validated methods. The diagnosis of food allergy cannot usually be based solely on the case history and IgE sensitisation; the diagnosis has to be confirmed by controlled food elimination and food challenge procedures. The diagnosis of inhalant allergic disease requires only confirmatory nasal, conjunctival or bronchial challenges in equivocal cases or before specific allergy treatment such as extensive allergen avoidance measures or allergy vaccination.

### Oral allergy syndrome: a clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic challenge [^117U3nim]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To provide a review of the literature and discuss the clinical, pathophysiologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic challenges of oral allergy syndrome (OAS).

Data Sources

English-language publications on OAS (and pollen-food allergy syndrome) were identified through MEDLINE and through the reference lists of each identified article and review.

Study Selection

Articles pertaining to OAS with respect to its varied clinical presentation, underlying pathophysiology, available and investigational diagnostic testing, and evidence-based treatment options were selected.

Results

OAS occurs in patients with a prior cross-reactive aeroallergen sensitization and clinically presents with initial oralpharyngeal symptoms after ingestion of a triggering fruit or vegetable. Although controversial, these symptoms may progress to systemic symptoms outside the gastrointestinal tract in 8.7% of patients and anaphylactic shock in 1.7%. OAS's underlying pathophysiology may play a role in clinical presentation and outcome, depending on whether the cross-reactive protein is a heat-labile PR-10 protein, a partially labile profilin, or a relatively heat-stable lipid transfer protein. Diagnostic testing is variable based on the underlying food tested, but fresh food skin prick test typically has the highest sensitivity. Treatment centers on avoidance and the consideration of self-injectable epinephrine. Because of its relationship with a cross-reactive aeroallergen sensitization, subcutaneous immunotherapy and sublingual immunotherapy have also been therapeutically tried with mixed results.

Conclusion

OAS is a challenging diagnosis to the practicing allergist because of its many clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic considerations. Understanding these challenges and their underlying mechanisms can facilitate a knowledgeable approach to treating an oral allergy patient.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^1112Zc9w]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Epidermals — Summary Statement 163 emphasizes that animal clinical sensitivity is most often associated with domestic pets and laboratory animals, and that specific testing is guided by history of appropriate animal exposure (A); selection is guided by exposure history, and exhaustive testing is rarely indicated. Cat allergen extracts have been well characterized (ie, Fel d 1) from sebaceous glandular protein, allergens can be identified in cat saliva, and standardized cat extracts are commercially available; similar characterization exists in several rodent laboratory animals with urinary allergens demonstrated. Clinically relevant sensitizations are easily demonstrable to dog (the major allergen of which is Can f 1), birds, and farm animals, and on occasion customized extract preparation is indicated for evaluation of sensitization to more exotic animals, including those found in zoos.

### Component-resolved diagnostics in pet allergy: current perspectives and future directions [^113v349a]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Furry mammals kept as pets are important allergen sources. The prevalence of sensitization to dander from various animals appears to be increasing worldwide. Several mammalian allergens from diverse species and distinct protein families have been characterized, and some are available for component-resolved diagnostics (CRD). This review presents an overview of mammalian aeroallergens, with a focus on cat, dog, and horse allergens. The potential of CRD in fine-tuning the diagnostic workup following traditional methods based on whole- allergen extracts and allergen immunotherapy is discussed. The review highlights the clinical utility of CRD, particularly as a marker/predictor of increased asthma risk and disease severity. Finally, several perspectives of the future implications of CRD are offered in the context of furry animal allergens.

5 CONCLUSIONS

This study establishes the safety and feasibility of the NEC to provoke a reproducible EAR and a highly reproducible average FEV1 in cat‐allergic mild asthmatics, and demonstrates the effectiveness of aerosolizing Fel d 1 using a modified vacuum cleaner.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^111civuS]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Cat dander skin prick/puncture testing — receiver operating characteristic (ROC)–derived wheal thresholds and performance are reported as follows: in allergic rhinitis patients, a 3.0‑mm wheal cutoff provided 100% sensitivity and 100% negative predictive value, and ROC analysis was used to select optimal wheal size cutoffs; using increased symptom scores after nasal allergen challenge as the standard, a 5.5 mm cutoff increased specificity to 89% with sensitivity 88%; across reference standards, the optimal cutoff for a positive cat dander test was 6.0 mm (specific IgE, postchallenge tryptase, or PGD₂) or 5.5 mm (symptom or clinical history). As an example from the table, using specific IgE as the reference yielded cutoff 6.0 mm with sensitivity 93.3%, specificity 86.7%, efficiency 91.1%, positive predictive value 94.0%, and negative predictive value 85.3%.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^116RpAx9]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) administration, risk assessment, and monitoring: When clinically indicated, initiation decisions depend on factors including patient preference, adherence, medication requirements, response to avoidance, and adverse effects of medications, and risks should be assessed in patients on beta-adrenergic blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or with serious conditions. SCIT should be administered in a setting with procedures to reduce anaphylaxis risk and ensure prompt recognition and treatment. The first SLIT dose is given under medical supervision, then administered at home; improvement may be seen after reaching a maintenance dose. Patients should be evaluated at least every 12 months on AIT, and continuation decisions should generally be made after 3 to 5 years, based on disease severity, sustained benefits, and convenience.

### Drug allergy: a 2022 practice parameter update [^115Xq45n]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Drug allergy practice parameter update — glossary of challenge and testing protocols defines drug challenge as a procedure to determine tolerance and clarifies modalities and timing. Drug challenge is described as a "Procedure whereby drug is administered to determine tolerance", with direct challenge defined as "Performing drug challenge without prior skin testing". Drug challenge options include "Drug challenge, 1-step" in which "One treatment dose of the drug is administered", and "Drug challenge, 2-step" in which "One-tenth of the treatment dose of the drug is administered, followed 20–30 minutes later by 90% of the treatment dose if no symptoms occur". A multiple-day approach is specified as "Treatment dose of the drug is administered daily at home for 5–10 days". Delayed intradermal testing (dIDT) is defined as intradermal injection on the forearm with evaluation "24 hours after application", and delayed hypersensitivity reactions occur "at least 6 hours after dosing, with majority occurring 1–2 weeks after drug initiation". Desensitization is characterized as a temporary induction of tolerance requiring continued exposure, and the parameter notes it preferentially uses the term "induction of drug tolerance", which is defined as administering multiple gradually increasing doses with ongoing exposure required to maintain tolerance.

### Sublingual immunotherapy with a standardized cat dander extract: evaluation of efficacy in a double blind placebo controlled study [^116s4aw4]. Allergy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Little information is available on the clinical efficacy of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) using extracts derived from mammalian epithelia.

Objectives

To assess clinical efficacy of cat SLIT based on natural exposure challenge test (NCT).

Material and Methods

Fifty cat allergic patients with rhinoconjunctivitis with or without asthma were included in a randomized double blind placebo controlled clinical trial of cat SLIT during 1 year. Twenty-five patients received active treatment and 25 placebo. Sublingual immunotherapy efficacy was assessed by natural exposure challenge to a cat in a cat-room and by skin tests. Airborne Fel d 1 levels, symptom scores and peak expiratory flow (PEF) values were monitored.

Results

Thirty-three (66%) out of 50 patients completed the treatment. Fel d 1 content of the maximum concentration was 0.51 microg per ml. During the build up phase, the accumulated dose was 1.7 mug of Fel d 1 and during the entire length of the study was 17.1. No adverse reports were reported. The active group showed a marked reduction (62%) in symptoms during the NCT (P < 0.001) with no changes in placebo group. Active group also showed a reduced PEF response to cat exposure (P < 0.05), and an improvement in skin test reactivity to a standardized cat extract (P < 0.05), without significant changes in placebo group. Mean Fel d 1 exposure during the NCT was 6.2 ± 2.21 ng/m³.

Conclusions

The results suggest that the cat SLIT used in this study was able to improve cat allergy based on natural exposure challenge.

### Standardized cat hair [^115GKAZE]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

It is imperative that the physician determine the initial dose of the product by skin testing. Patients being switched from extracts not labeled in Bioequivalency Allergy Units should be started as if they were coming under treatment for the first time. Patients being switched from one lot of Standardized Cat Hair to another lot of Standardized Cat Hair (from the same or different manufacturers) should have the initial dose from the new lot reduced by 75%. Patients being switched from a Standardized Cat Pelt extract to a Standardized Cat Hair extract (both labeled in BAU/mL) should be skin tested with both extracts to determine the relative potency of the extracts and the dosage adjusted accordingly.

Recommended usual dosage and range: (Scratch or Prick Testing)

The general method of making a scratch test is to first scarify the skin and then apply a drop of extract to the scratch. Make scarifications at least 2.5 cm apart. Hold the scarifier between thumb and index finger, press the sharp edge of the instrument against the skin and twirl instrument rapidly. The scratch should disrupt the outer layers of epidermis but should not produce immediate oozing of blood. One drop (0.05 mL) of extract is rubbed or applied into each scratch. Always apply a control scratch with each test set. Sterile Diluting fluid (for a negative control) is used in exactly the same way as an active test extract. Histamine may be used as a positive control. Scratch or prick test sites should be examined at 15 and 30 minutes. To prevent excessive absorption, wipe off antigens producing large reactions as soon as the wheal appears. Record the size of the reaction.

### Optimal management of allergic rhinitis [^112uwAao]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Rhinitis, which can be allergic, infectious or neither of these, is defined as at least two nasal symptoms, including rhinorrhoea, blockage, sneezing and itching. It is a common problem in childhood and adolescence which impacts negatively on physical, social and psychological well-being.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an under-recognised inflammatory condition of the nasal mucosa, caused by immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated early-phase and late-phase hypersensitivity responses, usually to inhalant allergens, similar to those in allergic asthma. Typical allergens include house dust mite, grass and tree pollens, dander from animals such as cat, dog, horse and, occasionally, moulds. Different phenotypes exist; those with obvious symptoms of sneezing and running, who are easily recognised, and others with predominant blockage, where the diagnosis may be missed. Children with AR can present with symptoms related to nasal connections, such as lungs, throat, ears, (table 1) or to quality-of-life impairment, often related to poor quality sleep and consequent fatigue, poor concentration and school performance.

Table 1
Recognising rhinitis in childhood

AR is often part of a systemic inflammatory process associated with other inflammatory conditions, including allergic conjunctivitis (AC), rhinosinusitis and asthma. Asthma shows an increased prevalence in children with both allergicand non-allergic rhinitis. A higher prevalence of asthma is found among those suffering from persistent and more severe rhinitis. Over three-quarters of children with asthma also have ARwhich is associated with poor asthma control. Minimal persistent allergic inflammation of the nasal mucosasynergises with infective inflammation; thus, subjects with AR have more problems with viral colds, and the combination in children of allergic sensitisation, relevant allergen exposure and viral cold gives a high risk for hospital admission for asthma in children. Poor asthma control is found in children with moderate to severe rhinitis, which should be identified and treated.

### Clinical and immunological evaluation of cat-allergic asthmatics living with or without a cat [^115Ku316]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Characterising the clinical and immunological impact of daily cat exposure in cat‐allergic subjects with asthma who live with cats (WC) and those who do not (WoC) may provide understanding of the drivers of the allergic response.

Methods

Clinical and immunological characteristics (skin prick test, spirometry, symptom assessments, immunological markers) were compared between asthmatic subjects WC (n = 10) and WoC (n = 9).

Results

WC subjects had greater use of long‐acting beta agonists (p < .05) and high‐potency corticosteroids. No differences were observed in lung function, nasal and ocular symptoms, or asthma control between the groups. Cat dander‐ and Fel d 1‐specific IgG₄ concentrations were higher in WC than WoC subjects (both p < .05). Total IgE and cat dander‐, Fel d 1‐ and Fel d 7‐specific IgE concentrations were similar, but Fel d 4‐sIgE was higher in WC subjects (p < .05) versus WoC. Basophil sensitivity to cat dander extract and Fel d 1 was lower in WC versus WoC subjects (p < .05) and correlated with higher IgG₄ concentrations (r = 0.63; p = .009). Fel d 1‐specific CD4⁺ T‐cell responses polarised toward Th2A responses in WC versus WoC subjects; Fel d 1‐specific IgE correlated with surface expression of CRTH2 and CD200R (both p ≤ .05).

Conclusion

Immunological differences observed in WC versus WoC did not reflect clinical tolerance with natural cat exposure. The ability to live with a cat despite allergy could be driven by higher preventative medication use. This study may support design of novel therapeutics for allergy management.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) diagnosis and treatment flow chart — patients who present with "Patient presents with the following symptoms: nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy nose, sneezing" should undergo history and physical examination (KAS1), "including assessment of chronic conditions and comorbidities (KAS5)", after which the "Physician determines clinical diagnosis of allergic rhinitis". When "Treatment Needed? - YES", options include "Pharmacologic Treatment (KAS 6–10): Refer to Figure 3: Medications Flow Chart for Common Clinical Scenarios", Environmental Factors (KAS4), where "Clinicians may advise avoidance of known or suspected allergens", and, if "Patient prefers Complementary Medicine", "Clinicians may offer acupuncture (KAS13)". For "Inadequate control of AR symptoms with pharmacologic therapy and/or environmental controls", proceed to "Allergy Testing (KAS2); Clinicians should perform and interpret, or refer to a clinician who can perform and interpret, specific IgE (skin or blood) allergy testing" as indicated; if positive, "Immunotherapy If Positive Allergy Testing (KAS11): Clinicians should offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, immunotherapy (sublingual or subcutaneous) for patients with allergic rhinitis who have inadequate response to pharmacologic therapy with or without environmental controls". For persistent nasal obstruction, "Inferior Turbinate reduction: for Persistent Nasal Airway Obstruction (KAS12) Clinicians may offer, or refer to a surgeon who can offer, inferior turbinate reduction" in patients with enlarged inferior turbinates "who have failed medical management".

### Treating cat allergy with monoclonal IgG antibodies that bind allergen and prevent IgE engagement [^1174veRQ]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Eligible study participants were randomized to receive study drug or placebo on study day 1 (14 days after screening visit 2). On study days 8, 29, 57, and 85, study participants underwent NAC using the same allergen titration required for each individual subject to reach TNSS > 7 at their 2nd screening visit, not to exceed the maximum dose established in the screening visit, regardless of whether TNSS > 7 was reached. At each study visit, TNSS, and PNIF and were measured pre-NAC, then at 10, 30, and 60 min during the first hour, and once per hour for 8 h to measure the LPR. Serum samples were collected at each study visit, and a repeat cat-SPT was performed on study days 29 and 85.

Definitions of terms used in this section

An allergen mitigation intervention aims to decrease an individual's exposure to allergens. The intervention can have a single component or multiple components.

A single-component intervention is an individual mitigation strategy targeted at one or more specific allergens to which an individual is both exposed and sensitized. Single-component allergen mitigation interventions examined in this report include the following:
Acaricide: a house-dust mite pesticide that can be applied to carpets, mattresses, and furniture.
Air filtration systems and air purifiers, including those with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters: devices that filter indoor air and remove solid particulates, such as dust, pollen, mold, and bacteria, from the air.
Carpet removal: removal of wall-to-wall or area rugs from one or more rooms.
Cleaning products: including application of bleach or similar products.
HEPA vacuum cleaners: vacuum cleaners that have a HEPA filter.
Impermeable pillow and mattress covers: covers placed on mattresses and pillows that are impermeable to dust mites.
Integrated pest management: a comprehensive approach to removing and controlling common indoor pests (eg, cockroaches and mice) using, for example, traps, poison, and barriers to influx. The Expert Panel considered integrated pest management to be a single-component intervention even though it may include prevention, mitigation, and removal strategies.
Mold mitigation: professional removal, cleaning, sanitization, demolition, or other treatment to remove or prevent mold. The Expert Panel considered mold mitigation to be a single-component intervention even though it may include prevention, mitigation, and removal strategies.
Pet removal: complete removal or confinement of furry pets (eg, dogs and cats) to specific rooms in a house.

A "multicomponent intervention" is defined as the use of two or more of the aforementioned single-component interventions at the same time as part of a bundled approach targeted at one or more allergens to which the individual is both sensitized and exposed. An example of a multicomponent intervention is the use of three single-component interventions (eg, air purifiers, impermeable pillow and mattress covers, and HEPA vacuum cleaners) for individuals sensitized and exposed to dust mites and mold.

"Sensitization" is defined in this section as the production of a specific IgE to an aeroallergen whose presence can be confirmed by skin prick testing or assays for a specific IgE.

### Clinical effects of air filters in homes of asthmatic adults sensitized and exposed to pet allergens [^117Mjev9]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Despite medical advice, many pet-allergic asthma sufferers refuse to remove the pet to which they are sensitized from their home.

Objective

We aimed to assess the clinical effects of air cleaners in the homes of adult asthma patients sensitized and exposed to cats and/or dogs.

Methods

We performed a randomized, parallel-group study of 30 asthmatic adults sensitized to and sharing a home with cats or dogs. The effects of placing air cleaners in the living room and bedroom for 12 months and using high efficiency particulate air filter vacuum cleaners (active group) were compared with using these vacuum cleaners alone (control group). Measures of airway responsiveness, treatment requirement, lung function, peak flow, reservoir and airborne allergen were recorded before, during and after the interventions. A beneficial clinical response was assessed in terms of a 'combined asthma outcome'. This was defined as a two or more doubling dose improvement in bronchial hyper-reactivity to histamine and/or a reduction in treatment requirement of at least one step change on the British Thoracic Society guidelines for asthma treatment.

Results

A beneficial clinical response was observed in 10/15 subjects in the active group compared with 3/15 in the control group after 12 months intervention (P = 0.01). No significant differences between the active and control groups were detected for changes in measures of lung function, reservoir pet allergen and airborne pet allergen during the study.

Conclusion

Whilst the study design has not allowed complete exclusion of a placebo effect, we believe that this pragmatic study of adult asthmatic patients sensitized and exposed to pets resulted in a small, but significant improvement in combined asthma outcome.

### Allergen-specific immunotherapy: which outcome measures are useful in monitoring clinical trials? [^111AvGsa]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Various clinical outcome measures are commonly applied in clinical trials on specific immunotherapy for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis with or without asthma to provide evidence of its clinical efficacy. These "primary endpoints" measure clinical symptoms as well as the use for concomitant medication. "Secondary outcome endpoints" are represented by health-related quality of life (HRQoL), "well-days", provocation-tests, in vitro tests and others. This article reviews different methods assessing the clinical outcome of trials on both subcutaneous and sublingual immunotherapy, and highlights potential advantages and drawbacks of each method.

### Identification of allergic asthmatics reactive to felis catus (cat hair… [^1171UeK1]. ClinicalTrials (2018). Low credibility.

Study Overview Asthma is an increasingly common chronic illness among children and adults, and allergen exposure is among the most common triggers for asthma exacerbations. Exacerbations of allergic asthma are characterized by an early phase response, mediated by release of preformed mediators like histamine from mast cells, and a late phase response 3–7 hours later mediated by chemokines and cytokines that attract leukocytes such as neutrophils and eosinophils to the airways, increase mucus production, trigger airway smooth muscle contraction, and result in airway constriction and airway hyperreactivity. This group has taken a particular interest in targeting an inflammatory cytokine, Interleukin-1β, involved in both the early and late phase asthmatic responses to inhaled allergen in allergic asthmatics.

In the lung, interleukin 1 beta is produced by numerous cell types, where it signals through its receptor to induce transcription of pro-inflammatory genes. IL-1β is increased in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from persons with symptomatic asthma vs. those with asymptomatic asthma; likewise, immunohistochemistry of bronchial biopsies of allergic asthmatics reveal increased expression of IL-1β in both bronchial epithelial cells and macrophages.

In order to better understand the role of IL-1β in allergen-induced airway inflammation, induced sputum will be obtained to determine if higher baseline sputum IL-1β concentrations or larger increases in IL-1β following allergen challenge impact non-specific airway hyperresponsiveness, sputum granulocyte recruitment, a marker of airway eosinophilia), or changes in expression of inflammatory or allergy-related genes.

### Anti-TSLP (AMG 157) plus antigen-specific immunotherapy for induction of tolerance in individuals with cat allergy… [^116yRA4A]. ClinicalTrials (2014). Low credibility.

Study Overview This study will implement the concept referred to as "allergen-plus, " which aims to enhance the disease-modifying mechanisms of allergen-specific immunotherapy by combining it with other anti-inflammatory or immune-modulating agents. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin is a cytokine which appears to be instrumental in both initiating and maintaining allergic sensitivity to antigens, and Immune Tolerance Network investigators hypothesize that blocking TSLP during the administration of cat immunotherapy will induce durable immune changes that lead to tolerance.
- TNSS is ≥ 8 after the highest dose, and
- Between the first non-zero dose and 10 minutes after the highest dose, either:

- ≥ 3 sneezes are counted or
- > 20% drop in PNIF is recorded
- Body mass index between 1 and 32 kg/m², inclusive at screening.
- Clinically acceptable physical examination and electrocardiogram results prior to Day 0 based on the opinion of the investigator
- Adequate renal function.
- History of chronic sinusitis, defined as a sinus symptoms lasting > 12 weeks that includes ≥ 2 major factors or 1 major factor and 2 minor factors. Major factors are defined as facial pain or pressure, nasal obstruction or blockage, purulent or discolored postnasal discharge, purulence in nasal cavity, or impaired or loss of smell. Minor factors are defined as headache, fever, halitosis, fatigue, dental pain, cough, and ear pain, pressure, or fullness.
- High risk of parasitic disease as judged by the investigator
- Positive QuantiFERON tuberculin test UNLESS the potential subject has been treated with appropriate chemoprophylaxis
- Exposure to an individual with active tuberculosis within six months from randomization

### Exposure to dogs and cats in the first year of life and risk of allergic sensitization at 6 to 7 years of age… [^111tTfSx]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

cat allergen in the child's bedroom at age 2 years, and pet exposure. In this analysis, we specifically examined exposure to dogs or cats in the first year of life and a child's risk of later allergic sensitization to common allergens after adjusting for potential confounding associations. We also examined relationships between early dog and cat exposure and allergen-specific serum IgE concentrations. during the first year. Using the same reference group of 220 unexposed children, the patterns toward less prevalent allergic sensitization with exposure to cats were similar to those observed with dog exposure, but none of the associations reached statistical significance. For example, the prevalence of atopy declined from 33. 6% to
31. 4% to 23. 1% with exposure to no dogs or cats, 1 cat, or
2. or more cats, respectively, while seroatopy declined from 38. 5% to
34. 5% to 26. 1%.

Based on finding similar relationships between dog and cat exposures in the first year of life and allergic sensitization at age 6 to 7 years, relationships were further analyzed by simultaneously considering combined. cats in the first year of life was associated with a lower prevalence of allergic sensitization at age 6 to 7 years regardless of exposure to dogs and cats at age 6 years. This inverse relationship was consistent whether skin prick tests for 6 common aeroallergens or tests for 7 allergen-specific IgE concentrations. pets inside the home. In a recent cross-sectional study in children by Platts-Mills et al, 18 and also in a subsequent study in adults, 46 a bell-shaped dose-response relationship between cat allergen exposure and cat-specific sensitization was observed. Decreased levels of cat-specific sensitization were associated with both the lowest. and the highest cat allergen exposure groups.

Platts-Mills and colleagues also found that cat-specific IgG antibody levels increased with increasing cat exposure, and were highest in the highest cat exposure group. They suggested that high levels of cat allergen exposure induced a modified T helper cell type 2 response with production of cat allergen–specific.
