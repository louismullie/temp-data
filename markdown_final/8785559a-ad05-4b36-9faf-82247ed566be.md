## Question

How should apnea be evaluated in an 18 month male with an active covid infection?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate apnea in an 18-month-old male with active COVID-19. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and whether this is an airway, breathing, or circulation emergency. Then, I should clarify the detailed event history to distinguish central from obstructive mechanisms. Next, I will examine the focused physical findings and risk factors that raise the pretest probability of severe disease. After that, I should select targeted diagnostics, including testing for SARS-CoV-2 and common coinfections, and judicious imaging. Then, I will prioritize the differential diagnosis and the management plan, including when to admit, how to monitor, and whether antiviral therapy is indicated. Finally, I should set disposition and follow-up, with special attention to toddlers' unique risks and the possibility of post-COVID sequelae, while cross-checking each step against the best available evidence and pediatric applicability of largely adult guidelines where needed [^112KCUtW] [^112jCGDi] [^114VuDP4].

> Let me first stabilize and verify safety. Any apnea in a toddler is an ABCs problem until proven otherwise, so I need to immediately assess airway patency, breathing effort, color change, mental status, and perfusion, with continuous pulse oximetry given the risk of "silent hypoxia" in COVID-19 that can present without overt distress. Wait, let me verify that silent hypoxia has been described in COVID-19 and therefore justifies routine saturation monitoring even when the child looks comfortable, which it has been, so maintaining normal age-appropriate saturations with supplemental oxygen is prudent while I reassess [^111nrQaf].

> Next, I should characterize the event history in detail to sort central versus obstructive patterns, but hold on, I need to check whether COVID-19 has been linked to central apnea in children and whether brief recurrent episodes have been reported in younger infants. Yes, central apnea with seizures has been described in a previously healthy adolescent with COVID-19, and brief apnea with circumoral cyanosis has been documented in a young infant with SARS-CoV-2, so I should ask about timing during sleep or feeds, duration, frequency, associated tone change, seizure-like activity, stridor, and recovery with stimulation. I should also verify timing relative to COVID-19 symptom onset, medication exposures, and whether there are risk factors such as neurologic disease, airway anomalies, prematurity, or Down syndrome, as these can modify risk and mechanisms [^112jCGDi] [^114VuDP4] [^114HCr4x].

> I will now examine the child carefully, but I should confirm the clinical features most likely to change management. Respiratory signs such as retractions, stridor, wheeze, and auscultatory findings can point toward obstructive processes, while altered tone, focal deficits, or abnormal movements push me toward central etiologies or seizure-related apnea. I need to ensure I check hydration, fever, perfusion, and signs of evolving systemic illness since young children and those with comorbidities have higher odds of severe disease and need for respiratory support when hospitalized with COVID-19 [^112KCUtW] [^114FLxc4].

> Now, diagnostics. Let me first confirm the infection status and exclude common coinfections that could precipitate apnea in this age group. I should verify that repeat SARS-CoV-2 PCR is reasonable if the diagnosis is in doubt and that respiratory viral coinfection is frequent in pediatric ARI, which it is, so a multiplex viral panel for RSV, influenza, and rhinovirus is appropriate, given coinfections are common and can lengthen oxygen needs. I should double-check inflammatory markers, since elevated CRP has been linked with more severe pediatric disease, and obtain basic labs and blood gas in any child with respiratory compromise. Hold on, I initially thought chest CT might be helpful up front, but I should correct that impulse; imaging societies advise an algorithmic approach favoring chest radiography when indicated and reserving CT for specific scenarios, and pediatric systematic reviews show many children have normal or mild CT findings, so CXR is reasonable if there are respiratory signs and CT only if escalation is needed. If there are seizure-like features, I need to consider EEG and brain imaging to evaluate for encephalopathy or seizure foci as reported in pediatric COVID-19 with apnea [^117X5Sih] [^114Lbduy] [^115sDsi8] [^115hDB7f] [^112jCGDi].

> Before deciding on treatment, I should prioritize the differential. Let me consider COVID-19–related central mechanisms first, because neurotropism and encephalopathy have been reported in children and could depress respiratory drive or provoke seizures that include apnea. But wait, I should not jump to conclusions and miss obstructive etiologies, including upper airway edema from viral infection, baseline OSA risk, or post-viral airway reactivity, especially since OSA has epidemiologic links to COVID-19 susceptibility and complications and post-COVID increases in OSA diagnosis have been observed in large datasets. I also need to keep respiratory decompensation with hypoxemia, bacterial pneumonia, anemia, and metabolic derangements on the table while I rule out seizures as an ictal or postictal source of apnea [^115vLYuv] [^112jCGDi] [^116m6xJE] [^116rrkGm].

> Management comes next, but I should confirm admission thresholds given the child's age. For an 18‑month‑old with any recurrent apnea, a prolonged episode, cyanosis, abnormal examination, hypoxemia, or worrisome labs, I should admit for continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring, as younger children and those with comorbidities have higher risks and coinfections can worsen the course. Wait, I initially considered using convalescent plasma broadly, but I need to correct that; the 2025 IDSA recommendation to consider high‑titer plasma applies to ambulatory mild‑to‑moderate cases at high risk with no other options, which does not fit a toddler with apnea who will require inpatient monitoring. I also briefly thought about Gohibic, but I should verify its scope; it is investigational and restricted to ventilated adults, so it is not applicable here. For COVID‑19–directed therapy in hospitalized pediatric patients at risk of progression, remdesivir has pediatric labeling and can be considered based on disease severity and risk profile, while most toddlers with mild disease receive supportive care only [^114FLxc4] [^116RYWmB] [^111231ZL] [^112i1SRF].

> I need to ensure respiratory support is escalated safely if needed. Although pediatric-specific ICU guidance is limited in these references, adult critical care guidelines emphasize close monitoring on noninvasive support with early intubation if deterioration occurs, lung-protective ventilation with attention to PEEP strategy, and caution with adjuncts like inhaled nitric oxide. Hold on, I should verify the applicability; these are adult recommendations, so any extrapolation to a toddler must be cautious and individualized in consultation with pediatric critical care, but the general principles of timely escalation and lung-protective strategies remain instructive when a child with COVID-19 decompensates [^113Aaq9x] [^113vhCky] [^1165Gb6U] [^116axKf5].

> For subspecialty input, I should confirm when to involve neurology and pulmonology. Pediatric neurology is indicated if there are central apnea features, abnormal movements, or post-event altered consciousness, given reports of seizures and encephalopathy associated with apnea in pediatric COVID‑19. Pediatric pulmonology becomes important when recurrent obstructive features, suspected OSA, or persistent respiratory symptoms are present, especially since sleep-disordered breathing intersects with COVID-19 risk and may complicate recovery. Infectious diseases can help adjudicate antiviral eligibility, isolation duration, and decisions around additional testing or therapeutics [^112jCGDi] [^116m6xJE] [^116RYWmB].

> Regarding disposition, I should double-check that my criteria align with pediatric risk. Admission is appropriate for recurrent events, any prolonged apnea with cyanosis or hypotonia, hypoxemia, abnormal exam or labs, high-risk comorbidities, or unreliable home monitoring. If and only if there was a single, brief, resolved event with a normal exam, normal oxygenation, reassuring workup, and reliable caregivers, discharge with strict return precautions could be considered, but I need to ensure rapid outpatient follow-up. Next, I should review post-acute follow-up for potential long COVID symptoms; persistent sleep disturbance, fatigue, and respiratory issues have been reported in children, and in toddlers caregiver observation is critical for detecting problems that children cannot verbalize, so I should plan follow-up within days and re-evaluation over weeks if symptoms persist [^114Q9Z5P] [^114Tx9yQ] [^115ue16V].

> There are toddler-specific nuances I should not overlook. While the highest hospitalization risk is concentrated in infants under one year, toddlers still have immature airways and are vulnerable to inflammation and coinfection, and caregiver reports rather than self-report drive the history quality. I should verify seasonality and coinfection context because RSV and other viruses circulating with SARS-CoV-2 can lengthen oxygen needs and hospital stay in younger children, further lowering my threshold to admit and monitor an 18‑month‑old with documented apnea events during active COVID‑19 [^112KCUtW] [^117X5Sih] [^113YajCn] [^115ue16V].

> One more systems check on testing strategy and sleep evaluation. I initially leaned toward formal polysomnography for all recurrent events, but wait, I should reconsider feasibility and necessity in the acute phase; sleep medicine perspectives during the pandemic caution against a rigid PSG-centric approach and emphasize clinical judgment and access, so inpatient observation and targeted outpatient testing may be more practical, with PSG reserved for persistent or high-risk obstructive features once the acute illness resolves [^115gj9cr].

> In summary, I need to stabilize first and continuously monitor, carefully characterize the event and risk profile, pursue targeted testing for SARS-CoV-2 and coinfections with judicious imaging, and keep a broad differential that includes COVID-19–related central mechanisms, obstructive airway disease, seizures, and metabolic contributors. Management hinges on supportive care, admission for any concerning features, selective use of pediatric-approved antivirals when indicated, cautious extrapolation of adult critical care principles if escalation is needed, prompt subspecialty input when central or obstructive processes are suspected, and close follow-up with attention to toddler-specific limitations in symptom reporting and the possibility of post-COVID sequelae [^111nrQaf] [^112jCGDi] [^117X5Sih] [^112i1SRF] [^114Tx9yQ] [^115ue16V].

In an 18-month-old male with active COVID-19 and apnea, prioritize **immediate stabilization** with airway support, oxygen, and monitoring, followed by a **focused evaluation** to identify COVID-19-related or alternative causes. COVID-19 can cause apnea via hypoxemia [^111nrQaf], neurological involvement [^112jCGDi], or co-infection [^114FLxc4], but **other etiologies must be excluded**. Obtain a CBC, CRP, electrolytes, blood gas, and SARS-CoV-2 PCR [^115sDsi8]; consider chest X-ray and EEG if indicated. Admit for **continuous monitoring**, supportive care, and escalate to HFNC, NIV, or intubation [^113Aaq9x] as needed. Evaluate for co-infections [^114FLxc4] and neurological complications, and arrange follow-up for persistent symptoms [^115ue16V] or sequelae.

## Pathophysiological mechanisms of apnea in COVID-19

COVID-19 can cause apnea in children through **multiple mechanisms**:

- **Hypoxemia and respiratory distress**: COVID-19 can cause significant hypoxemia, sometimes without obvious respiratory distress ("silent hypoxia"), leading to apnea episodes [^111nrQaf].

- **Neurological involvement**: COVID-19 can affect the central nervous system, potentially causing central apnea [^115vLYuv] through encephalopathy, seizures, or other neurological complications [^112jCGDi].

- **Co-infections and secondary bacterial infections**: COVID-19 can predispose children to secondary bacterial infections [^114nb6G2] or co-infections with other respiratory viruses [^114FLxc4], which can exacerbate respiratory symptoms and lead to apnea.

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnostic approach

A **systematic clinical evaluation** is essential to determine the underlying cause of apnea in a child with COVID-19.

---

### Initial assessment and stabilization

Initial assessment and stabilization should prioritize immediate **airway, breathing, and circulation** management, with continuous monitoring of vital signs and oxygen saturation. Obtain a detailed history of the apnea episode, including duration, frequency, associated symptoms (fever, cough, or seizures), and any family history of respiratory or neurological conditions.

---

### Laboratory investigations

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: To assess for infection or inflammation.

- **C-reactive protein (CRP) and inflammatory markers**: Elevated CRP levels have been associated with severe COVID-19 in children [^114Lbduy].

- **Electrolytes and blood gas analysis**: To evaluate metabolic disturbances and respiratory function.

- **SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing**: Confirm active COVID-19 infection [^115sDsi8].

---

### Imaging studies

Imaging may include a **Chest X-ray** to assess for pneumonia, atelectasis, or other respiratory complications, and consider a **Chest CT scan** if severe respiratory involvement is suspected; pediatric COVID-19 lung findings are generally less severe than in adults [^115hDB7f].

---

### Neurological evaluation

Neurological evaluation may involve an **Electroencephalogram (EEG)** [^112jCGDi] if seizures or neurological involvement are suspected, and a **Neurological examination** to assess for signs of encephalopathy or other neurological complications.

---

## Differential diagnosis

It is essential to consider **alternative causes** of apnea beyond COVID-19:

| **Category** | **Potential causes** |
|-|-|
| Respiratory | - COVID-19 pneumonia <br/> - Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [^113YajCn] <br/> - Influenza [^114NnK5q] <br/> - Bacterial pneumonia <br/> - Obstructive sleep apnea [^116m6xJE] |
| Neurological | - Seizures <br/> - Encephalopathy [^115vLYuv] <br/> - Central apnea <br/> - Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy |
| Cardiac | - Congenital heart disease <br/> - Arrhythmias <br/> - Heart failure |
| Metabolic | - Hypoglycemia <br/> - Electrolyte imbalances <br/> - Metabolic acidosis |
| Infectious | - Sepsis <br/> - Meningitis <br/> - Encephalitis |

---

## Management strategies

Management of apnea in a child with active COVID-19 involves **supportive care**, respiratory support, and close monitoring for complications:

### Supportive care

- **Oxygen therapy**: Supplemental oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation levels.

- **Respiratory support**: High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), non-invasive ventilation (NIV), or mechanical ventilation if indicated [^113Aaq9x].

- **Prone positioning**: Consider awake prone positioning in severely ill patients requiring supplemental oxygen or NIV [^112Fkm61].

---

### Monitoring and escalation of care

Monitoring and escalation of care should include **Continuous monitoring** of respiratory status, oxygen saturation, and neurological status, with **Early escalation** [^113Aaq9x] to intubation and mechanical ventilation if respiratory distress worsens or apnea episodes increase in frequency or severity.

---

### Treatment of underlying conditions

Consider **antiviral therapy** such as remdesivir for hospitalized pediatric patients with severe COVID-19 [^112i1SRF]. Start **empiric antibiotics** [^114nb6G2] if a bacterial co-infection is suspected, and initiate anticonvulsant therapy [^115vLYuv] if seizures are identified.

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

The prognosis for pediatric patients with COVID-19-associated apnea is **generally favorable** [^111qKMMW], with most children recovering fully. However, long-term neurological or respiratory sequelae [^114Tx9yQ] may occur, particularly in severe cases or those with underlying medical conditions. Persistent symptoms such as fatigue, sleep disturbances [^115ue16V], and respiratory issues have been reported [^1133dfEt] in some pediatric patients following COVID-19.

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Arrange **regular follow-up** visits to monitor for persistent symptoms [^114Tx9yQ] or complications. Consider pulmonary function testing if respiratory symptoms persist, and continue neurological assessment [^115vLYuv] if involvement was identified during the acute illness.

---

## Conclusion

Evaluation of apnea in an 18-month-old male with active COVID-19 requires a **comprehensive approach**, including immediate stabilization, thorough clinical assessment, laboratory and imaging studies, and consideration of alternative diagnoses. Management centers on supportive care, respiratory support, and monitoring for complications. Prognosis is generally favorable, but **long-term follow-up** is essential to identify and manage potential sequelae.

### Silent hypoxia: A frequently overlooked clinical entity in patients with COVID-19 [^111nrQaf]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, may present with a wide spectrum of symptoms ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection-like illness to severe pneumonia and death. Patients may experience severe hypoxemia without proportional features of respiratory distress, also known as 'silent' or 'apathetic' hypoxia.

We present a case of a 56-year-old man with COVID-19 who presented to the fever clinic of our institution with fever and cough, without any respiratory distress but with low oxygen saturation. The patient deteriorated over the next two days but eventually recovered from his illness in due course of time. This case demonstrates 'silent hypoxia' as a possible presentation in COVID-19 and emphasizes the importance of meticulous clinical examination, including oxygen saturation measurements, in suspected or confirmed patients.

Other neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 in the pediatric population have also been reported. Savić et al. described a previously healthy 13-year-old who presented with loss of consciousness with no other typical symptoms of COVID-19. She was found to have a ruptured pseudoaneurysm of the left middle cerebral artery and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via nasopharyngeal PCR. Enner et al. reported a previously healthy 14-year-old who developed central apnea. She presented with tonic-clonic seizures after 6 days of upper respiratory symptoms and fever and was positive for SARS-CoV-2 via nasopharyngeal PCR. She had multiple apneic episodes accompanied by focal seizures and required ventilator support for 2 weeks because of poor respiratory drive. A case report by Bhavsar et al. described a previously healthy 16-year-old who developed severe encephalopathy and was positive for SARS-CoV-2 via nasopharyngeal PCR. However, cerebrospinal fluid testing was negative for SARS-CoV-2. A thorough workup revealed no other bacterial, viral, or autoimmune pathologies. However, MRI imaging was not obtained. As evidenced by recent findings, additional research is needed to fully assess the neurologic implications of COVID-19 in children.

### Risk factors for severe COVID-19 in children [^114Lbduy]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Low credibility.

There are limited pediatric data regarding severe COVID-19 disease. Our study aims to describe the epidemiology and identify risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease in children.

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective cohort study among children with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR from March to July 2020 at Children's Hospital Colorado. Risk factors for severe disease were analyzed as defined by hospital admission, respiratory support, or critical care. Univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted.

- **Results**: Among 454 patients identified with SARS-CoV-2, 191 (42.1%) were females, with a median age of 11 years. Fifty-five percent of all patients identified as Hispanic compared with 29% among all hospital visits in 2019. A higher odds ratio for severe illness was observed among those greater than 20 years [adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 7.85]. Asthma, gastrointestinal conditions, and similar symptoms at presentation were also predictors for respiratory support. Elevated C-reactive protein was associated with the need for critical care with a median of 17.7 mg/dL (IQR, 5.3–22.9) versus 1.95 mg/dL (IQR, 0.7–5.5) among patients requiring critical versus no critical care (OR, 1.2; P = 0.02).

- **Conclusions**: Extremes of age, comorbid conditions, and elevated CRP are significant factors associated with severe COVID-19 in children.

### Covid-19-associated apnea and circumoral cyanosis in a 3-week-old [^112mddu1]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Data about COVID-19 in the infant population is scarce. Less than 1% of patients in a review of over 72,000 cases from China were younger than 10 years of age, and less than 20% of a pediatric subset were younger than 1 year of age. There is contradictory evidence regarding vertical transmission of COVID-19 between infected mothers and newborns, though the consensus is that vertical transmission is unlikely to occur. Symptoms in this age group vary as with older age groups. A case series of nine hospitalized patients under the age of one noted that most hospitalized patients were symptomatic with fever and upper respiratory symptoms. Another reported case described a 55-day-old infant who developed more severe symptoms, including pneumonia, and demonstrated evidence of liver and cardiac injury.

In younger populations, viral load may persist for weeks regardless of symptoms, as case reports have noted persistently positive PCR tests even in asymptomatic patients, including in a well 6-month-old who tested positive for 16 days. As our patient's immediate family members were sick one week prior to the onset of his symptoms, his family was the likely source from which he contracted the virus. He tested positive on admission for both hospitalizations via PCR testing, with 21 days between the two tests.

Our patient's presentation, initially for an isolated episode of perioral cyanosis and apnea, was at first attributed to a BRUE. A BRUE is defined as an event lasting less than one minute without an identifiable explanation and with full resolution.

### Gohibic [^111231ZL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

COVID-19 is caused by a virus called a coronavirus. You can get COVID-19 through contact with another person who has the virus. COVID-19 illnesses have ranged from very mild (including some with no reported symptoms) to severe, including illness resulting in death. While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, serious illness can happen and may cause some of your other medical conditions to become worse. People of all ages with severe, long-lasting (chronic) medical conditions, like heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes, for example, seem to be at higher risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19.

- **Symptoms of COVID-19**: The symptoms of COVID-19 may include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which can appear 2 to 14 days after exposure. Serious illness, including breathing problems, can occur and may cause your other medical conditions to become worse.

- **Gohibic**: Gohibic is an investigational medicine used for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults when initiated within 48 hours of receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Gohibic is investigational because it is still being studied. Gohibic is not FDA-approved to treat COVID-19.

### The COVID-19 pandemic presents an opportunity to reassess the value of polysomnography [^115gj9cr]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Far from an abstract thought exercise, we need to recognize the real-world consequences of a PSG-centric worldview. Our rigid belief that treatment decisions cannot be made without a PSG has impeded care for those who cannot readily access these services, such as residents of rural areas, caregivers to small children and other dependents, and those lacking health insurance or reliable transportation at night. Furthermore, laboratories are often insufficiently staffed to care for those who have substantial nursing needs. Removing the obligate requirement for PSG creates an opportunity to provide much-needed care to these marginalized populations.

Following the lead of sleep medicine experts, insurance companies have also prioritized physiologic measures from PSG over clinical assessments, resulting in restrictions on care based on rigid diagnostic criteria. All clinicians understand that any diagnostic test, including PSG, is never 100% accurate; therefore, clinical judgment remains a critical tool for accurate diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making. By developing coverage criteria solely based on arbitrary AHI thresholds, payors have devalued the clinical assessment of sleep disorders. We all have taken care of patients who clearly would benefit from positive airway pressure (PAP) but are denied treatment because the AHI is less than 5. Rather than advocating for changes in the definition of hypopnea or recognition of an upper airway resistance syndrome, perhaps it is more sensible to redefine obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) so as to reduce the re.

### Covid-19 and pediatric pulmonology: Feedback from an expert center after the first year of the pandemic [^115RtFTj]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2023). Low credibility.

In hospitalized children, poorly tolerated fever and fatigue are common. At hospital admission, respiratory symptoms are present in approximately 50% of cases, with more than half being associated with respiratory distress. Notably, the severity seems to be greater in infants under 1 year of age and adolescents. During the first wave, a retrospective cohort study was conducted in Colorado, USA, involving 454 children with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, aiming to evaluate the risk factors for severe COVID‐19. They showed that extremes of age (e.g. 0–3 months or > 20 years), preterm birth history, comorbidities (such as immunosuppression, gastrointestinal conditions, diabetes, and asthma), and an elevated C‐reactive protein were predictors of severe disease in children. At the beginning of the pandemic, we described hemodynamic disorders and transient neurological manifestations in young infants. A systematic review of COVID‐19 in 63 infants under 3 months of age reported moderate severity and nonspecific clinical signs; however, one‐fifth of children required ICU care. Among hospitalized adolescents, children with underlying conditions, such as asthma, obesity, or sickle cell disease, are overrepresented. Rare cases of pulmonary embolism associated with COVID‐19 have also been reported in pediatric patients.

Little is known about the sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. In a COVID-19 dedicated clinic, we followed up for 4 months with 25 children previously hospitalized for COVID-19, performing clinical, laboratory, and lung ultrasound evaluations. Mid-term sequelae were rarely observed in our COVID-19 children's cohort.

### Imaging algorithm for Covid-19: A practical approach [^115sDsi8]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

The global pandemic of Covid-19 pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has strained healthcare resources worldwide, presenting challenges in mass testing, resource allocation, and management. While the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is the most commonly utilized and considered the gold standard for diagnosis, several studies have demonstrated high sensitivity of computed tomography (CT), highlighting the role of chest imaging. Many have suggested using CT chest as a first-line screening tool for Covid-19 diagnosis. However, advancements in laboratory testing and challenges in obtaining CT scans without significant risk to healthcare providers have led to questions about the role of imaging in diagnosis.

Several imaging societies have released consensus statements and guidelines on utilizing imaging resources and optimal reporting. In this review, we highlight the evidence on various modalities in thoracic imaging for Covid-19 diagnosis and describe an algorithm on how to use these resources optimally, in accordance with the guidelines and statements released by major imaging societies.

### IDSA guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with covid-19 [^116RYWmB]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for COVID-19 infection, specifically concerning convalescent plasma, the IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend considering the administration of FDA-qualified high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma within 8 days of symptom onset. This is recommended for ambulatory patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk for progression to severe disease and have no other treatment options available.

### COVID-19-associated apnea and circumoral cyanosis in a 3-week-old [^114VuDP4]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

A 25-day-old full-term male infant with a history of mild hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) was admitted initially for a work-up of a brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE). His guardians described a single episode three days before presentation during which the patient stopped breathing and developed perioral cyanosis for approximately 3–4 seconds while sleeping, which resolved with mild stimulation and waking. Associated symptoms included nasal congestion and rhinorrhea. Multiple family members had been experiencing fevers, cough, and congestion starting the week prior. The patient's only additional medical history included respiratory distress at birth requiring 24 hours of positive pressure ventilation and episodes of desaturation during his first six days of life, attributed to possible mild laryngomalacia.

Vital signs were within normal limits, and the physical exam was without abnormal findings. A nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 and a respiratory viral panel (RVP) PCR were collected. Continuous pulse oximetry overnight was normal, and the patient was discharged home the following morning with instructions to presumptively quarantine while RVP and COVID-19 testing were pending. Shortly after discharge, his COVID-19 PCR resulted positive, and the RVP was negative.

Three weeks after his initial presentation, at 45 days of life, the patient was brought back to the hospital after his guardians noted new episodes of apnea, perioral cyanosis, intermittent stridor, and abnormal head and eye movements. The physical exam was unchanged from his prior admission except for the noted changes.

### Epidemiological and clinical features of pediatric COVID-19 [^111E96R7]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

COVID-19 is an extremely severe infectious disease. However, few studies have focused on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of pediatric COVID-19. This study conducted a retrospective review of the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 in children.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was conducted on children with a definite diagnosis of COVID-19 in mainland China using the web crawler technique to collect anonymous COVID-19 updates published by local health authorities.

- **Results**: Three hundred forty-one children aged 4 days to 14 years, with a median age of 7 years, were included. Sixty-six percent of pediatric patients were infected via family members with COVID-19. The median incubation period was 9 days (interquartile range, 6 to 13). Asymptomatic cases accounted for 5.9%, of which 30% had abnormal chest radiologic findings. A majority of pediatric COVID-19 cases showed mild to moderate clinical features, and only a few developed severe or critical diseases (0.6% and 0.3%, respectively). Fever (77.9%) and cough (32.4%) were the predominant presenting symptoms of pediatric COVID-19. The pediatric patients had fewer underlying diseases and complications than adults. The treatment modalities for pediatric COVID-19 patients were not as complex as those of adult COVID-19 patients. The overall prognosis of pediatric COVID-19 was benign with a decent recovery. The median time from onset to cure was 16 days (interquartile range, 13 to 21).

- **Conclusions**: Compared to adults, COVID-19 in children has distinct features of epidemiology and clinical manifestation.

### Protecting children in low-income and middle-income countries from COVID-19 [^1163i1bf]. BMJ Global Health (2020). Low credibility.

A saving grace of the COVID-19 pandemic in high-income and upper middle-income countries has been the relative sparing of children. As the disease spreads across low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), long-standing system vulnerabilities may tragically manifest, and we worry that children will be increasingly impacted, both directly and indirectly. Drawing on our shared child pneumonia experience globally, we highlight these potential impacts on children in LMICs and propose actions for a collective response.

Data suggest children are susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection but are less likely than adults to become severely ill. Although at first glance these data appear reassuring, the child pneumonia and broader global child health experience provide a forewarning of what may be coming in LMICs. High-income countries (HICs) have an under-5 pneumonia mortality rate of 3 per 100,000. In contrast, the rate in LMICs is 200 per 100,000 population, with pneumonia being the leading infectious cause of under-5 death globally. While yet unknown, COVID-19, a viral pneumonia syndrome, may impact children in LMICs more severely than what has been observed at the time of writing.

The risk factors for poor outcomes in pneumonia are overwhelmingly more prevalent in LMICs than in HICs. These include severe malnutrition, low immunization uptake, nutritional anemia, HIV exposure or infection, air pollution, poverty, low parental education and, crucially, limited access to high-quality acute healthcare. In HICs, vulnerable children are being actively cared for.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 in children - United States, February 12-April 2, 2020 [^112KCUtW]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Low credibility.

Among 149,082 U.S. cases of COVID-19 reported as of April 2, 2020, where age was known, 2,572 (1.7%) occurred in patients aged under 18 years. In comparison, persons aged under 18 years account for 22% of the U.S. population. Although infants under 1 year accounted for 15% of pediatric COVID-19 cases, they remain underrepresented among COVID-19 cases in patients of all ages (393 of 149,082; 0.27%) compared with the percentage of the U.S. population aged under 1 year (1.2%).

Relatively few pediatric COVID-19 cases were hospitalized (5.7%–20%; including 0.58%–2.0% admitted to an ICU), consistent with previous reports that COVID-19 illness often might have a mild course among younger patients. Hospitalization was most common among pediatric patients aged under 1 year and those with underlying conditions. Additionally, 73% of children for whom symptom information was known reported characteristic COVID-19 signs and symptoms of fever, cough, or shortness of breath.

### COVID-19 in 17 Italian pediatric emergency departments [^116UwEZr]. Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Variability in presentation of children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a challenge in emergency departments (EDs) in terms of early recognition, which affects disease control and prevention. We describe a cohort of 170 children with COVID-19 and differences with the published cohorts.

- **Methods**: Retrospective chart reviews on children (0–18 years) evaluated in 17 Italian pediatric EDs.

- **Results**: In our cohort (median age of 45 months; interquartile range of 4 months-10.7 years), we found a high number of patients under 1 year with COVID-19 disease. The exposure happened mainly (59%) outside family clusters; 22% had comorbidities. Children were more frequently asymptomatic (17%) or presented with mild diseases (63%). Common symptoms were cough (43%) and difficulty feeding (35%). Chest computed tomography, chest radiograph, and point-of-care lung ultrasound were used in 2%, 36%, and 8% of cases, respectively. Forty-three percent of patients were admitted because of their clinical conditions. The minimal use of computed tomography and chest radiographs may have led to a reduced identification of moderate cases, which may have been clinically classified as mild cases.

- **Conclusions**: Italian children evaluated in the ED infrequently have notable disease symptoms. For pediatrics, COVID-19 may have rare but serious and life-threatening presentations; however, in the majority of cases, it represents an organizational burden for the ED. These data should not lower the attention to and preparedness for COVID-19 disease because children may represent a source of viral transmission.

### Risk factors for severity in children with coronavirus disease 2019: A comprehensive literature review [^114wXDZg]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected hundreds of thousands of people. The authors performed a comprehensive literature review to identify the underlying mechanisms and risk factors for severe COVID-19 in children. Children have accounted for 1.7% to 2% of the diagnosed cases of COVID-19. They often have milder disease than adults, and child deaths have been rare. The documented risk factors for severe disease in children are young age and underlying comorbidities. It is unclear whether male gender and certain laboratory and imaging findings are also risk factors. Reports on other potential factors have not been published.

### Clinical presentation and outcome of acute respiratory illnesses in South African children during the COVID-19 pandemic [^117X5Sih]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). High credibility.

Data from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) show higher morbidity and mortality in children with acute respiratory illness (ARI) from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, whether SARS-CoV-2 infection is distinct from other causes of ARI in this regard is unclear. We describe clinical characteristics and outcomes of South African children with SARS-CoV-2 and non-SARS-CoV-2 ARIs.

- **Methods**: We performed a cross-sectional study including children aged 0–13 years admitted to Tygerberg Hospital between May and December 2020 with an ARI. Routine clinical data were collected by the attending clinicians. All children underwent SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction testing. For severity of disease, the need for respiratory support and duration of support were considered. Multivariable logistic regression models were built to determine the factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity.

- **Results**: Data for 176 children were available; 38 (22%) children were SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction positive and 138 (78%) were negative. SARS-CoV-2 positive children were more likely to be female (OR: 2.68, 95% CI: 1.18–6.07) and had a lower weight-for-age Z score (OR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.63–0.93). They presented more frequently with fever (OR: 3.56, 95% CI: 1.54–8.24) and less often with cough (OR: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.11–0.66). SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a significantly longer duration of oxygen treatment (median 8 vs. 3 days; OR: 1.1, 95% CI: 1.01–1.20). Overall, 66% of children had viral coinfection, with no significant difference between groups.

### Characterizing long COVID symptoms during early childhood [^115ue16V]. JAMA Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

This analysis identified separate indices for infants/toddlers versus preschool-aged children, based on symptoms likely to differentiate between young children with and without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In previous RECOVER-Pediatrics analyses, the symptoms included in the school-aged index were very different from those found in early childhood, with more predominance of neurological, dermatological, and gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as pain and fears. The adolescent index included symptoms that were more like those included in the adult index, with less overlap between the adult and school-aged indices. These differences highlight why it is imperative to conduct separate assessments in different age groups.

The pathophysiology and mechanisms leading to these age-related differences warrant further investigation. The findings that infants/toddlers and preschool-aged children have varied symptoms may be explained by the fact that symptoms in younger children are reported based on what caregivers can observe rather than what the children themselves are feeling and describing, because most children in this age group do not yet have the language, social skills, or understanding of symptoms to share what they are experiencing. For example, fears and feelings of pain, brain fog, headache, tiredness, or changes in taste and smell may be hard to identify if the child cannot verbalize their internal feelings or sensations, whereas a symptom such as a cough is easily observed.

A further complication is that the identified symptoms may occur commonly in young children because of their developmental stage.

### Surviving sepsis campaign guidelines on the management of adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the ICU: First update [^114p9Kdz]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Regarding respiratory support for COVID-19 infection, more specifically concerning mechanical ventilation, SCCM 2021 guidelines recommend considering the use of a continuous neuromuscular blocking agent infusion for up to 48 hours in cases of persistent ventilator dyssynchrony or when there is a need for ongoing deep sedation, prone ventilation, or persistently high plateau pressures.

### Lessons from COVID-19: A reflection on the strengths and weakness of early consensus recommendations for pediatric difficult airway management during a respiratory viral pandemic using a modified Delphi method [^112tnHac]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2021). Low credibility.

The authors recognized a gap in existing guidelines and convened a modified Delphi process to address novel issues in pediatric difficult airway management raised by the COVID-19 pandemic.

- **Methods**: The Pediatric Difficult Intubation Collaborative, a working group of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia, assembled an international panel to reach consensus recommendations on pediatric difficult airway management during the COVID-19 pandemic using a modified Delphi method. We reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of this process and ways care has changed as knowledge and experience have grown over the course of the pandemic.

- **Recommendations**: In the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Delphi panel recommends against moving away from the operating room solely for the purpose of having a negative pressure environment. The panel also recommends supplying supplemental oxygen and using videolaryngoscopy during anticipated difficult airway management. Direct laryngoscopy is not recommended. If the patient meets extubation criteria, extubate in the OR, awake, at the end of the procedure.

- **Reflection**: These recommendations remain valuable guidance in caring for children with anticipated difficult airways and infectious respiratory pathology when reviewed in light of our growing knowledge and experience with COVID-19. The panel initially recommended minimizing involvement of additional people and trainees and minimizing techniques associated with aerosolization of viral particles. The demonstrated effectiveness of PPE and vaccination at reducing the risk of exposure is also considered.

### Frequent apnea attacks in a 1-month-old infant with influenza C virus infection [^114NnK5q]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Influenza C virus infection is a common and mild disease in children. Nevertheless, it remains an under-recognized cause of acute respiratory illnesses. Herein, we report the case of a 54-day-old infant who developed an influenza C virus infection and frequent apnea attacks, which could be a risk factor for sudden death and has never been reported earlier.

### Covid-19-associated apnea and circumoral cyanosis in a 3-week-old [^114cXoSy]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Despite increasing evidence demonstrating that children have milder presentations and better outcomes in COVID-19 infections, there is limited documentation of individual cases, especially in infants, in the medical literature. Since children appear to most commonly present asymptomatically or with mild symptoms, they have the potential to serve as undetected vectors of the disease as cities and countries begin to ease restrictions on commerce and socialization. Given the lack of universal testing infrastructure worldwide, the implication may be to focus on opportunities to test these patients whenever possible. With disease modeling estimating continued COVID-19 infection in the years ahead, our case highlights the need for clinicians to consider more subtle presentations in infants, such as brief episodes of apnea, cyanosis, and stridor, as potential catalysts to prompt testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, caregiver testing, and/or recommending quarantine protocols.

### COVID-19 and children with Down syndrome: Is there any real reason to worry? Two case reports with severe course [^114HCr4x]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Of the total of 55 children admitted to pediatric wards in Bergamo (between February and May 2020) for SARS-CoV-2 infection, two children with Down syndrome (DS) had a severe course. The first case involved COVID-19 acute viral pneumonia that necessitated intubation and respiratory support, and the second case involved an immunoinflammatory condition that presented as a complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, both cases involved one or more comorbidities, including cardiovascular anomalies, obesity, and/or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Children with DS have a unique profile of cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, diverse anatomic abnormalities of the airways are considered major risk factors for respiratory infections in those with DS. OSA is very common in DS and can trigger pulmonary complications. In the context of COVID-19, obesity is a recognized risk factor. A recent study reported that 30.4% of hospitalized children had obesity, and obesity is prevalent among patients with DS. This currently presents a challenge in distinguishing the role of comorbidities in the development of COVID-19 in patients with DS. Previous studies have suggested that children with trisomy 21 could be genetically vulnerable to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.

During the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, the incidence of pediatric emergency visits declined drastically. This observation is attributed to the closure of schools, intensification of public hygiene measures, and the wearing of facemasks. These measures for mitigating the spread of COVID-19 appeared to be effective in protecting not only adults but also children during the peak period.

### Epidemiological and clinical features of pediatric COVID-19 [^111QnqhX]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Although there are no clear guidelines for the treatment of pediatric COVID-19, our study suggests that the treatment measures for pediatric COVID-19 patients were not as complex as those for adult COVID-19 patients, but even relatively simple. The treatment modalities for children with COVID-19 mainly included antiviral therapy, traditional Chinese medicine, empirical antibiotic treatment, nutritional support therapy, and symptom relief.

The time from onset to recovery in children with COVID-19 ranged from 6 to 39 days, with a median of 16 days and an interquartile range of 13 to 21 days. The prognosis for children with COVID-19 was generally positive. However, we must maintain stringent monitoring of affected children and remain alert to the possibility of condition aggravation due to delayed treatment. The critical patient included in this study is likely a result of delayed treatment. It is noteworthy that there is a significant patient overlap between this study and the one recently reported by Dong et al. because both studies used the same pool of pediatric COVID-19 cases. Our study contributes detailed clinical findings, including clinical symptoms, therapeutic management, and prognosis of pediatric COVID-19, in addition to the analysis of epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in children, which have already been defined by the prior study.

This study has several limitations. The research only covered a brief 2-month period with an observational design and retrospective nature. The data was obtained from local Chinese health authorities.

### Features of an atypical RSV surge during the COVID-19 pandemic [^113YajCn]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

This study describes the clinical features, severity, and outcomes in children under 5 years of age with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection during an atypical summer surge during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although the timing was uncharacteristic, clinical features and illness severity were representative of a typical RSV season. Co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 was low.

### Association of clinically significant obstructive sleep apnoea with risks of contracting COVID-19 and serious COVID-19 complications: a retrospective population-based study of health administrative data [^116m6xJE]. Thorax (2023). High credibility.

Despite plausible pathophysiological mechanisms, more research is needed to confirm the relationship between obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and the risk of COVID-19 infection or COVID-19-related serious complications.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective population-based cohort study using provincial health administrative data from Ontario, Canada. Adults with physician-diagnosed OSA who received positive airway pressure therapy in the five years preceding the pandemic (OSA group) were propensity score matched by baseline characteristics to individuals in the general population at low risk of OSA (non-OSA group) using inverse probability of treatment weighting. Weighted hazard ratios (HR) of (1) a positive COVID-19 test and (2) COVID-19-related emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalisations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and mortality within 12 months of pandemic onset, were compared between groups. We also evaluated the impact of comorbid cardiometabolic or chronic airways disease.

- **Results**: We identified and matched 324,029 individuals in the OSA group to 4,588,200 individuals in the non-OSA group. Compared with the non-OSA group, those in the OSA group were at a greater hazard of testing positive for COVID-19 (HR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.21), having a COVID-19-related ED visit (HR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.51 to 1.73), hospitalisation (HR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.65), or ICU admission (HR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.84). COVID-19-related 30-day mortality was not different (HR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.16). We found that for the OSA group, comorbid airways disease but not cardiometabolic conditions had a significant impact.

### The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome after COVID-19 infection [^116rrkGm]. Journal of Medical Virology (2024). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea is a well-known risk factor regarding the severity of COVID-19 infection. However, at the time of writing, relatively little research has been performed on the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in COVID-19 survivors. The purpose of this study was to investigate the risk of obstructive sleep apnea after COVID-19 infection.

This study was based on data collected from the US Collaborative Network in TriNetX. From January 1, 2020, to June 30, 2022, participants who underwent the SARS-CoV-2 test were included. Based on their positive or negative COVID-19 PCR test results, the study population was divided into two groups. The duration of follow-up began when the PCR test was administered and continued for 12 months.

Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for newly recorded COVID-19 positive subjects for obstructive sleep apnea were calculated using the Cox proportional hazards model and compared to those without a COVID-19 infection. Subgroup analyses were performed for age, sex, and race groups. The COVID-19 group was associated with an increased risk of obstructive sleep apnea at both 3 months of follow-up (HR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.48–1.54) and 1 year of follow-up (HR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.55–1.60).

Kaplan-Meier curves regarding the risk of obstructive sleep apnea revealed a significant difference in probability between the two cohorts in the follow-up periods of 3 months and 1 year (Log-Rank test, p < 0.001). The risks of obstructive sleep apnea among COVID-19 patients were significant in the less than complete analysis available.

### Use of an asymptomatic COVID-19 testing protocol in a pediatric emergency department [^117C77ef]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

High rates of asymptomatic infections with COVID-19 have been reported.

- **Objective**: We aimed to describe an asymptomatic COVID-19 testing protocol in a pediatric emergency department (ED).

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients (younger than 18 years) who were tested for COVID-19 via the asymptomatic testing protocol at a single urban pediatric ED between May 2020 and January 2021. This included all pediatric patients undergoing admission, urgent procedures, and psychiatric facility placement. The primary outcome was the percentage of positive COVID-19 tests. COVID-19 testing was performed via real-time polymerase chain reaction RNA assay testing. County-level COVID-19 data were used to estimate local daily COVID-19 cases per 100,000 individuals (from all ages). Data were described with simple descriptive statistics.

- **Results**: There were 1,459 children tested for COVID-19 under the asymptomatic protocol. Mean ± standard deviation age was 8.2 ± 5.8 years. Two tests were inconclusive, and 29 (2.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–2.8%) were positive. Of the 29 positive cases, 14 (48%; 95% CI 29–67%) had abnormal vital signs or signs and symptoms of COVID-19 upon retrospective review. A total of 15 truly asymptomatic infections were identified. On the days that asymptomatic cases were identified, the lowest average daily community rate was 7.67 cases per 100,000 individuals.

- **Conclusions**: Asymptomatic COVID-19 positivity rates in the pediatric ED were low when the average daily community rate was fewer than 7.5 cases per 100,000 individuals.

### Covid-19 and pediatric pulmonology: Feedback from an expert center after the first year of the pandemic [^116j6eWz]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2023). Low credibility.

Another long-term consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults and children is long-COVID. The definition proposed by the WHO for this condition is that it generally occurs 3 months after the onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with symptoms that last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. A systematic review, which evaluated 80,071 children and adolescents from 21 studies, reported a long-COVID prevalence of 25.24%. The most prevalent clinical manifestations were mood symptoms (16.5%), fatigue (9.7%), and sleep disorders (8.4%). Moreover, this review showed that children with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection had a higher risk of persistent dyspnea, anosmia/ageusia, and fever. A large prospective pediatric cohort of children admitted to the hospital with confirmed COVID-19 also showed that a quarter of children had persistent symptoms (> 5 months) at the time of follow-up with fatigue, sleep disturbance, and sensory problems being the most common. In this study, almost 1 in 10 children reported multisystem impacts with at least two categories of persistent symptoms. Children in mid-childhood and adolescents (aged 6–18 years), as well as those with a history of allergic diseases (defined here as asthma, allergic rhinitis, eczema, or food allergy), were at higher risk of persistent symptoms. Although long-COVID represents a significant public health concern that may increase in the future, there are still no guidelines for its diagnosis and management in children.

### Covid-19-associated apnea and circumoral cyanosis in a 3-week-old [^116ivLXP]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Data regarding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and outcomes in infants are sparse compared to older pediatric and adult populations.

- **Case presentation**: We present a three-week-old full-term male with a history of mild hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) who was admitted as an inpatient twice for episodes of apnea and perioral cyanosis. The patient tested positive for COVID-19 and negative for other common respiratory viruses at both admissions.

- **Conclusions**: To our knowledge, this is the first report of apnea and perioral cyanosis associated with COVID-19 in an infant. This case highlights a previously undocumented COVID-19 presentation and suggests that even mildly symptomatic infants warrant viral diagnostic testing in an effort to prevent further spread of the disease.

### Rise in nocturnal respiratory rate during CPAP may be an early sign of COVID-19 in patients with obstructive sleep apnea [^1165d8H1]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

A middle-aged man with obstructive sleep apnea who had been treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) developed COVID-19. An analysis of airflow records from the CPAP machine revealed a rise in his respiratory rate on the night before the onset of COVID-19-related symptoms, while his nocturnal respiratory rate had been stable during the 18-month period prior to the reported episode. This case suggests that a rise in respiratory rate detected using CPAP machine data could be an important sign of impending acute illness, such as COVID-19. Studies to elucidate the usefulness of this method are warranted.

### Sleep apnea and COVID-19 mortality and hospitalization [^114YqfqZ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

A report describing 5,700 patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) identified that common risk factors for poor outcomes are older age, minority ethnicity, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. However, mortality and hospitalizations, estimated by the CDC COVID-19 Response Team to occur in 1.8–3.4% and 20.7–31.4% of COVID-19-positive individuals, respectively, are not fully explained by recognized risk factors. Sleep apnea — prevalent in older, obese, and minority individuals — increases risk for COVID-19 comorbidities and may contribute to poor outcomes by exacerbating or causing endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress, microaspiration, and lung injury. Although prior reports of COVID-19 risk factors have not identified sleep apnea as a prevalent risk factor, data were from healthcare systems where clinical recognition of sleep apnea is markedly underrecognized. Given its association with recognized COVID-19 comorbidities and physiological plausibility, we analyzed electronic health record (EHR) data from a large New England healthcare system to ask whether sleep apnea is an unrecognized risk factor for COVID-19-related death, hospitalization, ventilator use, and ICU admission among patients with positive COVID-19 diagnostic testing.

### Covid-19 in patients with persistent tachypnea of infancy [^111L7AgF]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2023). High credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has raised substantial concern for patients with chronic lung diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children with persistent tachypnea of infancy (PTI).

- **Methods**: Data on the history of COVID-19, including diagnosis and clinical course of the infection, were collected during the regular follow-up visits of children previously diagnosed with PTI. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on laboratory criteria recommended by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

- **Results**: Between January 1, 2021, and February 28, 2022, 62 patients with PTI (median age 3.7 years; 42 boys, 20 girls) were evaluated. COVID-19 was diagnosed in 38 patients (61.3%) with 16 patients (42.1%) being asymptomatic, and 22 (57.9%) symptomatic. The most common symptoms were rhinorrhea or nasal congestion, cough, and sore throat. Sixteen patients (42.1%) were classified as having a mild course of COVID-19, three children (7.9%) as moderate, and three children (7.9%) as severe. Follow-up performed following a median of 6 months (range 3–12 months) revealed that, after COVID-19, nearly all PTI patients returned to their prior status (32/38, 84.2%); however, 4 children (10.5%) experienced exacerbating symptoms of PTI for 1 month. Two children (5.3%) became asymptomatic after COVID-19.

- **Conclusion**: The course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children with PTI is usually mild, and the risk of hospitalization is low. The course of PTI did not significantly change.

### Epidemiology, clinical characteristics and risk factors of Covid-19 among children in Saudi Arabia: A multicenter chart review study [^112do1nw]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected over 100 million cases worldwide. Children accounted for 1–5% of all cases, with fewer reported symptoms and a better prognosis compared to adults. This study aimed to describe the epidemiological characteristics and outcomes of pediatric COVID-19 cases in Saudi Arabia, in addition to identifying risk factors associated with disease severity.

- **Methods**: This was a multicenter, cross-sectional retrospective study that included confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection among pediatric patients (< 14 years) from the time of initial identification in March 2020 to the end of July 2020 in six centers across the country. Patients were classified based on clinical severity. Study outcomes included time to recovery, need for invasive ventilation, and mortality. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to explore factors associated with increased disease severity.

- **Results**: The study enrolled 567 children, with 51.5% male and 44.6% aged between 6 and 14 years. Asymptomatic patients accounted for 38.98% of the cases, while 319 patients (56%) had mild disease and 27 patients (4.76%) had moderate-to-severe disease. Only 10 patients (1.76%) required Pediatric Intensive Care Unit admission. The calculated case-fatality rate was 0.7%. After performing multivariate regression analysis, chronic lung conditions [adjusted OR = 12.73, 95% CI (2.05–79.12)] and decreased red blood cell (RBC) count [adjusted OR = 2.43, 95% CI (1.09–5.41)] were found to be significant predictors for moderate-to-severe disease (p = 0.006 and 0.030, respectively).

### Pediatric lung imaging features of COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115hDB7f]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Rationale**: Pediatric COVID-19 studies have mostly been restricted to case reports and small case series, which have prevented the identification of specific pediatric lung disease patterns in COVID-19. The overarching goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to provide the first comprehensive summary of the findings of published studies thus far describing COVID-19 lung imaging data in the pediatric population.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search of PubMed was performed to identify studies assessing lung imaging features of COVID-19 pediatric patients (0–18 years). A single-arm meta-analysis was conducted to obtain the pooled prevalence and 95% confidence interval (95% CI).

- **Results**: A total of 29 articles (n = 1026 children) based on chest computerized tomography (CT) images were included. The main results of this comprehensive analysis are as follows: (1) Over a third of pediatric patients with COVID-19 (35.7%, 95% CI: 27.5%-44%) had normal chest CT scans and only 27.7% (95% CI: 19.9%-35.6%) had bilateral lesions. (2) The most typical pediatric chest CT findings of COVID-19 were ground-glass opacities (GGO) (37.2%, 95% CI: 29.3%-45%) and the presence of consolidations or pneumonic infiltrates (22.3%, 95% CI: 17.8%-26.9%). (3) The lung imaging findings in children with COVID-19 were overall less frequent and less severe than in adult patients. (4) Typical lung imaging features of viral respiratory infections in the pediatric population such as increased perihilar markings and hyperinflation were not reported in children with COVID-19.

- **Conclusion**: Chest CT man

### Pre-existing sleep disturbances and risk of COVID-19: A meta-analysis [^1151se2h]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis focusing on all sleep disturbances, rather than OSA alone, to illustrate the influence of pre-existing sleep disturbances on the entire clinical course of COVID-19. It emphasized that sleep disturbances, especially OSA, significantly influenced COVID-19. These influences could be affected by age and gender.

This study had some limitations. First, high heterogeneity was observed in all outcomes. We used random-effect models to alleviate the influence of high heterogeneity on the results. Second, owing to the outbreak of COVID-19, all included studies were observational, thus no causal relationships could be confirmed. We have performed three subgroup analyses representing good quality, and the results showed that the associations between pre-existing sleep disturbances and the four outcomes were consistent with the main analyses. Future randomized controlled trials are expected to investigate the prophylactic and therapeutic effects of timely sleep interventions on the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19.

In conclusion, sleep disturbances, especially OSA, significantly increased the risk of COVID-19 susceptibility, hospitalization, mortality, and long COVID. These influences could be affected by age and gender. Early evaluation and prompt intervention for sleep disturbances are necessary to alleviate the short-term and long-term effects of COVID-19.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) generally causes milder illness in the pediatric population. However, infants represent a higher-risk population with evolving symptomatology and severity. There is a paucity of large population-based data on the impact of COVID-19 on hospitalized infants.

In this large cohort study, the National Inpatient Sample database was queried for all infant hospital admissions between January and December 2020 in the United States, with and without a diagnosis of COVID-19 based on ICD-10-CM U07. The mortality and morbidity of infants with and without COVID-19 were evaluated. Parent-reported race and outcomes were also analyzed.

A weighted total of 3,754,236 infants who were hospitalized were identified, of which 4,265 patients (0.11%) had a concomitant diagnosis of COVID-19. Infants with COVID-19 had similar mortality and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation utilization. Infants with concomitant COVID-19 had a higher rate of respiratory failure, congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury, and coagulopathy. Compared with Caucasian and Asian infants, Hispanic and African American infants were more likely to have COVID-19 hospital admissions than hospitalizations without a COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients with lower median household income represented the majority of the COVID-19 hospitalizations. The infants with COVID-19 were more likely to have Medicaid or Medicare insurance and less likely to have private insurance.

In this large cohort of hospitalized infants with COVID-19, the infection was as…

Regarding respiratory support for COVID-19 infection, more specifically with respect to mechanical ventilation, SCCM 2021 guidelines recommend considering the use of a higher PEEP strategy over a lower PEEP strategy in mechanically ventilated adult patients with COVID-19 and moderate-to-severe ARDS. It is important to monitor patients for barotrauma if using a higher PEEP strategy (> 10 cmH₂O).

### Pre-existing sleep disturbances and risk of COVID-19: a meta-analysis [^11633YkD]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Low credibility.

Sleep disturbances are widespread but usually overlooked health risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to investigate the influence of pre-existing sleep disturbances on the susceptibility, severity, and long-term effects of COVID-19.

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase for relevant articles from inception to October 27, 2023, and updated at May 8, 2024. Sleep disturbances included obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), insomnia, abnormal sleep duration, night-shift work, and any other sleep disturbances. Outcomes were COVID-19 susceptibility, hospitalization, mortality, and long COVID. The effect sizes were pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).

- **Findings**: A total of 48 observational studies (n = 8,664,026) were included. Pre-existing sleep disturbances increased the risk of COVID-19 susceptibility (OR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.07–1.18), hospitalization (OR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.15–1.36), mortality (OR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.19–1.78), and long COVID (OR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.17–1.57). Subgroup analysis showed that younger individuals with sleep disturbances were associated with higher susceptibility and hospitalization and a lower risk of mortality than older individuals. Males with sleep disturbances were associated with higher mortality. For specific sleep disturbances, the susceptibility and hospitalization of COVID-19 were associated with OSA, abnormal sleep duration, and night-shift work; mortality of COVID-19 was linked to OSA; risk of long COVID was related to OSA.

### A unique presentation of delirium in a patient with otherwise asymptomatic COVID-19 [^116hGxWF]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020). Low credibility.

Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), manifests with a wide spectrum of presentations. Most reports of COVID-19 highlight fever and upper respiratory symptoms as the dominant initial presentations, consistent with the World Health Organization guidelines regarding suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, atypical presentations of this disease have been evolving since the initial outbreak of the pandemic in December 2019. We report a case of an older male patient who presented at our hospital with an unusual manifestation of COVID-19.

- **Design**: Brief report.

- **Setting**: A university hospital in Saudi Arabia.

- **Participant**: A 73-year-old man who presented with confusion in the absence of any respiratory symptoms or fever.

- **Intervention**: The patient was initially admitted with delirium and underwent a further work-up.

- **Measurements**: Given his recent history of domestic travel and the declaration of a global COVID-19 pandemic status, the patient was administered a swab test for SARS-CoV-2.

- **Results**: The patient's positive test led to a diagnosis of COVID-19. Although he began to experience a spiking fever and mild upper respiratory symptoms, he recovered rapidly with no residual sequela.

- **Conclusion**: The recognition of atypical presentations of COVID-19 infection, such as delirium, is critical to the timely diagnosis, provision of appropriate care, and avoidance of outbreaks within healthcare facilities during this pandemic.

### Characteristics and clinical outcomes of children and adolescents aged < 18 years hospitalized with COVID-19 - six hospitals, United States, July-August 2021 [^114FLxc4]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Low credibility.

Approximately two-thirds of patients hospitalized for COVID-19, including 83% and 88% of patients aged 5–11 and 12–17 years, respectively, had one or more underlying medical conditions. Approximately two-thirds of patients aged 12–17 years hospitalized for COVID-19 had obesity. Compared with patients without obesity, those with obesity required higher levels and longer duration of care. These findings are consistent with previous reports and highlight the importance of obesity and other medical conditions as risk factors for severe COVID-19 in children and adolescents.

The proportions of patients admitted to the ICU and who required IMV are similar to those in prior reports, which predominantly included hospitalized pediatric COVID-19 patients before Delta variant predominance. Adolescents were more likely to require ICU admission and oxygen support compared with other age groups and required the longest median duration of IMV. The median duration of IMV overall (7 days) is consistent with previous reports. Approximately one-half of patients aged 1–4 years required oxygen support, which might be related to the high proportion with viral coinfection. This study occurred during July–August 2021, the first period during the COVID-19 pandemic with high circulation of RSV and other respiratory viruses. Compared with prior studies, this study found a high proportion of patients had high-flow nasal cannula as the highest level of respiratory support (37%), which might reflect a change in practice to avoid intubation or the high proportion of viral coinfections, including RSV.

### Epidemiological and clinical features of pediatric COVID-19 [^112edXuT]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

**Comparison of characteristics of pediatric COVID-19 with adult COVID-19**: As shown in Table 3, we compared the differences between pediatric COVID-19 and adult COVID-19. Pediatric COVID-19 cases were mostly transmitted in family clustering, while adults can be infected through multiple routes. It is worth noting that there may have been maternal-fetal vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in newborns. The median and interquartile range of the incubation period in pediatric COVID-19 were 9 days and 6–13 days, respectively; the median and interquartile range in adult COVID-19 were 4 days and 2–7 days, respectively. 5.9% of the pediatric patients were asymptomatic, whereas approximately 1% of the adult COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic. Pediatric patients with COVID-19 were mainly mild/moderate, while adults, especially the elderly, tended to be more severe/critical. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in adults were more complicated than those in children, although fever and cough were the main clinical manifestations for both adults and children. Compared with adults, children with COVID-19 had fewer comorbid conditions and complications. The treatment modalities for adult COVID-19 patients were more complicated than those for children with COVID-19. Children with COVID-19 recovered well, whereas COVID-19 prognosis in adults was relatively worse concerning the clinical outcome.

### Risk factors for pediatric critical COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115aYYd1]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Risk stratification is a cornerstone of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society COVID-19 treatment guidance. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to define the clinical characteristics and comorbidities associated with critical COVID-19 in children and adolescents.

- **Methods**: Two independent reviewers screened the literature (Medline and EMBASE) for studies published through August 31, 2023, that reported outcome data on patients aged ≤ 21 years with COVID-19. Critical disease was defined as an invasive mechanical ventilation requirement, intensive care unit admission, or death. Random-effects models were used to estimate pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and heterogeneity was explored through subgroup analyses.

- **Results**: Among 10,178 articles, 136 studies met the inclusion criteria for review. Data from 70 studies that collectively examined 172,165 children and adolescents with COVID-19 were pooled for meta-analysis. In previously healthy children, the absolute risk of critical disease from COVID-19 was 4% (95% CI, 1%-10%). Compared with no comorbidities, the pooled OR for critical disease was 3.95 (95% CI, 2.78–5.63) for the presence of one comorbidity and 9.51 (95% CI, 5.62–16.06) for ≥ 2 comorbidities. Key risk factors included cardiovascular and neurological disorders, chronic pulmonary conditions (excluding asthma), diabetes, obesity, and immunocompromise, all with statistically significant ORs > 2.00.

- **Conclusions**: While the absolute risk for critical COVID-19 in children and adolescents without underlying health conditions was 4%, the presence of comorbidities significantly increased the risk, underscoring the importance of targeted preventive measures for vulnerable populations.

### Management strategies for children with COVID-19: ESPR practical recommendations [^111dLXjq]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Since the recent identification of the novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2), which causes the infection known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there has been a declaration of a global pandemic with a seemingly uncontrolled daily death toll, currently standing at more than 133,000 worldwide as of 15 April 2020. This has led to an international state of fear, uncertainty, and confusion. There remains confusion regarding best medical practices, population control, and when or whether we will return to normality.

Understanding this new disease is crucial. The scientific literature indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is predominantly spread through human droplet transmission, such as sneezing, coughing, or close contact with others who are less than 2 meters away. The greatest risk occurs during the 2- to 14-day incubation period, when many individuals may be asymptomatic. Additionally, the virus can remain viable as aerosols or on hard surfaces for several days, making fomite transmission plausible if a person comes into contact with an infected surface.

Children are susceptible to COVID-19, although they tend to have a less severe course of illness than adults. Only 3% of pediatric cases result in severe illness, while nearly 13% are asymptomatic. Although only two pediatric deaths have been reported in the literature to date, more cases across all pediatric age groups have been described in news reports. While transplacental and intrauterine transmission are not believed to occur, perinatal infection has been described.

### Epidemiological and clinical features of pediatric COVID-19 [^116xpyoU]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection prioritizes our intense efforts to identify effective preventive strategies and develop optimal medical management. Although there is relatively ample information available for adult COVID-19 patients, our knowledge and analysis of the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of pediatric COVID-19 is quite limited. In this context, we performed a retrospective review of COVID-19 in children under 14 years old to assess the epidemiological and clinical features of pediatric COVID-19. This systematic review of pediatric patients with COVID-19 showed that children with COVID-19 were mainly infected via family clustering and had a long incubation period. The majority of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 presented as asymptomatic or mild/moderate disease. The most frequent clinical manifestations were fever and cough. Children with COVID-19 had rare comorbid conditions and few severe complications. The medical management for pediatric COVID-19 patients mainly included supportive therapy and antiviral treatment. In general, the pediatric patients with COVID-19 had a good prognosis.

### Risk stratification for selecting empiric antibiotherapy during and after COVID-19 [^114nb6G2]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic deeply modified the risk of bacterial infection, bacterial resistance, and antibiotic strategies. This review summarizes what we have learned.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an observed increase in healthcare-acquired infections and multidrug-resistant organism-related infections. These were triggered by several factors, including structural challenges such as increased workload and ongoing outbreaks, underlying illnesses, invasive procedures, and treatment-induced immunosuppression. The two most frequently described healthcare-acquired infections in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were bloodstream infections — related or not to catheters — and health-acquired pneumonia, which affected both ventilated and nonventilated patients.

The most frequent species involved in bacteremia were Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative bacilli in cases of health-acquired pneumonia. The rate of Gram-negative bacilli was particularly high in late-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia. Additionally, the specific risk of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-related pneumonia increased when the duration of ventilation exceeded seven days. One unexplained observation was the increase in enterococci bacteremia.

The choice of empiric antimicrobials depends on several factors, such as the site of infection, time of onset, previous length of stay, previous antibiotic therapy, and known colonization by multidrug-resistant organisms. Pharmacokinetics of antimicrobials could be markedly altered during SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory failure, which should encourage the performance of therapeutic drug monitoring.

### Undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea syndrome as a treatable cause of new-onset sleepiness in some post-COVID patients [^113XQhMZ]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Since the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the virus has caused not only severe acute infections but also significant long-term sequelae. Symptoms persisting for more than 12 weeks have been termed post-COVID syndrome. In January 2021, Huang et al. described persistent symptoms in 76% of 1,655 patients with COVID-19, six months after discharge from hospital. These symptoms included respiratory and cardiac issues, but also possible neurological symptoms such as fatigue in 63%, sleep difficulties in 26%, smell disorders in 11%, taste disorders in 7%, dizziness in 6%, and myalgia and headache in 2% of patients. The most prominent symptom seems to be fatigue, which has also been described in 35% of patients with mild acute symptoms of COVID-19 that did not require hospital admission. In many cases, the persistent symptoms limit patients' ability to work or manage their daily life. Understanding the pathophysiology of post-COVID syndrome is important for the development of treatment options and to reduce its burden on individual patients and society.

Risk factors associated with post-COVID syndrome include female sex, middle age, the presence of other chronic or psychiatric diseases, and the severity of the acute infection. Several pathophysiological mechanisms may contribute to persistent symptoms. These may include cardiovascular or pulmonary damage, hematological disturbances, inflammatory or immunological processes, psychosocial factors such as posttraumatic stress disorder or depression, or neurological disorders.

### Characteristics and clinical outcomes of children and adolescents aged < 18 years hospitalized with COVID-19 - six hospitals, United States, July-August 2021 [^1148mosN]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Low credibility.

During June 2021, the highly transmissible B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, became the predominant circulating strain in the United States. U.S. pediatric COVID-19-related hospitalizations increased during July-August 2021 following the emergence of the Delta variant and peaked in September 2021. As of May 12, 2021, the CDC recommended COVID-19 vaccinations for persons aged ≥ 12 years, and on November 2, 2021, COVID-19 vaccinations were recommended for persons aged 5–11 years. At the time of writing, clinical signs and symptoms, the course of illness, and factors contributing to hospitalizations during the period of Delta predominance have not been well described in pediatric patients. The CDC partnered with six children's hospitals to review medical record data for patients aged < 18 years with COVID-19-related hospitalizations during July-August 2021.

Among 915 patients identified, 713 (77.9%) were hospitalized for COVID-19 (acute COVID-19 as the primary or contributing reason for hospitalization), 177 (19.3%) had incidental positive SARS-CoV-2 test results (asymptomatic or mild infection unrelated to the reason for hospitalization), and 25 (2.7%) had multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a rare but serious inflammatory condition associated with COVID-19. Among the 713 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, 24.7% were aged < 1 year, 17.1% were aged 1–4 years, 20.1% were aged 5–11 years, and 38.1% were aged 12–17 years. Approximately two-thirds of patients (67.5%) had one or more underlying medical conditions, with obesity being the most common.

### Auditory evaluation of infants born to COVID19 positive mothers [^111eAXPt]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2022). Low credibility.

COVID-19 infection can cause a wide spectrum of symptoms, and the audio-vestibular system can also be involved. However, there is still debate about this, so findings need to be considered carefully. Furthermore, mother-to-fetus intrauterine transmission of COVID-19 infection in pregnant women is controversial. Few studies are available about the audio-vestibular symptomatology of newborns with intrauterine COVID-19 exposure.

- **Objectives**: This study investigates the possible correlation between COVID-19 gestational infection and hearing impairment onset in newborns. The involvement of hearing in COVID-19 is verified so the timing and methodology of audiological evaluation of children can be planned.

- **Methods**: Children were subject to newborn hearing screening and audiological evaluation. The newborn hearing screening is carried out prior to hospital discharge using the Automatic Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions test. Audiological evaluation is performed within the child's age of 4 months by using maternal, pregnancy, and perinatal case history, COVID-19 case history, otoscopy, acoustic immittance test, Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions test, and the Auditory Brainstem Response test.

- **Results**: Sixty-three children were included in the study. 82.5% of these children were subjects of the newborn hearing screening program. The remaining 11 newborns were not subjected to hearing screening due to isolation measures, and their audiological evaluation was carried out directly. Only one of 52 screened neonates showed a bilateral REFER test result, but the hearing threshold was normal at audiological evaluation.

### Algorithm-based pediatric otolaryngology management during the COVID-19 global pandemic: A Children's Hospital of Philadelphia clinical consensus [^11317VEt]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic requires clinicians to explore alternatives to routine patient management. Otolaryngologists caring for children commonly depend on physical examination, laboratory data, and ambulatory surgical procedures. Limiting patient care, mindful allocation of resources, and concern for safety have challenged all aspects of our health care system. This evidence-based clinical consensus is designed to guide practitioners of pediatric otolaryngology for common scenarios during this time.

- **Data sources**: Peer-reviewed literature, published reports, institutional guidelines, and expert consensus.

- **Review methods**: A clinical consensus on six common scenarios in pediatric otolaryngology was developed with evidence-based strategies.

- **Conclusions**: Providers should suspend all in-person nonessential office visits and elective surgical procedures. An emphasis on medical management and caregiver education will provide reasonable approaches to many of the common outpatient concerns. Surgery for chronic otitis media, obstructive sleep apnea, and acute rhinosinusitis should occur only in response to severe complications or failure of medical regimens. The approach to the pediatric neck mass focuses on timely management for oncologic etiologies and cautious surgical intervention for abscess drainage or tissue sampling. Finally, epistaxis and otorrhea must be triaged and addressed without the usual ambulatory procedures.

- **Implications for practice**: Adaptation of practice patterns during this unprecedented moment for our health care system requires continuous evaluation and flexibility.

### Characteristics and clinical outcomes of children and adolescents aged < 18 years hospitalized with COVID-19 - six hospitals, United States, July-August 2021 [^112nSULc]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Low credibility.

Data were collected from six U.S. children's hospitals located in areas with high COVID-19 incidence during July–August 2021, including hospitals in Arkansas, District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, and Texas. Data from hospitalized patients aged < 18 years with COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 infection were abstracted from electronic medical records using REDCap software (version 11.1.8; Vanderbilt University). Patients were categorized by reason for hospitalization: 1) acute COVID-19, 2) incidental positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, or 3) MIS-C.

Patient demographic characteristics, medical history, coinfections, and disease severity — including the need for and duration of respiratory support, ICU admission, IMV, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and deaths — were abstracted from the medical records. Among patients hospitalized for COVID-19, the presence of underlying medical conditions (including obesity), viral coinfections, and illness course were described by age group.

Pearson's chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare categorical and continuous variables, respectively; p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and R (version 4.0.3; R Foundation for Statistical Computing). This activity was reviewed by CDC and the other participating institutions and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.

Among 915 patients aged < 18 years, 713 (77.9%) were hospitalized for COVID-19, 177 (19.3%) had incidental SARS-CoV-2 infections, and 25 (2.7%) had MIS-C.

### Clinical presentation and outcome of acute respiratory illnesses in South African children during the COVID-19 pandemic [^111QajXu]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Low credibility.

We found no difference in laboratory parameters, in contrast to findings by Jimenez-Garcia et al. and other studies of COVID-19 in children. The reason for this may be the young median age of our cohort or the high prevalence of coinfection. We found alveolar infiltrates in 48% of SARS-CoV-2 positive children, compared with 31% who were negative, and no interstitial infiltrates in the positive group. Ground glass infiltrates and consolidation are the most common radiographical findings reported in children with SARS-CoV-2. Toba et al. reported chest X-ray (CXR) findings of interstitial infiltrates in 18% of SARS-CoV-2 children and consolidation in 15%. The reason for the lack of finding interstitial infiltrates in our study is not clear.

Severity of the disease and outcomes were worse in the SARS-CoV-2 positive children. They tended to require more respiratory support and had increased Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) admission. Most notably, children with SARS-CoV-2 were on oxygen significantly longer compared with SARS-CoV-2 negative children and had an increased length of hospital stay. This is consistent with our previous findings, which showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection in younger children was associated with hospital admission and the need for respiratory support. However, this also highlights the difference between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative children. Although SARS-CoV-2 infections have generally been reported as mild in children, our data show that there is substantial morbidity in children. Jimenez-Garcia et al. also found a longer oxygen duration among SARS-CoV-2 positive children, but no increased length of stay.

### Neurological effects of COVID-19 in infants and children [^115vLYuv]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Neurological manifestations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in children are becoming increasingly apparent as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic continues. While children manifest relatively milder features of the disease, accumulating evidence warrants concern that COVID-19 exacts both acute and long-term effects on the developing central and peripheral nervous systems. This review focuses on the relatively underinvestigated topic of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the brain in infancy and childhood, concluding that clinicians should be attentive to both the acute effects and long-term consequences of COVID-19 from a neurological perspective.

### Veklury [^112i1SRF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The safety and effectiveness of Veklury for the treatment of COVID-19 have been established in pediatric patients from birth to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 1.5 kg. This includes those who are either hospitalized or not hospitalized but have mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death.

Use in this age group is supported by trials in adults [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.4, 14.5)] and an open-label trial (Study 5823) involving 58 hospitalized pediatric subjects [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.6)].

Use of Veklury in pediatric patients from birth to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 1.5 kg is supported by Study 5823. In this study, 58 hospitalized pediatric subjects received weight-based Veklury for up to 10 days in the following cohorts:

- **Cohorts 1–4, 8**:
	- **Infants, children, and adolescents**: Subjects ≥ 12 years and weighing ≥ 40 kg (n = 12).
	- Subjects 37 weeks and weighing ≥ 2.5 kg (n = 3).
	- Subjects 37 weeks and weighing ≥ 2.5 kg at birth (n = 1).
	- Subjects < 56 days old, GA ≤ 37 weeks, and weighing ≥ 1.5 kg at birth (n = 1).

### Long COVID in children: Observations from a designated pediatric clinic [^1133dfEt]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Systematic data are lacking on pediatric long COVID. This study prospectively assessed 90 children with persistent symptoms who presented to a designated multidisciplinary clinic for long COVID. In nearly 60%, symptoms were associated with functional impairment 1–7 months after the onset of infection. A comprehensive structured evaluation revealed mild abnormal findings in approximately half the patients, mainly in the respiratory aspect.
