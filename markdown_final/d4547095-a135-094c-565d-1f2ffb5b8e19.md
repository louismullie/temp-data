## Question

Is a MRI needed if bone biopsy is negative for osteomyelitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether an MRI is needed when a bone biopsy is negative for osteomyelitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and pretest probability. Then, I should verify the limitations of a negative bone biopsy. Next, I will review the diagnostic performance of MRI and how it shifts probability. After that, I need to check guideline-based recommendations for next steps when suspicion remains high. Finally, I will consider special scenarios and synthesize a practical decision framework with caveats and follow-up plans.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because the answer hinges on it. In vertebral osteomyelitis, MRI is the first-line imaging modality and has high sensitivity and specificity, so a negative MRI substantially lowers the likelihood of disease, whereas in nonvertebral sites like the foot, MRI is the most accurate advanced imaging but can be falsely positive in settings such as Charcot arthropathy or postoperative marrow edema, which means pretest probability and competing diagnoses matter greatly [^116ymHLJ] [^115dtG92] [^117WAE62] [^1133s9pj].

> Wait, let me verify the implications of a negative bone biopsy. A negative biopsy does not rule out osteomyelitis because sampling error is common, especially if the biopsy did not target the active lesion, if antibiotics were given beforehand, or if fastidious organisms are present. Guidelines explicitly advise that a nondiagnostic biopsy should prompt repeat image-guided biopsy or alternative tissue acquisition when clinical suspicion remains high, rather than closure of the case [^116WxmYL] [^116EZGfy] [^114oMVkN] [^115fkQ8v].

> I will now examine MRI performance to understand how it changes post-test probability. In vertebral osteomyelitis, MRI has about 97% sensitivity and 93% specificity, and a negative MRI meaningfully decreases the probability of disease. In diabetic foot osteomyelitis, a negative MRI produces a negative likelihood ratio around 0.12, translating to a marked drop in post-test probability when pretest probability is not extremely high, though false negatives do occur and must be weighed against the clinical picture [^115dtG92] [^111xV9ug] [^112gTUox].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm guideline direction for next steps when suspicion persists despite a negative biopsy. For suspected vertebral osteomyelitis, multiple high-credibility guidelines recommend repeating image-guided biopsy or pursuing alternative tissue sampling if the first biopsy is negative but clinical and imaging suspicion remains, and they endorse MRI as first-line imaging when not contraindicated. For nonvertebral sites, expert consensus similarly supports MRI when the diagnosis remains uncertain after clinical and basic imaging assessment, recognizing its superior accuracy while acknowledging specificity limitations in certain contexts [^116EZGfy] [^115HXNZF] [^116WxmYL] [^1132h6Fi] [^117WAE62].

> But wait, what if the MRI is already available and was negative before the biopsy. I should double-check that scenario. If MRI is negative and the patient is improving clinically, many guidelines allow deferring further invasive testing. However, if MRI is negative and suspicion remains high due to persistent symptoms, rising inflammatory markers, or evolving imaging, repeating or escalating tissue sampling is still reasonable because MRI can miss early or focal disease and cannot replace microbiologic confirmation when management would change with a pathogen-directed diagnosis [^114Stz9S] [^116ymHLJ] [^115fkQ8v].

> Let me consider special populations and mimics. In children, whole-body MRI can reveal multifocal nonbacterial osteomyelitis (CNO/CRMO), a diagnosis of exclusion where biopsy may be avoided if classic imaging patterns and clinical features are present. Conversely, in diabetic foot or postoperative bone, MRI can be falsely positive due to marrow edema, so a negative biopsy in that context should prompt careful reassessment of pretest probability and consideration of repeat biopsy or alternative imaging such as tagged WBC studies if MRI is equivocal or contraindicated [^114QzyxJ] [^112ShNJx] [^1133s9pj] [^117D1HmZ].

> I need to ensure I address the practical decision framework. If clinical suspicion is low to moderate and the patient is improving, observation without immediate MRI is reasonable. If suspicion is high or the patient is not improving, MRI is appropriate to define disease extent and guide repeat tissue sampling. If MRI is negative but suspicion remains high, repeat image-guided biopsy or alternative tissue acquisition is indicated. If MRI is positive, that strengthens the case for osteomyelitis, but tissue diagnosis still optimizes pathogen-directed therapy and should be pursued when feasible and safe [^1132h6Fi] [^117WAE62] [^116ymHLJ] [^115fkQ8v].

> In summary, I should confirm that MRI is not universally mandatory after a negative biopsy, but it is the most informative next step when clinical suspicion remains significant because it can detect missed foci, guide repeat sampling to the correct site, and refine the differential. A negative MRI lowers the probability of osteomyelitis but does not absolutely exclude it, so persistent clinical concern warrants repeat tissue diagnosis rather than anchoring on a single negative result [^115dtG92] [^111xV9ug] [^116EZGfy] [^115fkQ8v].

---

In select cases, **MRI is still indicated** despite a negative bone biopsy when clinical suspicion for osteomyelitis remains high, because biopsy can miss focal infection or be limited by sampling error [^116ymHLJ]. MRI is the **most sensitive modality** for detecting early osteomyelitis and can reveal multifocal or deep lesions that biopsy may not capture, especially in the spine or diabetic foot [^116WxmYL] [^111xV9ug]. If MRI is negative and suspicion remains low, osteomyelitis is unlikely and alternative diagnoses should be considered; if suspicion remains high, repeat biopsy or alternative imaging (e.g. PET/CT) may be needed [^114Stz9S] [^1155AHWo].

---

## Limitations of bone biopsy

Bone biopsy is the diagnostic gold standard for osteomyelitis, but it has **important limitations**:

- **Sampling error**: Biopsy may miss focal infection, especially if the lesion is small or multifocal [^116ymHLJ].

- **Technical factors**: Needle size, sample volume, and operator experience can affect yield [^116ymHLJ].

- **Antibiotic exposure**: Prior antibiotics can reduce culture sensitivity [^112mJgXJ].

- **Patient factors**: Obesity, anatomical constraints, and comorbidities can limit access or increase risk.

Given these limitations, a negative biopsy does not fully exclude osteomyelitis, particularly when clinical suspicion remains high [^115fkQ8v].

---

## Role of MRI in osteomyelitis diagnosis

MRI is **highly sensitive and specific** for osteomyelitis, particularly in the early stages when plain radiographs are often normal [^115dtG92]. It can detect marrow changes, soft tissue involvement, and abscesses that may not be captured by biopsy [^116QQn7J]. MRI is especially valuable in the following scenarios:

- **Vertebral osteomyelitis**: MRI is the first-line imaging modality due to its high sensitivity and specificity [^116WxmYL] [^115dtG92].

- **Diabetic foot osteomyelitis**: MRI outperforms other imaging modalities in diagnosing foot osteomyelitis [^111xV9ug] [^117WAE62].

- **Pediatric osteomyelitis**: MRI is preferred for its ability to detect multifocal disease and guide management [^116QzxmU] [^1168Unpc].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines and expert consensus provide clear guidance on the role of MRI when bone biopsy is negative:

- **Persistent clinical suspicion**: If clinical suspicion remains high despite a negative biopsy, MRI is recommended to reassess the diagnosis and guide further management [^notfound].

- **Alternative diagnoses**: MRI can help differentiate osteomyelitis from other conditions such as malignancy, inflammatory arthritis, or non-infectious bone lesions [^116ymHLJ].

- **Repeat biopsy**: If MRI reveals new or persistent abnormalities, repeat image-guided biopsy or alternative tissue sampling may be indicated [^115HXNZF].

---

## Clinical scenarios where MRI is indicated despite negative biopsy

MRI is **particularly indicated** in the following scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Rationale for mri** |
|-|-|
| Vertebral osteomyelitis with negative biopsy | - High sensitivity and specificity of MRI [^115dtG92] <br/> - Detection of epidural abscess or paraspinal involvement [^notfound] |
| Diabetic foot infection with negative biopsy | - Superior diagnostic accuracy of MRI [^111xV9ug] <br/> - Differentiation from Charcot arthropathy [^1114dVcc] |
| Pediatric osteomyelitis with negative biopsy | - Detection of multifocal disease [^112HT6wW] <br/> - Guidance for surgical planning [^116QzxmU] |
| Persistent clinical suspicion despite negative biopsy | - Identification of missed or inaccessible lesions [^116ymHLJ] <br/> - Alternative diagnoses [^116ymHLJ] |

---

## Clinical scenarios where MRI may not be necessary

MRI may not be necessary if:

- **Low clinical suspicion**: Clinical suspicion is low and the patient is improving [^notfound].

- **Alternative diagnosis**: An alternative diagnosis has been established and osteomyelitis is unlikely [^notfound].

- **Resource limitations**: MRI is unavailable or contraindicated (e.g. pacemaker, severe claustrophobia) [^116kUTz2].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In summary, **MRI remains a valuable tool** when bone biopsy is negative but clinical suspicion for osteomyelitis persists. It can detect missed lesions, guide repeat biopsy, and differentiate osteomyelitis from other conditions. Clinicians should integrate clinical judgment, laboratory results, and imaging findings to guide management. If MRI is negative and clinical suspicion remains low, osteomyelitis is unlikely and alternative diagnoses should be considered. If suspicion remains high, repeat biopsy or alternative imaging (e.g. PET/CT) may be warranted [^1155AHWo].

### Osteomyelitis: diagnosis and treatment [^116MXFu5]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Osteomyelitis is an inflammatory condition of bone secondary to an infectious process. Osteomyelitis is usually clinically diagnosed with support from imaging and laboratory findings. Bone biopsy and microbial cultures offer definitive diagnosis. Plain film radiography should be performed as initial imaging, but sensitivity is low in the early stages of disease. Magnetic resonance imaging with and without contrast media has a higher sensitivity for identifying areas of bone necrosis in later stages. Staging based on major and minor risk factors can help stratify patients for surgical treatment. Antibiotics are the primary treatment option and should be tailored based on culture results and individual patient factors. Surgical bony debridement is often needed, and further surgical intervention may be warranted in high-risk patients or those with extensive disease. Diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease increase the overall risk of acute and chronic osteomyelitis.

Osteomyelitis frequently requires more than one imaging technique for an accurate diagnosis. Conventional radiography still remains the first imaging modality. MRI and nuclear medicine are the most sensitive and specific methods for the detection of osteomyelitis. MRI provides more accurate information regarding the extent of the infectious process. Ultrasound represents a noninvasive method to evaluate the involved soft tissues and cortical bone and may provide guidance for diagnostic or therapeutic aspiration, drainage, or tissue biopsy. CT scan can be a useful method to detect early osseous erosion and to document the presence of sequestra. PET and SPECT are highly accurate techniques for the evaluation of chronic osteomyelitis, allowing differentiation from soft tissue infection.

### Challenges in the imaging and diagnosis of chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) [^113vCCRR]. Clinical Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) is a benign skeletal disorder of childhood and adolescence characterised by sterile bone inflammation that results in chronic insidious bone pain. Although it is increasingly recognised, many challenges remain in its diagnosis with patients waiting 15–24 months for diagnosis from the time of symptom onset. Prompt identification and treatment are key to reducing morbidity from CNO, which affects school attendance and can result in chronic limb or spine deformities. Identifying its imaging features, particularly its characteristic lesion distribution on whole-body MRI, remains key to diagnosis. Image-guided biopsy is also required in many cases, particularly those with clinical uncertainty around the diagnosis. We present a review of the challenges encountered in the diagnosis of CNO from a critical appraisal of the literature and our experience as a national paediatric sarcoma, rheumatology and orthopaedic centre. This review hopes to inform radiology colleagues involved in the evaluation of potential CNO patients by discussing its imaging appearances, typical MRI phenotypes, potential mimics and the role of image-guided biopsy.

### Does this patient with diabetes have osteomyelitis of the lower extremity? [^112gTUox]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Context

Osteomyelitis of the lower extremity is a commonly encountered problem in patients with diabetes and is an important cause of amputation and admission to the hospital. The diagnosis of lower limb osteomyelitis in patients with diabetes remains a challenge.

Objective

To determine the accuracy of historical features, physical examination, and laboratory and basic radiographic testing. We searched for systematic reviews of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of lower extremity osteomyelitis in patients with diabetes to compare its performance with the reference standard.

Data Sources

MEDLINE search of English-language articles published between 1966 and March 2007 related to osteomyelitis in patients with diabetes. Additional articles were identified through a hand search of references from retrieved articles, previous reviews, and polling experts.

Study Selection

Original studies were selected if they (1) described historical features, physical examination, laboratory investigations, or plain radiograph in the diagnosis of lower extremity osteomyelitis in patients with diabetes mellitus, (2) data could be extracted to construct 2 x 2 tables or had reported operating characteristics of the diagnostic measure, and (3) the diagnostic test was compared with a reference standard. Of 279 articles retrieved, 21 form the basis of this review. Data from a single high-quality meta-analysis were used to summarize the diagnostic characteristics of MRI in osteomyelitis.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently assigned each study a quality grade using previously published criteria and abstracted operating characteristic data using a standardized instrument.

Data Synthesis

The gold standard for diagnosis is bone biopsy. No studies were identified that addressed the utility of the history in the diagnosis of osteomyelitis. An ulcer area larger than 2 cm2 (positive likelihood ratio [LR], 7.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1–49; negative LR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.31–0.76) and a positive "probe-to-bone" test result (summary positive LR, 6.4; 95% CI, 3.6–11; negative LR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.20–0.76) were the best clinical findings. A erythrocyte sedimentation rate of more than 70 mm/h increases the probability of a diagnosis of osteomyelitis (summary LR, 11; 95% CI, 1.6–79). An abnormal plain radiograph doubles the odds of osteomyelitis (summary LR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.6–3.3). A positive MRI result increases the likelihood of osteomyelitis (summary LR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.5–5.8). However, a normal MRI result makes osteomyelitis much less likely (summary LR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.08–0.26). The overall accuracy (ie, the weighted average of the sensitivity and specificity) of the MRI is 89% (95% CI, 83.0%-94.5%).

Conclusions

An ulcer area larger than 2 cm2, a positive probe-to-bone test result, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of more than 70 mm/h, and an abnormal plain radiograph result are helpful in diagnosing the presence of lower extremity osteomyelitis in patients with diabetes. A negative MRI result makes the diagnosis much less likely when all of these findings are absent. No single historical feature or physical examination reliably excludes osteomyelitis. The diagnostic utility of a combination of findings is unknown.

### Osteomyelitis and beyond [^113vn1Uh]. Pediatric Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Musculoskeletal infections are a cause of considerable morbidity in children. Symptoms and signs are often nonspecific, and imaging is needed to define the anatomical location of infected tissue or fluid collections for diagnostic aspiration or biopsy. Prompt diagnosis and precise localization of the infection site has become even more imperative with the emergence and dissemination of highly invasive organisms such as community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus. Although radiography, bone scintigraphy and US continue to play a role, MRI is now the preferred imaging modality for definitive evaluation of pediatric musculoskeletal infections because of its capability of simultaneously assessing the osseous, articular and muscular structures without ionizing radiation exposure. This article focuses on the imaging characteristics of osteomyelitis, septic arthritis and pyomyositis and the differentiating features of potential mimics of infection.

### Chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis: the role of whole-body MRI [^114QzyxJ]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis (CNO), also known as chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, is a noninfectious autoinflammatory disorder that occurs primarily in children and adolescents and is characterized by episodic musculoskeletal pain with a protracted course.

Main body

Traditionally, the diagnosis of CNO is made by exclusion and commonly requires bone biopsy to rule out infection and malignancy. However, bone biopsy may be avoided when imaging and clinical characteristic features are present, such as multifocal bone lesions at typical sites, no constitutional symptoms and no signs of infection in laboratory test results. Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) can assess signs of acute and chronic inflammation and enables the detection of CNO typical patterns of lesion location and distribution, thereby helping to exclude differential diagnosis. The goal of the present study paper is to review the main clinical and imaging aspects of the disease with emphasis on the role of WB-MRI in the diagnosis, assessment of disease burden and follow-up monitoring.

Conclusion

Radiologists need to be familiar with the imaging features to suggest the diagnosis as the early therapy may help to avoid irreversible secondary damage of skeletal system.

Fig. 2
Bristol diagnostic criteria for CRMO

Twelve children were without biopsy at referral of whom nine did not require a biopsy for diagnosis. Using these criteria for diagnosis provides a framework for avoiding biopsy in children with typical disease; however, these criteria cannot be validated by this retrospective audit as the clinicians and/or radiologist may have been aware of a biopsy report when making the diagnosis. It is very straightforward to declare the MRI findings as 'typical' for CRMO whilst holding a bone marrow report with suggestive features. The clinical vignette and available imaging would need to be shown to a blinded audience in order to validate these criteria objectively.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) in children — late relapse following appropriate antibiotic and surgical therapy is uncommon, generally < 1% to 2%. In a child who presents with apparent late relapse, the first step is to determine whether the symptoms or signs are due to bacterial osteomyelitis versus another etiology. Reassessment of the adequacy of the antibiotic regimen and adherence to the prescribed course is a starting point, and imaging studies (plain radiographs and/or MRI, depending on the presentation) should be obtained. Bone biopsy or other invasive technique to examine and culture involved bone(s), including histopathologic evaluation, may be helpful, and surgical debridement of sequestrum and involucrum, when present, may be needed.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of diabetic foot osteomyelitis: imaging accuracy in biopsy-proven disease [^114nv9bF]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the recommended diagnostic imaging technique for diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO). The gold standard to diagnose osteomyelitis is bone biopsy with a positive culture and/or histopathology finding consistent with osteomyelitis. The purpose of this study is to assess the accuracy of MRI readings in biopsy-proven diabetic foot osteomyelitis with a second read done by a blinded, expert musculoskeletal radiologist. A retrospective chart review of 166 patients who received a bone biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of a suspected DFO at a large county hospital between 2010 and 2014. A second, blinded musculoskeletal radiologist reviewed the images for accuracy, once the official reading was recorded. Imaging results were correlated with the final diagnosis of osteomyelitis determined by bone biopsy. In 17 of 58 patients (29.3%), the diagnosis of DFO by MRI was not confirmed by bone biopsy. There were 12 false positives and 5 false negatives. After the second expert read, there were 5 false positives and 4 false negatives. The overall accuracy was 84% for the second read. Our study demonstrated results comparable to the previously reported meta-analysis findings. There is a clear variation on the read of MRI that could lead to an incorrect diagnosis of DFO. An integrated approach with evaluation of clinical findings, communication with radiologist about the MRI results when indicated, and bone biopsy is warranted for accurate diagnosis management of DFO.

Osteomyelitis Without Prosthetic Joint Infections (PJI)

Based on observational studies, we do not recommend the routine use of plain x-rays (because of inadequate sensitivity, specificity) or computed tomography scans (inadequate sensitivity) for all patients with a possible diagnosis of osteomyelitis (Table 1; eTable 1 in Supplement 2) as they may result in unnecessary radiation and use of resources. However, these studies may be helpful if a fracture or other noninfectious cause of bone pain (eg, tumor, foreign object) is prioritized on the differential diagnosis, and/or the pretest probability of osteomyelitis is lower (eg, ≤ 15%). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and certain tagged white cell scans are the most accurate imaging modalities for diagnosing osteomyelitis. Inflammatory biomarkers are insufficiently accurate, and we do not recommend their routine use for osteomyelitis diagnosis. Blood cultures have variable sensitivity, but if the patient has systemic symptoms or risk factors for bacteremia (eg, intravenous drug use), isolating likely pathogens (eg, Staphylococcus aureus) can be helpful to target with therapy and potentially obviate the need for bone biopsy. If available, bone biopsy for histopathology is highly accurate if positive, but cannot rule out osteomyelitis if negative. Culture of biopsy specimens of the affected bone may help identify etiology and target antimicrobial therapy.

Diabetic Foot Osteomyelitis (DFO)

Based on observational studies, plain x-rays have low sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing DFO (Table 1; eTable 1 in Supplement 2). The probe-to-bone (PTB) test is simple, noninvasive, and has reasonable sensitivity and specificity as a diagnostic method for DFO, which may preclude the need for imaging in some settings. MRI and certain tagged white cell scans are the most accurate imaging modalities for diagnosing DFO, although their specificities are lower than their sensitivities. Inflammatory biomarkers are insufficiently accurate and we do not recommend their routine use for diagnosis. If available, percutaneous bone biopsy for deep microbiological cultures may help target antimicrobial therapy; surface cultures are not accurate and not recommended.

### Consensus document for the diagnosis of peripheral bone infection in adults: a joint paper by the EANM, EBJIS, and ESR (with ESCMID endorsement) [^113ZCL2D]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

When still having a suspicion at this stage, image-guided bone biopsy should be performed to detect infection and identify the causative micro-organism. Sinus tract cultures can cause false-positive results due to contamination, and superficial swab cultures have a lower diagnostic than bone biopsy. Besides the bone biopsy, advanced diagnostic imaging tests should be performed. Since there are not enough well-designed studies (with a level of evidence 1) available that directly compare radiological with nuclear-medicine techniques, we decided to split the imaging techniques into radiological and nuclear-medicine techniques. When choosing an advanced diagnostic imaging test, a further stratification should be performed based on the pre-test probability of infection. Based on local experience, one can decide to start with radiological techniques (MRI has the best diagnostic accuracy) and use nuclear-medicine techniques in case of equivocal MRI results. If a center is very experienced in nuclear-medicine modalities, one can decide to start with these techniques. Which nuclear-medicine modality should be used first depends on the following: is there a low or a high probability of infection? Was there recent surgery? Was there a recent fracture? Is there metallic hardware in situ? For the answers to these questions, see the nuclear part of the flowchart and tables.

### Gaucher disease: an unusual cause of knee pain [^1174sTn1]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Bone pain may be an early manifestation in patients with GD, especially in childhood and adolescence. Because it generally occurs along with elevated inflammatory markers and signs of local inflammation, a possible misdiagnosis of osteomyelitis may delay adequate therapy and allow progression of bone involvement. The differential diagnosis between these two conditions is challenging. During bone crisis in GD, MRI illustrates high signal intensity of the bone marrow in T2-weighted images because of edema; however, osteomyelitis has similar imaging. Most frequently, the only clue in favor of GD is negative cultures after a biopsy. Still, diagnostic suspicion of GD may prompt measurement of β-glucocerebrosidase, which in combination with DNA analysis can confirm the diagnosis, without any orthopaedic intervention.

### Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis [^115Xa3xc]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis is a rare auto-inflammatory condition that primarily affects children and adolescents. It presents with recurrent episodes of pain related to the presence of foci of sterile bone inflammation. The long bones of the lower extremities are more frequently affected and the spine can also be involved. Imaging studies, including whole-body magnetic resonance, are important for diagnosis and detection of asymptomatic lesions. Bone biopsies may be necessary to exclude other diseases, including malignancy and infections. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs cause relief of symptoms in the majority of cases. Bisphosphonates and TNF-α blockers are alternatives for patients who do not respond or who have spinal involvement.

Native vertebral osteomyelitis (NVO) — pathology submission after image-guided aspiration biopsy: If adequate tissue can be safely obtained, pathology specimens should be sent from all patients to help confirm a diagnosis of NVO and to help guide further diagnostic testing, especially in the setting of negative cultures (strong, low). The differential diagnosis of a patient with back pain and an MRI abnormality includes NVO, neoplasm, acute disc herniation with disc space collapse, and osteoporosis-associated vertebral collapse (vertebral compression fracture). In addition, the absence of any tissue abnormality suggests that the biopsy performed did not sample the correct area of abnormality. In a retrospective review of 800 patients undergoing imaging-guided diagnostic bone biopsy, the highest rate of positive cultures was associated with obtaining > 2 mL of fluid, and the size of the needle used (range, 11–18 gauge) and antibiotic administration before biopsy did not have a significant impact on the yield. In patients with high clinical and radiologic suspicion and a nondiagnostic first image-guided aspiration biopsy, a second or an open biopsy to establish a pathologic and microbiologic diagnosis should be considered.

### Chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis: the role of whole-body MRI [^112ShNJx]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

CNO is a diagnosis of exclusion and is often delayed. It has high variability in presentation, sites, recurrence rates and prognosis. The typical clinical presentation is a child or adolescent with a history of chronic multifocal bone pain, usually with a normal blood count and mildly elevated inflammatory markers. The characteristic lesions are metaphyseal, multiple and symmetric, involving the lower extremities, pelvis, spine, clavicle, and mandible.

Currently, WB-MRI is the most sensitive imaging method to detect asymptomatic and radiographically occult multifocal lesions, demonstrating the multifocal pattern of the CNO and characteristic lesion distribution, thus helping to establish the diagnosis and reducing the need for invasive diagnostic procedures. Radiologists need to be familiar with the imaging features to suggest the diagnosis.

### What are the optimal cutoff values for ESR and CRP to diagnose osteomyelitis in patients with diabetes-related foot infections? [^1167ktyN]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Distinguishing osteomyelitis from soft-tissue infection of the foot is important because osteomyelitis is associated with more operations, amputation, and prolonged antibiotic exposure. Both erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are routinely ordered inflammatory biomarkers for evaluating foot infection. When initial evaluation is inconclusive, advanced imaging is indicated, and high clinical or radiographic suspicion of osteomyelitis may indicate bone biopsy to identify organisms and antibiotic sensitivity. Although ESR and CRP levels are helpful for distinguishing osteomyelitis from soft-tissue infections in patients with diabetes-related foot infections, parameters regarding optimal cutoff values for those tests have not, to our knowledge, been defined.

Questions/Purposes

(1) What are the optimal cutoff values for ESR and CRP to differentiate osteomyelitis from soft-tissue infection in patients with diabetes-related foot infection? (2) Can a diagnostic algorithm be derived to guide interpretation of ESR and CRP to improve recognition of osteomyelitis in the setting of diabetic foot infection?

Methods

The medical records of 1842 patients between 18 and 89 years of age treated at our institution between January 1, 2010 and February 6, 2017 for foot infection were reviewed. For inclusion, patients must have had a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, moderate or severe infection, ESR and CRP values within 72 hours of admission, either advanced imaging (MRI or single-positron emission computed tomography/computed tomography [SPECT/CT]) or bone biopsy during admission and must not have had comorbidities that could affect ESR and CRP, such as autoimmune disorders. As such, 1489 patients were excluded, and 353 patients were included in the study. Osteomyelitis was diagnosed by positive bone culture or histopathology. Osteomyelitis was considered to be absent if there was a negative MRI or SPECT/CT result, or negative bone culture and histology findings if imaging was inconclusive. We identified 176 patients with osteomyelitis and 177 with soft-tissue infection. A blinded investigator performed the statistics. Optimal cutoffs of ESR and CRP were determined using receiver operative characteristic (ROC) analysis. A diagnostic algorithm was determined using epidemiologic principles of screening evaluations.

Results

An ESR of 60 mm/h and a CRP level of 7.9 mg/dL were determined to be the optimal cutoff points for predicting osteomyelitis based on results of the ROC analysis. The ESR threshold of 60 mm/h demonstrated a sensitivity of 74% (95% confidence interval [CI] 67–80) and specificity of 56% (95% CI, 48–63) for osteomyelitis, whereas the CRP threshold of 7.9 mg/dL had a sensitivity of 49% (95% CI, 41–57) and specificity of 80% (95% CI, 74–86). If the ESR is < 30 mm/h, the likelihood of osteomyelitis is low. However, if ESR is > 60 mm/h and CRP level is > 7.9 mg/dL, the likelihood of osteomyelitis is high, and treatment of suspected osteomyelitis should be strongly considered.

Conclusions

While ESR is better for ruling out osteomyelitis initially, CRP helps distinguish osteomyelitis from soft-tissue infection in patients with high ESR values. Further prospective studies addressing the prognostic value of ESR and CRP are needed, and a more comprehensive diagnostic algorithm should be developed to include other diagnostic tests such as probe-to-bone and imaging.

### 2015 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of native vertebral osteomyelitis in adults [^117PB92X]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

2015 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline — native vertebral osteomyelitis (NVO) in adults — notes that NVO is often the result of hematogenous seeding of the adjacent disc space from a distant focus, as the disc is avascular, and the diagnosis can often be delayed several months and initially misdiagnosed as a degenerative process. NVO is typically diagnosed in the setting of recalcitrant back pain unresponsive to conservative measures and elevated inflammatory markers with or without fever. Radiographs of the spine are not sensitive for the early diagnosis of NVO, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine is often required to establish the diagnosis. Except in septic patients or patients with neurologic compromise, empiric antimicrobial therapy should be withheld, when possible, until a microbiologic diagnosis is confirmed; an image-guided or intraoperative aspiration or biopsy of a disc space or vertebral endplate sample submitted for microbiologic and pathologic examination often establishes the microbiologic or pathologic diagnosis of NVO. NVO is commonly monomicrobial and most frequently due to Staphylococcus aureus, and the concomitant presence of S. aureus bloodstream infection within the preceding 3 months and compatible spine MRI changes preclude the need for a disc space aspiration in most patients. Definitive therapy should be based on the results of culture and in vitro susceptibility testing, and the majority of patients are cured with a 6-week course of antimicrobial therapy.

### 2015 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of native vertebral osteomyelitis in adults [^111sW1oi]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2015 native vertebral osteomyelitis — suspected treatment failure evaluation and management is addressed as follows: In patients with NVO and clinical and radiographic evidence of treatment failure, we suggest obtaining additional tissue samples for microbiologic and histopathologic examination, either by image-guided aspiration biopsy or through surgical sampling (weak, very low), and we suggest consultation with a spine surgeon and an infectious diseases physician (weak, very low). The most consistent finding in NVO treatment failure is persistent or recurrent severe back pain, and patients with persistent or progressive pain, systemic symptoms of infection, undrained or partially drained large epidural abscess, or persistently elevated systemic inflammatory markers may be at highest risk for treatment failure. There are limited data to guide evaluation; obtaining systemic inflammatory markers and a follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may confirm the risk of treatment failure, while the frequency and utility of follow-up inflammatory laboratory markers during antimicrobial therapy have not been established. In NVO patients with suspected treatment failure in whom surgical debridement is not planned, one should consider image-guided aspiration biopsy to definitively establish the diagnosis and confirm microbiologic etiology; for culture-negative NVO with suspected treatment failure, we recommend undertaking additional attempts to isolate an etiologic pathogen, including tissue for histopathology; aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures; and fungal, brucellar, and mycobacterial cultures, and in select circumstances, serologic assays for uncommon causes should be considered as well.

### Imaging of osteomyelitis and musculoskeletal soft tissue infections: current concepts [^112HT6wW]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The diagnostic imaging of osteomyelitis can require the confluence of multiple imaging technologies. Conventional radiography should always be the first imaging modality. Sonography is most useful in the diagnosis of fluid collections in a joint or in the extra-articular soft tissues but is not useful for evaluating presence of osseous infection. CT scan can be a useful method to detect early osseous erosion and to document the presence of sequestrum, foreign body, or gas formation but generally is less sensitive than other modalities for the detection of bone infection. Nuclear medicine and MRI are the most sensitive and most specific imaging modalities for the detection of osteomyelitis. Nuclear medicine is particularly useful in identifying multifocal involvement, which is common in children. MRI provides more accurate information of the local extent of the soft tissues and possible soft tissue abscess in patients with musculoskeletal infection.

### Spinal infections: diagnostic tests and imaging studies [^1123jWZq]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Clinical signs and symptoms caused by spinal infections often are subtle and insidious; therefore, clinical suspicion in patients with nonmechanical pain is important in making the correct diagnosis in the early stage of disease. Serologic tests such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein are quite sensitive, but specificity is relatively low. Imaging tests include plain radiographs, radionuclide studies, computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging. Changes on plain radiographs appear at least 3 to 4 weeks after the onset of disease. Bone scan is a sensitive but not a specific test. Computed tomography provides structural details in the bone and intervertebral disc but magnetic resonance imaging is a superior imaging test for diagnosing infections earlier and more accurately. In many patients, percutaneous or open biopsy is required to make the definitive diagnosis of discitis or osteomyelitis and the organism responsible for the infection. Early and accurate diagnosis of spinal infections will lead to less invasive treatment for the patient.

### Chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis: the role of whole-body MRI [^111kcdwz]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic imaging approach

There is no confirmatory diagnostic test for CNO. The diagnosis of CNO is traditionally one of exclusion of other diseases, such as acute bacterial osteomyelitis, bone tumors, blood diseases, fibrous dysplasia and histiocytosis. Due to the gradual onset of the symptoms, minimal findings on clinical examination, relatively normal laboratory studies and lack of awareness of this condition, children with CNO may experience delays in diagnosis. These delays may lead to prolonged use of antibiotics, multiple surgeries, repeated bone biopsies and excessive radiation exposure. The median time between initial symptoms and diagnosis of CNO is 2 years, and 69% of the patients consulted with 2–5 physicians before receiving the final diagnosis. It is common for the patient to undergo multiple segmental examinations of the joints involved over the time before the diagnosis of CNO is suggested.

Diagnostic imaging frequently includes conventional radiography and/or regional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at sites of pain. Plain radiography may reveal sclerotic, lytic or mixed lesion, according to the time of disease evolution. Hyperostosis and periosteal reaction are also suggestive features, though less frequently observed. Characteristically, there is no abscess formation, fistula or sequestra, which are often identified in pyogenic osteomyelitis.

Occasionally, computed tomography (CT) may be useful when MRI is unavailable, but it should be avoided in children.

MRI is highly sensitive for detecting inflammatory lesions without radiation exposure, which is important, especially in young children, as MRI can reveal the site, features, and patterns of bone involvement characteristic of CNO. On MRI, active disease exhibits edematous marrow changes, including T1 hypointensity and hyperintensity on both T2 and short time inversion recovery (STIR) sequences.

### Magnetic resonance imaging for diagnosing foot osteomyelitis: a meta-analysis… [^111xV9ug]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions We found that MRI performs well in the diagnosis of osteomyelitis of the foot and ankle and can be used to rule in or rule out the diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging performance was markedly superior to that of technetium Tc 99m bone scanning, plain radiography, and white blood cell studies. Specifically, we calculated the frequency that a bone biopsy–based reference standard was used to determine or exclude osteomyelitis. For a positive disease determination, positive histologic analysis or culture results from a bone specimen were recorded. For the negative reference standard, we recorded the percentage of patients in whom osteomyelitis was excluded by negative histologic analysis results. This meta-analysis has 2 major implications. First, this study confirms that MRI is a strong test to aid in both confirming and excluding osteomyelitis of the foot.

Using the clinically relevant cut point of 90% sensitivity, the positive likelihood ratio is 5. 1 and the negative likelihood ratio is 0.
12. Assuming a pretest probability of 50%, a patient with a positive MRI would have an 84% chance of having the diagnosis. If any other features or examination findings favor the diagnosis of osteomyelitis, such as substantial depth of ulcer or positive probe to bone, the addition of a positive MRI virtually clinches the diagnosis. A negative MRI study in our baseline hypothetical patient results in a posttest probability of 11%. Combined with absence of substantial ulcer depth or a negative probe to bone, MRI effectively rules out osteomyelitis. Although bone scanning has been proposed for ruling out the disease, the lack of adequate specificity creates many false-positive results.

4, 6, 33 Using a hypothetical prevalence of osteomyelitis of 25%, for every 100 patients subjected to bone scanning, 12 of 13 with a negative result would have the diagnosis correctly excluded, but only 24 of 87 with a positive result would be correctly identified as having osteomyelitis. We did not compare the performance of biopsy with MRI. A biopsy affords information regarding the exact pathogen responsible for infection, something that imaging tests cannot do.

Diabetic foot infection imaging — magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has generally supplanted computed tomography (CT) in the early diagnosis of osteomyelitis due to its higher tissue contrast and ability to detect both soft tissue and marrow inflammation. Additionally, MRI can be used to follow the resolution of infection or as an aid in surgical planning. However, none of these imaging modalities are 100% sensitive and specific for diagnosing or ruling out bone infection. Furthermore, these tests are expensive and may not be readily available, and appropriate clinical assessment and diagnostic acumen should therefore remain the guiding principles to management.

Acute bacterial arthritis (pediatric) — adjacent osteomyelitis risk, imaging follow-up, and research needs: When an MRI obtained early shows no adjacent osteomyelitis and the clinical course shows expected, rapid improvement without complications, adjacent osteomyelitis is very unlikely; plain radiographs of bones adjacent to the infected joint for children with full recovery are not routinely necessary, though a low risk may still exist when MRI was not obtained. On rare occasions MRI imaging is reasonable based on comorbidities or concerning clinical or laboratory findings. Additional controlled, prospective studies are needed to quantify the risk of adjacent osteomyelitis by pathogen and joint, and multicenter collaborations likely will be required.

### Imaging of osteomyelitis in the mature skeleton [^115dcyko]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of acute osteomyelitis is often challenging but can be made by plain radiograph, bone scan, or MR imaging. This diagnosis may be more problematic in small bones, in diabetic or immunocompromised patients, those partially treated, post-traumatic, previous surgery, or with pre-existing marrow conditions and associated soft tissue infections. CT is the modality of choice for revealing sequestra and cortical erosions in chronic osteomyelitis. Nonenhanced and enhanced STIR or fat-saturated sequences are essential to reveal the marrow abnormality and its extension for diagnosis of subtle cases with neuropathic or other associated conditions. Combined radionuclide scintigraphy becomes necessary in complicated situations.

### Osteomyelitis complicating sacral pressure ulcers: whether or not to treat with antibiotic therapy [^113Abc82]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

The treatment of osteomyelitis in patients with stage IV sacral pressure ulcers is controversial. We conducted a systematic literature review and did not find evidence of benefit of antibacterial therapy in this setting without concomitant surgical debridement and wound coverage. Furthermore, many patients with chronically exposed bone do not have evidence of osteomyelitis when biopsied, and magnetic resonance imaging may not accurately distinguish osteomyelitis from bone remodeling. The goal of therapy should be local wound care and assessment for the potential of wound closure. If the wound can be closed and osteomyelitis is present on bone biopsy, appropriate antibiotic therapy is reasonable. We find no data to support antibiotic durations of > 6 weeks in this setting, and some authors recommend 2 weeks of therapy if the osteomyelitis is limited to cortical bone. If the wound will not be closed, we find no clear evidence supporting a role for antibiotic therapy.

### Optimizing advanced imaging of the pediatric patient in the emergency department: policy statement [^112Uy3SE]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Musculoskeletal infections — Although radiographs are insensitive for the detection of acute bone infections, they may be considered as an initial examination to evaluate for other pathologies such as trauma or malignancy. If there is high clinical suspicion for osteomyelitis, MRI should be considered as the diagnostic test of choice, given its accuracy for diagnosis and ability to detect concomitant adjacent infections, and it is best that such imaging is performed at the institution where definitive care will be delivered. Ultrasonography is an appropriate diagnostic modality to identify joint effusions; however, it cannot distinguish between sterile joint fluid and septic arthritis, therefore a definitive diagnosis requires synovial fluid analysis, and MRI may be helpful in patients in whom there is clinical suspicion for concomitant osteomyelitis.

### Childhood osteomyelitis: imaging characteristics [^116QQn7J]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging

After 3–5 days of onset of infection, MRI can detect osteomyelitis. MRI is the best technique available to evaluate changes in the bone marrow/water content of bone marrow. Alteration of bone marrow signal intensity can be visible 1 or 2 days after the onset of infection (Figs. 6 and 8).

MRI criteria for diagnosis are low signal intensity on T1, high signal intensity on T2/STIR, and enhancement of (subperiosteal) bone and/or soft tissues and abscess/collections after contrast administration.

MRI is also useful for evaluation of complications such as (subperiosteal) abscesses, joint effusions and soft-tissue extension that would require surgical treatment (Figs. 8, 10 and 11).

Fig. 10
a A 9-year-old girl from Ethiopia, with cervical lymph nodes and weight loss, under suspicion of having tuberculosis. Fluid collection was seen on ultrasound at level II and the patient underwent CT to exclude a retropharyngeal abscess. CT showed multiple cervical and mediastinal lymph nodes, but also destruction of the end plate of the corpus of C2 with a fragment dislocated anteriorly (arrow). b CT in the soft tissue kernel clearly shows a prevertebral fluid collection with rim enhancement, but also posterior extension in the spinal canal, with enhancement. The diagnosis is a tuberculous spondylodiscitis. c On the sagittal T1 contrast-enhanced fat-saturated image, one can clearly see the anterior abscess, but also the intraspinal extension of the abscess in the spinal canal

Nuclear imaging

Acute osteomyelitis on a three-phase bone scintigraphy can show increased blood flow and blood pool activity, and positive uptake on 3 h images in areas of osteomyelitis. However, at this time blood pool flow and pool activity can be normal or photon deficient because of devascularisation of the periostium due to rapid raising of the periostium.

PET-CT will show high uptake in areas of osteomyelitis, in bone marrow and in soft tissue.

Differential diagnosis (Table 2)

Since defining a differential diagnosis solely based on imaging characteristics can be very difficult, clinical and laboratory parameters and communication with clinicians remain very important in the diagnosis of osteomyelitis. In cases of doubt, fine-needle aspiration or an image-guided biopsy will eventually be necessary to determine the definitive diagnosis.

### Is there a simple, definitive, and cost-effective way to diagnose osteomyelitis in the pressure ulcer patient? [^111Mi9os]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Despite advances in managing pressure ulcers, there is still no definitive way to diagnose bone infection (osteomyelitis) short of open biopsy. An effective, less invasive diagnostic method might result in cost savings and improved care; however, needle aspiration, computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, and bone scans have proven unsatisfactory in predicting osteomyelitis. The authors reviewed preoperative radiologic studies of stage IV pressure ulcer patients and their bone biopsy results to determine which radiologic studies are most diagnostic for osteomyelitis.

Methods

Patients (n = 44) having surgical débridement of stage IV ulcers with open bone biopsy after prior radiographic imaging (plain films, ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and/or nuclear bone scans) were included. Studies were interpreted by a single musculoskeletal radiologist blinded to information from the medical record and following standard radiologic criteria for the diagnosis of osteomyelitis.

Results

The percentage of patients with biopsy-proven osteomyelitis identified with imaging was 50 percent using a computed tomography scan and 88 percent using a plain film of the bony area of involvement. The overall sensitivity of either radiologic study was 61 percent. The percentage of patients without osteomyelitis identified as not having the condition by imaging was 85 percent for the computed tomography scan and 32 percent for the plain film. Overall specificity of both studies was 69 percent.

Conclusion

Preoperative radiologic studies for osteomyelitis in a pressure ulcer are far from definitive; however, if a radiologic study is used to make that diagnosis in a stage IV pressure ulcer, it would appear that a plain film would suffice.

Osteomyelitis With PJI

There is no established, accurate referent standard diagnostic test for PJI. Certain tagged white cell scans are the most accurate imaging studies for PJI (Table 1; eTable 1 in Supplement 2); however, given the limitations of individual tests, published algorithms are sometimes recommended to establish the diagnosis. Data are limited and inadequate to compare the relative accuracies of competing algorithms. Practically, the diagnosis is typically made from a combination of history, physical examination, imaging studies to assess alternate causes of pain and instability, inflammatory markers, synovial fluid analysis, and/or operative specimens. Molecular diagnostic testing is a promising approach, but data are mixed and inadequate to recommend for or against its use as of 2022.

Question 2: What Is the Appropriate Management for Osteomyelitis Underlying a Pressure Ulcer?

Clinical Review (Insufficient Quality of Evidence to Enable a Clear Recommendation)

Observational studies indicate that imaging and inflammatory biomarkers are not diagnostically accurate for osteomyelitis underlying a pressure ulcer and we do not recommend their routine use for this purpose. Antibiotics have not been shown to be of benefit (and may be of harm) in the absence of surgical wound closure, but osteomyelitis may increase the risk of surgical flap failure. Therefore, it may be preferable to avoid the routine use of antibiotic therapy for osteomyelitis underlying a pressure ulcer unless deep bone biopsy confirms osteomyelitis and surgical wound closure is planned, or the patient has accompanying sepsis syndrome or local soft tissue infection. Irrespective of antibiotic use, a multimodal therapeutic approach includes nutritional optimization, wound debridement and care, pressure off-loading, and psychosocial management.

Question 3: When Should Empirical Therapy Be Administered in the Treatment of Osteomyelitis?

Clinical Review (Insufficient Quality of Evidence to Enable a Clear Recommendation)

Some observational studies suggest that administration of antibiotics prior to bone biopsy or surgical management may modestly decrease yield of bone cultures for patients with osteomyelitis, including DFO and PJI. Thus, presuming other microbiological methods (eg, blood cultures) have not already established a microbial etiology, it is reasonable to consider deferring antimicrobial therapy initiation until bone and/or joint microbiological samples are obtained for clinically stable patients. However, other studies are not concordant, and histopathology results are unlikely to be affected by prior short-term antibiotics. Decisions regarding the delay of empirical therapy therefore balance potential harm due to the risk of progression of life-threatening infection (eg, sepsis) or impending spinal cord compression against the potential benefit of microbiological data.

Question 4: Are There Preferred Antibiotics With Which to Treat Osteomyelitis?

### Magnetic resonance imaging of nontraumatic musculoskeletal emergencies [^115vzxix]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Many pathologies of the musculoskeletal system involve nontraumatic causes. MR imaging is used in the diagnosis because of its high sensitivity and specificity compared with other modalities. Osteomyelitis, osteonecrosis of the femoral head, and stress fractures are pathologies of bone where early diagnosis and intervention usually lead to an improved outcome. Joint aspiration and culture is the standard for diagnosing septic arthritis. MR imaging can support the diagnosis and allows evaluation for adjacent abscess and osteomyelitis. Early in the disease process, necrotizing fasciitis may not be clinically suspected and imaging may provide the first indication of the presence of this potentially deadly infection.

### Osteomyelitis: what you should know… [^116E1yQS]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

What is osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis is an infection in a bone. It is caused by bacteria that spread through the blood from a wound or infection somewhere else in the body. In children, it usually occurs in the arms and legs. In adults, it usually affects the feet, spine, or hips. People with diabetes or poor circulation are more likely to get osteomyelitis. What are the symptoms. Children usually have pain, swelling, and redness over the area that is infected. They also may have a fever or trouble moving the arm or leg, and they may be more tired than usual. In adults, the symptoms can be harder to pinpoint. They may have a fever or feel tired. There may be pain in the area over the bone, and wounds may take longer to heal. Symptoms can take up to six weeks to develop after the infection has started. How is it diagnosed. In children, osteomyelitis is usually diagnosed by the symptoms and a physical examination.

In adults, the diagnosis can be more difficult because the symptoms and examination are not always clear. Blood tests can show an infection in the body, but other tests, such as x-rays or magnetic resonance imaging, must also be done. The best way to tell if a patient has osteomyelitis is to remove a piece of damaged bone and test it for bacteria. How is it treated. The main treatment for children and adults is antibiotics. Antibiotics are usually given first through an IV to get high doses of the medicine into the blood. Later on, antibiotic pills may be used. Children usually need about four weeks of antibiotics. Adults need to take antibiotics for six to eight weeks. Sometimes surgery is needed to clean out the infected bone.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

PIDS/IDSA 2021 pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) — imaging studies: In children with suspected AHO, we recommend obtaining plain radiography of the potentially infected bone(s) rather than not performing plain radiographs (strong recommendation and moderate certainty of evidence). For children who require further imaging to confirm the diagnosis, we suggest magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) rather than scintigraphy (bone scan), computerized tomographic (CT) scan, or ultrasound (US) (conditional recommendation and very low certainty of evidence). If a child does not respond to medical therapy within 24 to 48 hours or signs and symptoms suggest a potential role for surgical debridement, MRI may be performed to better define the location and extent of infection or to evaluate for an alternative diagnosis such as malignancy.

### Computed tomography-guided percutaneous biopsy for vertebral osteomyelitis: a department's experience [^115UKjWy]. Neurosurgical Focus (2014). Low credibility.

Object

Vertebral osteomyelitis has been reported to occur in approximately 0.2–2 cases per 100,000 annually. Elevated laboratory values such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein suggest inflammatory etiologies. Different imaging modalities, from radiography and CT scanning to nuclear medicine imaging and contrastenhanced MRI, can be employed to evaluate for osteomyelitis. Although MRI has a strong sensitivity and specificity for vertebral osteomyelitis, obtaining histological and microbiological samples remains the gold standard in diagnosis. Therapy can be geared toward the specific pathogen cultured, thereby preventing the need surgical intervention in the majority of cases. However, recent reports have questioned the percentage yield of image-guided percutaneous biopsy even when there is a high clinical suspicion for vertebral osteomyelitis.

Methods

After obtaining institutional review board approval, the authors performed a chart review of patients who had undergone image-guided percutaneous bone biopsies at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio. Data were filtered for patients in whom a biopsy sample of a vertebral body/disc was obtained. A total of 213 procedures were performed, of which clinicians indicated a concern for infection in 84, infection or neoplasm in 13, and a noninfectious etiology (the majority being neoplasms) in the remaining 116.

Results

Histological examination provided positive results in 25 (41.0%) of the 61 samples collected for suspected cases of osteomyelitis. Microbiology samples were less predictive, with only 16 of the 84 samples collected, or 19.0%, yielding a positive result. In 10 patients there were positive blood and/or urine cultures. Of these, 8 samples (80%) demonstrated the same pathogen identified by biopsy (for the remaining 2 positive systemic cultures, no pathogen was identified by the percutaneous intervention). In other words, half of the 16 cases that provided microbiological results from biopsy demonstrated the same results by systemic cultures. However, 89 (76.7%) of the 116 samples collected with the primary concern of neoplasm yielded results.

Conclusions

Image-guided percutaneous biopsy for vertebral osteomyelitis demonstrates an extremely low probability of identifying specific microbes. Blood or urine cultures concurrently identified culprit pathogens in 50% of positive biopsy cultures. Therefore, in only 8 (9.5%) of 84 biopsies did the biopsy results provide additional information to clinicians as to the pathological microorganism present and how treatment might need to be adjusted.

### Dealing with chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis: a practical approach [^111Dkxex]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

CNO is a rare disorder and many considerations about diagnosis and treatment remain to be clarified. However, clinical features, the presence of multifocal lesions and radiologic features may help in diagnosis avoiding bone biopsy. NSAIDs remain the first treatment option, while bisphosphonates and TNF-alpha inhibitors could be considered the best second line treatment option. Even if CNO is often a benign disease, it can lead to severe and persistent complications.

### Childhood osteomyelitis-incidence and differentiation from other acute onset musculoskeletal features in a population-based study [^111AvRi9]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

A limitation of this study is that, due to the recruitment criteria, children with disease duration of more than six weeks and children with trauma may not have been included. We wanted to avoid including children with larger injuries or fractures. However, on admission patients with a history of trauma were not excluded. There are studies indicating that a history of trauma can precede osteomyelitis. As symptoms like back pain and refusal to sit were not among our recruitment criteria, we may not have identified all patients with vertebral osteomyelitis. Although all primary care physicians were repeatedly invited to participate in our study, we have no verification that our request was followed up in every case. In addition, few non-osteomyelitis patients underwent MRI and/or bone scans and/or had follow-up at six weeks and six months. However, the vast majority of patients who did not receive further diagnostic tests or follow-up either received a specific diagnosis or no longer showed symptoms after a few days. The clinical value of testing these patients would probably have been limited. A further limitation was that only 13 (35%) of 37 osteomyelitis patients underwent bone biopsies, which probably led to the low number of patients with a positive microbiological test. Twenty-four (65%) of the osteomyelitis patients were classified on the basis of clinical features and MRI. A poor interface between the normal and diseased bone marrow was found in acute osteomyelitis cases. This is known in the literature. Sensitivity of MRI in the diagnosis of osteomyelitis in adults and children is reported at 88% to 100%, with a specificity of 75% to 100%. Assets like fat suppression and contrast enhancement may not help to distinguish infectious from non-infectious inflammatory conditions on MRI. As trauma, acute infarction in sickle cell anemia, recent radiation therapy, osteoid osteoma and medullary tumors may all simulate the signal alterations seen with osteomyelitis, clinical and plain radiograph correlations are essential if MRI is being used for diagnostic purposes. All of our osteomyelitis patients diagnosed using MRI had a clinical history and plain radiographs that supported the diagnosis.

Osteomyelitis patients versus children with other acute onset musculoskeletal features

Figure 2 shows the ROC curves for ESR, CRP, WBC, neutrophils and platelet counts when used to discriminate between patients with and without osteomyelitis. ESR had the highest ROC AUC (.754; 95% CI.680–.828), followed by CRP (.638; 95% CI.545–731).

Figure 2
ROC curves of laboratory tests used during the first visit to discriminate between patients with osteomyelitis (n = 37) and patients without osteomyelitis (n = 392). The curves plot the relationship between the true positive rate (Sensitivity, y-axis) and the false positive rate (1 - Specificity, x-axis) at different cut-off titers. The higher the cut-off titer that is chosen, the lower the sensitivity and the higher the specificity, and visa versa. The diagonal reference line (area under curve (AUC) = .5), indicates no discrimination. The greater the distance of the curve from the diagonal, the higher the overall discriminative ability of the test.

Among the laboratory variables, ESR ≥ 40 mm/hr had the highest positive predictive value at 26% for identifying patients with osteomyelitis (Additional file 1). ESR < 20 mm/hr had the lowest positive predictive value at 3%.

Nineteen (51%) of the 37 osteomyelitis patients were girls. The median age at presentation was 4.3 years (Additional file 3). In addition to clinical signs and symptoms the diagnosis of osteomyelitis was based on bone biopsy and MRI in 11 patients (2 had a negative culture but were positive on histology), on MRI alone in 24 patients and on bone scan alone in 2 patients (MRI and/or bone biopsy not assessed). One of the patients received corticosteroids due to adrenocortical insufficiency, and another child had C2 immunodeficiency.

Patients with osteomyelitis had a longer history of symptoms than patients with septic arthritis or skin infection or non-septic arthritis (p < .001, p = .001). The period between the first physician visit and the first hospital visit was longer for patients with osteomyelitis than for patients with septic arthritis or skin infection or non-septic arthritis (p < .001, p = .001). ESR and CRP were higher in patients with osteomyelitis than in patients with non-septic arthritis or patients with other conditions (p < .001). The presenting symptom, clinical examination and bone involvement in the osteomyelitis patients are presented in Additional file 4.

### Advanced imaging for detection of foci of infection in Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia-can a scan save lives? [^116EjVxp]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The use of single-site 18 F-FDG-PET/MRI in localized bone and joint infection has been explored when there is a clear focus suspected, and has multiple advantages compared to 18 F-FDG-PET/CT, including high-resolution soft tissue information. Henkelmann et al.performed 18 F-FDG-PET/MRI for the detection of periprosthetic joint infections in 13 prostheses, finding the scan correctly identified every infection (sensitivity 100%, specificity 100%) when compared to the reference standard of surgical or biopsy specimens. This ability was limited to soft tissue identification, and was hampered by difficulty identifying infection within periprosthetic bone due to artefact from the prostheses. A retrospective study by Hulsen et al.performed single-site 18 F-FDG-PET/MRI imaging in 36 patients with chronic osteomyelitis, and calculated a sensitivity of 78%, specificity of 100%, and accuracy of 86% sensitivity of 18 F-FDG-PET/MRI, compared to the "ground truth" (clinical assessment by the orthopedic surgeon that is, based on subsequent intraoperative microbiology or long-term follow-up). 18 F-FDG-PET/MRI could also overcome some of the challenges of native valve endocarditis diagnosis- we note the small registered study in Edinburgh assessing hybrid 18 F-FDG-PET/MRI vs 18 F-FDG-PET/CT in suspected native and prosthetic valve endocarditis and NVE and await the results with interest (NCT03626571).

The limitations of 18 F-FDG-PET/MRI revolve around the usual limitations of MRI, some of which are pertinent in the detection of SAB: the scan takes approximately one hour to perform and the coils required for MRI can be uncomfortable for those with bone and joint infection, and there is limited resolution around metal prostheses due to artefact, particularly limiting in the setting of suspected prosthetic valve endocarditis or orthopedic prosthetic infection. The single greatest limitation of the fact that very few centers have access to hybrid PET/MRI scanners. To overcome this, MRI could be performed immediately following a 18 F-FDG-PET/CT (as a 18 F-FDG-PET/CT plus single-site MRI). However, studies that tried to combine the investigations in SAB found challenges due to the timings required with 25% of patients receiving both MRI and PET/CT on the same day, 56% within 24 hours, and 19% in 24–48 hours.

### Bone reporting and data system on MRI (bone-RADS-MRI): a validation study by four readers on 275 cases from three local and two public databases [^113MAFd4]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the reproducibility and effectiveness of the Bone Reporting and Data System on MRI (Bone‐RADS-MRI) for incidental solitary bone lesions in adults.

Materials and methods

We retrospectively included 275 MRI cases from three local and two public databases, respectively. All the cases were histopathologically or clinically confirmed bone lesions, or "do not touch" lesions with typical appearance and remained stable for at least two years. Each lesion with gender, age, and clinical history was categorized according to the Bone-RADS algorithm by two musculoskeletal radiologists and two non-musculoskeletal radiologists. The Bone-RADS categories were as follows: Bone-RADS-1, likely benign, leave alone; Bone-RADS-2, incompletely assessed on imaging, perform different imaging modality; Bone-RADS-3, intermediate, perform follow-up imaging; Bone-RADS-4, suspicious for malignancy or need for treatment, biopsy and/or oncologic referral. Inter-reader agreement was evaluated. The diagnostic performance of the Bone-RADS-MRI was measured for distinguishing intermediate or malignant lesions or osteomyelitis from benign lesions. The histopathology results, clinical diagnosis, or follow-up were used as a standard reference.

Results

There were 165 intermediate or malignant lesions or osteomyelitis, and 110 benign lesions, respectively. The inter-reader agreements between two musculoskeletal and between two non-musculoskeletal radiologists were both moderate (weighted kappa 0.572 and 0.520). The diagnostic performance for identifying intermediate or malignant lesions or osteomyelitis ranged according to radiologists with sensitivities of 88.5% to 94.5%, specificities of 55.5% to 74.5%, and accuracies of 76.4% to 82.9%.

Conclusion

Bone-RADS-MRI is effective for identifying bone lesions that need further treatment, but it has only moderate reliability for readers with different specialties and experience.

Critical relevance statement

With local and public databases, Bone-RADS-MRI has been demonstrated to be a reliable algorithm for musculoskeletal and non-musculoskeletal radiologists with varying experience and an effective tool for identifying incidental solitary bone lesions that "need treatment" in adults.

Key Points

Bone-RADS-MRI needs clinical validation for inter-reader agreement and diagnostic performance.
Bone-RADS-MRI achieved moderate agreements between musculoskeletal and non-musculoskeletal radiologists, respectively.
Bone-RADS-MRI presented high sensitivities but low specificities for identifying "need-for-treatment" bone lesions.

### How to synthesize evidence for imaging guidelines [^117TA7gR]. Clinical Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Aim

To provide guidance on how to gather and evaluate evidence from the literature on the efficacy of imaging, using as an example the assessment of the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of osteomyelitis. This method was adopted for evaluating evidence for the musculoskeletal section of the 5th edition of the Royal College of Radiologists' (RCR) guidelines.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review of the literature published between 1966 and July 2001 was carried out. Eligible articles described studies in patients with suspected osteomyelitis and who were diagnosed using MRI. Search strategies were developed to identify relevant imaging studies. Studies included in the systematic review were selected using predefined criteria. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and likelihood ratios for MRI reported in the studies were used to evaluate the value of the procedure in osteomyelitis. Where the above were not reported, they were calculated by the reviewers.

Results

The average sensitivity of MRI in osteomyelitis was 91% (range 76–100%), the average specificity was 82% (range 65–96%), average accuracy was 88% (range 71–97%), and the average positive likelihood ratio was 7.8 (range 2.3–21.1). Four studies evaluated the use of MRI in the diagnosis of osteomyelitis in the diabetic foot, two in osteomyelitis of the lower extremities, while four each evaluated the use of MRI in vertebral osteomyelitis, in the diagnosis of any form of osteomyelitis, osteomyelitis in spinal cord-injured patients and in cranial osteomyelitis.

Conclusion

Systematic reviews of literature can be used to obtain evidence on the value of imaging procedures. The quality of the studies included in the review should always be considered when selecting studies to limit bias. In our example, MRI appears sensitive, specific and accurate in the diagnosis of osteomyelitis at different sites.

### PET / MRI in infectious and inflammatory diseases: will it be a useful improvement? [^1114dVcc]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Diabetic foot infection

Foot infections are one of the most common and severe complications of diabetes mellitus. Detection, however, can be difficult. On clinical examination it is difficult to differentiate between soft-tissue infection and osteomyelitis. Infection parameters in the blood (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein) are not specific. Bone biopsy is not always performed because it is an invasive procedure that loses its reliability if the biopsy fragments are contaminated by cutaneous bacteria. Therefore, imaging is crucial in diagnosing and evaluating diabetic foot infections. Plain radiography and CT are routinely used, but are not accurate enough. MRI is able to differentiate between osteomyelitis and soft-tissue infection, but the specificity is reduced if bony destruction, dislocation, marrow oedema, synovial effusion and loss of bone and joint limits are present (which are characteristic of neuropathic Charcot's joints) as well as osteomyelitis.

Nuclear medicine techniques play an important role in the diagnosis of diabetic foot infections. White blood cell scintigraphy with either 99m Tc-exametazime (HMPAO) or 111 In-oxine is currently the gold standard radionuclide technique for the diagnosis of osteomyelitis. The labelling method is well described in several guidelines. Another possibility is the use of 18 F-FDG, but routine FDG PET protocols cannot reliably distinguish infection from inflammation. No acquisition protocols for FDG PET in the diabetic foot have yet been validated and only a few studies comparing FDG PET and white blood cell scintigraphy are available.

Combining MRI and nuclear medicine imaging may help improve the accuracy in diagnosing diabetic foot infections. The sensitivity of MRI alone or FDG PET alone is not high enough, but as for PET/CT, we think combined imaging improves sensitivity as well as specificity.

Therefore, in comparison with PET or MRI alone, hybrid PET/MRI imaging could:
Improve accuracy in the diagnosis of diabetic foot infection

### Chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis: the role of whole-body MRI [^111tVYAm]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Therefore, it is important for radiologists to recognize the imaging characteristics of bone lesions in CNO and promptly suggest whole-body MRI in suspected cases, which may lead to a reduction in the time between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis. In the past, 99 m-technetium bone scintigraphy was used, but should be considered obsolete and only be used if WB-MRI is unavailable.

Most recently, some authors have suggested that biopsy could be avoided when there are characteristic findings, such as suggestive clinical data and multiple bone lesions at typical sites (clavicle, metaphysis of long bones, vertebral body) with normal laboratory test results and no constitutional symptoms. Therefore, bone biopsy is reserved for cases where the clinical or radiological findings are inconclusive or multifocality is not revealed (Fig. 5).

Imaging findings

The imaging aspects of CNO include multiple bone lesions, mainly affecting the metaphyses of long bones, clavicle, vertebrae and mandible. Symmetric involvement is common and multifocality is virtually always present. In 30% of cases, CNO involves the adjacent joint with the presence of synovial thickening and/or damage to the articular cartilage.

CNO is the most common non-neoplastic process involving the clavicle in children and adolescents, and clavicular involvement was noted in 38% of patients with CNO.

These lesions typically involve the medial third of the clavicle with periosteal reaction, hyperostosis and soft tissue signal abnormality (Fig. 6). Clavicle is an atypical location for bacterial osteomyelitis and such as the diagnosis of CNO should be considered in the differential diagnosis of expansive lesions affecting the medial third of the clavicle in this age group (Fig. 7).

Regarding specific circumstances for nonvertebral osteomyelitis, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetic foot osteomyelitis, tagged WBC and bone scans, IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining WBC or anti-granulocyte scintigraphy, preferably combined with a bone scan, to evaluate for diabetic foot osteomyelitis if MRI is unavailable or contraindicated.

Regarding specific circumstances for nonvertebral osteomyelitis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (follow-up), IDSA/PIDS 2021 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining end-of-therapy imaging studies (plain radiographs and/or MRI) in patients with complicated acute hematogenous osteomyelitis or with the involvement of the physis.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Bone scintigraphy and other nuclear medicine imaging in pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis — historical use, limitations, and selected roles — has been commonly used and was the preferred advanced modality prior to the early 2000s, but positive scans can reflect noninfectious conditions and may require confirmatory MRI; scans can be falsely negative in the first 48 hours or with large subperiosteal abscesses, sedation is not routinely required and radiation doses are low, and current utility is mainly for nonlocalizable or potentially multifocal presentations; gallium/indium approaches involve higher radiation, a 24‑hour wait, and for indium require 20–40 mL of patient blood, with use reserved for highly selected uncommon circumstances with expert consultation.

Regarding specific circumstances for nonvertebral osteomyelitis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (follow-up), IDSA/PIDS 2021 guidelines recommend to do not obtain end-of-therapy MRI
and avoid obtaining routine end-of-therapy plain radiographs in patients with uncomplicated acute hematogenous osteomyelitis not involving the physis.

### Optimizing advanced imaging of the pediatric patient in the emergency department: technical report [^114BS79Z]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Acute osteomyelitis in children — advanced imaging in the emergency department emphasizes modality roles and timing. Use of contrast "may be useful in young children and infants… and markedly improves detection of cartilaginous infections in children younger than 6 years". Computed tomography (CT) "is usually not appropriate for the diagnosis of acute osteomyelitis" compared with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), though "CT with intravenous contrast can be valuable for depiction of abscess and guided procedures". Cross-sectional imaging is "typically needed" for definitive diagnosis but "is not necessary… in the ED setting", and is "best performed at the institution where definitive care will be delivered unless negative imaging would allow for discharge from the ED". Ultrasonography can identify soft-tissue and periosteal complications but "is unable to depict marrow abnormality" and is used as an adjunct to MRI for suspected acute osteomyelitis.

### Childhood osteomyelitis: imaging characteristics [^115FNBuf]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Osteomyelitis in childhood can be a challenging diagnosis. Imaging plays a vital role in the diagnosis of childhood osteomyelitis, and the imaging findings are pivotal in the treatment decision. As in all clinical cases the most important aspect of the diagnosis of childhood osteomyelitis lies in good cooperation among the paediatrician, paediatric orthopaedic surgeon and paediatric radiologist.

### Diagnosis and triage of a patient with an extra-osseous fat fluid level [^111ocSUU]. Emergency Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Extra-osseous fat fluid level is rarely seen in osteomyelitis, with only three magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cases previously reported in the literature. The rarity of this finding is probably secondary to the extensive necrosis of bone marrow that needs to occur at a rapid phase for the fat to accumulate. However, an extra-osseous fat fluid level is a specific diagnostic sign of osteomyelitis in cases with otherwise equivocal imaging findings and should be reported as such, especially when associated with medullary bone destruction and in the absence of trauma.

### Don't routinely use MRI to diagnose bone infection… [^1133s9pj]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

When the diagnosis of osteomyelitis can be reliably established by clinical means and/or serial plain film radiographs, MRI is generally unnecessary. Furthermore, MRI is particularly poor at differentiating osteomyelitis from benign postoperative marrow edema and from marrow edema due to Charcot arthropathy. Use of MRI in these instances can lead to a false positive interpretation and potentially harmful overtreatment.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2023 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute bacterial arthritis in pediatrics [^111ELAHM]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for suspected acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) with concern for adjacent infection — In children with suspected ABA requiring further imaging to assess extent of inflammation and infection, including adjacent osteomyelitis and pyomyositis, the guideline states "we suggest performing a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study rather than other imaging modalities (eg, computerized tomography (CT) or bone scintigraphy) (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence)". Children at higher risk for adjacent osteomyelitis are described as having "more than 3 or 4 days of symptoms prior to presentation, S. aureus infection, and marked elevation of CRP", though "these risk factors require further validation". The page adds that MRI "may provide anatomic detail needed to define the extent of infection in and around the infected joint including identification of adjacent osteomyelitis and soft tissue abscesses".
