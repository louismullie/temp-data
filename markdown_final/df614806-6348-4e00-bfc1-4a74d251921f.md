## Question

does response to biologics for psoriatic arthritis vary regarding skin and joint disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether biologic therapies for psoriatic arthritis yield different magnitudes of response in skin versus joints. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biological plausibility for discordant tissue responses. Then, I should verify guideline positions that implicitly or explicitly acknowledge domain-specific efficacy. Next, I will examine clinical and translational evidence showing discordant responses. After that, I will synthesize drug-class specific patterns. Finally, I need to translate these insights into practical, domain-directed management and monitoring recommendations while double-checking for exceptions and comorbidity constraints.

> Let me first confirm the conceptual frame: psoriatic disease spans multiple domains — skin, peripheral joints, axial skeleton, entheses, dactylitis — and responses often vary by domain, which already hints that uniform efficacy across tissues is not guaranteed. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify whether authoritative frameworks endorse domain-specific selection. GRAPPA explicitly recommends selecting therapy to address the active domains in an individual patient, acknowledging that no single agent uniformly dominates across all compartments, while contemporary reviews emphasize assessing both cutaneous and musculoskeletal outcomes independently in routine care [^116LW7xw] [^116xzPf5].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiologic rationale for discordance. The IL-23/Th17 axis is central in psoriatic disease, but evidence suggests it might be more influential in skin than in synovium, with comparatively stronger IL-17 signatures in skin and relatively stronger IL-6 pathways in synovium. I should double-check that: Lancet notes targeting IL-23–Th17 may be more effective for psoriasis than arthritis, and synovium-versus-skin transcriptional profiling shows robust IL-6 pathway expression in synovium and less robust joint responses to IL-12/23 blockade relative to skin outcomes, while a cytokine review highlights a more upregulated IL-17 signature in skin than synovium, supporting a biological basis for skin-dominant responses to IL-17/IL-23 inhibition [^1154KGNC] [^113Dh2aR] [^113mkSSn].

> Next, I should review guideline positions for implicit clinical corroboration. EULAR 2024 recommends preferring IL-17A, IL-17A/F, IL-23, or IL-12/23 inhibitors when clinically relevant skin involvement is present, which signals superior cutaneous activity of these pathways, whereas for clinically relevant axial disease, EULAR and BSR prioritize TNF inhibitors or IL-17 pathway inhibition over other mechanisms, reflecting different hierarchies by domain. GRAPPA's domain-focused schema and BSR's class prioritization similarly recognize that efficacy trade-offs exist and should guide selection domain-by-domain [^116Egi2u] [^115bCx3C] [^117Rj4ra] [^116LW7xw] [^117KrSeK].

> I will now examine the clinical evidence for discordant responses. Let me think about translational-clinical links: comparative profiling suggested IL-12/23 antagonists produce marked skin improvement but less robust joint responses, and there have been reports of arthritis flares despite good skin control with ustekinumab, aligning with the notion that joint drivers may diverge from skin drivers in some patients. Clinically, case reports describe patients requiring dual biologics to control discordant skin and joint disease, underscoring that discordance is not merely theoretical but observed at the bedside, although dual biologic therapy should be approached cautiously and is not standard practice [^113Dh2aR] [^116gkYNd].

> Hold on, I should verify class-by-class patterns before overgeneralizing. Anti-TNF agents historically provide balanced efficacy for joints and meaningful skin benefit, with real-world durability, while IL-17 inhibitors deliver excellent skin clearance and good joint responses, including with dual IL-17A/F inhibition, though skin PASI gains often outpace joint ACR responses. Initially, I was going to say IL-23 inhibitors underperform uniformly in joints; but wait, that would be an overstatement — IL-23 agents are effective for PsA joints, yet relative to their dramatic skin efficacy, joint responses can be more modest on average, which is why several guidelines position TNF or IL-17 earlier when joint disease predominates [^115s8ZEP] [^112HgbY2] [^114GkQt8] [^114hvywP] [^113Dh2aR].

> Let me consider management implications and sequencing. For skin-predominant disease with mild joints, I should confirm that guidelines allow favoring IL-17/IL-23 pathways to leverage superior cutaneous efficacy; for joint-predominant or axial phenotypes, I should verify that TNF inhibitors or IL-17 inhibitors are recommended earlier to optimize musculoskeletal outcomes. If a discordant response emerges — clear skin but persistent arthritis or vice versa — switching mechanism of action is reasonable; EULAR and BSR endorse switching strategies, including across or within classes depending on primary versus secondary inefficacy, guided by active domains and comorbidities. But wait, I need to ensure comorbidity constraints are respected; for example, avoid IL-17 inhibitors in active Crohn's disease, and tailor choices accordingly [^116Egi2u] [^115bCx3C] [^117KrSeK] [^115MPajy].

> I should also confirm treat-to-target and monitoring across domains. EULAR and BSR recommend aiming for remission or low disease activity with regular assessment and therapy adjustment; given domain heterogeneity, improvement in skin does not guarantee joint control and vice versa, so multidomain tools and patient-reported impact measures like PsAID-12 should be used to track both compartments independently and guide timely adjustments. Hold on, let me verify the measurement framework: OMERACT core domain sets and contemporary expert guidance reinforce multidomain assessment as standard, which aligns with the clinical need to detect discordance early and intervene [^1119bSpp] [^1116NsBj] [^113ngSPa] [^115pF41C].

> But wait, what about special scenarios and edge cases? In selected refractory cases with profound discordance despite multiple switches, there are reports of dual biologic therapy controlling both domains, though infection risk and limited evidence mean this should remain exceptional and specialist-driven after exhaustive monotherapy strategies. I need to ensure that standard pathways — optimize dosing within label, address adherence and comorbidities such as obesity and smoking, and switch mechanisms appropriately — are exhausted before considering off-label combinations [^116gkYNd] [^114hvywP] [^1141bnvb].

> In summary, I should reaffirm the bottom line. Yes, differential responses of skin and joints to the same biologic are biologically plausible, guideline-recognized, and clinically observed: IL-17/IL-23 pathway inhibitors often achieve superior skin clearance, whereas TNF inhibitors and IL-17 inhibitors provide more balanced or preferential joint control in many patients. Clinicians should assess domains independently, select therapy based on the dominant active domain and comorbidities, and switch mechanisms when discordance persists, all within a treat-to-target framework to avoid assuming that improvement in one compartment implies control in the other [^1154KGNC] [^116Egi2u] [^116LW7xw] [^115bCx3C] [^116xzPf5].

Yes, responses to biologic therapy in psoriatic arthritis differ between skin and joint disease: **IL-17/IL-23 inhibitors are superior for skin**, whereas **TNF inhibitors are preferred for joints**. IL-17/IL-23 agents achieve **higher PASI responses** but may be less effective for joint symptoms, while TNF inhibitors offer more balanced joint and skin control. IL-12/23 inhibitors are less effective for joints, and JAK inhibitors are typically reserved for refractory cases. Treatment should be **individualized by domain activity**, comorbidities, and patient preference, with **switching or combination strategies** considered for discordant responses [^116Egi2u] [^114hvywP] [^115bCx3C] [^114BF52N].

## Differential efficacy of biologic classes

| **Class** | **Joint efficacy** | **Skin efficacy** | **Axial disease** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) | TNFi (adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, certolizumab, golimumab) are highly effective for peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, and dactylitis, with robust ACR20/50/70 and radiographic inhibition [^1123yynN] [^114U7Jkd] | Improve psoriasis, but IL-17/IL-23 inhibitors achieve higher PASI75/90/100 [^113mkSSn] [^111htnyr] | Effective for axial PsA and are first-line for predominant axial involvement [^115bCx3C] |
| Interleukin-17 inhibitors (IL-17i) | Improve peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, and dactylitis, but joint responses may be slightly lower than TNFi [^113mkSSn] | Provide rapid, high PASI responses, often superior to TNFi [^113mkSSn] [^111htnyr] | Effective for axial PsA and are recommended for predominant axial involvement [^115bCx3C] |
| Interleukin-23 inhibitors (IL-23i) | Improve peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, and dactylitis, but joint responses may be lower than TNFi and IL-17i [^113mkSSn] | Achieve high PASI responses, often exceeding TNFi [^111htnyr] | Limited efficacy in axial PsA; not recommended for predominant axial disease |
| Interleukin-12/23 inhibitors (IL-12/23i) | Ustekinumab is less effective for joints than TNFi and IL-17i [^113mkSSn] | Ustekinumab improves psoriasis but is less effective than IL-17/IL-23 inhibitors [^113mkSSn] | Limited efficacy; not recommended for predominant axial disease |
| Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) | JAKi (tofacitinib, upadacitinib) improve peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, and dactylitis, and are options after inadequate response to biologics [^114BF52N] | Improve psoriasis but are generally less effective than IL-17/IL-23 inhibitors | Limited data; not first-line for axial PsA |

## Clinical evidence of differential responses

Clinical trials and real-world studies demonstrate **discordant responses** between skin and joints:

- **Etanercept**: PRESTA showed higher skin responses with 50 mg twice weekly vs once weekly, but similar joint responses [^1139x6yV].

- **IL-17/IL-23 inhibitors**: Superior skin efficacy but potentially lower joint efficacy than TNFi [^113mkSSn] [^111htnyr].

- **IL-12/23 inhibitors**: Less effective for joints than TNFi and IL-17i [^113mkSSn].

---

## Factors influencing differential responses

Several factors underlie these **differential responses**:

- **Disease phenotype**: Peripheral vs axial disease influences biologic choice and response [^1123yynN] [^115bCx3C].

- **Comorbidities**: IBD, uveitis, and cardiovascular disease affect selection and response [^114Erb5q].

- **Patient characteristics**: Age, sex, and disease duration impact response.

- **Genetic and molecular differences**: Distinct skin vs synovial pathways contribute to variability [^113Dh2aR].

---

## Clinical implications and treatment strategies

Given these differences, **individualized treatment** is essential:

- **Domain-driven therapy**: Select biologics by predominant domain (skin, peripheral, axial) [^1123yynN] [^115bCx3C].

- **Switching strategies**: Switch within or between classes for inadequate response [^113VbGVe].

- **Combination therapy**: Consider dual biologics or biologic plus csDMARD for refractory, discordant disease [^116gkYNd].

- **Treat-to-target**: Aim for remission or low disease activity with regular assessment and adjustment [^1119bSpp].

## Summary of biologic efficacy by disease domain

| **Biologic class** | **Peripheral arthritis** | **Axial disease** | **Skin disease** |
|-|-|-|-|
| TNF inhibitors | High efficacy | High efficacy | Moderate-high efficacy |
| IL-17 inhibitors | Moderate-high efficacy | High efficacy | High efficacy |
| IL-23 inhibitors | Moderate efficacy | Limited efficacy | High efficacy |
| IL-12/23 inhibitors | Moderate efficacy | Limited efficacy | Moderate-high efficacy |
| JAK inhibitors | Moderate-high efficacy | Limited data | Moderate efficacy |

---

Responses to biologics in PsA **vary by domain**, with IL-17/IL-23 inhibitors superior for skin and TNF inhibitors preferred for joints. Individualized, domain-driven therapy, with timely **switching or combination strategies**, is key to optimizing outcomes.

### Psoriasis: Immunopathogenesis and evolving immunomodulators and systemic therapies; U.S. experiences [^112eVFG8]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that presently lacks a permanent cure. Up to 40% of patients with psoriasis also develop psoriatic arthritis. The primary systemic treatment options include methotrexate, cyclosporin, and oral retinoids, all of which have significant potential for toxicity and necessitate close laboratory supervision. Although the exact mechanism of psoriasis remains unclear, the involvement of T-cell-mediated cytokine expression in the disease's etiology is becoming more apparent. The goal of modern treatment is to target these immune responses, which lead to the formation of psoriatic plaques and psoriatic arthritis, using selective immunomodulating pharmacotherapy. The advantages of these biological agents include a reduced systemic side-effect profile, which improves the quality of life for patients with psoriasis.

- **Objectives**: This review article describes emerging selective immunotherapies and systemic therapies for the treatment of psoriasis and will briefly discuss the disease's immunopathogenesis.

- **Methods**: Literature review.

- **Results and conclusions**: Given the role of inflammatory immune responses in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, the goal of modern medicine and pharmacotherapy lies in the design and use of specific targets in cell-mediated immune reactions and the modulation of the expression of various inflammatory cytokines. The clinical evidence of efficacy for some of these new biological immunomodulatory agents from several U.S.-based research studies and clinical experiences is convincing.

### Psoriatic arthritis [^113w8y9p]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2012). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic inflammatory arthropathy that affects approximately 6% to 48% of patients with psoriasis. Arthritis is not correlated with the extent of skin disease. Classic radiographic findings of the involved joint include erosion, ankylosis, and fluffy periostitis. Site-specific characteristic deformities, such as pencil-in-cup deformity of the phalanges, may also be present. The disease typically follows a moderate course, but up to 47% of cases develop into destructive arthritis, where the inflammatory process leads to bony erosion and loss of joint architecture.

The mainstay of treatment is biologic therapy (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors) in conjunction with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Patients with end-stage joint destruction may require surgery to alleviate pain and restore function. Orthopaedic surgeons should be cognizant of the risk factors (e.g. increased risk of cardiovascular disease) and potential complications (e.g. poor wound healing and increased risk of infection) associated with psoriatic arthritis.

### The pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis [^1154KGNC]. Lancet (2018). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic, immune-mediated, inflammatory arthropathy that presents with inflammation of the joints and entheses, including those of the axial skeleton, and is associated with increased mortality from cardiovascular disease. Diagnosis is primarily based on clinical phenotype due to the diversity of associated features, which can include skin and nail disease, dactylitis, uveitis, and osteitis. Improved understanding of the pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis has led to the development of effective biologics and small-molecular drugs targeting specific cytokines and signalling pathways, which can prevent disease progression and improve quality of life. However, at least 40% of patients with psoriatic arthritis have only a partial response or fail to respond to such treatments.

Cytokine inhibitors, mainly those specific for tumour necrosis factor and, more recently, the interleukin 23-T-helper-17 cell pathway, have been highly successful in the treatment of disease manifestations in several different tissues, although targeting the interleukin 23-T-helper-17 cell pathway might be more effective in psoriasis than in arthritis. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis — which include genetics, environmental factors, and immune-mediated inflammation — are complex, and the relationship between disease of the joint and that of other domains is poorly understood. Improving our understanding of psoriatic arthritis pathogenesis could help to establish validated biomarkers for diagnosis and predict therapeutic response.

### Risankizumab shows high efficacy and maintenance in improvement of response until week 52 [^114fMKw5]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

The presence of joint involvement in psoriatic arthritis (PSA) shares the same inflammatory pathways as the cutaneous form; however, the greater resistance to treatment and deeper systemic involvement suggest the role of further molecular and genetic factors, not yet well defined. The impact on the quality of life in PSA is often greater than its skin counterpart, and therapeutic options tend to lead to more modest results.

The high impact on the quality of life associated with PSA and involvement of difficult sites justifies the prescription of biologic drugs even in patients with a limited extent of disease, such as those with a low Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI).

The purpose of our study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of risankizumab, as well as possible prognostic factors like the use of previous biological therapies, obesity status, involvement of difficult sites, smoking habits, and joint involvement in a real-life setting.

### New therapies for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis [^116UMWXG]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Over the last several years, novel immunologic pathways pivotal in the development of the pathobiology of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) have been revealed. These discoveries have catalyzed a search for new treatment targets, resulting in many new therapies that are now available for patients with psoriatic disease.

- **Recent findings**: Helper T cells that secrete interleukin-17 (TH17), along with CD8+ cells, innate lymphocyte cells, and gamma delta T cells, are important in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and PsA. Recently, agents that target interleukin-17, the interleukin-17 receptor, and interleukin-23 (antip19) have been approved or are in clinical trials. Apremilast, a new oral agent, was approved for the treatment of psoriasis and PsA.

- **Summary**: Secukinumab, an interleukin-17A antibody, has been approved for treatment of psoriasis and PsA in the United States. It is effective with a good safety profile. Ixekizumab, another anti-interleukin-17A antibody, is currently in clinical trials, and brodalumab, an interleukin-17 receptor antagonist, was removed from clinical trials because of safety concerns despite demonstrated efficacy in psoriasis and PsA. Targeting interleukin-23 with antibodies to p19 is another approach with encouraging results in psoriasis. Apremilast, an oral agent approved to treat psoriasis and PsA, demonstrates moderate efficacy with an excellent safety record. The role of tofacitinib in psoriatic disease remains to be determined pending a safety review in psoriasis and the completion of PsA trials.

### Outcome measures in psoriatic arthritis [^113JCyRi]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Recent advances in biologic therapies have provided hope for patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). However, studies have been hampered by the lack of acceptable and validated outcome measures. This article reviews outcome measures used in the assessment of both skin and joints in PsA, and provides a summary of the Psoriatic Arthritis Workshop during OMERACT 7. A set of domains to be included in the assessment of patients with PsA was derived, and a research agenda was developed.

### Psoriatic arthritis: current therapy and future approaches [^114D2Kov]. Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a systemic inflammatory condition that affects 20–30% of patients with psoriasis. It is characterized by potential involvement of diverse tissues, including peripheral and axial joints, enthesitis, dactylitis, and skin and nail disease. The degree of involvement in each domain can vary over time in individual patients and can differ substantially between PsA patients. The clinical heterogeneity, along with the varying extent of severity and activity, can pose significant challenges to treatment. Although some studies had suggested immunopathophysiological similarities between PsA and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), more recently, important distinctions have been defined. Similarly, although some immunomodulatory therapies have proved effective for both PsA and RA, recent data suggests distinct responses to certain targeted therapies. Herein, DMARDs and biologic agents, as well as the potential role of emerging therapeutics, will be reviewed.

### Pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis [^111FXSDS]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis, which is more common and severe than initially appreciated. The success of biologic agents in treating psoriatic arthritis has sparked great interest in this disorder, even though the disease pathogenesis is poorly understood. This review focuses on recent advances in the genetic factors and immune pathways that have been implicated in susceptibility to the disease. Additionally, it discusses recent studies examining the mechanisms underlying angiogenesis, enthesitis, and bone resorption in psoriatic arthritis.

Studies performed on several different populations indicate that the MHC class I allele Cw6 is associated with both early-onset psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Mutations in the caspase-activating recruitment domain 15 locus on chromosome 16 are also associated with psoriatic arthritis, supporting a model involving innate immune mechanisms. Evidence for a CD8 antigen-driven acquired immune response in psoriatic synovium and blood has been reported. The finding of elevated levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoietin 2 in psoriatic arthritis synovial vasculature may provide insights into events responsible for the tortuous vessel morphology, a histologic feature characteristic of psoriatic joints. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is a critical factor mediating inflammation in the synovium, enthesis, and bone. In particular, osteoclasts resorb bone via a receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB-receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand.

### A cross-sectional questionnaire survey involving physicians for the clarification of the diagnosis and current status of therapeutic intervention of psoriatic arthritis in Japan [^112u6kBL]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is characterized by various clinical symptoms, including skin psoriasis, peripheral arthritis in the distal interphalangeal joints, and joint symptoms of axillary arthritis similar to sacroiliac arthritis. Additionally, nail psoriasis, enthesitis, and dactylitis are seen in approximately 60%, 30%, and 25% of patients, respectively. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment of PsA are important and should be based on a comprehensive assessment that includes a physical examination, a visual examination of the skin and nails, an interview, a blood test, and an imaging test. The prevalence of PsA in Japan has increased in recent years as a result of the westernization of dietary habits, widespread public awareness of the disease, and improvements in diagnostic methods. PsA in Japan accounts for 1.9%, 14.3%, and 15.3% of all psoriasis cases according to the health insurance claims database of the Japan Medical Data Center, a report from rheumatologists, and a report from dermatologists, respectively.

PsA has a wide range of clinical symptoms, making its diagnosis difficult. Dermatologists often examine skin psoriasis owing to their expertise, whereas patients with joint symptoms are more likely to consult orthopedists and/or rheumatologists. The stance on PsA screening might differ between dermatology clinics and hospitals depending on the circumstances of the facilities. Therefore, collaboration among different clinical departments becomes important, especially because cutaneous lesions appear before other symptoms in most patients with PsA.

Regarding the medical management of psoriatic arthritis, specifically concerning biologic DMARDs, the BSR 2022 guidelines suggest considering the selection of TNF inhibitors, IL-17 inhibitors, or upadacitinib before IL-12/23 inhibitors. Similarly, IL-23 inhibitors are recommended ahead of PDE4 inhibitors, which in turn are preferable to CTLA-4 immunoglobulin when initiating biologic DMARDs.

### Dose reduction and discontinuation of biologic and targeted synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for people with psoriatic arthritis in remission or low disease activity [^114hstrT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

We will follow the guidelines in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, Chapters 14 and 15, for interpreting results, being mindful of distinguishing a lack of evidence of effect from a lack of effect. Our conclusions will be based strictly on findings from the quantitative or narrative synthesis of included studies for this review. We will avoid making recommendations for practice; instead, our implications for research will suggest priorities for future research and address the remaining uncertainties in the field.

Two summary of findings tables will be created:

- **Dose reduction of biologic DMARDs or targeted synthetic DMARDs compared with continuation of biologic DMARDs or targeted synthetic DMARDs**:
	- Proportion of participants with remission
	- Proportion of participants with flare or relapse
	- Proportion of participants with low disease activity
	- Proportion of participants with radiographic progression
	- Mean disease activity score
	- Proportion of participant withdrawals due to adverse events
	- Proportion of participants with serious adverse events

- **Discontinuation of biologic DMARDs or targeted synthetic DMARDs compared with continuation of biologic DMARDs or targeted synthetic DMARDs**:
	- Proportion of participants with remission
	- Proportion of participants with flare or relapse
	- Proportion of participants with low disease activity
	- Proportion of participants with radiographic progression
	- Mean disease activity score
	- Proportion of participant withdrawals due to adverse events
	- Proportion of participants with serious adverse events

Two review authors (SW, RJ) will independently assess the certainty of the evidence, resolving any disagreements by discussion or involving another author (RB) as necessary. We will use the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, impre).

### Cross-sectional multicenter observational study of psoriatic arthritis in Japanese patients: Relationship between skin and joint symptoms and results of treatment with tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors [^11649FEE]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory arthritis with as yet unclear pathophysiology. This retrospective, multicenter, cross-sectional study was conducted in 19 facilities in western Japan and aimed to identify patients' characteristics and factors that affect the results of treatment with biologic agents. Of 2,116 patients with psoriasis, 285 (13.5%) had PsA. Skin manifestations preceded joint manifestations in 69.8%; the onset was simultaneous in 17.2%, whereas PsA preceded skin manifestations in 2.5%. Peripheral arthritis was most common, occurring in 73.7%, compared with axial disease in 21.8%, enthesitis in 23.5%, and dactylitis in 35.4%.

Patients with severe skin manifestations were significantly younger at onset (P = 0.02) and more frequently had axial disease (P < 0.01). Biologic agents were used in 206 patients (72.3%), with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α antibodies being prescribed first to 157 of them. Anti-TNF-α antibodies were continued by 105 participants and discontinued by 47, with the remaining five patients being lost to follow-up. Patients who discontinued anti-TNF-α antibodies were significantly older than those who continued (55 vs. 51 years, P = 0.04) and significantly older at onset of joint manifestations (50 vs. 44 years, P = 0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed that patients over 50 years terminated anti-TNF-α antibodies significantly more frequently (P < 0.01).

In conclusion, patients with PsA and severe skin manifestations have earlier onset and axial disease, which seriously impacts quality of life. Anti-TNF-α antibodies were generally effective.

### Treatment of psoriatic arthritis and recalcitrant skin disease with combination therapy [^111oPoTH]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) are chronic inflammatory disorders. Efalizumab targets several T-cell interactions central to psoriasis immunopathogenesis. Etanercept and infliximab are antitumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents that modify the inflammatory and cell-mediated immune responses involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and PsA. All three agents are approved for the treatment of plaque psoriasis, and etanercept and infliximab are also approved for the treatment of PsA.

Twenty patients with psoriasis and PsA have been successfully treated with a combination of efalizumab (1 mg/kg/wk) and etanercept (25 mg or 50 mg/wk) or infliximab (5 to 6 mg/kg). At the time of writing, no serious adverse events have been reported. Combination therapy was well tolerated and effectively controlled both skin disease and arthritis. The complementary activity of efalizumab with an anti-TNF agent is most likely attributable to their differing mechanisms of action. Further investigation is warranted.

Regarding specific circumstances for psoriatic arthritis, particularly for patients with extra-articular manifestations, the BSR 2022 guidelines recommend offering a multidisciplinary and multispecialty approach. This includes timely discussions before systemic treatment changes in patients with associated conditions such as psoriasis, uveitis, and/or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Clinicians should be aware of other licensed indications and options for differential dosing of common medications in different indications to optimize doses for each individual.

### Psoriatic arthritis treatment: biological response modifiers [^115s8ZEP]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in the treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders due to the development and application of targeted biological therapies. The elucidation of the overlapping cellular and cytokine immunopathology of diverse conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn's disease, and psoriasis identifies specific targets for bioengineered proteins or small molecules. Similar to clinical trials in RA, trials in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) have shown excellent clinical results with the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab across various domains, including joints, quality of life, function, and radiological evidence of slowing disease progression.

Additionally, these agents have demonstrated benefits in domains more unique to PsA, such as psoriasis skin lesions, enthesitis, and dactylitis, highlighting the similar pathogenesis in the skin, tendons, and synovial membrane. This therapy has been generally safe and well-tolerated in clinical trials of PsA. Other logical candidates for targeted therapy in development include additional anti-TNF agents, costimulatory blockade agents that affect T-cell function, blockers of other cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, 6, 12, 15, or 18, and B-cell modulatory medicines. Furthermore, it will be useful to explore the effects of combining traditional disease-modifying drugs with newer biologicals.

### Advances in the management of psoriatic arthritis in adults [^116xzPf5]. BMJ (2024). High credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory arthritis that affects approximately 30% of patients with psoriasis. The disease spectrum includes peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, tenosynovitis, dactylitis, axial involvement, and skin and nail psoriasis in most patients. In addition to the cutaneous and musculoskeletal manifestations, several comorbidities can complicate the disease course, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, gout, anxiety, and depression.

The management of patients with psoriatic arthritis begins with a careful assessment of the skin and joints and the screening for comorbidities. This review describes the assessment tools and outcome measures used in the evaluation of patients with psoriatic arthritis. It summarizes the approach to therapy, including non-medicinal interventions such as education, lifestyle changes, physiotherapy, and occupational therapy.

Furthermore, it discusses the evidence on pharmacologic treatments, including drugs used for symptomatic relief such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and those used to control the disease process. This last group comprises conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), including methotrexate, leflunomide, and sulfasalazine, and biologic and targeted DMARDs, including anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNFα), anti-interleukin-17 (IL-17), anti-IL-12/23, and anti-IL-23 agents, as well as Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) antagonists. Although these drugs are usually tailored to the clinical profile of the patient, biomarkers predictive of response to treatments are still under investigation.

### Differential efficacy of biologic treatments targeting the TNF-α/IL-23/IL-17 axis in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis [^113mkSSn]. Cytokine (2018). Low credibility.

Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis cause significant physical and psychological burdens for afflicted individuals. An accelerated TNF-α/IL-23/IL-17 axis is their major pathomechanism. Therefore, anti-TNF-α/IL-23/IL-17 biologics are very effective for the treatment of skin and joint lesions in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Given that the IL-17 signature is more upregulated in the skin than in the synovium in psoriatic arthritis, anti-IL-23/IL-17 agents seem to be superior to anti-TNF-α remedies in the treatment of skin lesions. In this review, we focus on the differential efficacy of anti-TNF-α/IL-23/IL-17 biologics in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.

### Integrating imaging and biomarker assessment to better define psoriatic arthritis and predict response to biologic therapy [^113VNJvL]. Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Randomized controlled trials identified several biomarkers, including adiponectin and factor VII, which appeared to predict response in both skin and joint scores following golimumab therapy. Several potential biomarkers were strongly associated with ACR20 and/or DAS28 score response and are referenced in Table 3. MMP-3 baseline results did not correlate with either skin or joint outcomes. The correlation between inflammatory markers and joint scores, especially the DAS-28 count, which includes CRP or ESR, is not surprising. Certain proteins like VEGF, MMP-3, and ICAM-1 have also been identified as potential biomarkers in TNFi studies looking at RA. We do not want to develop a panel that only identifies one presentation of PsA, namely a polyarthritis presentation similar to RA. The focus should be on assessing those on biologic treatment and complementing the more detailed data from imaging with proteomic analysis. Additionally, synergism between predictive proteome work in PsA and PsO will be vital. The ever-expanding capabilities from omic technology, including metabolomics and the subcategory of lipidomics, are also exciting areas of discovery.

### Psoriatic arthritis: A comprehensive review for the dermatologist part I: Epidemiology, comorbidities, pathogenesis, and diagnosis [^114f7ARc]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory seronegative arthritis strongly associated with psoriasis. Recognition of the clinical features of PsA is critical, as delayed detection and untreated disease may result in irreparable joint damage, impaired physical function, and a significantly reduced quality of life. Dermatologists are poised for the early detection of PsA, as psoriasis predates its development in as many as 80% of patients. In an effort to further acquaint dermatologists with PsA, this review provides a detailed overview, emphasizing its epidemiology, comorbidities, etiopathogenesis, and diagnostic features.

### The state of the art-psoriatic arthritis outcome assessment in clinical trials and daily practice [^113ngSPa]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2022). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis is a heterogeneous condition with substantial challenges in optimizing outcome measures for both clinical trials and daily practice. As with other inflammatory arthritides, there is no gold standard instrument for measuring disease activity or impact, both of which are key to evaluating therapeutic approaches in trials and monitoring disease in daily practice. A wide range of domains have been highlighted in the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) core domain set for psoriatic arthritis, reflecting the disease involvement in multiple tissues (joints, tendons, skin, and spine) and the heterogeneous impact of the disease on individuals. This review summarizes the evidence around outcome measure selection, considering factors such as unidimensional versus multidimensional outcomes, continuous versus binary measures, and the feasibility of these approaches in trials compared with clinical practice.

### Interleukin (IL)-17 versus IL-23 inhibitors: Which is better to treat patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis and mild psoriatic arthritis in dermatology clinics [^111GuK9n]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-23 inhibitors are both approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (PsO), as well as psoriatic arthritis (PsA). In the absence of head-to-head studies, it is not clear which agent is better suited to treat patients with moderate-to-severe PsO and mild PsA. During the 2022 Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) conference, Dr. April Armstrong and Dr. Joseph Merola debated which of these two biologic classes should be used in this patient population. Armstrong argued in favor of IL-17 inhibition, whereas Merola presented reasons for IL-23 inhibition. An overview of their main arguments is described in this manuscript.

### Treatment guidelines in psoriatic arthritis [^113ubGn7]. Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic, inflammatory, musculoskeletal disease associated with psoriasis. Up to 30% of patients with psoriasis may develop PsA over the course of their lifetime. Musculoskeletal manifestations of PsA include peripheral arthritis, spondylitis, dactylitis (inflammation of the whole digit), and enthesitis (inflammation where a tendon, ligament, or joint capsule inserts onto the bone). Skin manifestations of PsA include psoriasis, which has numerous phenotypes; the most common type associated with PsA is psoriasis vulgaris, or plaque psoriasis, and nail disease.

Beyond the musculoskeletal and skin features, patients with PsA experience fatigue, physical function limitations, and sleep disturbance, as well as diminished work capacity and social participation. In addition to the association with extra-articular manifestations such as uveitis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), PsA is associated with several comorbidities, including obesity and metabolic disease (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, fatty liver disease, cardiovascular outcomes), depression, and anxiety. All of these factors may play an important role in therapy selection.

Treatment for PsA includes traditional or conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), biologic therapies such as TNF inhibitors (TNFi), IL-17 inhibitors (IL-17i), IL-12/23 inhibitors (IL-12/23i), and new targeted oral agents, including a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor and a Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) inhibitor.

### Genetics of susceptibility and treatment response in psoriatic arthritis [^112Fk5Rt]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA), an inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis, exhibits a broad range of disease severity. The clinical heterogeneity in PsA likely reflects substantial genetic differences. In recent years, numerous genes contributing to the pathogenesis of psoriasis and PsA have been identified, especially in Western populations. Emerging evidence from functional studies of candidate genes identified by genome-wide association studies suggests an integrated, multi-tiered pathogenic model. This model comprises distinct signaling networks that impact skin barrier function, innate immune responses (involving NFκB and interferon signaling), and adaptive immune responses (involving CD8(+) T cells and type 17 T-helper-cell signaling).

Although several genes and their variants within these pathways have been associated with susceptibility to psoriasis and PsA, replication in large multiethnic cohorts, fine mapping, and resequencing efforts are warranted to better understand their role in disease susceptibility. Regarding pharmacogenetics, several candidate gene polymorphisms have been shown to influence responses to both traditional and biologic therapies in psoriasis and PsA. However, confirmation in large prospective cohorts is required before this information can be implemented in clinical settings.

### The many faces of psoriatic arthritis: Their genetic determinism [^113HHYtz]. Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

The best-designed, phase III randomized controlled trials in patients with PsA have been those conducted with biologic molecules and more recently with small molecules. It is of interest that despite the various cytokine and molecular pathways targeted, the response rates in terms of percentages reaching the primary outcome measure of an ACR 20% (ACR20) response remain at 40% do not respond. In addition, discordant responses are not uncommon with, for example, treatment targeting IL-17 resulting in sometimes dramatic improvements in skin psoriasis, while features of peripheral arthritis may show little or no response, and inflammatory bowel disease features may flare sometimes for the first time. Clinicians have a difficult job trying to identify which drug to prescribe for which patient, often using an individual's clinical features together with their comorbidity profiles and history of previous drug response as the best guide to treatment choice. This often means that patients cycle through several therapies before finding one that is effective, with this period of non-response contributing.

### Sequencing of targeted therapy in psoriasis: Does it matter [^112udXG2]? American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

With the continued development of biologics for the treatment of psoriasis, some patients have achieved optimal control. However, a recommended biologic sequence is still lacking if a biologic fails to initially improve the skin, termed primary nonresponse, or loses efficacy after initial improvement, termed secondary nonresponse. Primary and secondary nonresponse can occur with any class of biologics, and the type of nonresponse can drive the choice of whether to switch within a biologic class or to a different biologic class. The choice of biologic can also be challenging when managing psoriasis and concomitant psoriatic arthritis, as treatment differs based on the severity of both diseases and further classification of axial and peripheral joint involvement.

When choosing a biologic, each patient's comorbidities and preferences are also taken into account to provide the optimal therapy. With this lack of an established biologic sequence after biologic failure, the objective of our review is to define a therapy sequence for the tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-17 (IL-17), and interleukin-23 (IL-23) inhibitor classes in the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Our proposed biologic sequence was derived through an analysis of the efficacy of each biologic class, primary and secondary nonresponse rates from clinical trials, and clinical experience with expert opinion.

### Integrating imaging and biomarker assessment to better define psoriatic arthritis and predict response to biologic therapy [^1162xxSp]. Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

**Imaging features predictive of treatment response**: The limitations of clinical assessment in PsA have led to EULAR recommending the use of MRI and US for diagnosis, activity monitoring, and structural change evaluation in peripheral SpA. Traditional plain radiographs still form an important baseline test in clinical assessment. Erosive changes on X-ray will be seen after 2 years of disease. Other changes include joint space narrowing, periosteal new bone formation, osteolysis, and ankyloses. In the spine, generic SpA changes are seen in PsA, but by the time these appear on plain film, the disease has usually advanced. Chronic damage at the entheses is also visible with plain films.

### Comprehensive treatment of psoriatic arthritis: Managing comorbidities and extraarticular manifestations [^1153Zjh8]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis that can lead to decreased health-related quality of life and permanent joint damage, resulting in functional decline. In addition to joint and skin manifestations, both psoriasis and PsA are linked with numerous comorbidities and extraarticular/cutaneous manifestations, which may influence the physician's choice of therapy. This review aims to:

- **Identify comorbidities**: Examine patients with PsA based on the available evidence.
- **Examine effects on management**: Assess the impact of these comorbidities or extraarticular/cutaneous manifestations on the management of patients with PsA and therapy selection.
- **Highlight research needs**: Address research needs around comorbidities and treatment paradigms.

This review is part of a treatment recommendations update initiated by the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA).

### Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors for psoriatic arthritis [^114U7Jkd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic arthritis affecting people with psoriasis. If untreated, it may lead to disability. Recommended drugs are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs), and targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs). Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) are the first choice bDMARDs.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of TNFi in adults with psoriatic arthritis.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization trials portal up to 28 March 2024.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults with PsA, comparing TNFi to placebo, physiotherapy, NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and cs/b/tsDMARDs. Major outcomes included clinical improvement, minimal disease activity, physical function, health-related quality of life, radiographic progression, serious adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methods. The primary comparison was TNFi versus placebo. The primary time point was 12 weeks for clinical improvement; 24 weeks for minimal disease activity, function, quality of life, and radiographic progression; and the end of the trial period for serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events.

- **Main results**: We included 25 RCTs randomizing 7857 participants. Four studies compared TNFi to methotrexate and one to ustekinumab in DMARD-naïve participants.

### New generation biologics for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. State of the art and considerations about the risk of infection [^115AV7iT]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated disease characterized by inflammation of the skin (psoriasis) or joints (psoriatic arthritis) or both, resulting from a dysregulation, in particular, of the T helper (Th)17 functions. There is no available cure for psoriasis, and a lifelong treatment is needed to control signs and symptoms. Research interest is high around the newest biological drugs approved for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, especially drugs blocking the IL-23/IL-17 axis. Our aim is to review the new biological drugs for the treatment of psoriasis and their adverse effects, focusing on the risk of infections.

### Group for research and assessment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (GRAPPA): updated treatment recommendations for psoriatic arthritis 2021 [^116LW7xw]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Since the second version of the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) treatment recommendations were published in 2015, therapeutic options for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) have advanced considerably. This work reviews the literature since the previous recommendations (data published 2013–2020, including conference presentations between 2017 and 2020) and reports high-quality, evidence-based, domain-focused recommendations for medication selection in PsA developed by GRAPPA clinicians and patient research partners.

- **Overarching principles**: The overarching principles for the management of adults with PsA were updated by consensus. Principles considering biosimilars and tapering of therapy were added, and the research agenda was revised.
- **Literature searches**: Literature searches covered treatments for the key domains of PsA: peripheral arthritis, axial disease, enthesitis, dactylitis, and skin and nail psoriasis. Additional searches were performed for PsA-related conditions (uveitis and inflammatory bowel disease) and comorbidities.
- **Subcommittee approach**: Individual subcommittees used a GRADE-informed approach, taking into account the quality of evidence for therapies, to generate recommendations for each of these domains, which were incorporated into an overall schema.

Choice of therapy for an individual should ideally address all disease domains active in that patient, supporting shared decision-making. As safety issues often affect potential therapeutic choices, additional consideration was given to relevant comorbidities. These GRAPPA treatment recommendations provide up-to-date, evidence-based guidance.

### How early should psoriatic arthritis be treated with a TNF-blocker [^113wk6j4]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is the second most commonly identified inflammatory arthropathy in early arthritis clinics. It is a complex multisystem disease involving the skin and joints but may also present with inflammation of the spine (spondylitis), digits (dactylitis), eyes (uveitis), and ligamentous insertions (enthesitis). The skin manifestations may be mild or patchy and often precede joint inflammation. Joint erosions, however, may occur within the first two years in up to half of PsA patients, with an erosion rate of 11% per annum reported, suggesting it is not a benign disease as it was once regarded.

- **Recent findings**: Therapy with mild anti-inflammatories is beneficial only in very mild or localized disease. In cases of more widespread joint involvement, systemic therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate, may be required. In cases of extra-articular or spinal disease, where DMARDs have failed to show efficacy, biologic therapy may be highly effective.

The question of how early treatment should be instituted should be decided in a specialist rheumatology referral center following appropriate assessment. Optimal therapy with combination DMARD and biologics may result in remission rates of up to 60%.

Psoriasis is a common, chronic, inflammatory, multisystem disease with predominantly skin and joint manifestations, affecting approximately 2% of the population. In this second of five sections of the guidelines of care for psoriasis, we provide an overview of psoriatic arthritis, including its cardinal clinical features, pathogenesis, prognosis, classification, assessment tools used to evaluate psoriatic arthritis, and the approach to treatment.

Although patients with mild to moderate psoriatic arthritis may be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or intra-articular steroid injections, the use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, particularly methotrexate, along with biologic agents, are considered the standard of care in patients with more significant psoriatic arthritis. We will discuss the use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologic therapies in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe psoriatic arthritis.

### Sex differences in the effectiveness of first-line tumor necrosis factor inhibitors in psoriatic arthritis: Results from the European Spondyloarthritis Research Collaboration Network [^111ntWd9]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Women with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) may have reduced tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) effectiveness compared to men. We examined sex differences in treatment response and retention rates during 24 months of follow-up among patients with PsA initiating their first TNFi.

Data from patients with PsA across 13 European Spondyloarthritis Research Collaboration Network registries starting their first TNFi were pooled. Logistic regression was used to analyze the association between sex and treatment response using low disease activity (LDA) according to the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using the C-reactive protein level (DAS28-CRP) (< 3.2) at six months as the primary outcome. Analyses were adjusted for age, country, conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug treatment, and TNFi start year. Retention rates were explored using the Kaplan-Meier estimator.

We analyzed the treatment response of 7,679 patients with PsA (50% women) with available data on LDA at six months. At baseline, women and men had similar characteristics, including mean DAS28-CRP (women vs. men, 4.4 [SD 1.2] vs. 4.2 [SD 1.2]), though patient-reported outcome measures were worse in women. At six months, 64% of women and 78% of men had LDA (relative risk [RR] 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80–0.84). This difference was similar after adjustment (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.81–0.85). TNFi retention rates were evaluated in 17,842 patients with PsA. Women had significantly lower retention rates than men at all time points (women 79%, 64%, and 50% vs. men 88%, 77%, and…).

### Consensus terminology for preclinical phases of psoriatic arthritis for use in research studies: Results from a Delphi consensus study [^114fJTCf]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disease characterized by both skin and joint involvement. Synovio-entheseal involvement is present in up to 30% of those with psoriasis, and individuals with psoriasis progress to PsA at a rate of up to 3% per year. PsA can lead to joint erosions and deformities, as well as decreased quality of life, high levels of psychosocial stress, and increased rates of comorbidities, unemployment, absenteeism, and productivity loss. Despite this burden, PsA remains both underdiagnosed and undertreated, even within dermatology practices. The challenges in diagnosing and treating PsA produce a considerable gap in the care of patients with psoriatic disease, given that a delay in treatment of as little as 6 months can lead to worse disease outcomes.

### Apremilast monotherapy in DMARD-naive psoriatic arthritis patients: results of the randomized, placebo-controlled PALACE 4 trial [^111HPMZT]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) often involves skin and joints, leading to a poor quality of life and sometimes joint damage. Treatment recommendations emphasize addressing the spectrum of PsA clinical manifestations and associated comorbidities while minimizing complications associated with untreated disease or therapy. Although numerous NSAIDs, conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) such as methotrexate (MTX), and biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) are available, efficacy varies among agents. Many are associated with safety issues and limitations that can impact a patient's comfort level when initiating or continuing therapy. The importance of effective, earlier PsA treatment was highlighted in the Tight Control in Psoriatic Arthritis study, which demonstrated the benefits associated with tight control of early PsA.

The fourth Psoriatic Arthritis Long-term Assessment of Clinical Efficacy (PALACE 4) study in the phase III clinical trial program evaluates the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of apremilast, an oral phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, in patients with active PsA. PALACE 1, 2, and 3 evaluated apremilast in patients with active PsA who were considered inadequate responders to csDMARDs or bDMARDs, with benefits observed up to 156 weeks. PALACE 4 assessed apremilast use earlier in the treatment algorithm in patients with active PsA who were csDMARD naive and biologic naive. This report describes the results of the first 52 weeks of PALACE 4.

### Effect of psoriatic arthritis on treatment response in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis [^116uDsWD]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Among patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, the efficacy and tolerability of available treatments based on psoriatic arthritis (PsA) history are not well-described.

- **Objective**: We evaluate disease characteristics and treatment response variation in the moderate-to-severe psoriasis population based on PsA history.

- **Methods**: Simple-Measure for Assessing Psoriasis Activity (S-MAPA) was used to retrospectively analyze treatment responses.

- **Results**: A total of 191 moderate-to-severe psoriatic patients, 58 with and 133 without rheumatologist-diagnosed PsA, were analyzed. Regardless of PsA history, S-MAPA improvement was similar with biologic monotherapy (46.2 versus 44.1; P = 0.74), traditional systemic monotherapy (62.29 versus 38.12; P = 0.22), and combination treatments (64.62 versus 52.71; P = 0.40) after 12 weeks. PsA patients on biologic monotherapy experienced a higher infection rate than patients without PsA (0.57% versus 0.19%; P = 0.01). PsA patients experienced more adverse events (AEs) associated with traditional systemic monotherapy than biologic monotherapy (3.25 versus 1.04; P = 0.001).

- **Limitations**: The relatively small PsA cohort was the primary limitation.

- **Conclusions**: Patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis responded similarly to all treatments independent of PsA history. PsA patients received more overall treatments and more biologic monotherapy prescriptions. PsA patients had a greater infection risk on biologic monotherapy compared to those without PsA and greater adverse events risk on traditional systemic monotherapy.

### Diagnosis and treatment of psoriatic arthritis [^112F9CG2]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic, heterogeneous disease with an unknown pathogenesis, although genetic, environmental, and immunologic factors play major roles. It can follow an aggressive clinical course, making differentiation from other arthropathies sometimes difficult. Diagnosis is based on history, physical examination, usually the absence of rheumatoid factor, and characteristic radiographic features. At least 40% of patients develop radiographically detectable joint destruction; thus, proper diagnosis and early treatment can significantly impact disease course and outcome.

Understanding the pathogenesis of psoriatic disease has led to the use of several biologic agents that modulate T-cell signaling or inhibit key cytokines involved in inflammation, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF). TNF inhibitors have demonstrated excellent efficacy in resolving skin and joint disease in patients with psoriatic arthritis and have been shown to be safe in various inflammatory disorders. This article reviews the diagnostic and treatment challenges of psoriatic arthritis, as they relate to pathogenesis and disease burden.

- **Learning objective**: At the conclusion of this learning activity, participants should have acquired a comprehensive understanding of the classification, clinical presentation, etiology, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, and treatment of psoriatic arthritis.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of apremilast in psoriatic arthritis: Focus on skin manifestations and special populations [^117CNNWM]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

Few real-life studies have evaluated the long-term efficacy of apremilast therapy in the variable spectrum of clinical-anamnestic features found in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). This real-life retrospective observational study aimed to assess the long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of apremilast among patients with PsA and concomitant cutaneous psoriasis. A stratified analysis was performed on special populations defined by several factors:

- **Number of comorbidities**: (≤ 1 vs. > 2)
- **History of malignancy**: Presence or absence
- **Previous exposure to biologics**: Presence or absence

Patients attending three Italian university and hospital centers, who received at least one dose of apremilast and had at least one follow-up visit, were included. Ninety-six patients with PsA were identified. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), Body Surface Area, 28-joint Disease Activity Score, and Dermatology Life Quality Index scores improved during treatment. These improvements were observable as early as week 4 relative to baseline. Factors such as having more than two comorbidities, a history of malignancy, and previous biologic treatment negatively influenced PASI responses. At least one adverse event was experienced by 56 out of 96 patients, and 11 of these 56 events required drug withdrawal. In conclusion, this study confirms the efficacy and safety of apremilast in managing joint and skin involvement in PsA while highlighting which patients might have a less favorable response to the treatment.

Regarding medical management for psoriatic arthritis, specifically concerning treatment goals, the BSR 2022 guidelines recommend aiming for remission or, alternatively, low disease activity. This should be achieved by employing a treat-to-target strategy that considers the patient's goals, associated conditions and comorbidities, as well as non-inflammatory causes of pain.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in psoriatic arthritis: A systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^114GkQt8]. Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic, systemic, inflammatory disease in which patients experience a high burden of illness. PsA has multiple articular and extra-articular disease manifestations, including peripheral arthritis, axial disease, enthesitis, dactylitis, skin psoriasis (PSO), and psoriatic nail disease. Patients with PsA can also suffer from related inflammatory conditions, such as uveitis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Approximately one-fifth of all PSO patients, increasing to one-quarter of patients with moderate to severe PSO, will develop PsA over time.

The goal of treatment is to control inflammation and prevent structural damage to minimize disease burden, normalize function and social participation, and maximize the quality of life of patients. As PsA is a heterogeneous disease, the choice of treatment is guided by individual patient characteristics, efficacy against the broad spectrum of skin and joint symptoms, and varying contraindications to treatments. There are a number of treatments classed as conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine (SSZ), and leflunomide (LEF); biologic (b) DMARDs, such as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), interleukin (IL) inhibitors, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4)-immunoglobulins; and targeted synthetic (ts) DMARDs, which include phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors.

Despite the number of available treatment options, the majority of patients with PsA report that they do not achieve remission, and additional therapeutic options are needed. Thus, the treatment landscape for PsA continues to evolve, and treatment decisions increase in complexity.

### Integrating imaging and biomarker assessment to better define psoriatic arthritis and predict response to biologic therapy [^111a69HR]. Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Can imaging help in assessing treatment response?

Going forward, we have a choice to scan and research each domain of PsA separately or attempt to cover all domains with one composite score. The PsA-Son scores include entheses examination, and other composite US scores have attempted to reflect the heterogeneity of PsA.

- **Five targets PwD for psoriatic disease**: This score recognizes the various domains in PsA and can be used to monitor power Doppler at the joint, enthesis, skin, nail, tendons, and synovial sheath. While this score is much more feasible, it focuses on areas that are difficult to scan, including the skin and nails.

There is evidence of an association between nail disease (both clinical and subclinical) and enthesitis at the DIP joint in PsO. US is able to assess the nail bed, matrix, and plate, as well as its relationship with the DIP joint of the finger. A high transducer probe can diagnose subclinical psoriatic nail disease and potentially monitor response to treatment. Interestingly, a study of PsO patients with nail disease noted a higher incidence of subclinical systemic enthesitis. Thus, nail bed disease merits further investigation to better stratify patients by phenotype.

### Safety and efficacy of bimekizumab in patients with active psoriatic arthritis: Three-year results from a Phase IIb randomized controlled trial and its open-label extension study [^111v2vEe]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disease with varied musculoskeletal and dermatological manifestations, including joint inflammation, enthesitis, dactylitis, and skin disease. Due to the substantial and enduring impact of psoriatic disease on patients, it is critical to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of treatments.

In recent years, the interleukin (IL)-17 cytokine superfamily has emerged as a target of new monoclonal antibody therapies for a range of inflammatory diseases. Currently approved therapies for PsA that target IL-17 cytokines include secukinumab and ixekizumab, both of which inhibit IL-17A, one of the six isoforms of IL-17. The safety of IL-17A inhibitor treatment has been reported up to five years in patients with PsA.

Bimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that selectively inhibits IL-17F in addition to IL-17A. Previous studies have shown that the dual neutralization of IL-17A and IL-17F results in rapid clinical improvements in patients with PsA (Phase IIb) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) (Phase IIb), sustained up to 48 weeks, and plaque psoriasis (Phase III), sustained up to 56 weeks. Given that PsA is a chronic disease with the potential for lasting complications — including irreversible joint damage, an increased risk of comorbidities, impaired quality of life, and substantial psychosocial burden — it is important to establish the long-term safety and efficacy of treatments in this patient population. While studies have examined the safety and efficacy of IL-17A inhibitors in PsA patients, further investigation into treatments like bimekizumab is essential to improve patient outcomes.

### Biological therapy for psoriatic arthritis in clinical practice: outcomes up to 2 years [^112HgbY2]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of biological drugs in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) within a routine care setting, utilizing the Finnish national register of biological treatment (ROB-FIN).

- **Methods**: Patients with PsA who initiated therapy with infliximab or etanercept between June 2000 and February 2006 (n = 127) were monitored for up to 24 months. Response evaluation employed the American College of Rheumatology response criteria, including individual measures.

- **Results**: There were significantly diminished values for swollen and tender joints, patient's global and pain assessments, doctor's global assessment of disease activity, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and Health Assessment Questionnaire score observed within 3 months after initiation of both infliximab and etanercept. These values remained significantly lower throughout the 24-month follow-up period. The ACR20 response at 3 months was 79% (n = 22/28) for infliximab and 76% (n = 34/45) for etanercept. The first biological drug was discontinued in 16% of cases due to lack of effectiveness and in 6% due to adverse events.

- **Conclusion**: Anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy, often combined with conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, appeared to have limited toxicity and demonstrated persistent effectiveness for up to 2 years in a cohort of Finnish patients with severe peripheral PsA.

### Comparative genomic profiling of synovium versus skin lesions in psoriatic arthritis [^113Dh2aR]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Our findings indicate that treating both skin lesions and arthritis with the same modalities may show different patterns of efficacy between the skin and the joint. Although TNF antagonists are somewhat effective treatments for both psoriasis without arthritis and skin/joint manifestations of PsA, treatment failures occur in at least 30–40% of the overall PsA population, and alternative treatments are needed. IL-17 has emerged as the most critical cytokine for sustaining skin disease. In psoriasis vulgaris trials, the emerging IL-17 antagonists yielded response rates that reflect virtual elimination of disease. IL-12/IL-23 antagonists, which ultimately suppress IL-17 signaling, show marked lesional skin improvement in psoriasis but less robust results for PsA joint symptoms. It is not clear whether IL-17 will play a major role in PsA. The lower responses of PsA to ustekinumab and brodalumab (compared with TNF antagonists) seem to predict that this cytokine will not have the dominant role in arthritis that it has in controlling the skin phenotype. In addition, some clinical trials have shown flares of arthritis in a small number of PsA patients whose skin disease was well controlled with ustekinumab.

Our findings of a relatively stronger IL-6 gene signature in synovium may point toward another target in PsA. GSVA showed a trend toward positive expression of IL-6 pathways in synovium and negative expression in skin. In addition, real-time PCR further confirmed our GSVA IL-6 pathway findings, with mRNA for IL-6 significantly increased in synovium compared with skin.

### EULAR recommendations for the management of psoriatic arthritis with pharmacological therapies: 2023 update [^115bCx3C]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for psoriatic arthritis, specifically with respect to biologic DMARDs and predominantly axial disease, EULAR 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of therapy with an interleukin 17A inhibitor, a TNF inhibitor, an interleukin 17 A/F inhibitor, or a JAK inhibitor in patients with clinically relevant axial disease and an insufficient response to NSAIDs.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: Section 6. Guidelines of care for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: Case-based presentations and evidence-based conclusions [^115RqRM7]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a common, chronic, inflammatory, and multisystem disease with predominantly skin and joint manifestations affecting approximately 2% of the population. In the first five parts of the American Academy of Dermatology Psoriasis Guidelines of Care, we presented evidence supporting the use of topical treatments, phototherapy, traditional systemic agents, and biological therapies for patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. In this sixth and final section of the Psoriasis Guidelines of Care, we present cases to illustrate how to practically use these guidelines in specific clinical scenarios. We describe the approach to treating patients with psoriasis across the entire spectrum of this fascinating disease, from mild, moderate, to severe, with and without psoriatic arthritis, based on the five prior published guidelines.

Although specific therapeutic recommendations are given for each of the cases presented, it is important that treatment be tailored to meet individual patients' needs. In addition, we update the prior five guidelines and address gaps in research and care that currently exist, making suggestions for further studies that could help address these limitations in our knowledge base.

### Dose reduction and discontinuation of biologic and targeted synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for people with psoriatic arthritis in remission or low disease activity [^112a1gmk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Dealing with missing data, we will contact investigators or study sponsors to verify key study characteristics and obtain missing numerical outcome data where possible (e.g. when a study is identified as abstract only or when data are not available for all participants). When verification is not possible, and the missing data are thought to introduce serious bias, we will explore the impact of including such studies in the overall assessment of results using a sensitivity analysis. We will clearly describe any assumptions and imputations used to handle missing data and explore the effect of imputation through sensitivity analyses.

- **Dichotomous outcomes**: For outcomes such as the number of withdrawals due to adverse events, we will calculate the withdrawal rate using the number of participants randomized in the group as the denominator.

- **Continuous outcomes**: For outcomes like the mean change in pain score, we will calculate the mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD) based on the number of participants analyzed at that time point. If the number of participants analyzed is not presented for each time point, we will use the number of randomized participants in each group at baseline.

Where possible, we will calculate missing standard deviations from other statistics, such as standard errors, confidence intervals (CIs), or P values, according to the methods recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. If we cannot calculate standard deviations, we will impute them, for example, from other studies in the meta-analysis.

- **Reporting bias assessment**: We will create and examine a funnel plot to explore possible small-study biases.

We will assess the robustness of the treatment effect on both the proportion of participants with remission and the proportion of participants with flare or relapse due to potential selection bias and potential detection bias by performing the following sensitivity analyses.

- **Selection bias**: We will remove the trials that report inadequate or unclear allocation concealment from the meta‐analysis to see if this changes the overall treatment effect.

- **Detection bias**: We will remove the trials that report inadequate or unclear participant blinding from the meta‐analysis to see if this changes the overall treatment effect.

In addition, if we have to impute any missing data, we will assess the impact in sensitivity analyses.

### Enhancing current guidance for psoriatic arthritis and its comorbidities: Recommendations from an expert consensus panel [^115pF41C]. Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

The recommendations within the 'Disease Assessment' theme aim to achieve two key objectives: to highlight the need for individualized assessments addressing factors affecting the individual most significantly, and to provide practical guidance for assessing PsA in the clinic. PsA has a notably broad impact on quality of life (greater than PsO alone) due to associated symptoms of pain and fatigue, among others, leading to impairments in functional ability and ability to work. This impact may not only be linked to PsA symptoms but also to comorbid conditions, including mental health conditions, which need to be identified and managed as early as possible. Extra-articular manifestations, as previously mentioned, can provide important diagnostic indicators but are also important to assess on an ongoing basis due to their impact on the burden of disease and as a factor in driving therapy selection.

Evidence from the TLR suggested that sex is closely linked with disease course in PsA, resulting in distinct clinical presentations in men and women. Women reported worse quality of life associated with higher levels of disability, fatigue, pain, and overall disease severity, as well as a lower likelihood of achieving remission. Men with PsA experienced less overall functional impairment, but a higher impact on their self-esteem.

Given the variability in patients' experience of PsA, it is recommended that the Psoriatic Arthritis Impact of Disease (PsAID-12) questionnaire be used at every consultation. PsAID-12 covers all key domains and can be administered efficiently in clinical practice.

### The 2022 British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis with biologic and targeted synthetic DMARDs [^117KrSeK]. Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for psoriatic arthritis, particularly in relation to managing an inadequate response to biologic agents, the BSR 2022 guidelines recommend considering the following factors when selecting therapies after an inadequate response or intolerance to a biologic or targeted synthetic DMARD:

- **Disease domains, previous medication use, and associated conditions**: Consider conditions such as psoriasis, uveitis, and IBD, similarly as with first-line biologic or targeted synthetic DMARDs.

- **Different mode of action**: Consider choosing a different mode of action for the next treatment in patients experiencing primary inefficacy with a biologic or targeted synthetic DMARD.

- **Same mode of action**: Consider initiating drugs with the same mode of action first in patients with secondary inefficacy to a biologic or targeted synthetic DMARD. However, all currently licensed biologic or targeted synthetic DMARDs, without limit to previous lines of therapy and including those previously discontinued, can be considered.

### Clinical management of psoriatic arthritis [^1144DBbq]. Lancet (2018). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis, or the broader term psoriatic disease, refers to an inflammatory disorder that affects multiple organs, including the skin and joints. It also includes related extra-articular manifestations and comorbidities. Patients with psoriatic disease experience a substantial clinical burden. Early identification leading to timely diagnosis and treatment is crucial to prevent long-term structural damage, disability, and associated socioeconomic consequences.

The increase in therapeutic options, such as disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, both biological and targeted synthetic, has revolutionized the treatment of skin and joint disease. Clinicians are prompted to use the full clinical picture of an individual patient to make rational treatment decisions. Research is also focused on treatment strategies, including treat to target, early remission-induction, and tapering.

### Integrating imaging and biomarker assessment to better define psoriatic arthritis and predict response to biologic therapy [^113ij38v]. Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Advances in the treatment of PsA show that psoriasis (PsO) affects 2% of the population, and one-third of these individuals will develop PsA. There is a range of overlapping articular patterns, including deforming peripheral arthritis, dactylitis, enthesitis-dominant disease, and axial disease. Recent treatment recommendations highlight the heterogeneity of PsA and emphasize the need to target the various disease domains.

Rheumatologists are focused on treating disease early; those who do not respond to conventional DMARDs have several options. These include small-molecule synthetic DMARDs like apremilast. However, biologic agents are the cornerstone of effective PsA disease control. Anti-TNF-α (TNFi) drugs have revolutionized PsA disease management and were, until recently, the only family of biologics available. Further effective options now include monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy targeting IL-17, IL-12/23, and IL-23 and, latterly, combinatorial cytokine inhibition with Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors. Currently, the decision to start or switch to a particular biologic is based on several factors not necessarily linked to the disease itself, including patient choice, co-morbidities, and drug cost and safety profile. There is little evidence guiding the choice between them.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for psoriatic arthritis, particularly concerning the management of inadequate response to biologic agents, the BSR 2022 guidelines recommend not to use routine conventional synthetic DMARDs in patients with active PsA who are starting biologic or targeted synthetic DMARDs. Consider initiating conventional synthetic DMARDs to comply with drug licensing requirements or to maximize the effectiveness for skin disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or uveitis, and/or to improve persistence with TNF inhibitors.

### Treatment of psoriasis in patients with psoriatic arthritis: An updated literature review informing the 2021 GRAPPA treatment recommendations [^111htnyr]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Our aim was to summarize and evaluate the quality of evidence regarding the efficacy of therapies for cutaneous psoriasis (PsO) in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA).

- **Methods**: A literature search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library databases, and conference abstracts was conducted to identify interventional randomized controlled trials in patients with PsA between February 2013 and December 2021. Studies were included if PsO outcomes included achieving at least 75% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index and the blinded comparison period was ≥ 10 weeks. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was employed to assess the quality of the evidence to inform and update the 2021 Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) treatment recommendations.

- **Results**: A total of 116 studies and 36 abstracts identified in the initial search were screened. A total of 37 studies (40 treatment arms) met the criteria for final inclusion. Phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors, Janus kinase inhibitors, tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitors, interleukin 17 inhibitors (IL-17i), IL-12/23i, IL-23i, and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) had high-quality data broadly supporting the efficacy of each class for plaque PsO over placebo. Head-to-head studies with high-quality data supported both IL-17i and IL-23i over TNFi.

Several pharmacologic therapeutic classes have high-quality evidence demonstrating efficacy for cutaneous PsO in the PsA population. The findings will be integrated into future recommendations.

### Comparison of two etanercept regimens for treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: PRESTA randomised double blind multicentre trial [^1139x6yV]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

To compare the efficacy over 12 weeks of two different etanercept regimens in treating the skin manifestations of psoriasis in patients who also have psoriatic arthritis and to evaluate efficacy and safety over an additional 12 weeks of open-label etanercept treatment, a randomised double-blind multicentre outpatient study was conducted. This study was set in 98 outpatient facilities in Europe, Latin America, and the Asia Pacific region and included 752 patients with both psoriasis, evaluated by dermatologists, and psoriatic arthritis, evaluated by rheumatologists.

During the blinded portion of the study, participants were randomised to receive etanercept 50 mg twice weekly (n = 379) or 50 mg once weekly (n = 373) for 12 weeks by subcutaneous injection. All participants then received open-label etanercept 50 mg once weekly for 12 additional weeks while remaining blinded to the regimen.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants achieving "clear" or "almost clear" on the physician's global assessment of psoriasis at week 12. Secondary efficacy analyses included the psoriasis area and severity index, American College of Rheumatology responses, psoriatic arthritis response criteria, and improvement in joint and tendon disease manifestations.

At week 12, 46% (176/379) of participants receiving etanercept 50 mg twice weekly achieved a physician's global assessment of psoriasis of "clear" or "almost clear" compared with 32% (119/373) in the group treated with 50 mg once weekly (P < 0.001).

### Dual biologic therapy for recalcitrant psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis [^116gkYNd]. JAAD Case Reports (2019).

Numerous biologic medications are available to treat psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis; however, many patients experience differential responses of their skin and joints to the same agent. In patients who do not respond to biologic monotherapy or a combination of a biologic with an oral systemic agent, dual biologic therapy is a possible treatment option. Dual biologic therapy is rarely reported in the psoriatic literature.

We present a patient with severe psoriatic skin and joint disease who has been treated with multiple combinations of dual biologic therapy, including ustekinumab plus etanercept for 12 months, secukinumab plus etanercept for 6 months, and guselkumab plus etanercept for 15 months. Throughout the patient's treatment, adverse events occurred only with the ustekinumab plus etanercept combination and consisted of an increased incidence of urinary tract and upper respiratory infections, including a hospitalization for H2N1 flu.
