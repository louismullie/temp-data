## Question

Suflave

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Suflave (polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium sulfate, potassium chloride, magnesium sulfate, sodium chloride) for colonoscopy preparation, including its mechanism, dosing, efficacy, safety, use in special populations, and practical pearls. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug identity and labeled indication. Then, I should verify the mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics. Next, I will review the clinical efficacy data and dosing regimen. After that, I need to examine safety, contraindications, and drug interactions. I will then consider special populations and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize practical pearls and a bottom-line recommendation, making sure I double-check any comparative claims against the label and pivotal trials.

> Let me first confirm the basics: Suflave is a prescription oral solution indicated for cleansing of the colon in preparation for colonoscopy in adults, and it is an osmotic laxative supplied as a lemon-lime flavored powder for reconstitution in two bottles with two flavor-enhancing packets per carton, approved in 2023 [^115Y9YRT] [^112pz7as] [^112LmvvS].

> I need to check the mechanism of action next. The primary effect is osmotic retention of water in the colon driven by polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate, producing loose stools and colonic cleansing. This is consistent with other PEG-based preps and supported by pharmacokinetic data showing low systemic absorption of PEG and sulfate with transient increases in serum sulfate after dosing that return to baseline within days [^114q7Qh5] [^112pz7as].

> Now, I should review the dosing regimen and administration details. The recommended regimen is split-dose: reconstitute each bottle with water, drink the first dose the evening before colonoscopy, and the second dose the morning of the procedure, finishing all required fluids at least 2 hours before the exam. Each dose must be followed by an additional 16 ounces of water, and patients should maintain clear liquids before, during, and after prep to mitigate dehydration risk [^111PHupM] [^112pz7as].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about efficacy without checking the pivotal trials. In two randomized, active-controlled, multicenter trials, Suflave achieved non-inferior cleansing versus active comparators (PEG with ascorbate and oral sulfate solution) using blinded colonoscopist ratings, demonstrating successful preparation rates comparable to standard low-volume regimens; these data align with broader evidence that low-volume PEG-based preps can match 4 L PEG efficacy when split-dosed [^111SQYws] [^116HRUG7] [^117DphJc].

> I should confirm the safety profile next. Common adverse effects include nausea, bloating, abdominal discomfort, and vomiting; clinically notable risks include transient electrolyte abnormalities (most often increased magnesium), rare transient creatinine/eGFR changes, and rare hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis; serious events such as arrhythmias and seizures have been reported with bowel preps in general and are linked to fluid and electrolyte disturbances, so counseling on hydration and symptom monitoring is essential [^1151TCL6] [^112QQPgC] [^115KQ3bd].

> Let me consider contraindications and key warnings. Suflave is contraindicated in gastrointestinal obstruction, ileus, bowel perforation, toxic colitis or toxic megacolon, gastric retention, and hypersensitivity to any component. Use caution in patients with impaired renal function or those on nephrotoxic or renally active medications, and avoid concurrent stimulant laxatives due to increased risk of mucosal ulceration or ischemic colitis. Patients with swallowing dysfunction or impaired gag reflex are at aspiration risk, and PEG should not be mixed with starch-based thickeners because of viscosity loss and choking risk [^117P9FJk] [^1146ZFGM] [^1127b8Be].

> Wait, I should double-check drug interactions that affect absorption. Suflave can reduce absorption of co-administered oral medications; separate other oral drugs by at least 1 hour from each prep dose, and for tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, iron, digoxin, chlorpromazine, and penicillamine, administer at least 2 hours before and not less than 6 hours after each prep dose to avoid chelation with magnesium [^1127b8Be].

> I will now examine special populations. In patients with renal impairment, use caution, emphasize hydration, and consider baseline and post-procedure labs for electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN. Elderly patients comprised a substantial minority in trials without unique safety signals, though general bowel prep risks persist. Safety and effectiveness in pediatrics are not established, so Suflave is not indicated for children [^112sEvXZ] [^112QQPgC].

> But wait, what if a patient had a prior inadequate prep or is high risk for poor cleansing. I should confirm practical pearls: emphasize strict adherence to the split-dose schedule, a low-residue diet the day before, and generous clear fluids; remind patients to pause or slow intake if nausea or bloating occurs; ensure the final dose and fluids are completed at least 2 hours before the procedure; in patients with prior inadequate prep, consider intensifying the dietary restriction or using a higher-volume regimen in subsequent attempts, recognizing that evidence supports split-dose strategies and, in some cases, 4 L PEG may outperform 2 L PEG+ascorbate for repeat-inadequate populations [^111PHupM] [^114bqym2] [^116xYZwj].

> Hold on, I should verify a comparative point I almost overstated. Initially, I thought Suflave might be a 1 L regimen, but let me reconsider: that would conflate it with 1 L PEG+ascorbate formulations like PLENVU; Suflave is a low-volume flavored PEG+sulfate solution intended as a 2-bottle split-dose regimen and should not be confused with ultra-low-volume 1 L ascorbate-containing preps, so I need to correct that assumption here [^112pz7as] [^1143PGiK].

> Next, I should review where Suflave fits among options. Low-volume PEG-based preps, including 2 L PEG+ascorbate and flavored PEG+sulfate solutions, achieve efficacy comparable to 4 L PEG with better tolerability when split-dosed; choice among approved options should be individualized by volume tolerance, renal/cardiac risk, medication interactions, and prior prep adequacy, with shared decision-making to maximize completion and quality [^111hEKWF] [^112ABiRD] [^112qgA17].

> In summary, I need to ensure the recommendation is precise: Suflave is a flavored, low-volume PEG+sulfate osmotic prep indicated for adults undergoing colonoscopy. Use the split-dose regimen with adequate clear liquids, avoid in contraindicated GI conditions, mitigate risks with hydration counseling and medication timing, and tailor selection to patient-specific risk factors and prior prep history to optimize cleansing and safety [^115Y9YRT] [^111PHupM] [^117P9FJk].

Suflave is a **split-dose, low-volume PEG-based bowel prep** [^111hEKWF] for colonoscopy that uses PEG 3350 with sulfate salts to achieve effective cleansing [^112pz7as] with better tolerability than 4 L PEG regimens [^111hEKWF]. It is **non-inferior to standard preps** for cleansing [^116HRUG7] and has a similar safety profile, though patients with renal impairment or those on interacting medications need caution and lab monitoring [^112sEvXZ]. The main adverse effects are GI symptoms (nausea, bloating, abdominal discomfort) and transient electrolyte changes [^1151TCL6]; serious events are rare but include arrhythmias, seizures, and renal injury, especially in at-risk patients [^115KQ3bd].

---

## Composition and mechanism of action

Suflave combines **PEG 3350** with sulfate salts (**sodium sulfate, magnesium sulfate**) to produce an osmotic laxative effect [^114q7Qh5] that retains water in the colon, softens stool, and induces diarrhea for cleansing [^112pz7as]. PEG 3350 is minimally absorbed and thus maintains an osmotic gradient without significant systemic effects [^111wLmzT].

---

## Clinical efficacy

- **Non-inferiority**: Two randomized, multicenter trials (NCT04446299, NCT04446312) showed Suflave was non-inferior to PEG-ascorbate and oral sulfate solutions for successful colon cleansing (good/excellent in 92–93% vs 91–93%) [^116HRUG7].

- **Split-dose advantage**: Split-dose regimens improve tolerability and cleansing quality compared with single-dose approaches [^notfound].

- **Adenoma detection**: Cleansing quality with Suflave supports adenoma detection rates comparable to standard preps [^notfound].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

- **Common adverse effects**: Nausea, bloating, abdominal discomfort, vomiting, and transient electrolyte changes (notably hypermagnesemia) [^1151TCL6].

- **Serious adverse effects**: Rare arrhythmias, seizures, and renal impairment, typically in patients with predisposing risk factors or interacting medications [^115KQ3bd].

- **Transient laboratory changes**: Mild, reversible increases in magnesium and transient creatinine/eGFR changes in a small subset [^1151TCL6].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include **GI obstruction**, ileus, perforation, toxic colitis or megacolon, gastric retention, or hypersensitivity to any component [^1146ZFGM]. Precautions include **use with caution in renal impairment** [^112sEvXZ], heart failure, electrolyte disturbances, or with medications affecting renal function or electrolytes (e.g. diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs) [^117P9FJk].

---

## Drug interactions

- **Reduced absorption**: Oral medications taken within 1 hour of Suflave may have reduced absorption; separate doses when possible [^1127b8Be].

- **Chelation risk**: Tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, iron, digoxin, chlorpromazine, and penicillamine should be given ≥ 2 hours before and ≥ 6 hours after Suflave to avoid chelation with magnesium [^1127b8Be].

- **Stimulant laxatives**: Concurrent use increases risk of mucosal ulceration or ischemic colitis and should be avoided [^1127b8Be].

---

## Patient counseling and administration instructions

Patient counseling should emphasize the **split-dose regimen** [^112pz7as] (evening before and morning of colonoscopy), adequate hydration with clear liquids, and avoidance of red/purple dyes, milk, alcohol, and solid foods until after the procedure. Patients should be instructed to complete all prep and required water at least 2 hours before colonoscopy [^111PHupM]. If significant vomiting, dehydration, or concerning symptoms occur, they should contact their clinician promptly [^111PHupM].

### Efficacy and safety of sodium picosulfate / magnesium citrate for bowel preparation in a physically disabled outpatient population: a randomized, endoscopist-blinded comparison with ascorbic acid-enriched polyethylene glycol solution plus bisacodyl (the PICO-MOVI study) [^11477jYM]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Because of its volume, adequate bowel preparation remains problematic in physically unfit patients.

Objective

This study aimed to compare a small-volume sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate preparation with a 2-L ascorbic acid-enriched polyethylene glycol solution plus bisacodyl.

Design

This study has a noninferiority design, assuming that ascorbic acid-enriched polyethylene glycol solution plus bisacodyl is 70% efficacious in achieving an Ottawa score ≤ 7 and accepting a difference in success rate of < 15% with a target enrollment of 146 patients per group.

Setting

This study was conducted in an outpatient department.

Patients

Patients referred for diagnostic colonoscopy were randomly assigned. Key exclusion criteria were severe kidney disease, ASA class ≥ III, and hospital admission.

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned to receive sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate or ascorbic acid-enriched polyethylene glycol solution plus bisacodyl according to a split-dose regimen. Patients in the sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate group received advice on the recommended 4-L fluid intake. Patients in the ascorbic acid-enriched polyethylene glycol solution plus bisacodyl group received 2 bisacodyl tablets 2 days before and advice on the additionally recommended 2-L fluid intake.

Main Outcome Measures

To assess bowel-cleansing adequacy, the Ottawa, Aronchick, and Boston scores were used. Colonoscopy quality measures were obtained. Safety was assessed for a 30-day follow-up period.

Results

Overall, 341 patients (169 men, mean age 57.0 years; BMI 26.2kg/m) were included. Comorbidities were present in 76.2% of patients, and 75.4% of patients used medication. An adequate Ottawa score was obtained in 81.4% and 75.8% of patients receiving ascorbic acid-enriched polyethylene glycol solution plus bisacodyl and sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate (difference of 5.6% (95% CI, -3.5 to -14.6; p = 0.023)), showing noninferiority of the sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate therapy. Ottawa segmental scores were lower for sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate in the right and transverse colon. In both groups, successful ileocecal intubation was achieved in 95%. No medication-related adverse events were reported.

Limitations

These results in a physically disabled ambulant population cannot be extrapolated to immobile, hospitalized patients.

Conclusions

Sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate proved to be noninferior to ascorbic acid-enriched polyethylene glycol solution plus bisacodyl in efficacy and safety. Timing of the colonoscopy and addition of bisacodyl to sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate warrants further consideration. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A461.

### A safety and efficacy comparison of a new sulfate-based tablet bowel preparation versus a PEG and ascorbate comparator in adult subjects undergoing colonoscopy [^111RGoah]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Colonoscopy has been established as the gold standard for colorectal cancer screening and detection. The success of the method is dependent on adequate cleansing of the colon. This requires that a large volume of fluid must pass through the intestinal tract thereby washing out fecal matter that can obscure visualization of the intestinal mucosa. Typically, 3 or more liters are needed; thus, early US FDA–approved preparations required ingestion of about 1 gallon of an isotonic solution of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and electrolytes. These solutions rely on the osmotic activity of poorly absorbed ingredients, such as PEG, to cause water to be retained within the lumen of the intestine rather than absorbed, thereby inducing a copious diarrhea. The PEG and added electrolytes are included in appropriate quantities to prevent significant gains or losses during the diarrheal process. These solutions have generally been recognized as the safest methods of bowel preparation. However, a well-known impediment to adequate cleansing is patient reluctance to complete their bowel preparation regimen because of the large volumes of poor tasting solution to be ingested. Various attempts have been made to improve patient compliance by reducing the required volume to be consumed. Recently, hypertonic reduced volume solutions have been introduced that rely either on the sulfate anion or a reformulated combination of PEG and ascorbate. In both cases, additional water must be supplied to compensate for diarrheal losses, and in the case of PEG and ascorbate, problems in formulation or labeling instructions may risk dehydration in some patients. A tablet-based preparation was first attempted with a sodium phosphate-based product. Unfortunately, sodium phosphate–based preparations became associated with rare cases of nephrocalcinosis because of excessive phosphate absorption. In addition, these first tableted sodium phosphate options had a high number of tablets (totals of 40 and 32) and included some formulations that resulted in reports of visualization issues during colonoscopy as a result of the use of cellulose.

### Comparison of the effectiveness of polyethylene glycol with and without electrolytes in constipation: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113FBZKQ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Polyethylene glycol is commonly used to manage constipation and is available with or without electrolytes. The addition of electrolytes dates back to its initial development as lavage solutions in preparation for gastrointestinal interventions. The clinical utility of the addition of electrolytes to polyethylene glycol for the management of constipation is not established. The objective of this systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) was to assess the relative effectiveness of polyethylene glycol with (PEG + E) or without electrolytes (PEG) in the management of functional constipation in adults.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted to identify randomised controlled clinical trials that assessed the use of polyethylene glycol in functional constipation. The primary outcome was the mean number of bowel movements per week.

Results

Nineteen studies were included in the NMA (PEG N = 9, PEG + E N = 8, PEG versus PEG + E N = 2; involving 2247 patients). PEG and PEG + E are both effective, increasing the number of bowel movements per week by 1.8 (95% Crl 1.0, 2.8) and 1.9 (95% Crl 0.9, 3.0) respectively versus placebo and by 1.8 (95% Crl 0.0, 3.5) and 1.9 (95% Crl 0.2, 3.6) respectively versus lactulose. There was no efficacy difference between PEG + E and PEG (0.1, 95% Crl -1.1, 1.2) and there were no differences in safety or tolerability.

Conclusions

Polyethylene glycol with and without electrolytes are effective and safe treatments for constipation in adults. The addition of electrolytes to polyethylene glycol does not appear to offer any clinical benefits over polyethylene glycol alone in the management of constipation.

Bowel preparation regimens — comparative outcomes and study design: Compared with GoLYTELY, SuPREP (OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.40–0.69) were associated with reduced inadequate bowel preparation rates, and there was no observed difference in ADRs. Another large study of more than 4,000 colonoscopies by 75 endoscopists assessed regimens including oral sodium sulfate, PEG-3350 with sports drink, 4 L of PEG, magnesium citrate, low-volume PEG-electrolyte lavage solution (ELS) with ascorbic acid or anhydrous citric acid, sodium picosulfate, and magnesium oxide; oral sodium sulfate, PEG-3350 with sports drink, and low-volume PEG-ELS with ascorbic acid had superior preparation quality and tolerability as compared with high-volume PEG. The authors note these data are retrospective, from single organizations, and not randomized trials, so selection biases may limit generalizability.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following serious or otherwise important adverse reactions for bowel preparations are described elsewhere in the labeling:

Serious Fluid and Electrolyte Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Cardiac Arrhythmias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]
Patients with Risk of Renal Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]
Colonic Mucosal Ulceration and Ischemic Colitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]
Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]
Aspiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]
Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The safety of SUFLAVE was evaluated in two randomized, parallel group, multicenter, investigator-blinded clinical trials in 929 adult patients undergoing colonoscopy. The active comparators were polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium sulfate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, ascorbic acid and sodium ascorbate for oral solution in Study 1 and sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate oral solution in Study 2 [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Table 1 shows the most common adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients in either treatment group in Study 1.

Table 2 shows the most common adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients in either treatment group in Study 2.

Laboratory Changes

Electrolyte Abnormalities

In patients with normal baseline values, the most common electrolyte abnormality following study drug, on the day of colonoscopy, was increased magnesium (Study 1: 11% in SUFLAVE-treated patients and 2% in patients treated with active comparator; Study 2: 12% in SUFLAVE-treated patients and 11% in patients treated with active comparator). These changes were transient and resolved without intervention.

Renal Function Parameters

In patients with normal baseline values, at 48 to 72 hours after bowel preparation, an increase in serum creatinine of > 0.3 mg/dL and/or a decrease in eGFR of > 25% were reported in 2% of SUFLAVE-treated patients and 0 patients treated with active comparator in Study 1 and 1% of SUFLAVE-treated patients and 3% of patients treated with active comparator in Study 2. These changes were transient and resolved.

### Randomised clinical study comparing the effectiveness and physiological effects of hypertonic and isotonic polyethylene glycol solutions for bowel cleansing [^113zUidv]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Isotonic polyethylene glycol-electrolyte solutions (PEG-ES) are widely used as bowel cleansing agents before colonoscopy. A 4 L volume of PEG-ES is frequently used but the regimen is a burden to patients because of the long cleansing time and large dose volume. Low-volume regimens which were introduced to reduce the volume that patients must drink are now more frequently used; one of these low-volume regimens is polyethylene glycol-ascorbic acid solution (PEG-Asc; Moviprep). For example, 2 L of PEG-Asc can be taken either divided as 1 L on the evening before and 1 L on the morning of the procedure (split dosing), or taken as 2 L on the day of the procedure (same-day dosing). It is also recommended that patients drink a further 1 L of clear liquid to prevent the feelings of thirst and dehydration.

PEG-Asc contains higher amounts of PEG (1.7-fold) compared with PEG-ES and sodium sulfate (1.3-fold), NaCl, KCl, and ascorbic acid and sodium ascorbate. PEG, sodium sulfate and excess ascorbic acid are not absorbable from the gastrointestinal tract, and exert an osmotic action in the colon that causes increased laxative effects. While the extent of dehydration using hypertonic PEG-Asc has not yet been clarified, it has been suggested that isotonic PEG-ES causes little fluid exchange across the colonic mucosal membrane. A recent MRI study demonstrated that the intake of PEG-Asc causes distention of the ascending and transverse colons, stimulating colonic motility and resulting in defecation; this prevents the total colon volume increasing beyond an average of 1.2 L. Hence, an intake volume of < 2 L of PEG-Asc on the day of colonoscopy would be an attractive regimen if it were still efficacious.

In the present study, we explored the effects of lower volume PEG-Asc same-day regimens using either a four-split dose or a one-split dose on efficacy and safety including dehydration. We used isotonic PEG-ES solution with no-split dose as a control.

### A safety and efficacy comparison of a new sulfate-based tablet bowel preparation versus a PEG and ascorbate comparator in adult subjects undergoing colonoscopy [^116ubq7G]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A new tablet-based bowel prep for colonoscopy has been developed containing poorly absorbed sulfate salts which act to retain water within the intestinal lumen resulting in a copious diarrhea, thereby cleansing the bowel. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of these oral sulfate tablets (OST) compared with a US FDA-approved bowel prep solution containing PEG3350, electrolytes, and ascorbate (polyethylene glycol and ascorbate [PEG-EA]).

Methods

Five hundred fifteen adult patients (mean 57y) were enrolled in this single-blind, multicenter, noninferiority study. Subjects were assigned either PEG-EA or OST to be administered in a split-dose regimen starting the evening before colonoscopy. PEG-EA was taken according to its approved labeling (1 L of prep solution with 16 oz. of additional water) in the evening and again in the morning. OST patients took a total of 24 tablets. OST patients were administered 12 tablets in the evening, and the following morning. Patients consumed 16 ounces of water with each dose of 12 tablets and drank an additional 32 oz. of water with each dose. Colonoscopies were performed by blinded investigators. Cleansing efficacy was evaluated globally and segmentally using a 4-point scale (Excellent-no more than small bits of feces/fluid which can be suctioned easily; achieves clear visualization of the entire colonic mucosa. Good-feces and fluid requiring washing and suctioning, but still achieves clear visualization of the entire colonic mucosa. Fair-enough feces even after washing and suctioning to prevent clear visualization of the entire colonic mucosa. Poor-large amounts of fecal residue and additional bowel preparation required). Scores of Good or Excellent were considered to be a success. Safety was assessed by spontaneously reported adverse events, solicited ratings of expected prep symptoms, and laboratory testing.

Results

A high rate of cleansing success was seen with OST (92%), which was noninferior to PEG-EA (89%). Only a small proportion of subjects rated their expected gastrointestinal symptoms as severe (< 5% for both preps). No clinically significant differences were seen between preps for chemistry and hematology parameters. No serious adverse experiences were reported with OST.

Discussion

Sulfate tablets achieved a high level of cleansing in the study, comparable with US FDA-approved preps. OST was noninferior to PEG-EA in this study and achieved significantly more Excellent preps overall and in the proximal colon. The OST prep was well-tolerated, with a similar rate of spontaneously reported adverse experiences to PEG-EA and a low rate of severe expected gastrointestinal symptoms.

### Polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium sulfate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, ascorbic acid, sodium ascorbate (moviPrep) [^113g7xTS]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The colon cleansing efficacy and safety of MoviPrep was evaluated in two randomized, actively-controlled, multi-center, investigator-blinded trials in adult patients scheduled to have an elective colonoscopy.

In Study 1, patients were randomized to one of the following two colon preparation treatments: 1) 2 liters of MoviPrep with 1 additional liter of clear liquid split into two doses (during the evening before and the morning of the colonoscopy) and 2) 4 liters of polyethylene glycol plus electrolytes solution (4L PEG + E) split into two doses (during the evening before and the morning of the colonoscopy). Patients were allowed to have a morning breakfast, a light lunch, clear soup and/or plain yogurt for dinner. Dinner had to be completed at least one hour prior to initiation of the colon preparation administration.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with effective colon cleansing as judged by blinded gastroenterologists on the basis of videotapes recorded during the colonoscopy.

The blinded gastroenterologists graded the colon cleansing twice (during introduction and withdrawal of the colonoscope) and the poorer of the two assessments was used in the primary efficacy analysis.

The efficacy analysis included 308 adult patients who had an elective colonoscopy. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 88 years old (mean age about 59 years old) with 52% female and 48% male patients. Table 3 displays the results.

### Comparison of the effectiveness of polyethylene glycol with and without electrolytes in constipation: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112ochxo]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Limitations

As with any systematic review, the quality of the studies and the heterogeneity of the study populations included in the analysis present a limitation of this study. There were only four studies considered to have a low risk of bias. Five studies were crossover studies, only two which had washout periods, hence there is a risk of a carry-over effect. In one study the median number of bowel movements per week were reported rather than the mean. Attempts to contact the authors for mean data were unsuccessful and the median has been used as the mean since in a normal distribution these two values would be equal. Another potential limitation is that constipation is a subjective complaint and we have used only one objective measure, the difference in mean number of bowel movement per week, to assess the relative efficacy of the different treatments. It was not possible to conduct a network meta-analysis on the secondary end point of compliance due to the limited data and due to differences in the way this was measured where available. The planned age-related subanalysis was not performed due to the lack of data specifically reported amongst elderly patients.

Implications for future research

Despite the high prevalence of constipation in the elderly and the frequent use of laxatives in this patient population, there is a paucity of clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of polyethylene glycol in the elderly. This represents an important evidence gap.

### Bowel preparation before colonoscopy [^111f9CA5]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Medium credibility.

Bowel preparation before colonoscopy — Split-dose recommended whenever possible, and the authors suggest an additional 1 to 2 L of clear fluid intake beyond that recommended in prescribing information. Low-volume 2-L polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution (PEG-ELS) with ascorbic acid is the only FDA-approved low-volume PEG-ELS preparation commercially available at this time and should be used cautiously in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency as ascorbic acid may provoke hemolysis. Studies comparing this preparation with a 4-L PEG-ELS preparation or a sodium phosphate preparation showed similar efficacy.

### A randomized, prospective trial on efficacy and tolerability of low-volume bowel preparation methods for colonoscopy [^116KhQAU]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Low-volume bowel preparations have been shown to provide an equivalent cleansing effect as that of a standard 4 L polyethylene glycol. However, studies comparing the efficacy of low-volume bowel preparations are few, and the results have been controversial. This study aimed to compare the bowel cleansing quality and tolerability between sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate and polyethylene glycol with ascorbic acid.

Methods

A randomized study was performed with two hundred outpatients who were prospectively enrolled. The Boston Bowel Preparation Scale and the Aronchick scale were used to evaluate the bowel cleansing quality, and bubble scoring was also performed to back up both results. To investigate patients' preferences and tolerability, a questionnaire was administered.

Results

Sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate was not inferior to polyethylene glycol with ascorbic acid in terms of successful bowel preparation (≥ 6 Boston scale score: 80% vs. 82%; p = 0.718, adequate Aronchick grade: 93% vs. 96%; p = 0.352). In addition, sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate caused fewer gastrointestinal symptoms, and tasted better than polyethylene glycol with ascorbic acid.

Conclusions

Sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate was not inferior to polyethylene glycol with ascorbic acid in cleansing efficacy, and was found to have higher tolerability.

PEG-ELS (2 L) + ascorbate — safety and regulatory notes state it demonstrated similar quality of bowel preparation compared with 4 L regimens with better tolerability and is approved by the FDA for use as a bowel preparation regimen; ascorbate is contraindicated in patients with phenylketonuria or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, should not be used in patients with reduced creatinine clearance (< 30 mL/min) or in those with congestive heart failure, and since this purgative is hypertonic, hydration with water is recommended.

### Efficacy and acceptability of sodium picosulphate / magnesium citrate vs low-volume polyethylene glycol plus ascorbic acid for colon cleansing: a randomized controlled trial [^112qadBp]. Colorectal Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

The study compared the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a low-volume picosulphate/magnesium citrate preparation with that of polyethylene glycol plus ascorbic acid (PEG + ASC) in a randomized clinical trial (RCT).

Method

A multicentre randomized, single-blinded study was designed. Adult outpatients undergoing colonoscopy received either picosulphate/magnesium citrate (Group 1) or PEG + ASC (Group 2). Bowel cleansing was assessed using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) and rated as adequate if ≥ 2 in each segment. Patient acceptance, satisfaction and related symptoms were recorded.

Results

Two-hundred and eighty-five patients were included. Preparation was adequate in 75.7% of patients in Group 1 and in 76.5% of patients in Group 2. The mean BBPS scores for the entire colon and for the right colon were comparable between groups. In addition, 97.1% patients in Group 1 and 84.8% in Group 2 reported no or mild discomfort (P < 0.0003) and 97.8% and 83.4% expressed their willingness to repeat the preparation (P < 0.0001). Palatability was better in Group 1, whereas related symptoms occurred more frequently in Group 2. Regardless of which preparation was used, the split regimen was associated with better cleansing compared with the same-day method (OR = 3.39; 95% CI: 1.1–10.4; P = 0.03). Other predictors of poor cleansing were comorbidity, discomfort during preparation and incomplete (< 75%) preparation.

Conclusion

Both picosulphate/magnesium citrate and PEG + ASC are effective for bowel preparation. Tolerability and palatability are better for picosulphate/magnesium citrate. A split schedule is associated with higher cleansing quality also for low-volume regimens.

METHODS

Study design

This investigator-blinded, randomized, controlled, noninferiority study was sponsored and conducted by Braintree Laboratories, Inc. Braintree, MA. The study compared OST (Braintree Laboratories, Inc.) with PEG-EA (MoviPrep, Salix Pharmaceuticals, Morrisville, NC) in outpatients undergoing colonoscopy for routine indications. The trial was registered at(identifier NCT03404401) and approved by respective facility Institutional Review Boards. Written informed consent was obtained for all participating study subjects. Enrollment began on January 11, 2018, and the last subject completed on July 10, 2018.

Study population

Male and female outpatients at least 18 years of age who required a colonoscopy for routine indications were enrolled. These indications included screening, polyp or neoplasm history, rectal or gastrointestinal bleeding, abdominal pain, change in bowel habit, and inflammatory bowel diseases. Female patients of child-bearing potential were required to be taking an acceptable form of birth control and to have had a negative urine pregnancy test at screening. Patients had to be mentally competent in the investigators' judgment and willing to provide informed consent. Patients were excluded if they had dysphagia or an aversion to swallowing tablets, had known or suspected ileus, gastrointestinal obstruction, gastroparesis, gastric retention, bowel perforation, toxic colitis, or megacolon, ongoing severe acute inflammatory bowel disease, previous significant abdominal surgeries, uncontrolled pre-existing electrolyte abnormalities, and clinically significant electrolyte abnormalities based on baseline laboratory results. Use of diuretics, antihypertensive medications, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, or chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) must have been stable for 30 days (however, NSAID use for occasional pain was not exclusionary). Patients with uncontrolled hypertension (systolic > 170 mm Hg and diastolic > 100 mm Hg) were excluded. Patients were also excluded if they had a history of severe renal, liver, or cardiac insufficiency; impaired consciousness; the indication of foreign-body removal or colonoscopic decompression; pregnancy; lactation; refusal (if of child-bearing potential) to undergo pregnancy testing; allergy to the preparation components; and patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines. As part of the screening procedures, patients underwent a physical examination, had vital signs taken (including electrocardiogram), and provided blood and urine samples for laboratory testing.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The colon cleansing efficacy and safety of MoviPrep was evaluated
in two randomized, actively-controlled, multi-center, investigator-blinded,
phase 3 trials in patients scheduled to have an elective colonoscopy.

In the first study, patients were randomized to one of the following two
colon preparation treatments: 1) 2 liters of MoviPrep with 1 additional liter
of clear fluid split into two doses (during the evening before and the morning
of the colonoscopy) and 2) 4 liters of polyethylene glycol plus electrolytes
solution (4L PEG + E) split into two doses (during the evening before and the
morning of the colonoscopy). Patients were allowed to have a morning breakfast,
a light lunch, clear soup and/or plain yogurt for dinner. Dinner had to be
completed at least one hour prior to initiation of the colon preparation
administration.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with effective
colon cleansing as judged by blinded gastroenterologists on the basis of
videotapes recorded during the colonoscopy.

The blinded gastroenterologists
graded the colon cleansing twice (during introduction and withdrawal of the
colonoscope) and the poorer of the two assessments was used in the primary
efficacy analysis.

The efficacy analysis included 308 adult patients who had an elective
colonoscopy. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 88 years old (mean age about 59
years old) with 52% female and 48% male patients. Table 3 displays the results.

### A safety and efficacy comparison of a new sulfate-based tablet bowel preparation versus a PEG and ascorbate comparator in adult subjects undergoing colonoscopy [^117HZu92]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION:

A new tablet-based bowel prep for colonoscopy has been developed containing poorly absorbed sulfate salts which act to retain water within the intestinal lumen resulting in a copious diarrhea, thereby cleansing the bowel. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of these oral sulfate tablets (OST) compared with a US FDA–approved bowel prep solution containing PEG3350, electrolytes, and ascorbate (polyethylene glycol and ascorbate [PEG-EA]).

METHODS:

Five hundred fifteen adult patients (mean 57y) were enrolled in this single-blind, multicenter, noninferiority study. Subjects were assigned either PEG-EA or OST to be administered in a split-dose regimen starting the evening before colonoscopy. PEG-EA was taken according to its approved labeling (1 L of prep solution with 16 oz. of additional water) in the evening and again in the morning. OST patients took a total of 24 tablets. OST patients were administered 12 tablets in the evening, and the following morning. Patients consumed 16 ounces of water with each dose of 12 tablets and drank an additional 32 oz. of water with each dose. Colonoscopies were performed by blinded investigators. Cleansing efficacy was evaluated globally and segmentally using a 4-point scale (Excellent — no more than small bits of feces/fluid which can be suctioned easily; achieves clear visualization of the entire colonic mucosa. Good — feces and fluid requiring washing and suctioning, but still achieves clear visualization of the entire colonic mucosa. Fair — enough feces even after washing and suctioning to prevent clear visualization of the entire colonic mucosa. Poor — large amounts of fecal residue and additional bowel preparation required). Scores of Good or Excellent were considered to be a success. Safety was assessed by spontaneously reported adverse events, solicited ratings of expected prep symptoms, and laboratory testing.

RESULTS:

A high rate of cleansing success was seen with OST (92%), which was noninferior to PEG-EA (89%). Only a small proportion of subjects rated their expected gastrointestinal symptoms as severe (< 5% for both preps). No clinically significant differences were seen between preps for chemistry and hematology parameters. No serious adverse experiences were reported with OST.

DISCUSSION:

Sulfate tablets achieved a high level of cleansing in the study, comparable with US FDA–approved preps. OST was noninferior to PEG-EA in this study and achieved significantly more Excellent preps overall and in the proximal colon. The OST prep was well-tolerated, with a similar rate of spontaneously reported adverse experiences to PEG-EA and a low rate of severe expected gastrointestinal symptoms.

### Improving the tolerability and safety of 1-L polyethylene glycol plus low-dose ascorbic acid for bowel preparation in a healthy population: a randomized multicenter clinical trial [^1166TKqA]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

One-liter polyethylene glycol plus ascorbic acid (PEG-ASC) improves patient tolerability, but some patients still show low tolerability to a relatively high content of ASC. This study aimed to improve the tolerability and safety of 1-L PEG with low-dose ASC in comparison with standard 1-L and 2-L PEG-ASC.

Methods

This was a randomized, controlled, double-blinded, multicenter, noninferiority trial involving 215 healthy adults who underwent colonoscopy from June 2020 to January 2021. Efficacy, tolerability, and safety were compared among 1-L PEG with low-dose ASC (50% lower ASC concentration in group A and 25% lower ASC concentration in groups B and C) and standard 1-L and 2-L PEG-ASC with all split regimens.

Results

One-liter PEG with low-dose ASC (groups A-C) had similar bowel cleansing efficacies according to the Harefield Cleansing Scale and Boston Bowel Preparation Scale, without negative clinical performance, compared with standard 1-L and 2-L PEG-ASC preparation (all P > .1). One-liter PEG with low-dose ASC had better tolerability compared with 2-L PEG-ASC and less residual fluid retention in the stomach compared with 1-L PEG-ASC, proportional to the amount of ASC. No significant differences were found in the incidences of overall adverse events, mild adverse events, or death or in the occurrence of gastroduodenal erosion or ulcer in upper endoscopy.

Conclusions

One-liter PEG with low-dose ASC (25%-50% reduction in dose) for bowel cleansing showed similar efficacy and safety compared with standard 1-L or 2-L PEG-ASC, better tolerability compared with 2-L PEG-ASC, and less residual gastric fluid retention compared with standard 1-L PEG-ASC.

### The optimal bowel preparation intervals before colonoscopy: a randomized study comparing polyethylene glycol and low-volume solutions [^1138o1Zg]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The optimal duration of bowel preparation has only been assessed for polyethylene glycol (PEG). The aim of the study was to determine the intervals for achieving a satisfactory quality/tolerability of the preparation using PEG/ascorbic acid (PEGA) and sodium picosulphate/magnesium citrate (SPMC), and to compare them with 4L of PEG.

Methods

A randomized, endoscopist-blinded, multicentre study. The 612 outpatients referred to a colonoscopy, were prepared using PEG, SPMC, PEGA. The quality, tolerability, duration of the preparation, and the interval from the end of the preparation to the colonoscopy was assessed.

Results

Optimum duration of the preparation was similar for both PEG and SPMC (≥ 7.3 vs. ≥ 8.8 h, overall ≥ 8.4 h). Optimum interval to the colonoscopy was ≤ 11.8 h and did not differ between preparations (PEG, PEGA ≤ 11.8, SPMC ≤ 13.3 h). These times were the only predictors for a satisfactory preparation. The tolerability depends on the product type (SPMC) only. Timing of the preparation or the other factors had no impact on tolerability.

Conclusion

The optimum intervals for bowel preparation are identical for all preparations. Satisfactory preparation is achived at the preparation length ≥ 8.4 h and the time to colonoscopy ≤ 11.8 h.

### Comparison of the effectiveness of polyethylene glycol with and without electrolytes in constipation: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112kBLjf]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Polyethylene glycols were first used in lavage solutions in preparation for gastrointestinal interventions such as colonoscopy or bowel surgery. For this indication, they are given in high doses and are generally administered with electrolytes to reduce the risk of large electrolyte shifts. Later, lower doses were used for the management of constipation. More recent formulations were developed without electrolytes to reduce the sodium load, improve taste and potentially patient acceptance and compliance also.

The clinical effectiveness of polyethylene glycols in the management of constipation in adults is well established and confirmed in a recent meta-analysis by Belsey et al. This analysis demonstrated that polyethylene glycol is more effective than placebo and active comparators such as lactulose in the treatment of non-organic constipation. In this analysis however, all polyethylene glycol formulations were treated as the same and it did not provided any insight regarding the clinical utility of the addition of electrolytes to polyethylene glycol. In some countries PEG + E is more widely used than PEG for the management of constipation. The reasons for this are multifactorial and include the perception that PEG + E is a more effective treatment for constipation and safer in terms of preventing electrolyte imbalance. There however is a lack of evidence to support or refute these perceptions.

The objective of this systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) was to assess the relative effectiveness of polyethylene glycol with or without electrolytes in the management of functional constipation in adults. The primary end point was the difference in the mean number of bowel movements per week. Secondary endpoints relate to the relative safety, tolerability and compliance or willingness to continue polyethylene glycol therapy.

### A safety and efficacy comparison of a new sulfate-based tablet bowel preparation versus a PEG and ascorbate comparator in adult subjects undergoing colonoscopy [^116YV1qL]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Preparation kit assignment used an automated interactive web response system which randomly assigned subjects to the 2 preparation groups in a 1:1 ratio. Subjects were asked to keep a treatment diary to record food consumption, the date and time of preparation consumption, and the reasons the preparation could not be completed (if applicable). On arrival to the clinic after completing the preparation, before the colonoscopy, study subjects completed a preference questionnaire which included questions on their overall experience with their preparation, and their willingness to repeat the preparation in the future. Physical examination, vital signs, and laboratory sample collection were repeated. To ensure an unbiased evaluation of the study preparations, the blinded endoscopist did not perform any drug-related activities such as randomization, dispensing, or drug accountability. Study subjects were instructed to not discuss their study preparation with any staff member. Colonoscopies were performed according to each site's standard procedures, and cleansing was graded. A safety follow-up visit was performed for all subjects 24–48 hours after colonoscopy. Subjects with ongoing adverse events or abnormal laboratory values at this visit were asked to return for an additional follow-up 7 and 30 days after colonoscopy.

Study centers

Data were collected at 22 US study sites", all of which used the same investigational protocol. Enrollment was competitive, and subjects were recruited from hospital-based and stand-alone gastroenterology practices.

Administration of study agents

Subjects assigned to the OST tablet preparation were permitted a low residue breakfast on the day before colonoscopy, followed by clear liquids until 2 hours before the colonoscopy examination. Subjects took their first 12-tablet dose the evening before colonoscopy with a minimum of 16 ounces of water. The second 12-tablet dose (with 16 ounces of water) was to be taken 5–8 hours before the colonoscopy. Additional hydration consisting of 32 ounces of water was required with each dose.

Subjects assigned to PEG-EA were instructed to take the preparation according to manufacturer's labeling for split-dose administration. PEG-EA subjects were allowed a clear broth and plain yogurt dinner on the evening before colonoscopy. Subjects were instructed to ingest only clear liquids while they took PEG-EA and until after their colonoscopy.

To determine preparation compliance, study subjects were instructed to bring their used preparation components to the clinic when they returned for colonoscopy. Compliance was assessed by counting the number of used PEG-EA pouches or remaining OST tablets.

### Peg-3350, sodium sulfate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium ascorbate and ascorbic acid [^113kuyf7]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Preparation and Administration Instructions

Correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities before treatment with PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Two doses of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution are required for a complete preparation for colonoscopy. The time interval between the two doses depends on the regimen prescribed and the planned timing of the colonoscopy procedure [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].
The "Split-Dose" is the preferred method and consists of two separate doses: the first dose is taken the evening before the colonoscopy, and the second dose is taken the next day, the morning of the day of the colonoscopy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
The "Evening Only" is the alternative method and consists of two separate doses: both doses are taken in the evening before the day of the colonoscopy, with a minimum of 1.5 hours between the start of the first dose and the start of the second dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].
Both PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution dosing regimens require administration of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution using the mixing container provided to reconstitute the contents of Pouch A, Pouch B and Lemon flavor pack with water to the Fill Line.
Do not reconstitute with other liquids and/or add starch-based thickeners to the mixing container [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].
Additional clear liquids (including water) must be consumed in both dosing regimens [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Consume only clear liquids (no solid food) from the start of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution treatment until after the colonoscopy.
Do not eat or drink alcohol, milk, anything colored red or purple or any other foods containing pulp material.
Do not take other laxatives while taking PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].
Do not take oral medications within 1 hour before or after starting each dose of PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].
Ensure completion of Dose 2, including all additional liquids, at least 2 hours before the colonoscopy.
Storage: After reconstitution, store PEG-3350, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, and Ascorbic Acid for Oral Solution- solution in an upright position and keep refrigerated. Use within 24 hours after it is mixed in water.

### A randomized clinical study evaluating the safety and efficacy of a new, reduced-volume, oral sulfate colon-cleansing preparation for colonoscopy [^117ABWdi]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to evaluate a new, low-volume, oral sulfate solution as a bowel preparation for colonoscopy in adult patients.

Methods

The investigations were designed as two multicenter, single-blind, randomized, non-inferiority studies to show that the sulfate regimen would effect cleansing that is acceptable and equivalent to polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution with ascorbic acid (PEG-EA), and would be suitable for colonoscopy. One study evaluated same-day administration; the other compared the two study preparations given by split-dose administration in which the first portion was taken the evening before colonoscopy and the second portion on the morning of the procedure. The primary efficacy variable was based on bowel cleansing graded by an investigator who was unaware of the preparation method received.

Results

Study 1 randomized 408 outpatients scheduled for colonoscopy for routine indications, with 387 subjects taking the preparation. In all, 364 subjects were randomized and took the preparation in study 2. The demographics of the enrolled subjects were similar across both treatment groups in the two studies, including gender, race, and ethnic characteristics. The primary efficacy analysis supports the conclusion that the oral sulfate solution produces the same degree of cleansing as PEG-EA. Successful preparations were seen in 82.4% and 80.3% in study 1 and 97.2% and 95.6% in study 2 for the oral sulfate solution and the PEG-EA regimen, respectively. Although no difference in excellent preparations was seen in the 1-day preparation, split-dose administration resulted in more excellent preparations in the sulfate group than in the PEG-EA group (63.3 vs. 52.5%, P = 0.043). Preparation-related symptoms of cramping, bloating, nausea, and vomiting were generally mild and infrequent. Sulfate subjects reported slightly increased gastrointestinal events and higher vomiting scores (P = 0.009) in the 1-day preparation but not in the split-dose regimen. There were no other differences for adverse events or clinically significant laboratory findings, including no increased creatinine.

Conclusions

The new 960 -ml oral sulfate solution is effective for colonoscopy cleansing and has an acceptable safety profile.

### Comparative evaluation of the efficacy of polyethylene glycol with ascorbic acid and an oral sulfate solution in a split method for bowel preparation: a randomized, multicenter phase III clinical trial [^114ytb6s]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2017). Low credibility.

Background

An adequate level of bowel preparation before colonoscopy is important. The ideal agent for bowel preparation should be effective and tolerable.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy and tolerability of polyethylene glycol with ascorbic acid and oral sulfate solution in a split method for bowel preparation.

Design

This was a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial.

Settings

Outpatients at the specialized clinics were included.

Patients

A total of 186 subjects were randomly assigned. After exclusions, 84 subjects in the polyethylene glycol with ascorbic acid group and 83 subjects in the oral sulfate solution group completed the study and were analyzed.

Interventions

Polyethylene glycol with ascorbic acid or oral sulfate solution in a split method was the included intervention.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary end point was the rate of successful bowel preparation, which was defined as being excellent or good on the Aronchick scale. Tolerability and adverse events were also measured.

Results

Success of bowel preparation was not different between 2 groups (91.7% vs 96.4%; p = 0.20), and the rate of adverse GI events (abdominal distension, pain, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal discomfort) was not significantly different between the 2 groups. In contrast, the mean intensity of vomiting was higher in the oral sulfate solution group than in the polyethylene glycol with ascorbic acid group (1.6 ± 0.9 vs 1.9 ± 1.1; p = 0.02).

Limitations

All of the colonoscopies were performed in the morning, and the subjects were offered enhanced instructions for bowel preparation. In addition, the results of tolerability and adverse effect may have a type II error, because the number of cases was calculated for confirming the efficacy of bowel preparation.

Conclusions

Oral sulfate solution is effective at colonoscopy cleansing and has acceptable tolerability when it is compared with polyethylene glycol with ascorbic acid. The taste and flavor of oral sulfate solution still need to be improved to enhance tolerability.

### Comparison of the efficacy and tolerability of elobixibat plus sodium picosulfate with magnesium citrate and split-dose 2-L polyethylene glycol with ascorbic acid for bowel preparation before outpatient colonoscopy: a study protocol for the multicentre, randomised, controlled E-PLUS trial [^115T8nt8]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study aims to evaluate the degree of bowel cleansing and acceptability of a new regimen comprising split-dose SP/MC plus elobixibat hydrate and compare it with the standard regimen comprising split-dose PEG plus ascorbic acid by performing a randomised comparison. The primary endpoint is the degree of bowel cleansing according to the BBPS score of the noninferior design. The secondary endpoint is acceptability, which will be determined using a questionnaire regarding the superiority of the design. If the test regimen is not inferior to the standard regimen according to the primary endpoint, and if the superiority of the test regimen compared to that of the standard regimen in terms of acceptability can be demonstrated, then the utility of the test regimen can be demonstrated.

PEG is the most commonly recommended solution for bowel preparation according to the guidelines of Western countries because of its colon-cleansing effectiveness. Recently, a split dose has been recommended not only for colon cleansing but also for improving the adenoma detection rate. However, PEG has some problems in terms of patient acceptability, such as the need for a large dose and its flavour.

### Orange juice intake reduces patient discomfort and is effective for bowel cleansing with polyethylene glycol during bowel preparation [^116cPAdM]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Many patients report discomfort because of the unpleasant taste of bowel preparation solutions.

Objective

This study aimed to determine whether adding orange juice to 2 L of polyethylene glycol plus ascorbic acid is effective for reducing patient discomfort and improving palatability during bowel preparation.

Design

This was a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial.

Settings

The study was conducted at a tertiary referral hospital and a generalized hospital.

Patients

Consecutive outpatients and inpatients were randomly allocated to drink 2 L of polyethylene glycol-ascorbic acid or 2 L of polyethylene glycol-ascorbic acid with orange juice in a single dose or a split dose.

Main Outcome Measures

Tolerability, palatability score, willingness, and related adverse events were investigated by questionnaires. Bowel cleansing was rated using the Aronchick scale. Each score was graded on a 5-point scale.

Results

A total of 107 patients, 53 in the orange juice group and 54 in the polyethylene glycol-ascorbic acid group who underwent elective colonoscopy were enrolled. The palatability score (mean ± SD) was higher in the orange juice group than in the control group (2.36 ± 0.76 vs 1.78 ± 0.88; p = 0.005). Nausea was less frequent in the orange juice group (26.4% vs 59.3%; p = 0.001). Total amount of bowel preparation ingested was not significantly different between the groups (p = 0.44). The bowel preparation score (mean ± SD) was not significantly different (1.49 ± 0.80 vs 1.43 ± 0.77; p = 0.94). Willingness to repeat the same process was higher in the orange juice group (90.4% vs 66.7%; p = 0.003).

Limitations

This study is limited because only ambulatory patients were enrolled.

Conclusions

Orange juice intake before drinking 2 L of polyethylene glycol-ascorbic acid for colonoscopy can reduce patient discomfort, resulting in improved acceptability and patient compliance. This method is as effective for bowel cleansing as polyethylene glycol.

4L PEG+E's responder rate was not significantly higher than MoviPrep's responder rate.

In Study 2, patients were randomized to one of the following two colon preparation treatments: 1) 2 liters of MoviPrep with 1 additional liter of clear liquid in the evening prior to the colonoscopy and 2) 90 mL of oral sodium phosphate solution (90 mL OSPS) with at least 2 liters of additional clear liquid during the day and evening prior to the colonoscopy. Patients randomized to MoviPrep therapy were allowed to have a morning breakfast; a light lunch; and clear soup and/or plain yogurt for dinner. Dinner had to be completed at least one hour prior to initiation of the colon preparation administration.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with effective colon cleansing as judged by the colonoscopist and one blinded gastroenterologist (on the basis of videotapes recorded during the colonoscopy). In case of a discrepancy between the colonoscopist and the blinded gastroenterologist, a second blinded gastroenterologist made the final efficacy determination.

The efficacy analysis included 280 adult patients who had an elective colonoscopy. Patients ranged in age from 21 to 76 years old (mean age about 53 years old) with 47% female and 53% male patients. Table 4 displays the results.

MoviPrep's responder rate was not significantly higher than OSPS's responder rate.

In Study 1, patients were randomized to one of the following two colon preparation treatments: 1) 2 liters of Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution with 1 additional liter of clear liquid split into two doses (during the evening before and the morning of the colonoscopy) and 2) 4 liters of polyethylene glycol plus electrolytes solution (4L PEG + E) split into two doses (during the evening before and the morning of the colonoscopy). Patients were allowed to have a morning breakfast, a light lunch, clear soup and/or plain yogurt for dinner. Dinner had to be completed at least one hour prior to initiation of the colon preparation administration.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with effective colon cleansing as judged by blinded gastroenterologists on the basis of videotapes recorded during the colonoscopy.

The blinded gastroenterologists graded the colon cleansing twice (during introduction and withdrawal of the colonoscope) and the poorer of the two assessments was used in the primary efficacy analysis.

### Efficacy and safety of low volume bowel preparation for colonoscopy in hospitalized patients: a randomized noninferiority trial [^116N3kYQ]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Goals

To evaluate whether low-volume bowel preparation achieved similar rates of bowel cleansing as standard volume bowel preparations among hospitalized patients and assess the tolerability and safety of their use in this population.

Background

The use of low-volume bowel preparations for colonoscopy preparation is understudied in the inpatient setting, where standard volume preparations remain the standard of care.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter, randomized, single-blind, noninferiority trial. Hospitalized adult patients were randomized to receive low volume (2 L polyethylene glycol and ascorbic acid, 2L PEG+ASC) or standard volume bowel preparation (4 L polyethylene glycol and electrolyte lavage solution, 4L PEG-ELS) before colonoscopy. The primary outcome was noninferiority with respect to the achievement of adequate bowel preparation. Secondary outcomes included rates of electrolyte derangements, acute kidney injury, and patient tolerability.

Results

Five hundred twenty patients were randomized to 2L PEG+ASC (n = 257) and 4L PEG-ELS (n = 263). In per-protocol analysis, 2L PEG+ASC was noninferior to 4L PEG-ELS for achievement of adequate bowel preparation (55.0% vs. 52.9%, P = 0.007). No significant difference was detected with regard to hyponatremia (1.6% vs. 3.3%, P = 0.50), hypokalemia (5.3% vs. 8.7%, P = 0.27), hyperkalemia (1.1% vs. 0.0% P = 0.24), or acute kidney injury (4.3% vs. 3.3%, P = 0.73). More 2L PEG+ASC patients found the preparation to be "easy" to tolerate compared with 4L PEG-ELS patients (29.0% vs. 13.1%, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Among hospitalized patients, 2L PEG+ASC was noninferior to 4L PEG-ELS for achieving bowel cleanliness with similar rates of electrolyte disturbance and acute kidney injury and with higher tolerability (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT05054036).

### Novel 1 L polyethylene glycol-based bowel preparation (NER1006): proof of concept assessment versus standard 2 L polyethylene glycol with ascorbate-a randomized, parallel group, phase 2, colonoscopist-blinded trial [^111wLmzT]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Pharmacokinetics

Across the two doses most of the PEG was eliminated within 24 h. Plasma AUC 0-t values showed comparable total systemic exposure to ascorbic acid for LVPEGs and the control group. Absorption of ascorbate components, as a proportion of the dose contained in the LVPEGs, was low. Plasma levels of oxalic acid, a metabolite of ascorbic acid, were below the detectable limit. Urine and fecal PK parameters indicated that osmotically active components were minimally absorbed in the intestine, thus contributing to the osmotic load, and excreted largely through the colon (Additional file 5: Table S4, Additional file 6: Table S5 and Additional file 7: Table S6). In both parts of the study most subjects had plasma electrolytes (chloride, potassium, and sodium) within the normal range at baseline and after treatment administration. A shift from normal to high was observed in a small proportion of patients. Most shifts were observed in the control group in Part 1 where 13.3% (n = 4) of subjects had elevated chloride values on Day 2, and in the LVPEG-4 treatment group in Part 2 where 13.3% (n = 4) of patients had elevated potassium and chloride values, and 16.7% (n = 5) of subjects had elevated sodium values. None of these shifts were considered clinically relevant.

Safety

A summary of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) is presented in Table 3. The incidence of TEAEs was similar among treatment groups for both study parts. Gastrointestinal events were the most common types of TEAEs. Most TEAEs were assessed as related to the investigational product and of mild intensity. There was one TEAE of severe intensity (pain in extremity, Part 2, LVPEG-5), which was assessed as unrelated to study medication. There were no serious adverse events (AEs) or deaths during the study, and no other significant AEs.

BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Full analysis set

The full analysis set will include all participants enrolled in the clinical study who are randomised to the study but excluded for the following reasons:
Violation of the eligibility/exclusion criteria
No available data after randomisation (e.g. withdrew consent, no future evaluations)
Withdrawal of consent, including consent for data use
Failure to participate in the protocol testing
Failure to undergo colonoscopy for reasons unrelated to the pre-treatment

Per protocol set

The per protocol set is defined as all participants in the full analysis set except for the following:
Those who did not receive the assigned pre-treatment
Those who were not performed blinded evaluation because the physician prescribing the pre-treatment drug and the examining physician were the same physician

Safety analysis set

The study population will consist of all enrolled patients for whom protocol testing is initiated.

Data collection

An electronic data capture system will be used to collect the data necessary for this clinical study. The person responsible for preparing the case report form will promptly enter the necessary data into the electronic data capture system and confirm that the information regarding individual research subjects has been recorded correctly. Authentication and access rights to the electronic data capture system will be secured using identifiers and passwords, and encrypted communication will be used for data transmission.

Statistical analysis plan

Participant characteristics are summarized descriptively. The number of observations, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, maximum and interquartile range of continuous variables and frequency distributions of categorical variables are calculated.

The proportion of patients with a bowel cleanliness score ≥ 6 is calculated for each group. The difference between groups and 95% confidence interval is estimated using Miettinen-Nurminen method. Noninferiority will be declared when the lower limit of the confidence interval is above the margin. For secondary purpose, we plan to conduct the adjusted analysis using regression models and subgroup analysis restricted to the participants who answer "take more than half" or "take all of the medication".

Secondary endpoints will bel summarized appropriately and compared between the groups using nonparametric tests. Multiplicity adjustment will not perform for the secondary endpoints.

Frequency distributions of the grade of adverse events will be summarized for each group. Group comparison will be performed using the Fisher's exact test, if necessary.

### A phase 2 evaluation of a new flavored peg and sulfate solution compared to an over-the-counter laxative, peg and sports drink bowel preparation combination [^115CSY6Y]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite improvements in prescription bowel preparation technology, a significant proportion of colonoscopy preparations offered to patients are not approved by the FDA, but rather are over-the-counter laxative combinations. This is likely because bowel preparation is repeatedly cited as the worst part of the colonoscopy experience and an impediment to recommended surveillance. To combat prep hesitancy on the part of patients, many physicians have adopted an unapproved bowel preparation for colonoscopy that consists of an over-the-counter polyethylene glycol (PEG-3350) laxative combined with a "sports drink" (PEG-SD) such as Gatorade®. A stimulant laxative (e.g. bisacodyl) is frequently included in this regimen. This combination contains electrolytes and sugar in addition to PEG, however the electrolyte content, particularly sodium, is much lower than in most formulated bowel preparations. As a result, PEG-SD is an osmotically and electrolyte unbalanced formulation. Studies of its effects on fluid and electrolyte balance have shown that in normal volunteers PEG-SD results in body absorption of large volumes of water and substantial losses of sodium. In a study by Matro et al. patients were randomized to receive PEG-SD (n = 180) or polyethylene glycol with electrolytes and ascorbic acid (PEG-EA), an FDA approved bowel preparation (MOVIPREP ®, Salix Pharmaceuticals, Bridgewater, NJ) (n = 184) and collected clinical chemistry data at baseline and on the day of colonoscopy. The incidence of hyponatremia (serum sodium < 136 mmol/L) was higher in the PEG-SD group (3.9%) versus the PEG-EA treated group (2.2%). Following preparation, statistically significant changes from baseline were associated with PEG-SD for serum sodium, potassium and chloride.

### Highlights of prescribing information… [^112QQPgC]. FDA (DailyMed) (2023). Medium credibility.

In patients with normal baseline values, the most common electrolyte abnormality following study drug, on the day of colonoscopy, was increased magnesium. These changes were transient and resolved without intervention. Renal Function Parameters In patients with normal baseline values, at 48 to 72 hours after bowel preparation, an increase in serum creatinine of > 0. 3 mg/dL and/or a decrease in eGFR of > 25% were reported in 2% of SUFLAVE-treated patients and 0 patients treated with active comparator in Study 1 and 1% of SUFLAVE-treated patients and 3% of patients treated with active comparator in Study
2. These changes were transient and resolved. SUFLAVE can reduce the absorption of other co-administered drugs: Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and SUFLAVE may increase the risk of mucosal ulceration or ischemic colitis. Avoid use of stimulant laxatives while taking SUFLAVE. The safety and effectiveness of SUFLAVE in pediatric patients have not been established. Of the 460 patients who received SUFLAVE in clinical trials, 125 were 65 years of age or older. No differences in effectiveness of SUFLAVE were observed between geriatric patients and younger adult patients. Overdosage of more than the recommended dose of SUFLAVE may lead to severe electrolyte disturbances, as well as dehydration and hypovolemia, with signs and symptoms of these disturbances. Monitor for fluid and electrolyte disturbances and treat symptomatically.

SUFLAVE is an osmotic laxative and is provided in two bottles and two flavor enhancing packets for oral solution. The active ingredients contained in SUFLAVE are provided in Table 3. Each flavor enhancing packet contains anhydrous citric acid, colloidal silicon dioxide, malic acid, and sucralose.

### Polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium sulfate, potassium chloride, magnesium sulfate, and sodium chloride for oral solution (Suflave) [^116HRUG7]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

In Study 2 (NCT04446312), 450 adult patients were included in the efficacy analysis. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 80 years (median age 57 years) and 58% were female. The racial distribution was 85% White, 10% African-American, 3% Asian, and < 1% American Indian or Alaska Native. The population was 21% Hispanic or Latino. Patients were randomized to one of the following two colon preparation regimens: SUFLAVE or sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate oral solution. Both preparations were administered according to a split-dose regimen [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Patients receiving SUFLAVE were limited to a low residue breakfast followed by clear liquids on the day prior to the colonoscopy; patients receiving the comparator bowel prep were allowed a light breakfast followed by clear liquids on the day prior to the colonoscopy.

The primary efficacy endpoint in each trial was the proportion of patients with successful colon cleansing, as assessed by the blinded colonoscopist utilizing the four-point scale described in Table 4. Success was defined as an overall cleansing assessment of 3 (Good) or 4 (Excellent).

Results for the primary endpoint in Studies 1 and 2 are shown in Table 5. In both trials, SUFLAVE was non-inferior to the active comparator.

Figure 4
Percentage changes in levels of haematocrit, red blood cells and haemoglobin from baseline to the end of dosing (left) and from baseline to the end of colonoscopy (right). Baseline is the value measured before dosing. Significances of percentage changes in red blood cells and haemoglobin between the PEG-Asc-S and PEG-ES groups, and that between the PEG-Asc-M and PEG-ES groups were the same as those of haematocrit (not shown here; detailed description given in the onlines S2 and S3). ✱✱✱ p < 0.001. PEG-Asc, polyethylene glycol-ascorbic acid solution; PEG-ES, polyethylene glycol-electrolyte solution.

The percentage changes in Ht from baseline to the end of colonoscopy in the PEG-Asc-S and PEG-Asc-M groups (−0.64% and −0.45%, respectively) were significantly smaller than that in the PEG-ES group (−2.47%) when compared in absolute values. The difference between the percentage change from baseline to the end of dosing and that from baseline to the end of colonoscopy would reflect the extent of rehydration during colonoscopy, which was 4.17 ± 0.34%, 4.56 ± 0.35% and 3.78 ± 0.32% in the PEG-Asc-S, PEG-Asc-M and PEG-ES groups, respectively. No significant difference was observed in rehydration between any two groups.

2.1 Important Preparation and Administration Instructions

Correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities before treatment with Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Two doses of Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution are required for a complete preparation for colonoscopy. The time interval between the two doses depends on the regimen prescribed and the planned timing of the colonoscopy procedure [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].
The "Split-Dose" is the preferred method and consists of two separate doses: the first dose is taken the evening before the colonoscopy, and the second dose is taken the next day, the morning of the day of the colonoscopy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
The "Evening Only" is the alternative method and consists of two separate doses: both doses are taken in the evening before the day of the colonoscopy, with a minimum of 1.5 hours between the start of the first dose and the start of the second dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].
Both Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution dosing regimens require administration of Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution using the mixing container provided to reconstitute the contents of Pouch A and B with water to the Fill Line. Do not reconstitute with other liquids and/or add starch-based thickeners to the mixing container [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].
Additional clear liquids (including water) must be consumed in both dosing regimens [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Consume only clear liquids (no solid food) from the start of Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution treatment until after the colonoscopy.
Do not eat or drink alcohol, milk, anything colored red or purple or any other foods containing pulp material.
Do not take other laxatives while taking Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].
Do not take oral medications within 1 hour before or after starting each dose of Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

### Novel 1 L polyethylene glycol-based bowel preparation (NER1006): proof of concept assessment versus standard 2 L polyethylene glycol with ascorbate-a randomized, parallel group, phase 2, colonoscopist-blinded trial [^117QXB4n]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study has confirmed that PEG and Asc (vitamin C), when combined in two carefully selected doses for split-dosing administration, can create a new, low-volume PEG-based bowel preparation with a clinically useful bowel-cleansing efficacy plus a promising safety and tolerability profile. The selected candidate 1 L PEG + Asc bowel preparation identified in this study, LVPEG-4, has now been investigated as part of a larger, multi-center, Phase 3 program with a more representative patient population in studies that are sufficiently powered to assess cleansing performance.

### Comparison of the effectiveness of polyethylene glycol with and without electrolytes in constipation: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115LSyxa]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This network meta-analysis has confirmed that polyethylene glycol with and without electrolytes are effective and safe treatments for constipation in adults. There was no difference in the number of bowel movements per week and there appears to be no differences with respect to safety or tolerability between the two preparations. The addition of electrolytes in this clinical setting does not appear to offer any clinical benefits over polyethylene glycol alone.

### Efficacy of 1 L polyethylene glycol plus ascorbic acid with linaclotide versus senna for bowel preparation: a multicenter, endoscopist-blinded, randomized controlled trial (apple trial) [^113Rs2KD]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Linaclotide with 1 L PEG-Asc significantly improved BP quality compared with the senna regimen without reducing tolerability. Furthermore, the linaclotide regimen demonstrated efficacy even in the high-risk group with inadequate BP. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multicenter randomized controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of linaclotide as an adjunct laxative to 1 L PEG-Asc.

The demand for low-volume regimens with high tolerability is increasing. Although several low-volume agents (≤ 1-L) such as sodium picosulfate with magnesium citrate, PEG with a high concentration of ascorbate, sodium phosphate solution, or oral sulfate solution were developed, these regimens except for oral sulfate solution failed to meet the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy's quality standard of 90%. In addition, these hyperosmotic and stimulant agents have been reported to increase risks such as colonic ischemia, renal impairment, and electrolyte disturbance, and the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy does not recommend the routine use of these agents owing to their safety profile. Moreover, most of these low-volume regimens do not eliminate the need for patients to ingest large amounts of fluids along with laxatives to maintain hydration, amounting to 3–4 L of fluids. Therefore, various adjuvants combined with PEG-based solutions have been explored to enhance BP quality and minimize its volume and risks. In this study, the 1L-PEG/AL demonstrated higher efficacy with a safety profile similar to that of 1L-PEG/AS, which we previously reported to have noninferior efficacy and greater tolerability compared with the standard 2 L PEG-Asc regimen. Although a direct comparison between the linaclotide and standard regimen has not been made, the former may demonstrate noninferiority or even superiority to the standard regimen. In addition, the mean total volume in the 1 L-PEG/AL regimen was < 2 L, representing a significant step toward a real reduction of total liquids, potentially enhancing patient acceptability.

The efficacy analysis included 308 adult patients who had an elective colonoscopy. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 88 years old (mean age about 59 years old) with 52% female and 48% male patients. Table 3 displays the results.

4L PEG+E's responder rate was not significantly higher than Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution's responder rate.

In Study 2, patients were randomized to one of the following two colon preparation treatments: 1) 2 liters of Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution with 1 additional liter of clear liquid in the evening prior to the colonoscopy and 2) 90 mL of oral sodium phosphate solution (90 mL OSPS) with at least 2 liters of additional clear liquid during the day and evening prior to the colonoscopy. Patients randomized to Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution therapy were allowed to have a morning breakfast; a light lunch; and clear soup and/or plain yogurt for dinner. Dinner had to be completed at least one hour prior to initiation of the colon preparation administration.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with effective colon cleansing as judged by the colonoscopist and one blinded gastroenterologist (on the basis of videotapes recorded during the colonoscopy). In case of a discrepancy between the colonoscopist and the blinded gastroenterologist, a second blinded gastroenterologist made the final efficacy determination.

The efficacy analysis included 280 adult patients who had an elective colonoscopy. Patients ranged in age from 21 to 76 years old (mean age about 53 years old) with 47% female and 53% male patients. Table 4 displays the results.

Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution's responder rate was not significantly higher than OSPS's responder rate.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Drugs that increase risk of fluid and electrolyte imbalance. (7.1)

7.1 Drugs That May Increase Risks of Fluid and Electrolyte Abnormalities

Use caution when prescribing SUFLAVE to patients taking medications that increase the risk of fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure, arrhythmias, and prolonged QT in the setting of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4)].

7.2 Potential for Reduced Drug Absorption

SUFLAVE can reduce the absorption of other co-administered drugs [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]:

Administer oral medications at least one hour before starting each dose of SUFLAVE.
Administer tetracycline and fluoroquinolone antibiotics, iron, digoxin, chlorpromazine, and penicillamine at least 2 hours before and not less than 6 hours after administration of each dose of SUFLAVE to avoid chelation with magnesium.

7.3 Stimulant Laxatives

Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and SUFLAVE may increase the risk of mucosal ulceration or ischemic colitis. Avoid use of stimulant laxatives (e.g., bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate) while taking SUFLAVE [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Trial intervention

The enrolled patients will be scheduled to undergo colonoscopy between 2 and 90 days from the date of registration. The patients will be allocated to either the standard group or test group. They will consume only low-residue meal packets during the day before the colonoscopy. Laxative use and the internal use of intestinal peristalsis-promoting drugs in combination with pre-treatment drugs are not allowed. Patients using oral antithrombotic drugs should take measures such as medication withdrawal in accordance with the guidelines for gastrointestinal endoscopy practice for patients using antithrombotic drugs and supplement 2017 regarding anticoagulants, including direct oral anticoagulants, published by the Japanese Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. Heparin bridges will not be performed because of the high incidence of posterior haemorrhages. A protocol including the examination of the results of ingesting a low-residue meal pack the day before colonoscopy and the administration of bowel-cleansing agents and additional fluids will be specified for each group and performed at the end of the colonoscopy. Endoscopic resection performed during the protocol examination will be included in the protocol examination, but any additional treatment to be performed at a later date is not specified. The 30-day follow-up period comprises the end of the protocol.

Standard group

After dinner on the day before the colonoscopy, between 6:00and 7:00, the patient will consume 1 L of PEG plus ascorbic acid and 0.5 L of fluid (water or tea) over the course of at least 1 h. On the day of the colonoscopy, the patient will fast and consume 1 L of PEG plus ascorbic acid and 0.5 L of fluid (water or tea) over the course of at least 1 h between 4 and 5 h before the scheduled start of the examination.

### A phase 2 evaluation of a new flavored peg and sulfate solution compared to an over-the-counter laxative, peg and sports drink bowel preparation combination [^1157rEF5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Studies by Walker et al. have demonstrated that PEG-SD produces less cleansing diarrhea (2.0 L) than other FDA approved bowel preparations (e.g. oral sulfate solution = 3.3 L, PEG-EA = 3.0 L) which helps to explain reports by Matro et al. that PEG-SD bowel preparation produces inferior cleansing compared to other FDA approved preparations. Nevertheless, physicians continue to recommend PEG-SD because patient perception and completion rates are better relative to high-volume 4-liter options.

To provide healthcare practitioners and patients the positive attributes of PEG-SD (e.g. taste, low volume) in an electrolyte-balanced formulation, a new sports drink-like flavored PEG and sulfate solution (FPSS, SUFLAVE ®, Braintree Laboratories, Inc.) was developed and recently approved by the FDA. This preparation does not require the addition of bisacodyl (a harsh stimulant laxative associated with reports of ischemic colitis) to improve efficacy. The FDA requires all approved prescription bowel preparations to warn against concurrent use of stimulant laxatives due to the risk of mucosal ulceration and ischemic colitis. In Phase 1 development studies, FPSS produced 3.5 L of cleansing diarrhea, comparable to oral sulfate solution. This report describes a preliminary evaluation of the safety, efficacy and tolerance of FPSS compared to PEG-SD for bowel preparation prior to colonoscopy in adult patients.

### Efficacy of 1 L polyethylene glycol plus ascorbic acid with linaclotide versus senna for bowel preparation: a multicenter, endoscopist-blinded, randomized controlled trial (apple trial) [^113MW3pV]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION:

No bowel preparation (BP) for colonoscopy achieves optimal efficacy and tolerability. Combining polyethylene glycol plus ascorbic acid (PEG-Asc) with adjuvants has been explored to enhance cleansing efficacy and reduce the required volume. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether adding 0.5 mg linaclotide to 1 L PEG-Asc (1 L-PEG/AL) improves superior cleansing compared with adding 24 mg senna (1 L-PEG/AS), which we previously reported to be noninferior to the standard regimen of 2 L PEG-Asc.

METHODS:

A multicenter, endoscopist-blinded, randomized controlled trial was conducted at 5 centers in Japan with outpatients scheduled for colonoscopy. The primary outcome was adequate BP, evaluated using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale. Analyses were stratified based on low-risk and high-risk groups for inadequate BP.

RESULTS:

Between April 2022 and April 2023, 1,464 patients were randomized to the 1L-PEG/AL (n = 731) or 1L-PEG/AS (n = 733). The 1L-PEG/AL demonstrated higher adequate BP rates (92% vs 86%, P = 0.001) compared with 1L-PEG/AS. Both groups experienced similar adverse events and expressed high willingness for repeat BP (83% vs 81%, P = 0.49). In high-risk patients (n = 892), 1L-PEG/AL had significantly higher adequate BP rates (94% vs 86%, P < 0.001), whereas rates were comparably high in low-risk patients (n = 539) (94% vs 94%, P = 0.66).

DISCUSSION:

The linaclotide regimen was superior to the senna regimen reagrding BP efficacy without reducing tolerability. It can be a promising new option for BP, especially in patients at a high risk of inadequate BP.

Bowel preparation regimens for colonoscopy — Table 7 lists commonly used options with volumes and standard split-dose timing. For polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution (PEG-ELS) (GoLYTELY CoLyte), the standard regimen approach is "2 L night before and same dose on examination day". Low-volume agents include "2 L PEG-ELS plus ascorbate (MoviPrep)" and "1 L PEG plus ascorbate (PLENVU)", with the standard regimen approach "16 oz clear liquids per 500 cc night before and same dose on examination day". An oral sulfate option "Oral sodium sulfate tablets (SUTAB Liquid: SUPREP)" specifies "12 oz of purgative and 2.5 L H2O Or 24 tablets and 2 L H2O" and dosing "6 oz or 12 tablets night before and same dose on day of examination". Contraindications listed include "Bowel obstruction, ileus, allergy/ hypersensitivity to ingredients".

Table 7.
Solicited symptoms

Laboratory results are shown below in Table 9 for the study population for visit 1 (baseline) and visit 2 (day of colonoscopy). Although some statistically significant differences between the treatment groups were detected for some analytes, changes tended to be small and none were deemed clinically important. Although not considered clinically important, serum magnesium increased above normal range for about 25% of OST subjects. This was not unexpected because of the presence of magnesium in the OST formulation. Comparisons of laboratory results between elderly and nonelderly populations taking OST revealed no interactions unique to the elderly population, except for anion gap where elderly OST subjects experienced a mean increase in anion gap of 2.6 mEq/L compared with an increase of 1.8 mEq/L in the PEG-EA group.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The primary mode of action is the osmotic effects of polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium sulfate and magnesium sulfate, which induce a laxative effect. The physiological consequence is increased water retention in the lumen of the colon, resulting in loose stools.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

After administration of the first dose of SUFLAVE in 18 healthy subjects, the mean ± SD maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for polyethylene glycol 3350 of 3.4 ± 1.4 mcg/mL was reached at 4 hours, and the mean ± SD serum Cmaxfor sulfate of 27.0 ± 11.4 mcg/mL was reached at 6 hours. Following a second dose of SUFLAVE (approximately 12 hours later), the mean ± SD plasma Cmaxfor polyethylene glycol 3350 of 2.9 ± 0.97 mcg/mL was reached at 4 hours, and the mean ± SD serum Cmaxfor sulfate of 29.2 ± 11.0 mcg/mL was reached at 3 hours. Sulfate concentrations were below the limit of quantitation (19.2 mcg/mL) for all subjects by follow-up Day 3. Polyethylene glycol 3350 concentrations were below the limit of quantitation (LOQ 0.01 mcg/mL) for 16 of 18 subjects by follow-up Day 7.

PEG-ELS (polyethylene glycol–electrolyte lavage solution) 2 L + citrate — In a randomized study, 4 L PEG-ELS (n = 209) versus 2 L PEG + citrate (n = 213) had similar bowel preparation quality, safety, and adherence; patient tolerance and acceptability were greater with 2 L PEG + citrate, including more reporting no distress (2 L PEG + citrate 72.8% vs PEG 41.63%, P = 0.0314) and higher willingness-to-repeat (93.9% vs 82.2%, P = 0.0002). Outcomes versus 2 L PEG + ascorbate were equivalent, and 2 L PEG-ELS + citrate is approved by the FDA for use as a bowel preparation regimen.

BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Guidelines in Europe and the United States recommend dividing the doses of polyethylene glycol (PEG) as the most effective bowel cleansing method.

Due to the recent increase in demand for colonoscopies, an increasing number of medical facilities have begun offering colonoscopies during morning hours. Therefore, the demand for split-dose methods for colonoscopies that involve a short time between the initial administration of the internal bowel preparation solution and the completion of bowel preparation is expected to increase in the future.

SP/MC has been approved in Japan and can be administered either on the day before the examination or as split doses. In Japan, a phase III, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial involving an SP/MC split-dose group, SP/MC 1-day group, and 2-L PEG same-day group was performed. The SP/MC split-dose resulted in the best colon preparation and was statistically noninferior to the 2-L PEG same-day dose. Additionally, SP/MC was significantly superior to PEG in terms of acceptability because of its ease of consumption, general impression, taste, and volume. However, a meta-analysis of 25 randomised, controlled trials of SP/MC and PEG in Europe and the United States found no statistically significant difference in bowel cleanliness and a trend toward better cleanliness with PEG (relative risk [RR], 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86–1.01). Furthermore, the acceptability of SP/MC was significantly better (RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.04–1.13).

The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of
patients with effective colon cleansing as judged by the colonoscopist and one
blinded gastroenterologist (on the basis of videotapes recorded during the
colonoscopy). In case of a discrepancy between the colonoscopist and the
blinded gastroenterologist, a second blinded gastroenterologist made the final
efficacy determination.

The efficacy analysis included 280 adult patients who had an elective
colonoscopy. Patients ranged in age from 21 to 76 years old (mean age about 53
years old) with 47% female and 53% male patients. Table 4 displays the results.

BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Colonoscopy procedures

The defaecation status and subjective symptoms will be evaluated after the examination.
Participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire before the colonoscopy.
Blood samples will be collected on the same day to detect electrolyte, renal and liver function abnormalities due to bowel preparation. Blood samples will be collected after the end of the examination if they cannot be collected before the colonoscopy.
All tests conducted during this study will be conducted as outpatient tests.
A deviation from the protocol will be considered if an inpatient examination is required.
Hospital admission after the completion of the colonoscopy will not be considered a deviation from the protocol.
The level of the examiner will be intermediate or higher (experience with at least 500 colonoscopies).
The examining physician will be blinded to the allocation group. The physician who prescribes the pre-treatment drug and the examining physician will be different. If the same physician performs both procedures, then those results will be excluded from the per-protocol analysis.
The procedure will be performed using a general colonoscope. The manufacturer and model of the scope used will not be specified.
Intravenous administration of the antispasmodic butyl scopolamine or glucagon will be recommended.
Intravenous opioid analgesics will be recommended.
Intravenous administration of benzodiazepine sedatives will be acceptable.
This study will assume total resection of tumorous lesions detected during the protocol examination and will document the endoscopic resection method and pathological results.
Serrated polyps will be, in principle, resected, except for those smaller than 5 mm on the left-sided colon and the rectum. However, priority will be given to resecting adenomatous polyps. Serrated adenomas and adenomas usually will be treated similarly.
The location, gross type, tumour diameter, and endoscopic diagnosis (serrated polyps, adenomas, early CRC, advanced CRC, and neuroendocrine tumours) of neoplastic lesions will be recorded.
The method of resection and the medical equipment will not be specified.
Pathological results will indicate the diagnosis and, in cases of cancer, the depth of invasion.
Lesions planned for endoscopic resection or surgery at a later date will be described in terms of the endoscopic diagnosis (e.g. serrated polyps, adenomas, early CRC, advanced CRC, and neuroendocrine tumours) and planned treatment (e.g. endoscopic mucosal resection, endoscopic submucosal dissection, and surgery).
The cecal intubation time and withdrawal time will be recorded.
After completion of the colonoscopy, the examining physician will record the bowel cleansing status according to the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) and Aronchik scale.
If a colonoscope is inserted and the total colonoscopy is deemed impossible to perform because of poor preparation, then it will be permissible to perform additional preparation before attempting the colonoscopy again on the same day after the BBPS and Aronchik scale scores have been assessed. If re-examination is not feasible on the same day, then it will be considered a deviation from the protocol inspection provisions and routine performance of the colonoscopy.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

In the MoviPrep trials, abdominal distension, anal discomfort,
thirst, nausea, and abdominal pain were some of the most common adverse
reactions to MoviPrep administration. Since diarrhea was considered as a part
of the efficacy of MoviPrep, diarrhea was not defined as an adverse reaction in
the clinical studies. Tables 1 and 2 display the most common drug-related
adverse reactions of MoviPrep and its comparator in the controlled MoviPrep
trials.

* Drug-related adverse reactions were adverse events that were possibly, probably,
or definitely related to the study drug.

† 4L PEG + E is 4 liter Polyethylene Glycol plus Electrolytes Solution

* Drug-related adverse reactions were adverse events that were possibly, probably,
or definitely related to the study drug. In addition to the recording of
spontaneous adverse events, patients were also specifically asked about the
occurrence of the following symptoms: shivering, anal irritations, abdominal
bloating or fullness, sleep loss, nausea, vomiting, weakness, hunger sensation.
abdominal cramps or pain, thirst sensation, and dizziness.

† OSPS is Oral Sodium Phosphate Solution

Isolated cases of urticaria, rhinorrhea, dermatitis, and anaphylactic
reaction have been reported with PEG-based products and may represent allergic
reactions.

Published literature contains isolated reports of serious adverse events
following the administration of PEG-based products in patients over 60 years of
age. These adverse events included upper gastrointestinal bleeding from a
Mallory-Weiss tear, esophageal perforation, asystole, and acute pulmonary edema
after aspirating the PEG-based preparation.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the
following adverse events have been identified during post-approval use of
MoviPrep. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown
size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for
inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting or causal
connection to MoviPrep, or a combination of these factors.

General: Hypersensitivity
reactions including anaphylaxis, rash, urticaria, lip and facial swelling,
dyspnea, chest tightness and throat tightness.

Test formulations and colonoscopy

Each LVPEG consisted of two different powders for reconstitution into oral solution for split evening and morning dosing. To produce the cathartic effect, LVPEGs had PEG3350, Asc and sodium sulfate in varying amounts across the two doses. They also contained potassium chloride and sodium chloride, which were used to replace electrolytes lost through the osmotic effects of the formulations. The control had the same amounts of PEG, Asc and sodium sulfate in each dose. Compared to the control, LVPEGs contained less PEG and sodium sulfate, but about 2.5× the amount of Asc (except for LVPEG-5, which contained about 2× the amount of Asc). Each formulation was also taste- and flavor-optimized.

LVPEG-1 and LVPEG-3 both included Asc in the morning dose, whereas LVPEG-2 (LVPEG-1 regimen in reverse order) was the only LVPEG to have Asc in the evening dose. Preparation reconstitution volumes varied from 500 to 750 mL per dose. Based on its low preparation volume, significant effect on 24-h stool weight, and acceptable tolerability, LVPEG-3 was selected as the lead candidate for Part 2 of the study. Colonoscopy patients thus received LVPEG-3; one of its two variants, LVPEG-4 (with a lower required-additional-fluid-volume) or LVPEG-5 (with less Asc); or the control.

In both Parts 1 and 2 of the study, all bowel preparations were administered in an overnight split-dosing fashion following a standardized meal plan where all participants ate the same breakfast (09:00), snack (11:00) and light lunch (14:00). There were no food restrictions specified in the period before the study began. The first (evening) dose was taken on Day 1 of the study, after fasting from 14:00. Between 17:00 and 18:00, intake began over a maximum of 2 h. On Day 2, after overnight fasting and starting between 07:00 and 08:00, the second (morning) dose was taken over a maximum of 2 h. After each dose, variable volumes of mandatory additional clear fluid were needed to make up a total mandatory fluid volume of 3 L (or 2 L for LVPEG-4). Subjects could also consume ad libitum fluid as their thirst dictated; these volumes were recorded in Part 2 and included in the total fluid volumes.

### A randomized, controlled trial of oral sulfate solution plus polyethylene glycol as a bowel preparation for colonoscopy [^114AC8dR]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Background

No bowel preparation for colonoscopy is optimal with regard to efficacy, safety, and tolerability. New options for bowel preparation are needed.

Objective

To compare a new hybrid preparation consisting of a reduced dose of oral sulfate solution (OSS) plus 2 L of sulfate-free electrolyte lavage solution (SF-ELS) with 2 low-volume preparations based on polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solution (PEG-ELS).

Design

Two randomized, controlled trials.

Setting

Twenty-four U.S. centers.

Patients

A total of 737 outpatients undergoing colonoscopy.

Interventions

In study 1, OSS plus SF-ELS was given as a split dose, and in study 2, OSS plus SF-ELS was given in its entirety the evening before colonoscopy. In study 1, the active control was 2 L of PEG-ELS plus ascorbic acid (PEG-EA) given as a split dose. In study 2, the control was 10 mg of bisacodyl plus 2 L of SF-ELS taken the evening before colonoscopy.

Main Outcome Measurements

Rates of successful (good or excellent) bowel preparation.

Results

In study 1, the rates of successful (excellent or good) preparation with OSS plus SF-ELS and PEG-EA were identical at 93.5% for split-dose preparation. OSS plus SF-ELS was noninferior to PEG-EA (P < .001). In study 2, OSS plus SF-ELS resulted in successful preparation in 89.8% of patients compared with 83.5% with bisacodyl plus SF-ELS in a same-day preparation regimen. OSS plus SF-ELS was noninferior to bisacodyl plus SF-ELS (P < .001). In study 1, vomiting was more frequent with OSS plus SF-ELS (13.5% vs 6.7%; p = 0.042), and bloating was rated worse with PEG-EA (P = 0.025). In study 2, overall discomfort was rated worse with OSS plus SF-ELS (mean score 2.1 vs 1.8; p = 0.032). There were no deaths in either study and no serious adverse events considered related to the preparation.

Limitations

Bowel cleansing was not scored by colon segment. Adenoma detection was not compared between the regimens.

Conclusion

OSS plus SF-ELS is a new, safe, and effective bowel preparation for colonoscopy.

5.1 Serious Fluid and Electrolyte Abnormalities

Advise all patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of SUFLAVE. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration after taking SUFLAVE, consider performing post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN).

Bowel preparation products can cause fluid and electrolyte disturbances, which can lead to serious adverse reactions including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and renal impairment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities before treatment with SUFLAVE. Use SUFLAVE with caution in patients with conditions, or who are using medications [such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)], that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of seizure, arrhythmias, and renal impairment [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.2 Cardiac Arrythmias

There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. These occur predominantly in patients with underlying cardiac risk factors and electrolyte disturbances. Use caution when prescribing SUFLAVE for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT interval, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or cardiomyopathy). Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias.

5.3 Seizures

There have been reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or loss of consciousness associated with use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities.

Use caution when prescribing SUFLAVE for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at increased risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, or patients with known or suspected hyponatremia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Navigating bowel preparation for colonoscopy: a comprehensive overview [^112qgA17]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the United States. Early detection through colonoscopy significantly improves survival rates. Detecting colon polyps depends on the quality of bowel preparation. However, inadequate bowel preparation remains a significant issue in clinical practice. Efforts to address this challenge have led to the development of bowel preparation regimens emphasizing efficacy, tolerability, and safety. Bowel preparation options can be categorized by their osmotic and volume properties. Isosmotic solutions based on polyethylene glycol-electrolyte lavage solutions (PEG-ELS) are available in both low-volume PEG-ELS with ascorbic acid (PEG-Asc) (e.g. MoviPrep, PLENVU) and high-volume formulations (e.g. GoLYTELY, CoLyte), as well as sulfate-free high-volume PEG-ELS formulations (SF-PEG-ELS). Hyperosmotic solutions include oral sulfate solution (OSS) (e.g. SUPREP), sodium phosphate tablets (NaP) (e.g. OsmoPrep), oral sulfate tablets (OST) (e.g. SUTAB), flavored PEG with sulfate salts (FPSS) (e.g. SUFLAVE), and magnesium citrate. Hypoosmotic solutions consist of PEG-sports drink (PEG-SD). In addition, combination solutions are available, such as sodium picosulfate with magnesium citrate (SPMC) with laxatives (e.g. CLENPIQ), and OSS with SF-PEG-ELS (Suclear). Each regimen differs in terms of cost, volume, taste, contraindications, and potential adverse effects. Therefore, clinicians must carefully evaluate each patient to determine the most suitable regimen for their patients.

BP method

All patients received verbal and written instructions from the medical staff regarding BP and were instructed to consume a low-fiber diet and stop taking laxatives other than BP solution the day before the examination. Patients in the 1 L-PEG/AS group received 24 mg senna and those in the 1 L-PEG/AL group received 0.5 mg linaclotide at 8:00the day before colonoscopy, at the prescribed dosage for chronic constipation in Japan. Both groups drank 1 L PEG-Asc solution (Movie Prep; EA Pharma Co. Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) 4–6 hours before the procedure from 9:00 to 11:00, at a rate of 500 mL every 30 minutes, and drank 250 mL of water for every 500 mL of PEG-Asc. Patients were instructed to complete the procedure at least 2 hours before colonoscopy and subsequently drink clear liquids to ensure adequate hydration. Patients who did not defecate before the scheduled colonoscopy were recorded as having insufficient BP, treated with additional PEG-Asc or an enema to allow the colonoscopy to be performed.

Data collection

Demographic and comorbidity data were obtained using questionnaires. Chronic constipation was diagnosed based on evidence-based clinical guidelines for chronic constipation 2023. The severity of constipation was measured using the Constipation Scoring System (range 0–30). Colonoscopy and BP data were obtained through another questionnaire on the day of colonoscopy.

Colonoscopies were performed under sedation by 15 experienced gastroenterologists (experience of > 1,000 procedures) using 290 series of high-resolution colonoscopes equipped with a water jet pump (Olympus Optical Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). A complete colonoscopy was defined as arrival at the cecum. Incomplete colonoscopy was attributed to technical difficulty or strictures. Patients who canceled the treatment were asked to inquire about the reasons.

Study data were collected and managed using Research Electronic Data Capture, which is a secure web-based platform that facilitates data capture for research by offering an intuitive interface, audit trails, automated export procedures, and data integration capabilities with external sources.

### Randomized trial of low-volume PEG solution versus standard PEG + electrolytes for bowel cleansing before colonoscopy [^117DphJc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based gut lavage solutions are safe and effective, but require consumption of large volumes of fluid. We compared a new 2 L solution of PEG plus ascorbic acid (PEG + Asc) with standard 4 L PEG with electrolytes (PEG + E) for bowel cleansing before colonoscopy to determine efficacy, safety, and patient acceptability.

Methods

Consenting adult inpatients scheduled to undergo colonoscopy were randomized to receive either 2 L PEG + Asc or 4 L PEG + E. Preparations were taken as split doses the evening before colonoscopy and the following morning. The PEG + Asc group took 1 L at each administration (i.e., total dose of 2 L). The PEG + E group took 2 L at each administration (i.e., total dose of 4 L). Bowel cleansing success was assessed via videotapes by independent, blinded raters. Statistical noninferiority was predefined as a difference of < 15% in the lower limit of the 97.5% confidence interval for treatment difference. Patient views on the preparations were elicited. Adverse events were noted.

Results

Successful gut cleansing was achieved in 136 of 153 (88.9%) cases of the PEG + Asc group and 147 of 155 (94.8%) cases of the 4 L PEG + E group (mean difference -5.9 [-12.0-infinity]). The difference fell within the predefined limit for noninferiority. Clinical and laboratory parameters showed no difference in safety profile. Patient ratings of acceptability and taste were better for the PEG + Asc group than for the PEG + E group (P < 0.025).

Conclusions

The combination of ascorbic acid and PEG-based bowel preparation reduces the volume patients have to drink without compromising efficacy or safety. The low-volume PEG + Asc preparation was more acceptable to patients, and should, therefore, improve effectiveness in routine practice.

### Effective bowel cleansing before colonoscopy: a randomized study of split-dosage versus non-split dosage regimens of high-volume versus low-volume polyethylene glycol solutions [^116xYZwj]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Adequate bowel cleansing is essential for a high-quality, effective, and safe colonoscopy.

Objectives

To evaluate the degree of colon cleansing comparing split-dosage versus non-split-dosage intake of two different polyethylene glycol (PEG) volumes (low-volume PEG + ascorbic acid vs standard-volume PEG-electrolyte solution) and to identify predictors of poor bowel cleansing.

Design

Single-blind, active control, randomized study.

Setting

Tertiary-care institutions in Italy.

Patients

This study involved adult patients undergoing elective colonoscopy.

Intervention

Colonoscopy with different bowel preparation methods.

Main Outcome Measurements

Degree of bowel cleansing.

Results

We randomized 895 patients, and 868 patients were finally included in intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Overall compliance was excellent (97%) for both preparation methods. No difference in tolerability was recorded. Palatability was superior with low volume compared with high volume (acceptable or good 58% vs 51%, respectively, P < .005), independently of intake schedule. PEG plus ascorbic acid produced the same degree of cleansing as standard-volume PEG-electrolyte solution (77% vs 73.4%, respectively, within the split-dosage group and 41.7% vs 44.3%, respectively, within the non-split-dosage group). Independently of PEG volumes, the split-dosage regimen produced markedly superior cleansing results over the same-day method (good/excellent 327/435, 75.2% vs 186/433, 43.0%, P = 0.00001). Maximum cleansing was observed in colonoscopies performed within 8 hours from the last fluid intake versus over 8 hours from the last fluid intake (P < .001). The degree of bowel cleansing affected both cecal intubation (failed intubation 11.7% with fair/poor preparation vs 1.2% with good/excellent preparation, P = 0.00001) and polyp detection rates (12.2% with fair/poor vs 24.6% with good/excellent preparation, P = 0.001). Aborted procedures were significantly more frequent in the non-split-dosage arm (21.2% vs 6.9%, odds ratio [OR] 3.60 [2.29–5.77], P < .0001). Independent predictors of poor bowel cleansing were male sex (OR 1.45 [1.08–1.96], P = 0.014) and a non-split-dosage bowel preparation schedule (OR 2.08 [1.89–2.37], P = 0.0001).

Conclusion

Low-volume PEG plus ascorbic acid is as effective as high-volume PEG-electrolyte solution but has superior palatability. A split-dosage schedule is the most effective bowel cleansing method. Colonoscopy should be performed within 8 hours of the last fluid intake.

### Comparison of the effectiveness of polyethylene glycol with and without electrolytes in constipation: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113xasSM]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Data extraction

Two reviewers were involved in a four-step approach for data collection. All steps were performed independently. First, titles and abstracts of the identified citations were screened to see if they met the study selection criteria. Full texts of potentially relevant articles were reviewed to assess if they met the selection criteria. For the studies that did meet the selection criteria, one reviewer conducted extraction of data using a standardised Excel spreadsheet. A second reviewer independently confirmed the accuracy of the extracted data. As the final step, both reviewers determined if the study was to be included in the systematic review and network meta-analysis. Disagreements were resolved by consensus involving an additional two reviewers.

The following study characteristics were extracted: author; title; journal; publication year; population (adult/paediatric); study design; patient age; characteristics; definition of constipation; inclusion/exclusion criteria; intent to treat population (ITT); per protocol population for defecation frequency; mean duration of constipation prior to study intervention; comparability of study groups; sub-analysis based on age; study duration; study medications, dose and duration of treatment. To avoid comparisons of different subjective composite measures of efficacy, a single objective outcome was selected for the primary analysis – mean number of bowel movements per week. Assessment of defaecation frequency was made after a 2-week treatment period (if available) or at end of treatment (mean plus standard deviation [SD] or standard error [SE]). When data was available for both bowel movements and complete spontaneous bowel movements per week the later data was used in the analysis. Where data was only available graphically, estimates of the values were extracted by scaled measurement. Where means were not available, medians and interquartile ranges were collected. All data were adjusted to mean number of bowel movements per week (plus standard deviation) to allow meaningful comparison between the studies. To assess secondary endpoints, data regarding safety, tolerability, and compliance or willingness to continue therapy were collected.

All included studies were assessed for the risk of bias by two reviewers according to recommendations outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Each potential source of bias was graded as high, low or unclear, relating to whether the potential for bias was low or high. Studies were considered as high quality if all of the criteria were graded as low risk of bias.

### Polyethylene glycol vs. sodium phosphate for bowel preparation: a treatment arm meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^11291s9w]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Results

Descriptive findings

One hundred seventy four abstracts were obtained from 1990 through 2008 using MEDLINE and EMBASE; 50 were excluded as they were either published prior to 1990 (n = 18), involved bowel preparation for non colonoscopy use (n = 11), were published in foreign language (n = 8), or were non-randomized controlled trials (n = 13). Of the 124 randomized controlled trials included for full text review, 53 trials were excluded. The number of articles and reasons for exclusion were as follows: trials which included a pediatric population (n = 6); trials that did not include PEG or NaP (n = 24); trials with no categorical data (n = 12); and trials with non-traditional doses of either prep (e.g. single dose 3L or 6L PEG solutions regimen, single dose NaP (45 mL or 90 mL; n = 11) were excluded (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Flow chart diagram for the studies identified in the meta-analysis.

For analysis, we included 71 randomized controlled trials involving 10,201 patients. Trial aggregation by treatment arm resulted in the following prep arms: 4 liter PEG with and without adjunctive medications (e.g. metoclopramide, dulcolax); 2 liter PEG; split-dose PEG; NaP solution - two 45 mL doses with and without adjunctive medications; and NaP tablets. All low volume PEG trials (i.e. 2 liter) invariably used an adjunctive medication such as bisacodyl (70%), senna (20%), and magnesium citrate or ascorbic acid (10%). Trials that used split dose PEG regimen either divided a 4 liter dose into 2 liter the day before and 2 liter on the day of the procedure or divided a 3 liter dose into 2 liter the day before and 1 liter the day of the procedure.

### Novel 1 L polyethylene glycol-based bowel preparation (NER1006): proof of concept assessment versus standard 2 L polyethylene glycol with ascorbate-a randomized, parallel group, phase 2, colonoscopist-blinded trial [^1123dYbD]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Bowel preparation is a critical factor in the diagnostic and therapeutic success of colonoscopy and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening.

Bowel preparations based on polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG3350) plus electrolyte solutions are well established. Ascorbic acid/sodium ascorbate (Asc), that is vitamin C, adds to the laxative effect of PEG3350 whilst also enabling a total volume reduction. The development of a 2 L PEG + Asc preparation halved the required preparation-volume intake versus older 4 L PEGs and thus represented a more convenient but still effective bowel preparation. As it was easier to complete, patients were more likely to be willing to undergo the procedure again if they received the 2 L PEG + Asc. However, even with 2 L PEG + Asc, a total-fluid-volume of 3 L should be ingested in a short time, and taking 2 L of a bowel preparation is still a challenge for some patients. Further volume reductions may thus help even more patients to successfully complete their bowel-preparations.

It was hypothesized that an effective low-volume bowel preparation could be achieved with an increased ascorbate amount/osmotic load. An initial clinical study exploring new low-volume PEG + Asc (LVPEG) split-dosing bowel preparations identified two test formulations suitable for further clinical investigation [data on file: Norgine]. The current study used taste- and flavor-optimized versions of these formulations to assess if they could repeat stool output achievements and demonstrate clinical proof of concept by achieving functional bowel cleansing.

### Efficacy of 1 L polyethylene glycol plus ascorbic acid with linaclotide versus senna for bowel preparation: a multicenter, endoscopist-blinded, randomized controlled trial (apple trial) [^1115RZo4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Bowel preparation (BP) is essential for high-quality colonoscopies. To achieve adequate BP, sufficient volume of BP solution must be administered; however, low tolerance to its volume remains an issue. Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based solutions are commonly used for BP. Recently, 2 L PEG containing ascorbic acid (PEG-Asc) has been established as an effective alternative to traditional 4 L PEG, improving patient tolerance. However, the dosage of 2 L still poses a burden. Therefore, several studies have reported the use of adjuvants to reduce the volume of PEG-Asc required to 1 L, thereby improving patient acceptability. We previously reported that 1 L PEG-Asc combined with senna regimen was noninferior to 2 L PEG-Asc. However, the appropriate type and combination of adjunctive agents with 1 L PEG-Asc remain unknown.

Linaclotide, a guanylate cyclase C receptor agonist approved for chronic constipation, can enhance luminal fluid secretion and mediate visceral analgesia, resulting in laxative effects and improved abdominal symptoms. Recent studies have explored the efficacy of linaclotide as an adjunct to BP before capsule endoscopy and colonoscopy. We also found that adding linaclotide to 1 L PEG-Asc yielded superior BP results in constipated patients and hypothesized that adding linaclotide to 1 L PEG-Asc would improve cleansing in all patients.

The aim of this study was to evaluate bowel cleansing efficacy, adverse events, and tolerability in the 1 L PEG-Asc with 0.5 mg linaclotide (1 L-PEG/AL) group compared with those in the 1 L PEG-Asc with 24 mg senna (1 L-PEG/AS) group.

### Comparison of the efficacy and tolerability of elobixibat plus sodium picosulfate with magnesium citrate and split-dose 2-L polyethylene glycol with ascorbic acid for bowel preparation before outpatient colonoscopy: a study protocol for the multicentre, randomised, controlled E-PLUS trial [^1124iMLT]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

The standard formulation of PEG requires a large dose of solution with a distinctive, unpleasant flavour; therefore, many individuals are resistant to its use. In contrast, SP/MC requires a small internal dose and ensures fluid intake because it is administered in another beverage. Clinical trials have shown that SP/MC is superior to PEG in terms of acceptability. Therefore, if the cleaning speed and effectiveness of SP/MC are improved, and if physicians and patients feel that it is comparable to PEG, then it could become part of the mainstream bowel preparation method. This study aims to develop a new bowel preparation method including SP/MC and a combination of drugs that are expected to enhance the cleansing effect.

Recently, several drugs with completely different pharmacological actions have been developed to treat chronic constipation. Among them, elobixibat, which has pharmacological actions such as increasing the water content and transport capacity in the intestinal tract, is expected to enhance the cleansing effect when used in combination with existing bowel-cleansing agents.

### A novel volume-reduced CT colonography regimen using hypertonic laxative (polyethylene glycol with ascorbic acid): randomized controlled trial [^1143fzax]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of bowel preparation using a hypertonic laxative (polyethylene glycol with ascorbic acid, PEG + Asc) for CT colonography (CTC) and to examine the volume limit of laxative.

Methods

In one institution, patients who met the indications for CTC were enrolled and randomly assigned to CTC with regimen A (800 mL PEG + Asc), B (600 mL PEG + Asc), or C (400 mL PEG + Asc). Sodium diatrizoate was given orally for fecal tagging. On the previous day, patients ate low-residue meals and took the assigned lavage solution after dinner. A reader blinded to the preparation graded residual stool/fluid and fecal tagging quality in six segments of the colorectum. The primary outcome was a proportion of colon segments without stool. One hundred twenty segments in 20 patients with each regimen were needed to show a non-inferiority margin of 15%, assuming 85% of no stool.

Results

A total of 360 segments in 60 patients were analyzed. There were 83% of segments with no stool in regimen A, 89% in regimen B, and 88% in regimen C. Using the delta method, the 95% confidence interval of the risk difference (6.7%) between regimens A and B was -2.2% to 15.6%, and the risk difference (5.0%) between regimens A and C was -4.1% to 14%, both within the non-inferiority margin. Residual fluid and fecal tagging quality were also within the non-inferiority margin. No adverse events occurred.

Conclusions

A novel CTC regimen using hypertonic laxative demonstrated optimal colon cleansing effectiveness even with the lowest volume of laxative (UMIN000022851).

Key Points

- A novel CTC regimen using a hypertonic laxative is feasible.
- The lowest volume of laxative provides excellent colon imaging.
- However, the lowest volume of laxative did not improve patient acceptance.

### Comparison of the efficacy and tolerability of elobixibat plus sodium picosulfate with magnesium citrate and split-dose 2-L polyethylene glycol with ascorbic acid for bowel preparation before outpatient colonoscopy: a study protocol for the multicentre, randomised, controlled E-PLUS trial [^115WEeH1]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium picosulfate (SP)/magnesium citrate (MC) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) plus ascorbic acid are recommended by Western guidelines as laxative solutions for bowel preparation. Clinically, SP/MC has a slower post-dose defaecation response than PEG and is perceived as less cleansing; therefore, it is not currently used for major bowel cancer screening preparation. The standard formulation for bowel preparation is PEG; however, a large dose is required, and it has a distinctive flavour that is considered unpleasant. SP/MC requires a small dose and ensures fluid intake because it is administered in another beverage. Therefore, clinical trials have shown that SP/MC is superior to PEG in terms of acceptability. We aim to compare the novel bowel cleansing method (test group) comprising SP/MC with elobixibat hydrate and the standard bowel cleansing method comprising PEG plus ascorbic acid (standard group) for patients preparing for outpatient colonoscopy.

Methods

This phase III, multicentre, single-blind, noninferiority, randomised, controlled, trial has not yet been completed. Patients aged 40–69 years will be included as participants. Patients with a history of abdominal or pelvic surgery, constipation, inflammatory bowel disease, or severe organ dysfunction will be excluded. The target number of research participants is 540 (standard group, 270 cases; test group, 270 cases). The primary endpoint is the degree of bowel cleansing (Boston Bowel Preparation Scale [BBPS] score ≥ 6). The secondary endpoints are patient acceptability, adverse events, polyp/adenoma detection rate, number of polyps/adenomas detected, degree of bowel cleansing according to the BBPS (BBPS score ≥ 8), degree of bowel cleansing according to the Aronchik scale, and bowel cleansing time.

Discussion

This trial aims to develop a "patient-first" colon cleansing regimen without the risk of inadequate bowel preparation by using both elobixibat hydrate and SP/MC.

Patients with previous inadequate bowel preparation — randomized trials of split-dose polyethylene glycol (PEG) regimens report that in a single-center, blind, randomized controlled trial of 256 subjects with previous inadequate preparation (BBPS score < 5), those assigned to 4 L PEG had a greater percentage of adequate bowel preparation (BBPS score ≥ 6) than a 2 L split-dose PEG + ascorbic acid regimen (81% vs 67%; OR 2.07; 95% CI 1.16–3.69) while following a 3-day low-residue diet with 10 mg of bisacodyl. In a multicenter, blind, randomized controlled trial with 196 subjects and prior inadequate preparation defined as inability to detect polyps ≤ 5 mm and an assigned shorter interval, 4 L split-dose PEG versus 6 L split-dose PEG (4 L/ 2 L) showed no differences in overall adequacy (BBPS score > 6 with all segment scores > 2) between groups (91% vs 88%; P = 0.44), no differences in ADR, and greater willingness to repeat the preparation with the 4 L regimen (92% vs 66%; P < 0.001).

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The colon cleansing efficacy of SUFLAVE was evaluated in two randomized, single-blind, active-controlled, multicenter trials (Study 1 and Study 2). These trials included adult patients undergoing colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening and surveillance, or diagnostic colonoscopy, including patients with abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation and non-severe inflammatory bowel disease.

In Study 1 (NCT04446299), 471 adult patients were included in the efficacy analysis. Patients ranged in age from 20 to 84 years (median age 58 years) and 54% were female. The racial distribution was 70% White, 27% African-American, 2% Asian, and 1% American Indian or Alaska Native. The population was 8% Hispanic or Latino. Patients were randomized to one of the following two colon preparation regimens: SUFLAVE or polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium sulfate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, ascorbic acid and sodium ascorbate for oral solution. Both preparations were administered according to a split-dose regimen [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Patients receiving SUFLAVE were limited to a low residue breakfast followed by clear liquids on the day prior to the colonoscopy; patients receiving the comparator bowel prep were allowed to have a normal breakfast and a light lunch, followed by clear liquids and/or yogurt for dinner on the day prior to the colonoscopy.

5.7 Aspiration

Patients with impaired gag reflex or other swallowing abnormalities are at risk for regurgitation or aspiration of Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution. Observe these patients during the administration of Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution. Use with caution in these patients.

Do not combine Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution with starch-based thickeners [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Polyethylene glycol (PEG), a component of Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution, when mixed with starch-thickened liquids reduces the viscosity of the starch-thickened liquid. When a PEG-based product used for another indication was mixed in starch-based pre-thickened liquids used in patients with dysphagia, thinning of the liquid occurred and cases of choking and potential aspiration were reported.

5.8 Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) Deficiency

Since Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution contains sodium ascorbate and ascorbic acid, Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution should be used with caution in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, especially G6PD deficiency patients with an active infection, with a history of hemolysis, or taking concomitant medications known to precipitate hemolytic reactions.

5.9 Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria

Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution contains phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Each Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution treatment contains 131 mg of phenylalanine (after hydrolysis of the aspartame molecule in vivo to aspartic acid and phenylalanine). Before prescribing Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution to a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including Polyethylene Glycol-3350, Electrolytes, and Ascorbate for Oral Solution.

Results

Study disposition is shown in figure 2. A total of 310 patients were randomised to the PEG-Asc-S group (n = 107), the PEG-Asc-M group (n = 99) or the PEG-ES group (n = 104). After randomisation, two patients in the PEG-Asc-S group withdrew their consent, two patients in the PEG-ES group had a major protocol deviation, and three patients in the PEG-Asc-S group and two patients in the PEG-ES group discontinued dosing because of nausea due to stomach fullness. One patient in the PEG-Asc-M group had nausea but completed dosing. Therefore, a final total of 301 patients were analysed (102 in the PEG-Asc-S group, 99 in the PEG-Asc-M group and 100 in the PEG-ES group).

The distribution of overall cleansing evaluation as excellent, good, poor or missing in each group is shown in table 2.

Bowel preparation was successful (the combined ratings of 'excellent'+'good') for 96%, 94% and 95% of patients in the Modi-S, Modi-M and PEG-ES groups, respectively.

Table 2
Efficacy of the PEG-Asc-S, PEG-Asc-M and PEG-ES regimens

The number of polyps/adenomas per person (mean ± SD, range) in the PEG-Asc-S, PEG-Asc-M and PEG-ES groups were 2.97 ± 2.92 (0–15), 3.32 ± 3.51 (0–19) and 3.53 ± 3.27 (0–17). There was no significant difference between any two groups.

### Polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium sulfate, potassium chloride, magnesium sulfate, and sodium chloride for oral solution (Suflave) [^117P9FJk]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.4 Use in Patients with Risk of Renal Injury

Use SUFLAVE with caution in patients with impaired renal function or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function (such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. These patients may be at risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration with SUFLAVE and consider performing baseline and postcolonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

5.5 Colonic Mucosal Ulcerations and Ischemic Colitis

Osmotic laxative products may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and SUFLAVE may increase these risks [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Consider the potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspect inflammatory bowel disease.

5.6 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease

If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering SUFLAVE [see Contraindications (4)].

Use with caution in patients with severe active ulcerative colitis.

5.7 Aspiration

Patients with impaired gag reflex or other swallowing abnormalities are at risk for regurgitation or aspiration of SUFLAVE. Observe these patients during administration of SUFLAVE.

Do not combine SUFLAVE with starch-based thickeners [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Polyethylene glycol (PEG), a component of SUFLAVE, when mixed with starch-thickened liquids reduces the viscosity of the starch-thickened liquid. When a PEG-based product used for another indication was mixed in starch-based pre-thickened liquids used in patients with dysphagia, thinning of the liquid occurred and cases of choking and potential aspiration were reported.

5.8 Hypersensitivity Reactions

SUFLAVE contains polyethylene glycol (PEG) and other ingredients that may cause serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, and pruritus [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, and instruct them to seek immediate medical care should signs and symptoms occur.
