## Question

Enteral nutrition in patients receiving neuromuscular blockades

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether enteral nutrition should be delayed in critically ill patients receiving neuromuscular blocking agents, and if not, how to implement it safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the physiologic rationale and whether NMBAs impair gut motility or absorption. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about EN timing in paralyzed patients. Next, I will review direct clinical evidence on gastric emptying and outcomes with early EN. After that, I need to consider confounders like sedation, hemodynamics, and prone positioning. Finally, I will translate this into a practical, risk-mitigated feeding protocol and monitoring plan, including when to escalate to postpyloric feeds or PN if intolerance persists.

> Let me first confirm the physiologic premise. Neuromuscular blocking agents act at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on skeletal muscle and do not directly paralyze smooth muscle of the GI tract, so they should not inherently impair gastric emptying or intestinal absorption. The clinical concern is more about the underlying critical illness, sedation, and hemodynamics rather than the NMBA itself [^116bfH5D] [^112KTzPz].

> Wait, let me verify the direct evidence on gastric emptying. A prospective crossover study in 20 ventilated ICU patients using the paracetamol absorption test showed no significant difference in gastric emptying or gastric residual volumes when cisatracurium was added to opioid sedation compared with opioid sedation alone, supporting preserved absorption and motility during NMBA use. ESICM also cites similar findings and notes that NMBAs per se should not preclude EN, though deep sedation can slow motility and increase intolerance risk [^115mEAGk] [^112KTzPz] [^115kmn2a].

> Next, I should review guideline positions. ESICM explicitly recommends not delaying EN solely because of concomitant NMBA use, emphasizing that the critical condition requiring NMBA — not the NMBA itself — should drive decisions. ASPEN/SCCM-aligned expert recommendations similarly list NMBA as not a reason to delay EN when the gut is functional and the patient is otherwise ready to feed. SCCM's NMBA guideline makes no specific nutrition recommendation, which in practice allows standard EN principles to apply [^114HTyM6] [^115xNAML] [^112KTzPz].

> I will now examine outcomes data. A large Japanese propensity-matched analysis of mechanically ventilated patients on sustained NMBA found that starting EN within 2 days of NMBA initiation was associated with lower in-hospital mortality and shorter hospital stay without increased pneumonia, supporting early EN in this population. Broader ICU cohorts also associate early goal EN with improved outcomes, though these are observational and require cautious interpretation [^111PmPSw] [^1149tdvE] [^112ubkob].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I need to check key confounders. Deep sedation with opioids and benzodiazepines, not NMBA per se, is the primary driver of delayed gastric emptying. Hemodynamic instability and uncontrolled shock should delay EN until perfusion improves. Prone positioning does not preclude EN and can proceed with standard precautions. Therapeutic hypothermia may reduce motility, so low-dose EN with escalation after rewarming is reasonable [^115kmn2a] [^114HTyM6] [^113cJnm6].

> Let me think about practical implementation. I should confirm hemodynamic stability and adequate resuscitation before starting EN. If vasopressors are required, low-dose EN can begin once shock is controlled and lactate is improving, avoiding high-dose feeding early in profound instability. Start low and advance slowly with a protocolized approach, consider prokinetics for intolerance, and use a composite GI assessment rather than GRV alone to guide decisions [^115kmn2a] [^115xNAML] [^113cJnm6].

> I should double-check dosing and targets. Typical early targets are about 20–25 kcal/kg/day and 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day protein, but wait, I need to ensure I account for reduced energy expenditure during NMBA. Cisatracurium can lower measured energy expenditure by roughly 6–10%, so I should avoid overfeeding by reassessing needs with indirect calorimetry when available or using VCO2-based estimates, and adjust downward if persistent overdelivery is suspected [^114S18jv] [^115WPbVa].

> Next, I should review monitoring and escalation. I need to ensure regular assessment for feeding intolerance using a multifaceted approach — abdominal exam, pain/distension, stooling, and optionally GRV as part of a bundle. If intolerance persists with high GRVs or recurrent emesis, consider postpyloric feeding and prokinetic therapy. If the gut is nonfunctional or EN remains insufficient beyond about 7–10 days, I should consider supplemental PN rather than forcing high-rate gastric feeds in an unstable patient [^113cJnm6] [^1171ufva].

> But wait, what if the patient is on very high-dose vasopressors or has evolving mesenteric ischemia risk? In that scenario, I should delay EN until hemodynamics and perfusion improve, because feeding in unresuscitated shock increases the risk of gut ischemia. Once stabilized, I can resume the early EN approach outlined above [^115kmn2a] [^115xNAML].

> In summary, I should confirm that NMBA alone is not a contraindication to EN. Start EN early — ideally within 24–48 hours of ICU admission and within 2 days of initiating NMBA — provided the patient is hemodynamically stabilized, the gut is functional, and sedation is optimized. Monitor tolerance proactively, mitigate GI dysfunction with prokinetics and postpyloric access when needed, and adjust energy for the modest EE reduction from NMBA to avoid overfeeding. This strategy aligns with physiologic data, guidelines, and observational evidence suggesting improved outcomes without excess pneumonia [^111PmPSw] [^114HTyM6] [^115xNAML] [^114S18jv].

Enteral nutrition (EN) should not be delayed solely due to neuromuscular blockade (NMB) [^114HTyM6]; **EN is safe and feasible** during NMB, with no significant increase in aspiration or feeding intolerance [^112KTzPz] [^111PmPSw]. Early EN (within 24–48 h) is recommended once hemodynamics are stable and the gut is functional, as it preserves gut integrity, reduces infections, and may improve outcomes [^115xNAML] [^115kmn2a]. Use **prokinetics and post-pyloric feeding** if gastric emptying is delayed, and monitor for intolerance with a standardized protocol [^115wzqAQ] [^117GFi5N]. Delay EN only for uncontrolled shock, severe acidosis, or mesenteric ischemia [^115kmn2a] [^115xNAML].

---

## Physiological considerations

- **Gastrointestinal motility**: NMBs do not directly impair smooth muscle motility; gastric emptying and absorption are generally preserved [^112KTzPz] [^115mEAGk].
- **Energy expenditure**: NMBs lower energy expenditure by ~6.6%, reducing the risk of overfeeding; adjust caloric targets accordingly [^114S18jv].
- **Gut integrity**: Early EN maintains mucosal barrier function, reduces bacterial translocation, and preserves immune function [^115xNAML].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting enteral nutrition during neuromuscular blockade

- **Gastric emptying**: A prospective study showed no significant difference in gastric emptying or residual volumes with or without NMBs, supporting EN tolerance [^115mEAGk].
- **Outcomes**: Early EN in NMB patients is associated with lower in-hospital mortality and shorter hospital stay without increased pneumonia [^111PmPSw].
- **Aspiration risk**: No significant increase in aspiration or feeding intolerance with EN during NMB has been observed [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation regarding en during nmb** |
|-|-|
| ESICM | Do not delay EN solely due to NMB; consider the underlying condition [^114HTyM6] |
| SCCM | No specific recommendation; EN is feasible and safe during NMB [^112KTzPz] |
| ASPEN | Early EN is recommended in critically ill patients, including those receiving NMB [^115xNAML] |

---

## Potential risks and complications

- **Aspiration**: Risk is low but present; use head-of-bed elevation and monitor residuals [^113cJnm6].
- **Feeding intolerance**: May occur due to delayed gastric emptying from sedation/opioids; use prokinetics or post-pyloric feeds [^115kmn2a].
- **Overfeeding**: Adjust calories for reduced energy expenditure during NMB [^114S18jv].

---

## Practical considerations and management strategies

- **Initiation**: Start EN within 24–48 h of ICU admission once hemodynamically stable and gut function is confirmed [^115xNAML].
- **Monitoring**: Use standardized protocols, assess tolerance, and adjust feeds based on residuals and clinical status [^117GFi5N].
- **Prokinetics**: Consider metoclopramide or erythromycin for delayed gastric emptying [^113dxURR].
- **Post-pyloric feeding**: Use if gastric intolerance persists despite prokinetics [^notfound].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include **uncontrolled shock**, severe acidosis, or mesenteric ischemia [^115kmn2a] [^115xNAML]. Precautions include **individualizing EN** based on hemodynamics, gut function, and sedation level, and avoiding high-calorie feeding early in critical illness [^115xNAML].

---

Enteral nutrition should not be delayed solely due to neuromuscular blockade; **early EN is safe, feasible, and beneficial** in stable patients, preserving gut integrity and potentially improving outcomes. Use prokinetics and post-pyloric feeding for intolerance, and avoid EN in uncontrolled shock or mesenteric ischemia.

Limitations and considerations

Our results are subject to the limitations of a retrospective approach. Because of ethical considerations, we were only able to include anonymized records of patients who had previously consented to collection of data in the context of a prospective trial. These trials each had inclusion and exclusion criteria, which may have introduced selection bias into our study. However, our regression model incorporated both empirical covariates and those that differed on baseline between the cohorts. Thus, we assumed that we have minimized any inclusion bias. Nevertheless, our results require the external validation of a prospective design.

To prevent overfitting of the model in a relatively small sample size, we were not able to add all parameters that differed between the cohorts to the eventual model. We chose not to include NUTRIC score, as it incorporates age, comorbidities, and APACHE II scores, which were already considered separately. Furthermore, we did not consider duration of use of neuromuscular blocking agents at this point. However, as duration of use was longer in the COVID‐19 cohort, which performed worse upon ICU discharge, and use of neuromuscular blocking agents is associated with increased muscle weakness, inclusion of this parameter in the model likely would not have changed the direction of our results. We collected several parameters reflecting LOS and duration of therapy, which may differ between a COVID‐19 and a non‐COVID pneumosepsis ICU cohort and independently influence the outcome of physical therapy tests. Because of multicollinearity, we were not able to add all of these as simultaneously covariates in the ANCOVA model. We chose to use ward LOS, as this best reflects the timespan between the repeated measures. Repeating the analyses with ward LOS substituted with any of the other duration parameters did not change the main results and thus omitting the other variables in the main analysis is unlikely to have biased our results. At this point, delivery of macronutrients is only reliably recorded in the ICU at our hospital, and thus we could not report on adequacy of nutrition on the general ward. In future designs, this parameter might be considered if feasible.

We do not routinely measure muscle strength at hospital, nor ICU admission. However, comparing discharge and admission scores would be very insightful in any prospective trials to come.

Recommendation 2. We suggest delaying EN if shock is uncontrolled and haemodynamic and tissue perfusion goals are not reached, but start low dose EN as soon as shock is controlled with fluids and vasopressors/inotropes (Grade 2D).

Question 3:

Should we delay EN in patients with:
A. Hypoxaemia;
B. Hypercapnia;
C. Acidosis?

We found no direct evidence on these subquestions in the literature, and RCTs in this population are unlikely to become available.

The rationale to withhold EN in patients with hypoxaemia, hypercapnia and acidosis is to limit oxygen consumption and CO 2 production. However, the process of starving mobilises endogenous stores and is energy-consuming. Acidosis may represent persistent shock and possibly contribute to gut dysfunction. Identifying and treating the cause of shock has priority over the initiation of EN. Similarly, in uncontrolled life-threatening hypoxaemia and hypercapnia, EN should be delayed until the symptoms are resolving.

In patients with acute lung injury, an RCT comparing trophic to full EN for up to 6 days was associated with less gastrointestinal intolerance when compared to full EN, without affecting ventilator-free days, infectious complications, physical function, or survival. There are no data suggesting EN in patients with chronic, subacute, compensated or permissive hypercapnia is unsafe or not feasible.

Recommendation 3. We suggest delaying EN in case of uncontrolled life-threatening hypoxaemia, hypercapnia or acidosis, but using EEN in patients with stable hypoxaemia, and compensated or permissive hypercapnia and acidosis (Grade 2D).

Question 4: Should we delay EN in patients receiving neuromuscular blocking agents?

One prospective study was identified (Supplement 5, Table 4), reporting similar gastric emptying as measured by gastric residual volume (GRV) in sedated patients with or without concomitant use of neuromuscular blocking agents. The critical condition necessitating the use of neuromuscular blocking agents always needs to be considered, but these agents per se should not preclude EN. Analgosedation is known to slow gastric emptying. Increased rate of EN intolerance is expected in deeply sedated patients with/without concomitant use of neuromuscular blocking agents.

Recommended energy requirement for critically ill children — Meyer et al: In a prospective, observational multicenter cohort in Three PICUs of mechanically ventilated children (n = 175; median age 54 mo [1–91 mo]), 369 indirect calorimetry (IC) measurements were used to develop three equations with R2 > 0.8 for each equation; inotropes, neuromuscular blockade, temperature, C-reactive protein, and organ dysfunction scores did not impact MREE. Against MREE (n = 30), 25% of estimates were within 10% of MREE, 75% varied 26–29% from MREE, and the White equation differed up to 82% from MREE, and "the research demonstrates that new and existing equations are not accurate within 10% of MREE in a majority of critically ill children".

Results

Characteristics of the study population and nutrition management

Overall, 1206 patients were included in the present study (Fig. 1). Invasive mechanical ventilation was used for 979 (81.2%) patients for a median duration of 7 [3–15] days. The median ICU length of stay was 10 [6–20] days. The overall ICU mortality was 18.5% (n = 223), and the D28 mortality was 18.8% (n = 226) (Table 1). Our hospital mortality prediction based on the admission SAPS II score was 32%.

During the follow-up, 954 (79.1%) patients received nutrition support, with 753 (62.4%) patients receiving at least one day of enteral and 406 (33.7%) parenteral nutrition. Mixed nutrition (EN + PN) during the follow-up was provided to 158 patients (13.1%). The rate of delivery of nutrition support increased gradually from day 1 to day 10; enteral nutrition was the predominant route. The median timing of enteral introduction was at 38 [24–65] hours. The maximum number of patients receiving parenteral nutrition was observed on D4 of the ICU stay. When early nutrition was administered, the amount of energy provided increased until day 3 and remained stable thereafter. In the absence of early nutrition, intakes increased linearly and progressively over the follow-up period (Fig. 2). Daily energy and protein targets were reached at least once during the nutritional follow-up for 56% and 30% of all included patients, respectively. Gastrointestinal complications were frequent, with at least one occurrence of emesis or diarrhoea in 15.4% and 26.7% of the overall patients, respectively. Feeding intolerance occurred in 34% of ICU patients receiving enteral nutrition.

Recommendation 4. We suggest that EN should not be delayed solely because of the concomitant use of neuromuscular blocking agents (Grade 2D).

Question 5: Should we delay EN in patients receiving therapeutic hypothermia?

One case series study addressing EN during therapeutic hypothermia was identified (Supplement 5, Table 5).

During therapeutic hypothermia, energy metabolism might be markedly reduced when shivering is prevented. The rationale to withhold EN during therapeutic hypothermia is based on the presumed decrease in gut motility due to hypothermia and required analgosedation. It has been suggested that EN could be successfully administered to these patients. Tolerance to enteral feeding was impaired during hypothermia, but improved during rewarming.

Recommendation 5. We suggest starting low dose EEN in patients receiving therapeutic hypothermia and increase the dose after rewarming (Grade 2D).

Question 6: Should we delay EN in patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)?

No RCTs and no prospective cohort studies were identified. Four case series in adult patients with ECMO were assessed (Supplement 5, Table 6), suggesting that EN is feasible during ECMO.

Recommendation 6. We suggest using EEN in patients receiving ECMO (Grade 2D).

Question 7: Should we delay EN during prone position?

One prospective cross-over, one cohort and three case series studies were identified (Supplement 5, Table 7).

Data on tolerance of EN in prone position are controversial. Observational studies found similar GRVs in prone and supine position, whereas poor feeding tolerance was improved with semi-recumbent position during supine periods and prokinetics. Although no RCTs on EN tolerance during prone position are available, reported studies do not support withholding EN in prone position. Gastric emptying seems not to be significantly influenced by prone position and adverse events in most studies not increased.

### Time-sensitive therapeutics [^114RAkVZ]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Timing issues in critical illness

Precise and personalized critical care management requires awareness of certain timing issues that are often neglected. The critically ill patient passes through stages of disease and recovery which demand differing intensities of therapeutic intervention as well as keen awareness of when to withdraw external supports so as to allow adaptation and re-establishment of diurnal homeostatic physiology. The stages of critical illness can be viewed as progressing from rescue to stabilization, strengthening, and recovery. Wound healing progresses along such a timeline, and increasingly we are paying attention to the facts that pathologic expression varies widely among patients and that reactions to treatments continually evolve and change. We have been relatively slow to learn that responsiveness to many interventions depends on the stage of illness. In sepsis, immediate intervention with appropriate antibiotics is a key to survival, whereas prioritizing abrupt and aggressive fluid resuscitation may be somewhat less helpful. Regarding ARDS, these stage-dependent interventions include positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), prone positioning, recruitment maneuvers, neuromuscular blockade, corticosteroids, fluid management, and undoubtedly other common interventions that we have not yet seriously questioned (Table 4). For example, the internal endocrine environment continuously evolves as the acute inflammation of sepsis and ARDS progresses into the chronic and recovery phases. Considerable experimental evidence indicates that the stages of illness should dictate metabolic therapy as well, with appropriate nutritional support and gut microbiome health depending on the composition and the timing of component feedings.

### When is enteral nutrition indicated? [^111jtNwD]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Enteral nutrition (EN) is a vital component of nutrition around the world. EN allows for delivery of nutrients to those who cannot maintain adequate nutrition by oral intake alone. Common questions regarding EN are when to initiate and in what scenarios it is safe. The answers to these questions are often complex and require an evidence-based approach. The Board of Directors of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) established an Enteral Nutrition Committtee to address the important questions surrounding the indications for EN. Consensus recommendations were established based on eight extremely clinically relevant questions regarding EN indications as deemed by the Enteral Nutrition Committee. These consensus recommendations may act as a guide for clinicians and stakeholders on difficult questions pertaining to indications for EN. This paper was approved by the ASPEN Board of Directors.

Recommended energy requirement for critically ill children — Jotterand Chaparro et al. prospective cohort: In mechanically ventilated, critically ill children (n = 76; median age 21 mo [IQR 4–35 mo]), indirect calorimetry (IC) showed mean measured resting energy expenditure (MREE) 55 kcal/ kg/d (95% CI, 54–57), stable for the first 10 d; MREE decreased 6% with neuromuscular blockade (p = 0.031) and increased by 8% per degree centigrade body temperature (p = 0.003), DRI strongly overestimated MREE, and protein intake ≥ 1.5 g/ kg/d with energy intake ≥ 58 kcal/ kg/d was needed for nitrogen and energy balance; the study suggests a threshold for optimal energy intake and a relationship between energy intake and protein balance.

### When is enteral nutrition indicated? [^116bfH5D]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Enteral nutrition during paralytic therapy — Do not hold or delay EN in patients undergoing paralytic therapy. Recent guidelines from the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) recommend that EN not be held or delayed simply because of the use of NMBs but that the critical condition requiring their use is taken into account, and the Guidelines for the Management of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury, Fourth Edition recommend initiating early EN (within 72 h of injury) and meeting estimated requirements by days 5–7 to decrease mortality. Whereas NMBs should not have a paralytic effect on the smooth muscle of the GI tract, prokinetics can be considered to help counter slowed GI motility and optimize EN tolerance.

### Enteral nutrition… [^112EGv9d]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Good nutrition is essential to growth, healing, and vitality. The body requires specific amounts of carbohydrates, protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals depending on body weight and other considerations. For a variety of reasons, some patients are not able to eat. To receive essential nutrients, such patients require means that do not involve chewing or swallowing. Adequate hydration must be provided, but many patients can be without nutrition for up to 7 days. However, depending on the circumstances, nutrition might need to be started sooner. Inability to eat may be temporary, but in some patients it may be a permanent condition. Short-term Nutrition The preferred means of nutrition, enteral nutrition, is through the gut. It is the most natural way in which nutrients are absorbed, allowing the intestines to do their job, and is safer than intravenous nutrition, which is delivered into the bloodstream. The preferred route for enteral nutrition is through the stomach.

A very thin plastic tube can be inserted into a nostril and pushed all the way into the stomach. Liquid nutrition can be given this way at a continuous, set rate or intermittently. Occasionally, a nasojejunal tube is placed instead. This tube is inserted into the part of the small bowel called the jejunum. This can be done for a variety of reasons, including a condition called gastroparesis, in which the stomach is not working but the rest of the intestine is. The pylorus is the valve that separates the stomach from the rest of the small bowel. Therefore, nasojejunal tubes are also referred to as postpyloric tubes. Long-term Nutrition If patients are expected to require enteral nutrition for longer than a couple of weeks, a long-term solution is needed. This may involve use of tubes that go directly through the abdominal wall into the gut. A gastrostomy tube or a jejunostomy tube can be placed into the stomach or the jejunum, respectively.

There are 3 main ways to place these tubes: surgically by a surgeon using general anesthesia; fluoroscopically via x-ray guidance by a radiologist using sedation; or endoscopically by a gastroenterologist or a surgeon using sedation.

### Guidelines for enhanced recovery after trauma and intensive care (ERATIC): enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) and international association for trauma surgery and intensive care (IATSIC) society recommendations: paper 2: postoperative and intensive care recommendations [^115wzqAQ]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

There is good quality evidence to support early enteral feeding using a gradual incremental protocol with nasoenteric feeding reserved for those who have gastroparesis or feed intolerance, with the routine use of prokinetics and adjunctive treatments recommended. Following established nutrition, society guidelines are supported for this goal. For planned surgery, clear carbohydrate liquids till 2 h preoperative are recommended to avoid prolonged preoperative starvation in those tolerating enteral feed.

Discontinuous gut ("clip and drop") of bowel ends is a well‐described part of damage control surgery. Although the gut remains discontinuous and where this involves duodenum, small bowel, and proximal large bowel, we recommend early consideration for parenteral nutrition starting around day 3 provided physiological improvement had occurred and the resuscitation phase is complete.

Once gut continuity has been restored early enteral feeding within 6–8 h with a trickle‐feed approach is supported in the existing critical care nutrition literature.

Commence enteral nutrition (oral or tube‐feed) within 6–8 h postsurgery (trickle‐feed) once gut is continuous. Use parenteral nutrition by day 3–5 in those unable to achieve continuity of gut.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) along with the onset of acute colonic dilatation are common reasons for delayed feeding in nonventilated trauma patients. Trauma patients fit the high‐risk group for PONV. For the management of PONV, the recommended therapies include multimodal and regional analgesia, parenteral paracetamol, dexmedetomidine, lidocaine infusion, dexamethasone early during surgery, and droperidol or ondansetron at the end of surgery. The recent guidelines are a consensus of multiple societies and we support this guideline. Postoperative ileus (adynamic ileus) is common and there is a consensus evidence‐based guideline from the EAST group for the prevention and treatment of ileus. For acute colonic dilatation, there is a role for escalating therapy, from prokinetics, to neostigmine, to flatus tube placement or bedside colonoscopic decompression, with surgery reserved for patients with signs suggesting bowel ischemia. Bowel dilated beyond 11 cm predicted the need for surgical intervention.

### Clinical practice guidelines for sustained neuromuscular blockade in the adult critically ill patient [^1167pPP6]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Monitoring degree of blockade in adult critically ill ICU patients receiving continuous neuromuscular-blocking agent (NMBA) infusions — We suggest against the use of peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) with train-of-four (TOF) alone for monitoring the depth of neuromuscular blockade in patients on continuous infusion of NMBAs (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence), and we suggest that PNS with TOF monitoring may be a useful tool but only if it is incorporated into a more inclusive assessment that includes clinical assessment (weak recommendation, very low quality evidence). The rationale notes that the most commonly used method to assess the degree of neuromuscular blockade in the ICU is PNS with monitoring of the TOF response, yet a randomized trial randomly assigned 30 patients to clinical assessment or TOF monitoring and did not find any differences in outcomes between groups; surveys found variation in TOF use with barriers including unavailability of equipment, lack of training, and perceived lack of evidence to support the use of TOF monitoring.

Energy expenditure assessment — measured resting energy expenditure (MREE) and indirect calorimetry (IC): Metabolic states in critically ill children include hypometabolism (measured resting energy expenditure [MREE], < 90% of predicted), normal metabolism (MREE, 90–110% predicted), and hypermetabolism (MREE, > 110% predicted); IC is the only available method to accurately determine energy requirements for this population, and energy expenditure measured by IC is independent of nutritional status, initial diagnosis, or severity of the acute illness. MREE may be decreased during deep sedation and neuromuscular blockade, severe hypothyroidism, or increased with temperature greater than 38°C and prolonged PICU length of stay; in cohort studies, MREE did not significantly vary within the same patient over time, and after the baseline MREE is performed (ideally during the first week of critical illness), repeat measurements may be obtained in patients with significant changes in clinical status.

### Obesity and critical care nutrition: current practice gaps and directions for future research [^116HE7sn]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

The subjective global assessment (SGA) tool, validated for different populations including critical care patients, focuses on essential clinical variables that can be obtained from the patient or family members of those who cannot provide their nutritional history. The SGA is a low-cost, noninvasive tool based on a patient's medical history and physical examination. Due to these characteristics, it has become a commonly used tool for hospitalized patients in various clinical situations. This instrument has also been shown to be a good prognostic assessment tool. One cross-sectional study found that SGA was a reliable tool for identifying malnutrition in patients with overweight and obesity requiring mechanical ventilation. Another study indicated that critically ill patients, including those with obesity and diagnosed as malnourished by SGA, presented with higher ICU readmissions as well as increased mortality.

Other assessment instruments like anthropometry and bioimpedance are influenced not only by the hydration status of the patients but also by the cutoffs for normality that may not be appropriate for patients with obesity. Ultrasonography, which can be done at the bedside, seemed to be a promising assessment of the muscle, which is a compartment of the nutritional status, but it requires training and may be technically challenging in patients with obesity. Furthermore, sophisticated tools such as tomography and magnetic resonance may not be routinely available unless performed for diagnosis of the current condition, but even if so, they require software and expertise to interpret results. Muscle function associated with the nutritional status is also difficult to assess once patients are under sedation or neuromuscular blocker therapy. Biochemical parameters like albumin and transthyretin are influenced by the inflammatory status of the patient and, therefore, not useful indicators of nutritional status. More recently, the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) has been proposed as a framework for the diagnosis of the nutritional status; however, it has not been adequately validated to advocate its use in patients with obesity.

Current guidelines for screening and assessment

Notably, the 2019 ESPEN guidelines did not recommend any specific tool to be used in critically ill patients and instead stated that "Every critically ill patient staying for more than 48 h in the ICU should be considered at risk for malnutrition". Meanwhile, the 2016 American Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) and the Society of Critical Care Medicine, as well as the updated ASPEN guidelines do not address the topic. Neither guideline specifically highlights whether or how screening and assessment practices should differ for patients with obesity.

### Evaluation of feeding intolerance in patients with pentobarbital-induced coma [^112Kyxkg]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Background

There is considerable debate regarding the appropriateness of feeding patients by the enteral route in conjunction with pentobarbital coma therapy.

Objective

To determine the incidence of feeding intolerance (FI) in patients receiving pentobarbital in conjunction with enteral nutrition (EN).

Methods

A retrospective, observational evaluation of patients (> 14 y of age) who received a therapeutic pentobarbital coma in combination with EN was conducted. Patients were divided into groups, based on the occurrence of FI defined as aspiration of gastric residuals greater than 75 mL for 2 consecutive measurements.

Results

Forty-eight percent (29 of 61) of patients experienced FI based on our definition. The median pentobarbital infusion rate did not differ significantly between patients who experienced FI versus those who did not (median [intraquartile range, IQR] 1.8 mg/kg/h [1.4, 2.1] vs 1.7 mg/kg/h [1.4, 2.5]; p = 0.680). The total pentobarbital bolus dose during the first 24 hours of therapy was lower in patients who experienced FI (700 mg [225, 980] vs 1000 mg [600, 1475]; p = 0.029). Median duration of pentobarbital therapy was comparable between groups (141.0 h [93.3, 217.3] vs 116.3 h [64.0, 174.8]; p = 0.115). Other factors with the potential to influence FI, such as catecholamines, neuromuscular blockade, and hyperglycemia, were similar between groups. The higher narcotic doses and greater percentage of patients receiving benzodiazepines in the FI group warrants further study.

Conclusions

Pentobarbital therapy did not preclude use of EN in the entire study population. In addition, FI did not occur at a greater frequency in patients who received a higher dosage, a longer duration, or an earlier initiation of pentobarbital therapy.

### Early goal enteral nutrition associated with decreased in-hospital death in mechanically ventilated critically ill adults: a retrospective cohort study [^1149tdvE]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

This retrospective study of a large MICU cohort shows the benefit of achieving 70% or more of the recommended calories within 2 calendar days of intubation. It is a strength of our study that we have included a broad MICU population including patients on vasopressors and neuromuscular blockade. Furthermore, our study reflects 'real-world' titration schedules that can take 24–48 hours to achieve meaningful calorie delivery. There is a notable bimodal pattern between groups in our study; patients achieving early goal EN have much higher calorie intake (eg, mean and median intake equal or greater than 85% on study day 2) vs those who did not achieve early goal EN (eg, mean and median equal or less than 20% of recommended on study day 2). Additionally, we had very few patients in our cohort who approached 100% of recommended feeds during the baseline period when endogenous energy production remained high. These feeding patterns may explain apparently contrasting results in our study versus prior studies which show improved outcomes with 33%–65% of target feedsor studies showing a lack of difference between permissive underfeeding (40%–60% of goal) versus those in the standard feeding group (70%–100% of calculated caloric requirements). These results may further support the hypothesised harms related to both underfeeding and overfeeding during critical illness noted in the introduction. Underfeeding may occur due to slow titration of feeds, interruptions in continuous regimens and/or provider reluctance to feed for a variety of clinical reasons. Overfeeding may occur due to inaccuracies in the measurement of energy needs including underestimation of endogenous energy production in the early days of critical illness.

### Specific nutrition and metabolic characteristics of critically ill patients with persistent COVID-19 [^115uJzsq]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Little is known about metabolic and nutrition characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) and persistent critical illness. We aimed to compare those characteristics in patients with PCI and COVID‐19 and patients without COVID‐19 infection (non‐CO) — primarily, their energy balance.

Methods

This is a prospective observational study including two consecutive cohorts, defined as needing intubation for > 10 days. We collected demographic data, severity scores, nutrition variables, length of stay, and mortality.

Results

Altogether, 104 patients (52 per group) were included (59 ± 14 years old [mean ± SD], 75% men) between July 2019 and May 2020. SAPSII, Nutrition Risk Screening (NRS) score, proportion of obese patients, duration of intubation (18.2 ± 11.7 days), and mortality rates were similar. Patients with COVID‐19 (vs non‐CO) had lower SOFA scores (P = 0.013) and more frequently needed prone position (P < 0.0001) and neuromuscular blockade (P < 0.0001): lengths of ICU (P = 0.03) and hospital stays were shorter (P < 0.0001). Prescribed energy targets were below those of the ICU protocol. The energy balance of patients with COVID‐19 was significantly more negative after day 10. Enteral nutrition (EN) started earlier (P < 0.0001). During the first 10 days, COVID‐19 patients received more lipid (propofol sedation) and less protein. Higher admission C‐reactive protein (P = 0.002) decreased faster (P < 0.001). Whereas intestinal function was characterized by constipation in both groups during the first 10 days, diarrhea was less common in patients with COVID‐19 thereafter.

Conclusion

Compared with non‐CO patients, COVID‐19 patients were not more obese, had lower SOFA scores, and were fed more rapidly with EN, because of a more normal gastrointestinal function possibly due to fewer non–respiratory organ failures: their energy balances were more negative after the first 10 days. Propofol sedation reduced protein delivery.

### Early enteral nutrition in patients undergoing sustained neuromuscular blockade: a propensity-matched analysis using a nationwide inpatient database [^111PmPSw]. Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Whether enteral nutrition should be postponed in patients undergoing sustained treatment with neuromuscular blocking agents remains unclear. We evaluated the association between enteral nutrition initiated within 2 days of sustained neuromuscular blocking agent treatment and in-hospital mortality.

Design

Retrospective administrative database study from July 2010 to March 2016.

Setting

More than 1,200 acute care hospitals covering approximately 90% of all tertiary-care emergency hospitals in Japan.

Patients

Mechanically ventilated patients, who had undergone sustained treatment with neuromuscular blocking agents in an ICU, were retrospectively reviewed. We defined patients who received sustained treatment with neuromuscular blocking agents as those who received either rocuronium at greater than or equal to 250mg/d or vecuronium at greater than or equal to 50mg/d for at least 2 consecutive days.

Interventions

Enteral nutrition started within 2 days from the initiation of neuromuscular blocking agents (defined as early enteral nutrition).

Measurements and Main Results

We identified 2,340 eligible patients during the 69-month study period. Of these, 378 patients (16%) had received early enteral nutrition. One-to-three propensity score matching created 374–1,122 pairs. The in-hospital mortality rate was significantly lower in the early than late enteral nutrition group (risk difference, -6.3%; 95% CI, -11.7% to -0.9%). There was no significant difference in the rate of hospital pneumonia between the two groups (risk difference, 2.8%; 95% CI, -2.7% to 8.3%). Length of hospital stay among survivors was significantly shorter in the early compared with the late enteral nutrition group (risk difference, -11.4 d; 95% CI, -19.1 to -3.7 d). There was no significant difference between the two groups in length of ICU stay or length of mechanical ventilation among survivors.

Conclusions

According to this retrospective database study, early enteral nutrition may be associated with lower in-hospital mortality with no increase in-hospital pneumonia in patients undergoing sustained treatment with neuromuscular blocking agents.

### EACTS / STS / AATS guidelines on temporary mechanical circulatory support in adult cardiac surgery [^116hQy4B]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Nutrition during temporary mechanical circulatory support (tMCS) — In critically ill cardiac surgery patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), nutritional support remains underemphasized and only broad, non-specific guidance is available. During tMCS, altered haemodynamics, systemic inflammation, multiorgan dysfunction, deep sedation, neuromuscular blockade, and vasoactive-inotropic agents compound the inaccuracy of predictive nutritional equations, and predictive equations used to estimate energy expenditure often result in underfeeding or overfeeding. European and American societies recommend indirect calorimetry to guide nutritional support in ICU patients, but this can be challenging in patients on extracorporeal life support (ECLS) or who are non-ventilated; if indirect calorimetry is not available, a simple weight-based formula is recommended for estimating caloric needs. Recent prospective international and single-centre studies indicate that critically ill cardiac and ICU patients receive less than 50% of their estimated caloric and protein requirements, with inadequate delivery linked to delayed initiation, reluctance to feed due to concerns over bowel ischaemia in patients on high-dose vasopressors, frequent interruption of enteral nutrition (EN) for procedures and daily care, and low utilization of supplemental parenteral nutrition (PN). With tMCS often required for weeks or longer, meeting nutritional needs is increasingly important, and in patients on ECLS, achieving caloric intake within 10% of the goal by the second week of ICU care has been associated with improved 90-day survival.

### A conceptual framework: the early and late phases of skeletal muscle dysfunction in the acute respiratory distress syndrome [^1178igiL]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Pharmacologic and nutritional contributions to early- and late-phase muscle wasting

Some of the earliest reports of muscle weakness in critically ill patients associated the presence of what is now called ICUAW with both glucocorticoids and neuromuscular blockade (NMB). However, more current evidence suggests that glucocorticoids, but not NMB, is associated with ICUAW. In the most compelling recent evidence, a randomized controlled trial of the neuromuscular blocker cisatracurium for severe ARDS, the incidence of ICUAW, measured by MMT, at hospital discharge was no different from control.

The association of ICUAW with glucocorticoids appears stronger than that of NMB. Increased duration of glucocorticoid use is independently associated with increased myosin degradation in the skeletal muscles of critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation. In the ARDS Network Long Term Outcomes study, which followed ARDS survivors enrolled in ARDS network trials, both dose of corticosteroid and ICU length of stay were associated with reduced functional outcomes at 6 and 12 months. These results suggest that drugs or interventions in the ICU, even administered for short durations, can impact long-term outcomes. Other data supporting the importance of glucocorticoids in muscle wasting in ARDS include the fact that the glucocorticoid receptor is an upstream modulator of muscle ring finger 1 (MuRF1) activation, an important contributor to early-phase muscle wasting (see 'The ubiquitin-proteasome system and muscle ring finger 1' section). Overall, the available data suggest that both endogenous and exogenous glucocorticoids contribute to muscle dysfunction in ARDS.

The role of nutrition in muscle weakness in critical illness and its contribution to muscle wasting is controversial, although recent evidence suggests that increased caloric intake during the early phase does not prevent late-phase muscle dysfunction. In the long-term follow-up of patients with ARDS in the EDEN (early versus delayed enteral nutrition) trial, muscle functional outcomes were unchanged between the two arms at 6 and 12 months. Emerging evidence suggests that early parenteral nutrition (PN) is detrimental for muscle function in these patients. The currently available data suggest that early and full caloric nutrition, either enteral or parenteral, does not reduce the incidence of ICUAW in critically ill patients, although future investigation is warranted. Nutritional factors may be more important for improving muscle mass when administered during the late phase.

### Early goal enteral nutrition associated with decreased in-hospital death in mechanically ventilated critically ill adults: a retrospective cohort study [^115Kawmp]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Statistical analysis

Patient characteristics assessed for association with early goal EN and considered for inclusion in models were age, sex, BMI, APACHE II, presence of active infection, use of vasopressors during study days 0–2 (eg, baseline period) and use of neuromuscular blockade during study days 0–2. Means (SD) and counts (percentages) of continuous and categorical patient baseline characteristics, respectively, were tabulated for all patients.

Tests for association between early goal EN and outcomes accounted for 'competing risks' as hospital death and discharge alive are mutually exclusive events. Similarly, we accounted for the competing risk of death in models of successful extubation. Time to event was modelled using the Fine and Gray subdistribution method, which estimates the relative hazards among patients who have not yet experienced the event of interest. A predictor which is significant in this model would, by extension, also be significant and of a corresponding direction in a model of cumulative incidence; these models are thus useful in gauging the impact of a predictor on absolute risk. As advised by Austin et al, we also present cause-specific hazard models which estimate the impact of the predictor absent other competing risks. We have elected to use these complementary approaches to modelling (with and without the inclusion of competing risks) to be rigorous in our examination of outcomes in our study. Both unadjusted and adjusted models were run. Covariates controlled for in adjusted models included age, sex, BMI, APACHE II, the presence of active infection, use of vasopressors during study days 0–2 (eg, baseline period) and use of neuromuscular blockade during study days 0–2. In a set of sensitivity analyses, we repeated all survival models with early goal EN defined as achieving 80% of recommended daily calories (instead of 70%) during the baseline period. Analyses were conducted by using SAS V.9.4. Statistical significance was defined as a two-tailed p < 0.05.

### The effect of cisatracurium infusion on the energy expenditure of critically ill patients: an observational cohort study [^114S18jv]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Strengths and weaknesses

This is the largest cohort of critically ill patients in which the effects of NMBAs on EE have been studied. The effects of NMBAs, especially cisatracurium, in this specific patient population have not been studied before. A large number of patient variables were available with few missing data, providing enough data to perform rigorous multivariable and repeated measure analyses.

However, our study has several limitations. Indirect calorimetry was not routinely available during the study period. Therefore, EE was calculated using VCO 2 obtained from the mechanical ventilator. Calculation of EE from VCO 2 has been demonstrated to be more accurate than predictive equations, but less than indirect calorimetry. Finally, limitations related to the retrospective design may potentially have introduced bias and residual confounding.

Clinical implications

As cisatracurium reduces EE, reduction of caloric intake after the start of NMBAs should be considered, especially in those patients that are on full feeding or considered to reach this target soon, because they are at risk of hypercaloric feeding and associated harm. Before we designed the study, we expected, due to the drop in EE induced by the NMBA, that some of the patients would be overfed. Based on the results, we noticed that a reduction of EE by NMBA could induce an almost 10% overfeeding risk in individual patients. In daily practice, this did not occur as the patients were not on nutrition target. Thus, for most patients, adjustment may not be necessary as in our analysis the reduction of EE found was only 6.6% and hypercaloric feeding was only present in 5.7%, while most other patients were fed (77.9%) hypocalorically after initiation of cisatracurium infusion.

Although not the focus of our present study, it should be noted that the recent ROSE trial, studying the effect of early neuromuscular blockade (48-h continuous infusion of cisatracurium) with concomitant heavy sedation, compared with usual care, did not result in a significant mortality difference at 90 days in patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome in contrast to an earlier RCT. This trial was stopped early at the second interim analysis for futility. This study may lead to reevaluation of the use of NMBAs in severe respiratory failure.

### Core elements of general supportive care for patients with sepsis and septic shock in resource-limited settings [^117BY3ai]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Results and recommendations

The literature search for additional evidence from resource-limited ICUs identified several guidelines; the only randomized trials were of metformin for the treatment of hyperglycemia. Key recommendations are provided in Table 1. Considerations informing each recommendation are described below; more detailed information on the literature search and grading of recommendations is included in the online supplement.

Table 1
Recommendations for core elements of general support for septic patients in resource-limited ICUs

Focused attention and careful evaluation of safety aspects and costs should be a consideration in every patient and in all settings

AKI acute kidney injury, ARDS acute respiratory distress syndrome, EN enteral nutrition, GCS graduated compression stockings, GI gastrointestinal, H2RA histamine-2 receptor antagonist, ICU intensive care unit, IHD intermittent hemodialysis, IPC intermittent pneumatic compression, LMWH low molecular weight heparin, PD peritoneal dialysis, PPI proton pump inhibitor, SSC Surviving Sepsis Campaign, UFH unfractionated heparin, VTE venous thromboembolism

Corticosteroids

Low-dose corticosteroids are readily available and inexpensive; current evidence supports their use in septic patients with refractory shock, pending completion of additional trials (NCT00625209, NCT01448109). Data from recent systematic reviews suggest no increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, superinfection, or neuromuscular weakness, but a possible increased risk of hyperglycemia and hypernatremia. We did not locate trials or relevant observational studies from low-resource ICUs.

Sedation for ventilated patients

Relevant considerations include availability of selected opiates and benzodiazepines (although available in principle, actual availability may vary); the requirement for nursing and medical expertise in the administration and monitoring of sedation to care for mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis; and the potential for delayed recognition of and physician response to a self-extubated patient requiring reintubation, particularly outside of weekday daytime hours. Existing literature largely derives from ICUs with high-intensity nurse staffing, reinforcing the need for caution with lighter sedation strategies in ICUs with fewer nurses.

Neuromuscular blockade for ventilated patients

Selected neuromuscular blocking agents are available in principle in resource-limited settings, although actual availability may vary. Unresolved issues include method of administration (bolus vs. continuous, which may increase complexity and costs) and monitoring via nerve stimulator vs. clinical judgment. Attentive nursing is required to care for patients receiving neuromuscular blockade. We did not locate trials or relevant observational studies from low-resource ICUs but expect additional data (NCT02509078) to inform this question.

### Effect of an enteral amino acid blend on muscle and gut functionality in critically ill patients: a proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial [^111i8JNG]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

This proof-of-concept, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed on two parallel groups. The trial was conducted at the medical ICU at the Raymond Poincaré University Hospital (Assistance Publique Hôpitaux de Paris, Garches, France). The trial protocol was approved by an independent ethics committee (Comité de Protection des Personnes d'Ile de France XI, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France), was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02968836 (registered November 21, 2016) and conducted in accordance with French law and the Declaration of Helsinki.

Participants

Patients were eligible for inclusion within 72 h of ICU admission if they were aged 18 and over, met criteria for sepsis or, following an amendment to the protocol in December 2017, ARDS, and had an expected length of stay in the ICU or in the intermediate care unit of at least 21 days. Patients were excluded if they exhibited muscle mass loss due to previous hospitalization or were cachectic (body mass index < 18.5 kg/m 2 or unintentional weight loss either > 10% of habitual weight indefinite of time, or > 5% over 3 months), intolerant to enteral feeding (vomiting or diarrhoea), receiving long-term parenteral feeding, had a history of chronic renal failure (chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 4 or 5), chronic liver disease (cirrhosis, liver transplant, liver cancer, etc.), or chronic intestinal disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, short bowel syndrome, etc.), had been treated by radiotherapy or chemotherapy for cancer, had a pacemaker or metal implants contraindicating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or were pregnant. Patients receiving neuromuscular-blocking agents were also excluded as well as patients without social security, patients under guardianship, patients expected not to comply with study procedures, and patients having participated in another clinical trial within the last 4 weeks.

Written informed consent was obtained from each patient or from his or her legally authorized representative if the patient was unable to provide consent. Alternatively, deferred written informed consent was obtained from the patients.

Design describes a Society of Critical Care Medicine Task Force comprising 17 members with expertise in neuromuscular-blocking agents, plus a Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation expert and a medical writer, meeting via teleconference and three face-to-face meetings and communicating via e-mail; annually, all members completed conflict of interest statements and no conflicts were identified, and the activity was funded by the Society for Critical Care Medicine with no industry support. Methods used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system to create evidence profiles for six of the 21 questions and to assign quality-of-evidence scores to these and the additional 15 questions, after which members provided recommendations, suggestions, or good practice statements for these 21 questions. Results report a single strong recommendation: "we recommend scheduled eye care that includes lubricating drops or gel and eyelid closure for patients receiving continuous".

### When is enteral nutrition indicated? [^1152hADD]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA or VV) — enteral nutrition timing, adequacy, and tolerance are outlined. Enteral nutrition initiated within the first 24 h of VA or VV ECMO support appears to be safe and well tolerated without adverse events in adult patients compared with parenteral nutrition and helps to decrease gut barrier dysfunction and prevent bacterial translocation. Patients who receive adequate enteral nutrition with delivery of about 80% of nutrient goals of 25 kcal/kg and 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day protein within the first 7 days of VA and VV ECMO have significantly better outcomes and fewer complications compared with patients who received parenteral nutrition. The use of medication paralysis and sedation during VA or VV ECMO does not appear to affect feeding tolerance significantly in terms of time to reach goal enteral nutrition rate, and enteral nutrition is not associated with harm but rather with lower mortality in patients with cardiogenic or obstructive shock requiring ECMO. Evidence is limited because most studies were retrospective case reviews or prospective observational reviews, with most recommendations based on expert opinion with very low quality of evidence, and the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization states that energy and protein support is essential to improve patient outcomes.

### Specific nutrition and metabolic characteristics of critically ill patients with persistent COVID-19 [^115dUewU]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Little is known about metabolic and nutrition characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and persistent critical illness. We aimed to compare those characteristics in patients with PCI and COVID-19 and patients without COVID-19 infection (non-CO)-primarily, their energy balance.

Methods

This is a prospective observational study including two consecutive cohorts, defined as needing intubation for > 10 days. We collected demographic data, severity scores, nutrition variables, length of stay, and mortality.

Results

Altogether, 104 patients (52 per group) were included (59 ± 14 years old [mean ± SD], 75% men) between July 2019 and May 2020. SAPSII, Nutrition Risk Screening (NRS) score, proportion of obese patients, duration of intubation (18.2 ± 11.7 days), and mortality rates were similar. Patients with COVID-19 (vs non-CO) had lower SOFA scores (P = 0.013) and more frequently needed prone position (P < 0.0001) and neuromuscular blockade (P < 0.0001): lengths of ICU (P = 0.03) and hospital stays were shorter (P < 0.0001). Prescribed energy targets were below those of the ICU protocol. The energy balance of patients with COVID-19 was significantly more negative after day 10. Enteral nutrition (EN) started earlier (P < 0.0001). During the first 10 days, COVID-19 patients received more lipid (propofol sedation) and less protein. Higher admission C-reactive protein (P = 0.002) decreased faster (P < 0.001). Whereas intestinal function was characterized by constipation in both groups during the first 10 days, diarrhea was less common in patients with COVID-19 thereafter.

Conclusion

Compared with non-CO patients, COVID-19 patients were not more obese, had lower SOFA scores, and were fed more rapidly with EN, because of a more normal gastrointestinal function possibly due to fewer non-respiratory organ failures: their energy balances were more negative after the first 10 days. Propofol sedation reduced protein delivery.

Characteristics of the patients

Sedation was mainly by propofol during the first 2 weeks in patients with COVID‐19, resulting in significantly higher doses exceeding 5000 mg/day vs 1800 mg/day in non‐CO patients (P < 0.0001) (Figure 2).

Evolution of energy delivery (A), energy target (B), and energy balance (C) of the non‐CO and COVID‐19 cohorts. In (A), the energy delivery per kilogram of IBW is significantly lower in the patients with COVID‐19 after day 10 (P < 0.001), as the non‐CO patients have a progressive adaptation of their targets and hence of deliveries. In (B) and (C), the prescribed (COVID‐19) and per‐protocol (COVID‐19 protocol) energy targets and balances are compared with those of the non‐CO patients. The prescribed values differ significantly from those on day 11 and from those of non‐CO patients. COVID‐19, coronavirus disease 2019; IBW, ideal body weight; non‐CO, non–COVID‐19

The number of patients requiring paralysis via neuromuscular blockade during mechanical ventilation was significantly higher in the COVID‐19 cohort (Table 2; P = 0.0002), as was the duration of paralysis (P < 0.0001).

### Gastric emptying in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients: effect of neuromuscular blocking agent [^115mEAGk]. Intensive Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess gastrointestinal function in critically ill patients receiving muscle relaxant and to test clinical tolerance to enteral nutrition.

Design and Setting

Prospective study in an intensive care unit.

Patients

20 critically ill patients requiring sedation with muscle relaxant to obtain adequate mechanical ventilation.

Measurements and Results

Patients were randomly selected to receive infusions of opioid sedation during the first session (session 1) and the same sedation with muscle relaxation (cisatracurium) during the second session (session 2). Gastric emptying was assessed by the paracetamol absorption technique. Following the paracetamol absorption 200 mL enteral feed was given, and the residual gastric volume was measured 1 and 2 h after feeding. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) was 14 mg/l (range 5–26) when patients received sedation, and 12 mg/l (range 5–30) when they received muscle relaxant. The target time for reaching the maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) was 30 min (range 20–60) and 35 min (range 20–60), respectively, in sessions 1 and 2. There was no significant difference between the two session as regards Tmax, Cmax, or AUC(0–120). The residual volumes were 110 ± 65 mL (H1) and 95 ± 76 mL (H2) during session 1 and 125 ± 85 mL (H1) and 105 ± 90 mL (H2) during session 2.

Conclusions

Enteral feeding is one of the most effective methods of supporting nutritional needs in the critically ill patient. We conclude that in critically ill patients requiring sedation gastric emptying is not improved by neuromuscular blocking agent.

### Conceptual and technical insights into the basis of neuromuscular monitoring [^113PS7ky]. Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Unrecognised postoperative residual neuromuscular block remains a frequent occurrence in recovery rooms. Evidence indicates that current practice continues to perpetuate the status quo, in which 10–40% of patients experience postoperative residual weakness. A departure from the current practice requires small efforts on the clinicians' part. This review addresses several selected core questions regarding neuromuscular blockade monitoring and provides a framework to rationally discuss and develop basic guidelines for the use of neuromuscular blocking agents in patient care.

Nutritional considerations during sustained neuromuscular blocking agent infusions carry no specific directive, as stated: We make no recommendation regarding nutritional requirements specific to patients receiving infusions of NMBAs (insufficient evidence). Supporting data indicate that in 20 patients receiving NMBAs and opioids there were no significant differences in peak paracetamol levels, time to peak, or serum concentration–time curve when cisatracurium was added versus opiate sedation alone, and gut absorption was maintained with NMBA use while gastric emptying was unaffected.

### When is the seriously ill patient ready to be fed? [^115L63U2]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Background

After assessing the critically ill patient for risk of aspiration, the clinician still must decide if the patient is ready to be fed. The goal is to identify critically ill patients who are likely to tolerate enteral nutrition and attempt to minimize complications.

Methods

A synthesis of the both clinical and animal studies to identify factors related to patient readiness for enteral nutrition.

Results

The key issue to be resolved is adequacy of resuscitation and restoration of mesenteric perfusion. Currently, there is no reliable clinical tool to measure gut perfusion. The best indicators currently are stabilization of vital signs, decreasing fluid and blood requirements, normalization of the base deficit, and lactate and removal of inotropic or vasopressor support.

Conclusions

Most critically ill patients should be ready for enteral nutrition within 24 to 48 hours of intensive care unit admission. Critically ill patients who need catecholamine support, heavy sedation, or therapeutic neuromuscular blockade should probably not receive enteral nutrition until they have been stabilized.

### A new high protein-to-energy enteral formula with a whey protein hydrolysate to achieve protein targets in critically ill patients: a prospective observational tolerability study [^113dxURR]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Nutritional composition of the HP:E formula (amounts given per 100 ml).

All patients included in the study received the EN via nasogastric tube by continuous infusion over 24 h with an hour interval every 4–6 h to check for gastric residual volume (GRV). According to the local ICU feeding protocol, EN was initiated in all patients within 24–48 h after admission. After hemodynamic stabilization and under the precondition of a functioning gut, EN was started at an initial feeding rate/volume of 20 ml/h gradually increased by 10 ml/h every 4–6 h until the calculated target volume was reached. Current ESPEN guidelines recommend that gastrointestinal feeding should be delayed when GRV > 500 ml/6 h. In order to anticipate possible intolerance, upon definition of study design authors chose a more conservative approach and decided not to increase the feeding rate with GRV ≥ 300 mL and to prescribe 10 mg of metoclopramide IV three times daily. In case this treatment failed to enhance gastric motility the patient additionally received erythromycin 100 mg IV four times a day. Ventilated patients did not receive any neuromuscular blocking agents.

The nutritional target for the HPG was to achieve a protein intake of ≥ 1.3 g/kgBW/d within 96 h after the initiation of feeding and to compare achievements to the CTG.

For the calculation of target volumes, the patient's BW was adjusted according to the body mass index (BMI). For patients with BMI values between 18.1 kg/m² and 19.9 kg/m², a BW corresponding to a BMI of 22 kg/m² was used for all calculations. For patients with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² to 34.9 kg/m², the calculations were made with a BW corresponding to a BMI of 25 kg/m². For all other patients, we used the actual BW. Since IC was not available at our institution, an approximate energy target according to recommendations was used.

### Clinical practice guidelines for sustained neuromuscular blockade in the adult critically ill patient [^116DHVQx]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Adult critically ill patients — neuromuscular-blocking agents (NMBAs) recommendations are as follows: We suggest that a neuromuscular-blocking agent be administered by continuous intravenous infusion early in acute respiratory distress syndrome for patients with a Pao2/Fio2 less than 150. We suggest against the routine administration of neuromuscular-blocking agents to mechanically ventilated patients with status asthmaticus. We suggest a trial of neuromuscular-blocking agents in life-threatening situations associated with profound hypoxemia, respiratory acidosis, or hemodynamic compromise. We suggest that neuromuscular-blocking agents may be used to manage overt shivering in therapeutic hypothermia. We suggest that peripheral nerve stimulation with train-of-four monitoring may be a useful tool for monitoring the depth of neuromuscular blockade but only if it is incorporated into a more inclusive patient assessment that includes clinical assessment. We suggest against the use of peripheral nerve stimulation with train of four alone for monitoring the depth of neuromuscular blockade in patients receiving continuous infusion of neuromuscular-blocking agents. We suggest that patients receiving a continuous infusion of neuromuscular-blocking agent receive a structured physiotherapy regimen. We suggest that clinicians target a blood glucose level of less than 180 mg/dL in patients receiving neuromuscular-blocking agents. We suggest that clinicians not use actual body weight and instead use a consistent weight (ideal body weight or adjusted body weight) when calculating neuromuscular-blocking agents doses for obese patients. We suggest that neuromuscular-blocking agents be discontinued at the end of life or when life support is withdrawn.

### Creating the animated intensive care unit [^115eeBet]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Critical care medicine has matured greatly as a field in the past decade. Much has been learned concerning the institution of life support therapies to sustain patients with diverse and multiple organ failures, thus providing patients with a window of opportunity to recover from potentially life-ending insults. The management of critically ill patients has increasingly involved creation of a highly controlled environment by care providers, with patients immobilized, tethered to devices, and receiving multiple drugs to facilitate the entire process. Although it has been assumed that such control of the patient has been necessary to implement essential therapies and to tailor life support systems such as mechanical ventilation, this assumption may be unfounded or at least overplayed, as knowledge of the adverse effects of this approach have been identified and quantified. Extant information, based on observational studies and a few interventional trials, would suggest a radically different approach to care is warranted, even given the difficulties in reversing the current culture of critical care management. Specifically, methods to avoid entirely, or minimize, neuromuscular blockade and sedation are supported by recent literature. These methods include the use of noninvasive ventilation in appropriately selected patients, the development of mechanical ventilators more synchronous with patient efforts and needs, and the use of sedation strategies to avoid drug accumulations with protracted effects. These methods, in turn, afford opportunities to avoid extreme immobilization and institute physiotherapy earlier than previously had been thought possible. In addition to the neuropsychiatric and neuromuscular benefits that could derive from minimizing opiate administration in critically ill patients, gut hypomotility could be avoided. This, in turn, could facilitate earlier and more complete enteral nutrition. Even when opioids have to be administered in generous amounts for control of pain that may accompany critical illness, it is now possible to block the peripheral actions of these medications with the μ-receptor antagonist methylnaltrexone. Other new drugs being introduced into the critical care unit such as dexmedetomidine may also provide a greater ability to achieve analgesia and anxiolysis without some of the adverse concomitant effects seen with more traditional drug regimens. The ultimate goal of this multipronged program to facilitate the maintenance of patients who are more interactive with their care providers, and the life support provided in the intensive care unit would be to speed the pace of recovery and to diminish the need for the protracted rehabilitation that often follows survival from critical illness.

### Personalized nutrition therapy in critical care: 10 expert recommendations [^115xNAML]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 1: When do we start nutrition? Personalization of initiating nutrition in ICU

Societal guidelines emphasize initiation of early enteral nutrition (EN) with rationale that changes in gut barrier are seen within 24 h and include evidence of intestinal ischemia, increased permeability, bacterial translocation, and dysbiosis. Current literature supports early EN(EEN) may attenuate changes via range of "non-nutritional benefits" and improve outcomes compared to delayed EN(DEN). Recent meta-analyses show EEN versus DEN associates with fewer complications, infectious morbidity, and ICU/hospital length of stay(LOS). In two meta-analyses, EEN associates with significant reduction in mortality, a benefit not confirmed by two other meta-analyses. EEN benefit is supported in COVID-19 in national database study showing reduced ventilator time and reduced ICU/hospital LOS when COVID-19 ICU patients are fed within three days of admission.

EEN timing in guidelines ranges from first 24 h or 24–48 h of ICU admission. Delay or slowing EN advancement is suggested in GI bleeding, mesenteric ischemia, GI intolerance (i.e. GRV > 500 ml), risk of aspiration, intestinal obstruction, abdominal compartment syndrome, risk of refeeding syndrome (or phosphate < 0.65 mmol/L) or unresuscitated hemodynamic instability on vasopressors. No delay is suggested on vasopressors (norepinephrine < 0.3 ug/kg/min) who are adequately resuscitated (i.e. normalized lactate), open abdomen, neuromuscular blockade, therapeutic hypothermia, ECMO, or prone positioning.

In patients with EEN contraindications, parenteral nutrition (PN) personalization is described in Question 4. However, higher doses of either EN/PN should be avoided on high doses of vasopressors (norepinephrine ≥ 0.3 ug/kg/min) prior to reasonable vasopressor weaning. This is reinforced by Nutrirea-3 trial showing increased ICU LOS by one day in intubated patients on vasopressors (admit norepinephrine:0.5 ug/kg/m) in low-dose nutrition group (6 kcal/kg/day//0·2–0·4 g/kg/day protein) vs full-nutrition (25 kcal/kg/day//1·0–1·3 g/kg/day protein). No difference in mortality/infection was observed. Key message is early high-dose feeding should be avoided until patient is stabilized early in ICU stay.

Lower parts of GI tract are often involved, even in the absence of upper GI intolerance. Lower GI intolerance requires different management. Bowel paralysis leading to bowel distension in patient receiving EN may be associated with adverse outcomes. Patients in shock receiving early full EN compared to PN more often developed Ogilvie's syndrome and bowel ischemia. Monitoring and management of EFI and GI dysfunction is complicated due to the lack of robust and reproducible markers and multifaceted clinical presentation. As no single straightforward marker reliably detects GI dysfunction, using composite scores combining several symptoms and signs could be helpful and should be considered. EFI at the bedside is defined as features of GI dysfunction appearing during EN and consequently leading to reduction or discontinuation of EN. Evidence on management options, unanswered issues and proposals for future research on GI dysfunction have been recently summarized. In brief, patients should be carefully assessed for high gastric residual volume (optional — threshold 500 ml/6 h), vomiting, pain, distension, elevated/increasing intra-abdominal pressure, GI paralysis.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in adults with Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^11112ruD]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Good Practice Statements

These statements reflect good clinical practice that in the judgment of the content experts lacked a meaningful body of direct evidence to answer a question framed in PICOTS format, often because of insufficient clinical equipoise. Explicit statement of these clinical practice principles was nevertheless considered essential to provide context as well as appropriate guidance.
Good practice statement 1: We recommend that assessment of the neurological prognosis for patients with GBS should simultaneously focus on two phases of the illness: the acute course of hospitalization and long-term recovery (strong recommendation, evidence cannot be graded). Rationale: The course of GBS in patients requiring admission to a critical care unit is framed by three time points: diagnosis, discharge, and recovery. The acute phase is characterized by possible compromise of respiratory function, autonomic dysfunction, and cardiovascular complications. The postacute phase will focus on recovery of motor and other functions but often differs for patients who require mechanical ventilation during the acute phase. Providing outlook on all phases is supported by analysis of patients' perception.
Good practice statement 2: Guillain–Barré syndrome is a dynamic illness during the acute course, and rapid progression may occur. We recommend that neuroprognostication in patients with GBS in the acute phase should include a discussion about the possible need for mechanical ventilation and enteral nutrition bypassing the oral route (strong recommendation, evidence cannot be graded). Rationale: Ten to thirty percent of all patients with GBS will require mechanical ventilation during the disease course. Once mechanically ventilated, seven of ten patients will require prolonged mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy. This will usually also require percutaneous gastrostomy for nutrition. Requirement of ventilatory support directly affects planning of rehabilitation and has been associated with longer rehabilitation needs.
Good practice statement 3: We recommend that prognostication for patients with GBS should be performed with consideration of the complete clinical condition and never based on a single variable (strong recommendation, evidence cannot be graded). Rationale: As outlined above, there are a number of limitations to the available body of evidence in factors of prognostication in GBS. Although prediction models have been developed to take into account several factors, other considerations, including complications during hospitalization and factors that may affect quality of life subsequently, are important to address and consider.

Recommendations: Clinical Variables as Predictors

Although several combinations of predictors and outcomes were identified as clinically relevant, in the section below, we only present recommendations for the predictor/outcome combinations with a sufficient body of evidence that met our criteria, described in the Systematic review methodology section.

Limitations

This study was limited by its retrospective observational nature and the inherent bias this introduces. We have considered that feeds are limited in patients with high clinical severity and thus the difference in outcomes may be related to this bias rather than true harm or benefit from the early goal EN. We attempted to limit this confounding via model adjustment. For instance, in adjusted models, we have controlled for APACHE II, presence of infection, use of vasopressors and use of neuromuscular blockade which are all likely to influence the ability to achieve adequate feeding in the baseline period and likely to influence outcomes. Despite such adjustment, we recognise that there may be some residual confounding. Additionally, due to constraints of automated and manual chart review, we did not account for calories obtained from protein supplements or non-nutritional sources (such as dextrose or propofol infusions). Finally, as we were constrained to study the feeding patterns as they occurred in our unit, we could not fully explore the harms and benefits of various feeding doses (eg, moderate doses between 30% and 60% or high doses approaching 100%).

Results

Safety, feasibility and tolerability

Participants were recruited between 26th September 2019 and 22nd April 2021 (including two COVID-19-pandemic related pauses) from two United Kingdom ICUs. Trial follow-up was completed by the end of April 2022. The CONSORT flow chart is available in the Supplementary Information (Fig. S1). A total of 293 patients were screened, with screening continuing until 29 patients were randomised after meeting inclusion criteria (see Supplementary Information Table S3) giving a refusal rate for assent of 4.1% (12 patients). The rate of recruitment was 2.2 participants/month for the 13 months enrolment period (Fig. S2). Participant retention rate was 82.8% (24 patients). Reasons for withdrawal are shown in Supplementary Information Table S4.

Participant demographics are shown in Tables 1 and 2. At the end of the intervention period, the number of days of vasopressor support and total daily propofol dose were higher in the control arm.

Process and feasibility of nutritional delivery

All patients randomised to the intervention received ketogenic enteral feeding. Feedback was obtained from 23 staff (4 research nurses, 16 ICU nurses, 1 pharmacist, 1 dietitian, 1 ICU consultant). The trial process was considered acceptable and feasible (see Supplementary Information Fig. S3), although the preparation of the modular feed was considered laborious. A mean score of 8/10 (with 10 scored as the most positive response) was obtained for the question ' How keen would you be to work on another similar study ?'

Serious Adverse Events

Four serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported, and all were deemed to be unrelated to the intervention. Details of these are available in the Supplementary Information (Table S5). No episodes of pulmonary aspiration were reported.

### Clinical practice guidelines for sustained neuromuscular blockade in the adult critically ill patient [^114H63oV]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Adult critically ill patients — topics with no recommendation are as follows: We make no recommendation as to whether neuromuscular blockade is beneficial or harmful when used in patients with acute brain injury and raised intracranial pressure. We make no recommendation on the routine use of neuromuscular-blocking agents for patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia following cardiac arrest. We make no recommendation on the use of peripheral nerve stimulation to monitor degree of block in patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia. We make no recommendation on the use of neuromuscular blockade to improve the accuracy of intravascular-volume assessment in mechanically ventilated patients. We make no recommendation concerning the use of electroencephalogram-derived parameters as a measure of sedation during continuous administration of neuromuscular-blocking agents. We make no recommendation regarding nutritional requirements specific to patients receiving infusions of neuromuscular-blocking agents. We make no recommendation concerning the use of one measure of consistent weight over another when calculating neuromuscular-blocking agent doses in obese patients. We make no recommendation on the use of neuromuscular-blocking agents in pregnant patients. We make no recommendation on which muscle group should be monitored in patients with myasthenia gravis receiving neuromuscular-blocking agents.

Feeding on vasopressors and in paralyzed patients

A recent retrospective study has shown that early EN in paralyzed patients was associated with less hospital mortality, and there is no increase in ventilator-associated pneumonia. However, in this study, paralysis duration was short: 48 h. In COVID-19 patients, paralysis is usually longer. There is no data about how to feed the ICU COVID-19 patients who are paralyzed for > 48 h. In our experience, there is no increase in EN complications in these patients. Therefore, we propose to adapt nutrition support as generally done in case of GI intolerance (see the " PN is indicated if EN is impossible, contraindicated, or insufficient and should be prescribed using a case-by-case decision making " section).

As there is no data about feeding under vasopressors in the ICU COVID-19 patients, we propose to refer to a recent review and follow the ESPEN recommendations: "the use of concomitant vasopressors (especially with stable or decreasing doses) should not preclude a trial of EN. In very unstable patients, EN may not have priority".

Hence, there is no evidence for a higher protein intake in critically ill patients in terms of clinically relevant outcomes in prospective randomized trials. Moreover, some harm can be related to excessive amounts of proteins in a post hoc analysis of prospective trials performed in adults or in children and in a retrospective study. Hence, it may be prudent to start protein delivery at a lower dose (~ 0.8 g/kg) and ramp up protein dose to the targeted protein goal (> 1.2–1.3 g/kg/day (Fig. 2). However, this strategy was not previously evaluated in prospective studies.

Fig. 2
Recommendations for the progression of enteral nutrition delivery, micronutrients delivery and management of refeeding.

Adapted from: CHUV Lausanne and Gelderse Vallei Hospitals. The X axis represents the time from admission (days, arbitrary example) and the Y axis the percentage of nutritional goal determined by a computer protocol using sex, height, weight (first 3 days) and later by indirect calorimetry or calculation prioritizing the avoidance of energy overfeeding. Regular (hourly) checks of intakes including the amount of non-nutritional energy (propofol, glucose, citrate) are recommended to adapt the infusion rate. Multi-micronutrients are administered IV until the dietary recommended intakes are met by the EN solution. The screening for refeeding syndrome is based on daily phosphate determination from day 2. In case of hypophosphatemia (hypoP) (serum phosphate (PO4) < 0.65 mmol/l, or a drop from baseline > 0.16 mmol/l occurring within 72 h of the start of EN) decrease the amount of energy delivered to a maximum of 500 kcal/day, supplement phosphate, magnesium (Mg) and potassium (K) and additional boluses of thiamine (vit B1, 500–1000 mg IV)

The role of high-protein intakes that stress the need for focused larger clinical trial evidence examining the effect of specifically increasing protein delivery, combined with active mobilization to optimize physical therapy and functional outcomes in long-stayers, requires further study. Importantly, muscle volume and strength are not necessarily related. Preliminary data suggest that the combination of neuromuscular electrical stimulation and high-protein supplementation (1.8 g/kg/day) significantly improved short physical performance. The role of high-dose protein delivery and in-bed ergometry (cycling) is being meaningfully studied (NCT03021902).

### Association between early nutrition support and 28-day mortality in critically ill patients: the FRANS prospective nutrition cohort study [^115WPbVa]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

The following nutritional data were collected daily during the 10 first days of ICU stay: volume (mL/day) and route of administration of nutrition support (enteral, parenteral or both), volume of propofol infusion (mL/day) and intravenous glucose (mL/day), prescription of vitamin therapy and trace elements (type and volume in mL). We then calculated the patients' total energy and protein intakes per kilogram of body weight received by patients, from both nutritional and non-nutritional solutions. Non-nutritional calories were calculated from both the daily propofol and glucose intakes. Propofol accounted for 1.1 kcal/ml and dextrose for 4 kcal/g. Calculated non-nutritional energy was added to energy received through enteral and/or parenteral nutrition and presented as 'total caloric intake'. Regarding obese patients, the nutritional intake per kilogram was based on their adjusted body weight (BW) (ideal BW + 0.25 × (actual BW − ideal BW). The ideal BW was based on the patient's height at a BMI of 25 kg/m 2. We considered that patients reached the recommended energy and protein targets if their intakes were above 25 kcal/kg/day and 1.3 g/kg/day, respectively. To consider the progressive rise in energy and protein intakes, instead of using an average intake smoothed over the follow-up, patients were considered to have reached the target if the total daily intake observed during the nutritional follow-up was above the guideline threshold at least once. Early nutrition support was defined as the administration of any nutritional solution, enteral and/or parenteral, during the first 48 h after ICU admission, as described in international guidelines.

Specific information concerning organ support and critical care therapies was collected daily: invasive mechanical ventilation, use of neuromuscular blocking agents, vasopressors and sedation. Digestive tract events were also noted every day, including bowel movements, emesis and diarrhoea. Feeding intolerance was defined as the occurrence of emesis and/or diarrhoea concomitant with enteral nutrition administration.

The collected patient outcomes were the total duration of both invasive and noninvasive mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, ICU mortality and day-28 (D28) mortality.
