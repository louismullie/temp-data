## Question

positive quantiferon after 9 months isoniazid for latent tb normal?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is normal to have a persistently positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold (IGRA) result after completing 9 months of isoniazid for latent TB infection, and what the clinical implications of this are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the immunologic basis of IGRAs and why they might stay positive despite effective therapy. Then, I should review direct evidence on IGRA dynamics during and after isoniazid treatment. Next, I will examine meta-analytic data on reversion rates and whether they differ by regimen or population. After that, I need to check guideline positions on using IGRAs to monitor treatment response. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded interpretation and recommendation, including when, if ever, repeat testing is reasonable and what to do if the result remains positive.

> Let me first confirm the immunologic rationale. IGRAs measure interferon-gamma release in response to RD1 antigens (ESAT-6, CFP-10), reflecting a durable memory T-cell response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis; eradication of a small bacillary burden in LTBI does not necessarily erase established T-cell memory, so IGRA positivity can persist despite effective therapy, which aligns with the pathophysiology of latent infection rather than active disease [^116mwske] [^111BEYz9].

> Next, I should review direct evidence on isoniazid and IGRA responses. In a prospective controlled study of South African adults with positive TST, 6 months of isoniazid did not significantly change QFT-GIT reversion rates compared with observation, with only about 5% reverting in each group, indicating that short-course isoniazid had minimal impact on IGRA conversion to negative in that setting [^1161xUUX]. Similarly, a healthcare worker cohort treated with 9 months of isoniazid remained QFT positive at completion, underscoring that persistence is expected even with standard-duration therapy in some populations [^111fCgy9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify broader reversion data. A systematic review and meta-analysis across 52 studies found similar pooled reversion rates around 25% both in treated and untreated individuals, reinforcing that reversion is common regardless of prophylaxis and that IGRA reversion is not a reliable biomarker of treatment efficacy; subgroup signals suggesting higher reversion with 9 months of isoniazid or in Asian cohorts exist but are hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^1131pgTf]. Let me also consider rifamycin-based regimens: in a large randomized trial of weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid (3HP) versus 9 months of isoniazid, reversion rates were similar across arms and not significantly different from untreated controls, again arguing against using IGRA dynamics to judge treatment response [^notfound].

> I need to check guideline positions next. CDC/NTCA 2020 guidelines do not recommend using IGRAs to monitor response to LTBI therapy; they emphasize clinical completion of the recommended regimen and do not advise serial IGRA testing to assess efficacy, reflecting the lack of correlation between IGRA reversion and protection from progression to TB disease [^notfound]. WHO guidance likewise focuses on regimen completion rather than serial IGRA monitoring, aligning with this stance [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a special population or the baseline IFN-γ value was very high? Could that change interpretation? Let me consider modifiers. Higher baseline IFN-γ levels have been associated with lower likelihood of IGRA reversion after therapy, and immunologic and technical variability can confound serial interpretations, especially near the assay cut-point; preanalytical delays and within-person variability further limit the reliability of serial testing for decision-making [^112vsHmg] [^117SPT35] [^116DTWE8] [^114gpoKw].

> I should double-check the clinical implications. Persistently positive IGRA after 9 months of isoniazid does not indicate treatment failure; LTBI treatment reduces the risk of progression to active TB by roughly 60–90% depending on completion and risk group, and this benefit is independent of whether the IGRA becomes negative afterward, so a positive IGRA at the end of therapy should not prompt additional treatment or concern if the patient completed the recommended regimen and has no signs of active disease [^112MvpnN] [^113EsVFp] [^11238S4H].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing anything. Yes, it is normal for QuantiFERON to remain positive after 9 months of isoniazid for LTBI. IGRAs are not validated as treatment-monitoring tools, reversion is variable and not required for efficacy, and guidelines advise against serial IGRA testing for this purpose. The priority is confirming regimen completion, excluding active TB if symptoms arise, and avoiding unnecessary repeat IGRAs that could create confusion without changing management [^1131pgTf].

> Practical next steps: I should confirm the patient completed the full 9-month isoniazid course, document adherence and any adverse effects, and ensure active TB was appropriately excluded at baseline. If the patient remains asymptomatic with a normal chest radiograph, no further testing is indicated, whereas if new symptoms or imaging abnormalities arise, evaluate for active TB using standard diagnostic pathways rather than relying on IGRA status. If a repeat IGRA is obtained for nonclinical reasons, interpret any result cautiously given variability and the absence of validated decision thresholds for post-treatment management [^112MvpnN] [^112eoZqu] [^114gpoKw].

It is **normal** for a QuantiFERON-TB Gold test to remain positive after 9 months of isoniazid for latent TB, because IGRAs reflect durable immune memory and are not designed to monitor treatment response [^111fCgy9]. IGRA results often persist despite effective therapy, and **guidelines advise against using IGRAs to monitor LTBI treatment** [^notfound]. Persistent positivity does not indicate treatment failure; assess adherence and exclude active TB if symptoms arise [^111fCgy9].

---

## Immunological basis of persistent IGRA positivity

IGRAs measure IFN-γ release in response to TB antigens, reflecting **durable T-cell memory** that can persist after bacterial clearance. This memory response explains why IGRAs often remain positive despite effective therapy [^1131pgTf].

---

## Clinical evidence on IGRA dynamics during isoniazid treatment

Multiple studies show that IGRAs frequently remain positive after isoniazid therapy:

- **Healthcare workers**: After 9 months of isoniazid, all remained QFT positive, with persistent strong PPD responses [^111fCgy9].
- **South African adults**: No significant difference in QFT reversion between isoniazid and observation groups; only ~5% reverted in each arm [^1161xUUX].
- **Meta-analysis**: Reversion rates were similar in treated and untreated groups (~25%), indicating limited utility for monitoring therapy [^1131pgTf].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines **advise against using IGRAs to monitor LTBI treatment**:

- **CDC/NTCA 2020**: IGRAs are not recommended for monitoring LTBI treatment response [^notfound].
- **WHO 2020**: IGRAs are not recommended for monitoring LTBI treatment response.
- **ATS/IDSA/CDC 2017**: IGRAs cannot distinguish active from latent TB and should not be used to monitor treatment [^112eoZqu].

---

## Clinical implications of persistent IGRA positivity

Persistent IGRA positivity after isoniazid therapy **does not indicate treatment failure**. Clinicians should:

- **Confirm adherence**: Ensure the patient completed the 9-month isoniazid course [^112MvpnN].
- **Exclude active TB**: Evaluate for active disease if symptoms or new risk factors arise [^112MvpnN].
- **Avoid repeat IGRAs**: Do not use IGRAs to monitor treatment response [^113EsVFp].

---

## Factors influencing IGRA reversion

Several factors affect the likelihood of IGRA reversion:

| **Factor** | **Influence on reversion** |
|-|-|
| Baseline IFN-γ level | Higher baseline levels are associated with lower reversion rates [^112vsHmg] |
| Age | Younger patients have higher reversion rates [^notfound] |
| Immunosuppression | Lower reversion rates in immunocompromised patients [^notfound] |
| Treatment regimen | Shorter rifamycin-based regimens have higher completion rates but similar reversion rates [^113EsVFp] [^111xc8Hc] |

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

It is **normal** for a QuantiFERON-TB Gold test to remain positive after 9 months of isoniazid therapy because IGRAs reflect persistent immune memory. IGRAs are not recommended for monitoring LTBI treatment; persistent positivity does not indicate failure. Clinicians should confirm adherence, exclude active TB if indicated, and avoid repeat IGRA testing [^111fCgy9].

### Recommendations for use of an isoniazid-rifapentine regimen with direct observation to treat latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection [^111gmE8Z]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2011). Low credibility.

Preventing tuberculosis (TB) by treating latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is a cornerstone of the U.S. strategy for TB elimination. Three randomized controlled trials have shown that a new combination regimen of isoniazid (INH) and rifapentine (RPT) administered weekly for 12 weeks as directly observed therapy (DOT) is as effective for preventing TB as other regimens and is more likely to be completed than the U.S. standard regimen of 9 months of INH daily without DOT. This report provides CDC recommendations for using the INH-RPT regimen. The new regimen is recommended as an equal alternative to the 9-month INH regimen for otherwise healthy patients aged ≥ 12 years who have LTBI and factors that are predictive of TB developing (e.g., recent exposure to contagious TB). The new regimen also can be considered for other categories of patients when it offers practical advantages. Although the INH-RPT regimen was well tolerated in treatment trials, monitoring for adverse effects is recommended. Severe adverse effects should be reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and CDC.

### Predictive value of a whole blood IFN-gamma assay for the development of active tuberculosis disease after recent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis [^1162A6Dg]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Rationale

Numerous studies have been published on the new Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)-specific IFN-gamma release assays. However, their prognostic value for progression from latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) to active TB has yet to be established.

Objectives

To compare the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube assay (QFT) with the tuberculin skin test (TST) in recently exposed close contacts of active TB cases with respect to their development of TB disease within 2 years.

Methods

Close contacts (n = 601) of MTB-positive source cases underwent both TST and QFT testing and were subsequently observed for 103 (± 13.5) weeks. Risk factors for MTB infection were evaluated by multivariate analysis.

Measurements and Main Results

For the TST, 40.4% (243/601) of contacts were positive at a 5-mm cutoff, whereas only 66 (11%) were QFT positive. QFT positivity, but not TST, was associated with exposure time (P < 0.0001). Six contacts progressed to TB disease within the 2-year follow-up. All were QFT positive and had declined preventive treatment, equating to a progression rate of 14.6% (6/41) among those who were QFT positive. The progression rate for untreated TST-positive subjects was significantly lower (P < 0.003), at 2.3% (5 of 219), and one subject who progressed was TST negative.

Conclusions

Results suggest that QFT is a more accurate indicator of the presence of LTBI than the TST and provides at least the same sensitivity for detecting those who will progress to active TB. The high rate of progression to active TB of those who are QFT positive (14.6%), which is far greater than the 2.3% found for those who are TST positive, has health and economic implications for enhanced TB control, particularly if this higher progression rate is seen in studies of other at-risk populations.

Four Months of Daily Rifampin

A regimen of 4 months of daily rifampin is a preferred treatment that is strongly recommended for HIV-negative adults and children of all ages. (No evidence is available for effectiveness in HIV-positive persons.) The effectiveness of this regimen was clinically equivalent to, and less toxic than, the standard regimen of 9 months of daily isoniazid in adults and children. Four months of daily rifampin had noninferior effectiveness in preventing TB disease compared with 9 months of daily isoniazid, as well as a lower rate of treatment discontinuation because of adverse effects, a lower rate of hepatotoxicity, and a higher rate of treatment completion.

The potential disadvantages of the rifamycin-based regimens are the many drug interactions, including warfarin, oral contraceptives, azole antifungals, and HIV antiretroviral therapy. Rifabutin has fewer or less pronounced drug interactions and may be used in place of rifampin when rifampin is contraindicated due to drug-drug interactions and isoniazid cannot be used. Drug interactions with weekly rifapentine are fewer than with rifampin and appear to be fewer than with rifabutin; therefore, weekly isoniazid and rifapentine could be considered when rifampin is contraindicated, although clinical data are limited. Drug-drug interactions between rifamycins and antiretroviral therapy are regularly updated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In HIV-positive persons with low CD4+ lymphocyte counts, the risk for asymptomatic or subclinical TB disease increases, possibly facilitating rifampin resistance if TB disease is inadvertently treated with rifampin monotherapy.

### Challenges with quantiFERON-TB gold assay for large-scale, routine screening of U.S. healthcare workers [^114gpoKw]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Rationale

North American occupational health programs that switched from the tuberculin skin test (TST) to IFN-γ release assays for latent tuberculosis screening are reporting challenges with interpretation of serial testing results in healthcare workers (HCWs). However, limited data exist on the reproducibility of serial IFN-γ release assay results in low-risk HCWs.

Objectives

To evaluate the short-term reproducibility of QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) in a large cohort of HCWs and to define a QFT cutoff yielding a conversion rate equivalent to historical TST rates.

Methods

We retrospectively evaluated the QFT results from HCWs with two or more QFT tests performed between June 2008 and July 2010 at an academic institution. Outcome measures were proportions of reproducibility, quantitative results, and conversion rates with alternate QFT cutoffs.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 9,153 HCWs with two or more QFT tests were included in the analysis. Of 8,227 individuals with a negative result, 4.4% (n = 361) converted their QFT result over 2 years. A total of 261 (72.3%) of the HCWs with conversions underwent repeat short-term testing after the first positive result with 64.8% reverting (n = 169). An IFN-γ cutoff of 5.3 IU/ml or higher (manufacturer's cutoff is ≥ 0.35 IU/ml) yielded a conversion rate of 0.4%, equal to our institution's historical TST conversion rate.

Conclusions

The manufacturer's definition of QFT conversion results in an inflated conversion rate that is incompatible with our low-risk setting. A significantly higher QFT cutoff value is needed to match the historical TST conversion rate. Nonreproducible conversions in most converters suggested false-positive results.

### Relevance of latent TB infection in areas of high TB prevalence [^115hkp81]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

About one-third of the world population has latent TB infection (LTBI), the majority of which is distributed in 22 high-burden countries. Early diagnosis and treatment of active TB remains the top priority in resource-poor countries with high TB prevalence. Notwithstanding, because LTBI contributes significantly to the pool of active TB cases later on, its diagnosis and treatment is essential, especially in high-risk groups. The lack of a gold standard and several limitations of currently available tools, namely the tuberculin skin test and interferon-γ release assays, are major constraints for LTBI diagnosis. In areas with high TB prevalence, interferon-γ release assays have not shown superiority over the conventional tuberculin skin test and are yet to be systematically studied. Decisions regarding LTBI treatment with isoniazid preventive therapy should be made, keeping in mind the high prevalence of isoniazid resistance in these settings. Although efforts to shorten the LTBI treatment duration are encouraging, most trials have focused on adherence and toxicity. Future trials on short-duration regimens in high-burden settings should address drug efficacy issues as well. LTBI management, therefore, should comprise a targeted screening approach and individualization of LTBI treatment protocols. In addition, efforts should focus on airborne infection control measures in high-burden countries. A high prevalence of drug-resistant TB, the HIV epidemic, and delays in the diagnosis of active TB cases are other major concerns in areas of high TB prevalence. There is ample space for further research in these countries, whose outcomes may strengthen future national guidelines.

### Three months of rifapentine and isoniazid for latent tuberculosis infection [^111A37io]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

Treatment of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is an essential component of tuberculosis control and elimination. The current standard regimen of isoniazid for 9 months is efficacious but is limited by toxicity and low rates of treatment completion.

Methods

We conducted an open-label, randomized noninferiority trial comparing 3 months of directly observed once-weekly therapy with rifapentine (900 mg) plus isoniazid (900 mg) (combination-therapy group) with 9 months of self-administered daily isoniazid (300 mg) (isoniazid-only group) in subjects at high risk for tuberculosis. Subjects were enrolled from the United States, Canada, Brazil, and Spain and followed for 33 months. The primary end point was confirmed tuberculosis, and the noninferiority margin was 0.75%.

Results

In the modified intention-to-treat analysis, tuberculosis developed in 7 of 3986 subjects in the combination-therapy group (cumulative rate, 0.19%) and in 15 of 3745 subjects in the isoniazid-only group (cumulative rate, 0.43%), for a difference of 0.24 percentage points. Rates of treatment completion were 82.1% in the combination-therapy group and 69.0% in the isoniazid-only group (P < 0.001). Rates of permanent drug discontinuation owing to an adverse event were 4.9% in the combination-therapy group and 3.7% in the isoniazid-only group (P = 0.009). Rates of investigator-assessed drug-related hepatotoxicity were 0.4% and 2.7%, respectively (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

The use of rifapentine plus isoniazid for 3 months was as effective as 9 months of isoniazid alone in preventing tuberculosis and had a higher treatment-completion rate. Long-term safety monitoring will be important. (Funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; PREVENT TB ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00023452.).

### Guidelines for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020 [^114Pmvkv]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A systematic literature review was performed of clinical trial data pertaining to effectiveness and toxicity of treatment of LTBI, including studies published since the 2018 World Health Organization LTBI guidelines. Evidence quality was evaluated using the GRADE approach, and a network meta-analysis was performed, updated to include data from studies published since a previous network meta-analysis, to compare regimens not evaluated head-to-head in clinical trials.

Recommendations were formulated on the basis of the balance of desirable and undesirable consequences of the intervention, the quality of evidence, patient values and preferences, and feasibility. These factors also informed the priority rank of the regimens as preferred or alternative, with preference for shorter regimens, given their similar efficacy compared with 6–9 months of isoniazid but favorable tolerability and higher treatment completion rates. This combination of characteristics should result in greater effectiveness of the shorter regimens in clinical settings. More effective treatment of LTBI will facilitate TB elimination. Prescribing providers or pharmacists who are unfamiliar with rifampin and rifapentine might confuse the two drugs. They are not interchangeable, and caution should be taken to ensure that patients receive the correct medication for the intended regimen.

Although 9 months of isoniazid was a preferred regimen in the guidelines published in 2000, both 6 and 9 months of isoniazid were recommended at that time. In these current guidelines, application of GRADE criteria resulted in a strong recommendation for 6 months of isoniazid as an alternative for those persons unable to take a shorter preferred regimen (e.g. due to drug intolerability or drug-drug interactions), particularly in HIV-negative persons. The longer duration of isoniazid could increase the risk for hepatotoxicity and although increased effectiveness is plausible, the two treatment durations have not been directly compared.

Two months of rifampin plus pyrazinamide are not recommended for treatment of LTBI because of the hepatotoxicity risk. However, in persons treated empirically for TB disease with isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide for 2 months, this regimen will effectively treat LTBI in persons subsequently determined to have LTBI rather than TB disease.

### Rifapentine (Priftin) [^114AmD1A]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.2 Latent Tuberculosis Infection

A multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized, active-controlled trial compared the effectiveness of 12 weekly doses of PRIFTIN in combination with isoniazid (3RPT/INH arm) administered by directly observed therapy to 9 months of self-administered daily isoniazid (9INH arm). The trial enrolled patients two years of age or older with positive tuberculin skin test and at high risk for progression to tuberculosis disease. Enrolled patients included those having close contact with a patient with active tuberculosis disease, recent (within two years) conversion to a positive tuberculin skin test, HIV-infection, or fibrosis on chest radiograph. PRIFTIN was dosed by weight, for a maximum of 900 mg weekly. Isoniazid mg/kg dose was determined by age, for a maximum of 900 mg weekly in the 3RPT/INH arm and 300 mg daily in the 9INH arm [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

The outcome measure was the development of active tuberculosis disease, defined as culture-confirmed tuberculosis in adults and culture-confirmed or clinical tuberculosis in children less than 18 years of age, at 33 months after trial enrollment. Patients who were found after enrollment to be ineligible because they had active tuberculosis disease, were contacts of a source case with culture-negative or drug-resistant tuberculosis disease cases or no information regarding susceptibility of M. tuberculosis, and young children lacking a positive TST on initial and repeat testing were excluded from the analysis.

Active tuberculosis disease developed in 5 of 3074 randomized patients in the 3RPT/INH group (0.16%) versus 10 of 3074 patients in 9INH group (0.32%), for a difference in cumulative rates of 0.17%, 95% CI (-0.43, 0.09) (Table 10).

The proportion of patients completing treatment was 81.2% in the 3RPT/INH group and 68.3% in the 9INH group for a difference (3RPT/INH-9INH) of 12.8% 95% CI (10.7, 15.0).

In the 9INH treatment group, two of the thirteen culture-confirmed cases were found to be isoniazid-monoresistant. In the 3RPT/INH treatment group, one of the seven cases was rifampin-resistant, isoniazid-susceptible M. bovis infection.

### Latent tuberculosis infection-associated immunodiagnostic test responses as biomarkers of incipient tuberculosis: fruitful or futile? [^111BEYz9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Another broader issue raised by this study is the ambiguous and confusing interpretation of IGRA readouts. On the one hand, positive IGRA responses are often interpreted as a marker of LTBI, and hence "protection", given that ∼95% never progress to active disease, and serial IGRA responses often decrease during the course of successful TB treatment. In contrast, the work of Gupta and others suggests that IGRAs are a biomarker of incipient TB, and hence TB risk. Which is it, protection or risk? The answer is both, depending on the clinical context. Thus, the conundrum can be resolved by recognizing that TB is a spectrum of infection, which is a dynamic interplay between host and pathogen at the level of the granuloma, and this may change over time, reflecting time point–specific host immunity and mycobacterial disease burden (and hence changing levels of TB-specific effector T cells in blood). A temporal compartment-specific effect may also influence interpretation as a result of translocation of antigen-specific T cells from the blood to the disease site (e.g. the lung). Thus, serial measurements may often be required to determine whether IGRA responses are stable, increase in magnitude over time (conversion), or reduce in magnitude over time (reversion), possibly suggesting clearance of infection. This concept has been well outlined in a recent review. Thus, IGRA readouts can be a marker of protection or susceptibility depending on the context. This will explain why patients with stable, persistently positive IGRA responses remain asymptomatic and do not progress to active TB over many years, whereas those with increasing IFNγ-specific spot-forming units and/or responses progress to active TB, and others may revert to presumably clear their infection. Thus, selecting vaccine candidates simply on their ability to induce or drive antigen-specific IFN-y responses is counterintuitive; rather, selection based on preventing sustained conversion seems more logical and is an approach that has recently been used.

For now, the findings of Gupta and colleagues are clinically useful and point us in the right direction. The bottom line is that better biomarkers of incipient TB are required, and nascent biomarker signatures require urgent prospective clinical validation. It is hoped that these resource-intensive and challenging prospective validation studies (e.g. the CORTIS [The Correlate of Risk Targeted Intervention Study] study) will be fruitful rather than futile, as TB remains the foremost infectious disease killer globally.

### Highly multiplexed proteomic analysis of quantiferon supernatants to identify biomarkers of latent tuberculosis infection [^112TfQYu]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2017). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health problem, with an estimated 2 billion people infected withworldwide. From this large reservoir, millions of people develop TB disease, and 10.4 million TB incident cases were reported in 2015. Proper and accurate identification and treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI) can reduce substantially the risk of developing TB and is a major focus of TB control in the United States and in TB programs around the world.

There is no gold standard available for diagnosing LTBI. Hence, there is no way to firmly determine the sensitivity and specificity of tests designed to detect TB infection. Three tests are currently commercially available to diagnose TB infection, including two interferon gamma (IFN-γ) release assays (IGRAs; T-SPOT and QFT-GIT) and the tuberculin skin test (TST). The TST measures cell-mediated immunity in the form of a delayed-type hypersensitivity response to the most commonly used purified protein derivative (PPD) of. Until the commercial IGRAs were available, the TST was the only test for diagnosing LTBI but with several well-described limitations, for example, the need for two visits, the subjective quality of the results, the low sensitivity for active TB, and the occurrence of false-positive results due to prior BCG vaccination or nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infection. The IGRAs were developed to overcome many of these limitations. They require a single blood draw and assess the cell-mediated immune response by measuring IFN-γ produced after an incubation with TB-specific antigens, but these tests also have their limitations, including a low predictive value for identifying patients with the greatest immediate risk for developing active TB. Furthermore, IGRAs have high rates of false-positive results in some lower-risk, non-BCG vaccinated populations, and various sources of variability can impact the reproducibility. The need for better TB diagnostic tests is recognized as an important component for improving global TB control and prevention.

### Reversion rates of quantiFERON-TB gold are related to pre-treatment IFN-gamma levels [^112vsHmg]. The Journal of Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The quantitative interferon (IFN)-gamma in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antigens declines in tuberculosis patients after starting treatment, however, in some cases remains high despite clinical improvements. Our aim was to evaluate clinical parameters associated with remaining QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT-G) positive after treatment.

Methods

A prospective cohort study of 101 culture-positive, positive QFT-G, HIV-uninfected patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. QFT-G was performed at diagnosis, at the end of intensive phase, at treatment completion, and 5–7 months post-treatment completion.

Results

There were 80 patients with complete results, 34 (43%) remaining QFT-G positive and 46 (58%) reverting to QFT-G negative at the 5–7 month post-treatment time point. There was a significant decline in IFN-gamma levels in response to both CFP-10 and ESAT-6 with tuberculosis treatment. Multivariate analysis revealed significant associations between IFN-gamma levels detected before treatment and remaining QFT-G positive post-treatment after adjustment for smear status, presence of cavitation, and positive sputum culture two months after starting treatment.

Conclusions

Quantitative QFT-G responses drop significantly in active tuberculosis patients undergoing treatment, with almost 60% becoming test negative. Reversion to a negative QFT-G result was closely associated with the magnitude of the IFN-gamma response prior to treatment and increasing age.

Alternative Regimens: Six or Nine Months of Daily Isoniazid

Regimens of 6 or 9 months of daily isoniazid are alternative recommended regimens; 6 months daily is strongly recommended for HIV-negative adults and children of all ages and conditionally for HIV-positive adults and children of all ages and 9 months daily is conditionally recommended for adults and children of all ages, both HIV-negative and HIV-positive. Isoniazid reduces the risk for developing TB disease in persons with a positive TST, including HIV-negative adults and children, HIV-positive adults, and presumably also HIV-positive children. The drug can cause hepatotoxicity and be associated with discontinuation because of adverse effects, although these effects are more common in adults than children.

In HIV-positive persons who have a negative TST, anergy, or an unknown TST, the benefit of isoniazid is uncertain in settings with low TB incidence. For these HIV-positive persons, the potential exists for a reduction in the incidence of TB disease and an increase in adverse effects with isoniazid therapy; however, the likelihood of these effects remains uncertain because of wide confidence intervals resulting from too few events.

The evidence synthesis included multiple durations of isoniazid therapy in persons with a positive TST (3, 6, and 12 months in HIV-negative persons and 6 months in HIV-positive persons). Among HIV-negative persons with inactive TB (defined as the presence of tuberculin positivity, stable fibrotic lung lesions, and negative sputum cultures in persons not previously treated), 6 and 12 months of therapy were more effective than 3 months of therapy, demonstrating the benefit of LTBI treatment with isoniazid in this high-risk subset of patients with LTBI. Studies of other regimens have persons with LTBI and fibrotic lesions but in much smaller numbers. According to the results of the systematic review process, among HIV-positive persons, 6 months of therapy was highly effective, and the effect of other durations was unknown. Also reviewed was an analysis that included different, fewer trials than included in this report and found that 9 months of daily isoniazid therapy was perhaps more effective than 6 months and similar to 12 months (,–). However, no clinical trial data were available directly comparing 9 months of isoniazid to placebo, 6 months of isoniazid, or 12 months of isoniazid.

### How should I interpret an interferon gamma release assay result for tuberculosis infection? [^114rYSDH]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) are the first new diagnostic tests for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI) since the century-old tuberculin skin test (TST). They are cell-mediated immune-based blood tests that have revolutionised LTBI diagnosis and are increasingly recommended by national guidelines.

Objectives

With the rapid expansion of the IGRA evidence-base in recent years, the limitations of IGRA and uncertainties in clinical interpretation of IGRA results have increasingly come into focus. In LTBI diagnosis these include: prognostic power of IGRAs relative to TST for quantifying risk of progression to active disease, false-negative rates in immunocompromised patients, the clinical meaning of IGRA reversion and the significance of the size of IGRA response. Furthermore, the role of IGRAs in the diagnostic work-up of active TB is unclear, and there is little evidence supporting use of the tests in anti-TB treatment monitoring.

Methodological Approach

On-going large prospective longitudinal clinical endpoint cohort studies of active and latent TB will tackle some of the uncertainties regarding IGRAs. Here we discuss clinical practice and guidance in light of the current uncertainties, based on existing evidence.

Conclusions and Impact

Current and planned clinical research will fill the gaps in the evidence-base, narrowing the areas of uncertainty and informing future policy. Translational research into next-generation IGRAs and new T cell-based diagnostic platforms will likely overcome the limitations of current IGRAs in the near future.

### Effect of isoniazid therapy for latent TB infection on quantiFERON-TB gold in-tube responses in adults with positive tuberculin skin test results in a high TB incidence area: a controlled study [^1161xUUX]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

Background

T-cell interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) are used in the diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and could be useful biomarkers of response to treatment of latent TB infection for clinical trials, infection control units, and TB programs.

Methods

This investigation was a prospective, controlled substudy of IGRA responses in 82 healthy South African adults with HIV seronegative and positive tuberculin skin test results randomly assigned to treatment with 6 months of daily isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) or observation before Bacillus Calmette-Guérin revaccination in a clinical trial. QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) assay was used to measure interferon-γ (IFN-γ) response to mycobacterial antigens at baseline and after IPT or observation.

Results

IFN-γ levels declined between baseline and the end of IPT (signed rank test P ≤ .0001) and between baseline and a similar period of observation without IPT (signed rank test P = 0.03). The rate of decrease in IFN-γ responses over time did not differ between the groups (Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test P = 0.31). QFT-GIT test results in two subjects (5%) in the IPT group and two subjects (5%) in the observation group reverted from positive to negative during follow-up. No significant difference was found between the groups with respect to baseline positivity or the proportion of patients whose tests reverted to negative.

Conclusions

IPT had no effect on changes in QFT-GIT readouts during short-term follow-up of adults with positive tuberculin skin tests in a high TB incidence setting. QFT-GIT is unlikely to be a useful biomarker of response to treatment of latent TB infection.

### Detection and management of latent tuberculosis in liver transplant patients [^115Xu7rA]. Liver Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

The optimal means for detecting and managing liver transplantation (LT) patients with latent tuberculosis (TB) are not well defined. Our study aims were to (1) determine the frequency and risk factors of latent TB in a large cohort of consecutive adult LT candidates and (2) determine the safety and efficacy of isoniazid treatment in LT recipients with latent TB. A review of patients assessed for latent TB by skin testing using purified protein derivative (PPD; January 2004 to September 2008) or with the interferon-γ release assay QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT; March 2008 to October 2009) was undertaken. The baseline clinical features and outcomes of subjects with latent TB and subjects without latent TB were compared. Twenty-five of 420 subjects (6.0%) were positive for PPD. In comparison, 11 of 119 subjects (9.2%) had a positive QFT assay, and 15 others (13%) had indeterminate results. Both PPD-positive and QFT-positive subjects were less likely to be Caucasian than subjects without latent TB (p < 0.001). The 3-year survival rate of the 25 LT recipients with latent TB was similar to that of the 296 LT recipients without latent TB (78.7% versus 74.6%, P = 0.58). Fifteen of the 25 latent TB patients received isoniazid at a mean of 0.67 months after LT. Although isoniazid was discontinued in 8 subjects because of possible side effects, none of the 25 latent TB patients developed TB reactivation after transplantation with a mean follow-up of 33 months. In conclusion, both QFT testing and PPD testing demonstrate similar rates of detecting latent TB infection in American LT candidates, but QFT testing also leads to a moderate rate of indeterminate test results. Early isoniazid chemoprophylaxis after LT is poorly tolerated and is frequently discontinued.

### Absolute risk of tuberculosis among untreated populations with a positive tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay result: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113rUEZa]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Methods

In this meta-analysis we followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) and meta-analyses of observational studies in epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines.

Search strategy and selection criteria

Because an earlier reviewincluding studies from 1949 to 2003 examining risk for progression to active tuberculosis disease indicated that older studies might be confounded by previously healed tuberculosisor by high levels of ongoing transmission, we limited our search to studies indexed from 1 January 1990 to 17 May 2019 in Medline, Embase, or the Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials. We restricted the search to studies conducted in humans and published in English or French (see supplementary tables S1 to S3 for search strategies). Two reviewers (JRC and NW) independently reviewed titles, abstracts, and full texts and resolved disagreements with a third reviewer (DM). The reference lists of selected full texts and identified systematic reviews were reviewed for additional studies.

We included clinical trials and retrospective or prospective cohort studies in which more than 50% of participants were recruited from 1990 onwards. Included studies reported TST results at internationally accepted cut points for indurations (≥ 5 mm, ≥ 10 mm, or ≥ 15 mm) or used commercially available assays (QFT-Gold, QFT-Gold-In-Tube (QIAGEN, Netherlands) or T-SPOT. TB (Oxford Immunotec, Oxford, UK) and reported positive results using the manufacturers' recommended cut points. Studies also had to have a mean or median follow-up of at least 12 months and include at least 10 untreated participants who tested positive for latent tuberculosis infection. We included studies of HIV uninfected general populations and populations at increased risk of tuberculosis, using a broad definition of increased risk (see supplementary S1 for populations selected a priori for inclusion, and methods for classification). We excluded studies that investigated only TST converters, TST boosters, Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) or other experimental vaccinated populations, or participants who previously tested positive. To avoid confounding the interpretation of risk estimates, we further excluded studies of people living with HIV in countries with a tuberculosis incidence of more than 100 cases per 100 000 people owing to the high likelihood of reinfection, as well as studies conducted in countries with a general population prevalence of HIV of more than 5% where authors did not explicitly exclude, or report separately, people living with HIV. In our primary analysis, to minimise selection and publication bias, we further limited included groups to those where at least 100 participants were tested and untreated.

### Guidelines for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020 [^114SZZ12]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Three Months of Daily Isoniazid Plus Rifampin

A regimen of 3 months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin is a preferred treatment that is conditionally recommended for adults and children of all ages and for HIV-positive persons as drug interactions allow. HIV-negative adults and children with a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) who received 3 months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin appeared to have a similar risk for TB disease, hepatotoxicity, and adverse effects requiring discontinuation of therapy as those who received ≥ 6 months of isoniazid. Among children aged < 15 years specifically, a 3-month course of daily isoniazid plus rifampin appeared as effective as a 6-month or longer course of isoniazid, because direct comparisons found no difference in TB disease and no differences in adverse effects requiring discontinuation of therapy or hepatotoxicity. In HIV-positive persons, no difference was found in the incidence of TB disease among those who received 3 months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin compared with those who received ≥ 6 months of isoniazid monotherapy, regardless of whether they were TST positive, TST negative, or anergic. Hepatotoxicity was less frequent among those receiving the shorter course of therapy, although discontinuation of therapy because of adverse effects was more frequent.

Potential drug interactions with rifampin and acquired drug resistance if TB disease is not adequately excluded also are important considerations (see previous section on 4 months of daily rifampin). In addition, hepatotoxicity risk might be greater with the two drugs given together than with either drug given alone.

### New approaches in the diagnosis and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection [^111UoYER]. Respiratory Research (2010). Low credibility.

A major problem associated with IGRAs is the occurrence of indeterminate results that seem to arise mostly due to cellular immune suppression and occur more frequently with the ELISA-based method than with ELISPOT test or discordant results if both, TST and a blood test are performed. This is further compounded by the differences that exist in the manner in which these tests are applied for the detection of latently infected individuals in different settings. In the United States and few other countries, national guidelines advocate up-front use of a blood test (IGRA) as a direct replacement for TST in all groups of subjects. Due to higher sensitivity of IGRAs, it is likely that some individuals who are positive for a blood test but who may have been TST negative (if the test was performed) are unnecessarily treated. On the contrary, in the United Kingdom and other European countries, initial screening is performed with TST except in individuals in whom TST is unreliable (young children, HIV-seropositive and other immunosuppressed individuals). For the latter grouping and for TST-positive individuals at higher risk of developing active disease, a blood test is recommended for confirmation of a presumed infection. Thus, it is also probable that a TST-negative subject who may have been IGRA positive will not be identified as having LTBI and will, therefore, not receive treatment. Consequently this apoproach, though supposedly more economical, may result in undertreatment of some individuals with LTBI. A discordant result (TST negative but IGRA positive) in an immunocompetent individual should be repeated after 3 months and should be treated for LTBI if IGRA still remains positive (a negative IGRA on repeat testing may signify a transient M. tuberculosis infection that was quickly cleared). However, a similar result in an immunocompromised individual should be carefully evaluated as in this setting, any positive result may be significant.

### Absolute risk of tuberculosis among untreated populations with a positive tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay result: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113cAjfU]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Testing people for latent tuberculosis infection and providing effective treatment is critical to elimination of the disease. Deciding to test for latent infection depends on both the probability of infection and the risk for progression to active disease. As part of the assessment for latent tuberculosis infection, the tuberculin skin test (TST) or commercially available interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA; T-SPOT. TB or QuantiFERON-TB (QFT)), or both, are commonly used. The TST and IGRA rely on an adaptive immune response to tuberculosis antigens. The TST involves an injection of non-specific tuberculosis antigens, which induces a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction that can be measured in infected individuals, whereas IGRAs are blood tests that measure interferon γ produced by lymphocytes in whole blood in the presence of tuberculosis specific antigens. In the presence of a positive test result for latent infection, treatment depends on a careful consideration of the benefits and risks. These primarily include the benefit of reducing an individual's probability of developing tuberculosis and the risk of treatment related side effects, which are substantial with current treatment regimens for latent tuberculosis infection.

Diagnostic approach for suspected LTBI — test sensitivity in low/intermediate-risk individuals 5 years or older — indicates that in persons likely infected with Mtb but at low or intermediate risk of disease progression, IGRA sensitivity has been consistently reported as either equal (QFT; 81%–86%) or superior (T-SPOT; 90%–95%) to the sensitivity of the tuberculin skin test (TST; 71%–82%).

Purpose Of Review

This review describes the major developments in the rationale for treating latent tuberculosis infection; new approaches to identifying persons with latent infection who are most likely to progress to active disease; and the development of novel short-course regimens for treatment of latent tuberculosis.

Recent Findings

As many as one-third of the world's population has latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Models demonstrate that tuberculosis will not be eliminated without large-scale treatment of persons with latent TB. Current tools for identifying persons at risk for active tuberculosis disease include TST and IGRA, which have poor positive predictive values. Newer approaches using gene expression profiling show promise and are being studied in the ongoing trials. Development of short-course regimens are a major advance in treatment of latent TB. Three months of rifapentine with isoniazid, 4 months of rifampin, and 1 month of rifapentine with isoniazid have been found to be noninferior to the standard 9 months of isoniazid.

Summary

Progress towards TB elimination can be accelerated by instituting public health measures that take into account new developments in identifying and treating persons with latent tuberculosis infection who are most likely to progress to active disease.

### Guidelines for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020 [^111xc8Hc]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary of Evidence and Recommendations

The recommended treatment regimens include three preferred and two alternative treatment regimens (Tables 3 and 4). Rifamycin-based regimens, including 3 months of once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine, 4 months of daily rifampin, and 3 months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin are the preferred recommended regimens because of their effectiveness, safety, and high treatment completion rates. Regimens of 6 or 9 months of daily isoniazid are alternative recommended regimens; although efficacious, they have higher toxicity risk and lower treatment completion rates, which decrease effectiveness. On the basis of the most recent comprehensive LTBI treatment guidelines in the United States, which were published in 2000, 9 months of daily isoniazid was considered the standard comparator regimen to evaluate shorter-course regimens. Data on the effectiveness and toxicity of 9 months of daily isoniazid are provided, as are data on the other recommended regimens. A rifamycin-based regimen refers to treatment that includes either rifampin or rifapentine.

### Official American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America / centers for disease control and prevention clinical practice guidelines: diagnosis of tuberculosis in adults and children [^115KazTd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Latent tuberculosis infection — risk stratification and prognostic test performance are described as follows: Individuals with immunological evidence of exposure to Mtb antigens but without clinical disease are termed latently infected, and those with recent infection (< 2 years) are at increased risk for progression to clinical disease. Those with negative TSTs or IGRAs are unlikely to progress to TB, yet the PPV of either test is relatively modest, with household-contact estimates that 20–200 people require treatment to prevent one case. Evidence for IGRAs in children < 5 years old is still limited, and studies to inform appropriate use for accurately diagnosing LTBI in this age group are needed.

### Absolute risk of tuberculosis among untreated populations with a positive tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay result: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114w5QGB]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the annual rate of tuberculosis development after a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay result (IGRA), or both, among untreated populations with characteristics believed to increase the risk of tuberculosis (at risk populations).

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Embase, Medline, and Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials from 1 January 1990 to 17 May 2019, for studies in humans published in English or French. Reference lists were reviewed.

Eligibility Criteria and Data Analysis

Retrospective or prospective cohorts and randomised trials that included at least 10 untreated participants who tested positive to tuberculosis antigens (contained in TST or IGRA, or both) followed for at least 12 months. Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) and meta-analyses of observational studies in epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines, two reviewers independently extracted study data and assessed quality using a modified quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS-2) tool. Data were pooled using random effects generalised linear mixed models.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was tuberculosis incidence per 1000 person years among untreated participants who tested positive (TST or IGRA, or both) in different at risk subgroups. Secondary outcomes were the cumulative incidence of tuberculosis and incidence rate ratios among participants with a positive test result for latent tuberculosis infection compared with those with a negative test result in at risk subgroups.

Results

122 of 5166 identified studies were included. In three general population studies, the incidence of tuberculosis among 33811 participants with a TST induration of ≥ 10 mm was 0.3 (95% confidence interval 0.1 to 1.1) per 1000 person years. Among 116197 positive test results for latent tuberculosis infection in 19 different at risk populations, incidence rates were consistently higher than those in the general population. Among all types of tuberculosis contacts, the incidence of tuberculosis was 17.0 (95% confidence interval 12.9 to 22.4) per 1000 person years for participants with a positive IGRA result and 8.4 (5.6 to 12.6) per 1000 person years for participants with a positive TST result of ≥ 5 mm. Among people living with HIV, the incidence of tuberculosis was 16.9 (10.5 to 27.3) for participants with a positive IGRA result and 27.1 (15.0 to 49.0) for participants with a positive TST result of ≥ 5 mm. Rates were also high for immigrants, people with silicosis or requiring dialysis, transplant recipients, and prisoners. Incidence rate ratios among test positive versus test negative participants were significantly greater than 1.0 in almost all risk groups, for all tests.

Conclusions

The incidence of tuberculosis is substantial in numerous at risk populations after a positive TST or IGRA result. The information from this review should help inform clinical decisions to test and treat for latent tuberculosis infection.

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114g7qRZ]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) screening test accuracy — tuberculin skin test (TST) thresholds and interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) — is summarized as follows: The sensitivity and specificity of TST depends on the threshold used to determine positivity, with 5-mm induration showing pooled sensitivity 80% (12 studies; n = 1323) and pooled specificity 95% (3 studies; n = 5149), 10-mm induration showing pooled sensitivity 81% (15 studies; n = 1427) and pooled specificity 98% (8 studies; n = 964), and 15-mm induration showing pooled sensitivity 60% (9 studies; n = 1004) and pooled specificity 99% (10 studies; n = 9653). For IGRAs, pooled sensitivity of T-SPOT.TB was 90% (37 studies; n = 5367) with pooled specificity 95% to 97% (2 studies; n = 1664); for QFT-GIT, pooled sensitivity was 81% (48 studies; n = 7055) and pooled specificity 99% (3 studies; n = 2809); for QFT-Plus, pooled sensitivity was 89% (11 studies; n = 939) and pooled specificity 98% based on a single study (n = 211). Reliability studies suggest moderate to substantial agreement between 2 observers, with interrater reliability higher for IGRA and varying by manual vs automated reading.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis — treatment for latent TB infection (LTBI) in HIV-infected children: HIV-infected children should receive preventive therapy after TB disease has been excluded if they have a positive TST or IGRA result or if they are exposed to an individual with infectious TB (AII). The preferred preventive therapy regimen is isoniazid daily for 9 months (AIII), and if adherence with daily isoniazid cannot be ensured, then consider twice-weekly isoniazid by directly observed therapy (DOT) by a trained worker, not a family member (BII). With exposure to an isoniazid mono-resistant source case, preventive therapy consisting of daily rifampin for 6 months is recommended, with adjustment of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) as required (BII). A 12-dose combination regimen of once-weekly isoniazid and rifapentine by DOT is noted as effective but this regimen is not recommended for children aged < 2 years, nor for HIV-infected adults or children who are receiving cART or individuals who have LTBI with presumed isoniazid or rifampin resistance; the preferred regimen for children aged 2 to 11 years remains daily isoniazid for 9 months.

### Revisiting annual screening for latent tuberculosis infection in healthcare workers: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^112f2DnQ]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Two screening tests were considered: the TST and the QuantiFERON®-TB-Gold (QFT). The cohort was assumed to have a mean age of 35 and to be 80% female, consistent with previous reports. All HCWs were assumed to have previously tested negative in a baseline screen performed at hiring. HCWs were subsequently retested either yearly or only after a recognised TB exposure (Figs. 1 and 2). We considered two scenarios for the risk of TB exposure. The primary (base case) scenario reflected more recent reports from the US, while the alternate scenario involved higher risk estimates reflecting observations in the US during the 1980s and 1990s.

Fig. 2
Decision tree model: simplified treatment subtrees. HCWs healthcare workers, TB tuberculosis, LTBI latent TB infection, INH isoniazid. Path D Simplified treatment subtree, for patients who are treated for LTBI after test conversion. For HCWs who are inappropriately treated for LTBI after false-positive test conversions, the subtree is identical to the one displayed in Path D, with the exception that there is no benefit from treatment since workers do not truly have LTBI. These HCWs are no longer eligible for subsequent screens, leading to missed opportunities for prevention if true infection occurs in the future. Path E Subtree for LTBI not successfully treated. This relates to workers who receive no treatment, incomplete treatment, or unsuccessful treatment for latent TB infection. It is assumed that all active TB cases are diagnosed and fully treated

Biologic therapy — tuberculosis (TB) monitoring for pediatric psoriasis includes baseline testing and risk-based ongoing screening. Pretreatment testing for latent TB with purified protein derivative (PPD), T-Spot, or QuantiFERON Gold is advised; yearly testing for latent TB "should be done in patients at high risk", while "for patients who are not at high risk, screening should be done at the discretion of the dermatologist", and "this screening is particularly important for patients who are taking TNF-α inhibitors". The result of the QuantiFERON Gold test "can remain positive after treatment of latent TB", and "an annual chest radiograph may be considered at the discretion of the treating dermatologist"; this table is "expert consensus and not part of evidence-based recommendations".

### Guidelines for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020 [^113X3BwC]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

For patients without drug intolerability or drug-drug interactions, short-course (3–4 months) rifamycin-based treatment regimens are preferred over the longer-course (6–9 months) isoniazid monotherapy for treatment of LTBI. These guidelines can be used by clinicians, public health officials, policymakers, health care organizations, and other state and local stakeholders who might need to adapt these guidelines for individual clinical circumstances. Local and state TB programs in the United States answer questions about diagnosing and treating persons with LTBI in their jurisdictions.

### Serial T-SPOT.TB and quantiFERON-TB-gold in-tube assays to monitor response to antitubercular treatment in Italian children with active or latent tuberculosis infection [^117TY1H5]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

We performed a prospective study to investigate T-SPOT.TB and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-G-IT) dynamics during antitubercular treatment in active tuberculosis (TB) or latent TB. Eighteen children with latent TB and 26 with TB were enrolled. At 6 months of follow-up reversion rate was 5.88% (95% CI:0–13.79) for QFT-G-IT; 9.09% (95% CI:0.59–17.58) for T-SPOT.TB (P = 0.921) in TB cases. Significant decline in quantitative response was observed exclusively in TB cases. Our results suggest that serial IGRA have limited use in children receiving antitubercular treatment.

### Recent advances in testing for latent TB [^114FyxKQ]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

After more than a century of relying on skin testing for the diagnosis of latent TB infection, clinicians now have access to blood-based diagnostics in the form of interferon γ release assays (IGRAs). These tests are generally associated with higher sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of latent TB infection. This article reviews the indications for testing and treatment of latent TB infection in the overall context of a TB control program and describes how IGRAs might be used in specific clinical settings and populations, including people having close contact with an active case of TB, the foreign born, and health-care workers.

### Poor predictability of quantiFERON-TB assay in recipients and donors for tuberculosis development after kidney transplantation in an intermediate-TB-burden country [^112NWJNb]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Interestingly, two cases of TB developed in recipients with negative QFT results. This suggested that the QFT, just like T-SPOT, is not adequately sensitive in immunosuppressed hosts. De novo post-KT TB infection can also occur in countries with a high-to-intermediate TB burden. Yet, latent TB in the donor may be transmitted to the recipient after KT. Actually, one case of TB in a patient with a negative QFT result received kidneys from a QFT-positive donor. Organ donation from donors with active TB is generally contraindicated; however, there is some controversy concerning isoniazid treatment for donors or recipients when the donor has positive IGRA results. Some guidelines recommend chemoprophylaxis for donors with a positive TST/IGRA before donation; however, it is challenging to treat all donors with positive IGRA results for the same reason as recipients. In our study, 31% of donors were QFT positive, and the QFT of the donor could not predict the development of TB. Although treatment of latent TB for KT recipients with QFT-positive donors is recommended in low TB-burden countries, routine treatment is still controversial in high-to-intermediate TB-burden countries, because drug toxicity and resistance may outweigh the benefits of treatment. Further large-scale, long-term follow-up studies are needed to confirm the necessity of treatment based on donor QFT. Before confirmative evidence is available, a careful approach is needed according to a center-specific policy, and we recommend close monitoring of KT patients with a positive donor IGRA result without routine treatment in our situation.

### New approaches in the diagnosis and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection [^113nwG8x]. Respiratory Research (2010). Low credibility.

Table 2
Currently available drug regimens for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection

INH, isoniazid; RMP, rifampicin; PZA, pyrazinamide; RPE, rifapentine; DOT, directly observed treatment; 2/Wk, twice weekly; 1/Wk, once weekly; CDC, Center for Disease Control and Prevention; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; IUAT, international Union Against Tuberculosis; LTBI, latent tuberculosis infection

The standard regimen for the treatment of LTBI in United States and Canada is daily self-administered therapy with isoniazid (INH) for nine months based on clinical trial data but the duration of treatment can be reduced to 6 months for adults seronegative for HIV-infection. The International Union Against Tuberculosis (IUAT) recommends daily therapy with INH for 12 months as it is more effective than the 6-month course (75% vs. 65%). The preferred duration of treatment for most patients with LTBI in the United States and European countries is 9 months since clinical trial data showed that the efficacy of 6-month regimen is reduced to 60% while 12-month regimen is advocated for individuals at higher risk of developing active disease. According to the CDC guidelines, the frequency can also be reduced from daily therapy to twice weekly therapy with increased dosage of INH, however, the twice weekly regimen must be given as directly observed treatment (DOT). Inclusion of DOT adds a substantial additional expense to the treatment strategies. The efficacy of INH treatment in preventing active TB exceeds 90% among persons who complete treatment. However, the overall effectiveness of these regimens is severely limited as the completion rates in clinical settings have been rather low, ranging from 30% to 64% only. Completion rates in other settings have been even lower. Although INH is tolerated fairly well by most of the individuals, there is a risk of hepatic toxicity in selected populations. Studies have shown that 10% to 22% of participants taking INH for LTBI have at least one episode of elevated serum transaminase levels. Although the rates of clinically significant hepatitis were much lower (< 2%), the risk and severity increased with age and concomitant alcohol consumption. INH can also cause peripheral neuropathy but the risk can be lowered by concomitant use of pyridoxine (vitamin B6). Poor adherence due to the long duration of treatment and concerns for hepatotoxicity in selected patient populations resulted in development of shorter and more effective treatment options for LTBI.

### Absolute risk of tuberculosis among untreated populations with a positive tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay result: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114ZMutR]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Data analysis

In the planned primary analysis, for each identified group and tuberculosis test we estimated the pooled primary and secondary outcomes using random effects meta-analysis. We pooled the results for QFT-Gold and QFT-Gold-In-Tube (referred to as QFT). We analysed outcomes separately for TST indurations at 5 mm, 10 mm, and 15 mm cut points, T-SPOT. TB, QFT, and both IGRAs pooled together.

In planned secondary analysis, for studies reporting results of TST and IGRA, we calculated the incidence rate ratio among people with concordant (same test results) and discordant (test results differ) results. In further planned secondary analyses, we included all studies, regardless of the number of participants tested, and conducted a priori defined stratified analysis based on method of follow-up (passive v active), median year of study start (≤ 2005 v ≥ 2006), study design (randomised controlled trial v retrospective cohort v prospective cohort), mean or median duration of follow-up (≤ 24 months v > 24 months), annual tuberculosis incidence in country of study (< 30 per 100 000 v ≥ 30 per 100 000), country level income (high v upper middle, lower middle, and low), method of tuberculosis diagnosis (microbiological v microbiological and clinical v not specified), and study quality (high v moderate v low). In post hoc analysis, we conducted stratified analysis based on proportion of patients excluded because of treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (< 20% v ≥ 20%) and stratified analysis based on country level policy of BCG vaccination (multiple or post-infancy v vaccination only at birth or none) according to the BCG World Atlas.

All analyses were performed with package meta (version 4.9–5) in R. Individual study outcome estimates were log or logit transformed and random effects meta-analysed using generalised linear mixed models with a Poisson distribution; pooled estimates were back transformed. This method has the advantage of avoiding zero cell corrections that could bias estimates when events are rare. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I² statistic. Publication bias was not assessed statistically, as factors other than results, such as investigator motivation and funding, might influence why a study is published, commonly used tests do not always agree, few population groups analysed met the minimum criteria for statistical assessment of publication bias, and lack of statistical significance or funnel plot asymmetry does not indicate lack of publication bias.

### Latent tuberculosis infection-associated immunodiagnostic test responses as biomarkers of incipient tuberculosis: fruitful or futile? [^117QaA2D]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Given these considerations, it has often been asked whether a higher magnitude of the IFN-y release assay (IGRA) response, or larger tuberculin skin test (TST) induration diameter, reflecting a higher burden of circulating effector T cells and inferring a higher burden of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, predicts a higher likelihood of incipient TB. Indeed, serial IGRA responses increasing in magnitude over time were associated with the development of active disease in several reports, suggesting that antigen-driven T-cell responses could be a marker of incipient TB. However, there are limited and conflicting data regarding this point. Zellweger and Haldar found no association between the magnitude of the IFN-γ response and progression to active TB. In contrast, Winje and colleagues interrogated a large population-based cohort using QuantiFERON Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) and found that a quantitative IGRA readout > 4.0 IU/L was highly associated (> 30-fold risk compared with QFT-GIT negativity) with the development of active TB. Using a different metric, Andrews and coworkers from South Africa found that QFT-GIT conversion at IFN-γ values higher than 4.00 IU/L (but not below this threshold) was associated with substantially increased risk (42-fold higher risk than nonconverters) of developing active TB over the course of a ∼2-year period. However, although these data collectively suggested that the magnitude of the T-cell response was associated with higher rates of downstream active TB, there remained several unanswered questions. Did this relationship hold true for other immunodiagnostic readouts (such as T-SPOT.TB and the TST), what are the implications for clinical practice, and is this relationship meaningful and clinically useful?

### Limited usefulness of quantiFERON-TB gold in-tube for monitoring anti-tuberculosis therapy [^1127QpZc]. Respiratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The usefulness of IFN-gamma release assays to monitor the efficacy of anti-tuberculosis (TB) treatment is controversial. Sixty patients affected by culture-confirmed pulmonary TB (M = 36; mean age: 39.2 yr; Italians = 28) were serially tested in a low prevalence setting by means of QuantiFERON-TB GOLD In-Tube (QFT-IT) at baseline and after a successful six-month therapy regimen (T6). A sub-group of 40 cases was also tested at 1 and 3 months. Overall, 88.3% of patients scored a QFT-IT positive result at baseline, with the higher proportion of TB-specific IFN-gamma responses in foreign-born patients (p = 0.04). TB-specific responses were highly variable over time, the within-person variability being correlated with baseline IFN-gamma levels (r = 0.731; p < 0.001). Overall, 61.6% of cases still tested QFT-IT positive at the completion of therapy. Average IFN-gamma levels increased over time, being persistently significantly higher in Italian patients than in foreign-born cases both at baseline (p = 0.03) and at T6 (p = 0.02). Reversion mainly occurred in patients (26.6%) with baseline IFN-gamma levels close to the conventional cut-off value. No indeterminate results were recorded at any study time point. In conclusion, QFT-IT adds no significant information to clinicians for treatment monitoring when applied in routine clinical practice in a low prevalence setting. Kinetics of T cell responses upon TB treatment and reversion (and conversion) thresholds need to be addressed. Diversity of IFN-gamma responses among patients of different geographic origin is an issue to be investigated further.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^111KhU4Q]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis — Treatment of LTBI (TB preventive therapy) for a source case drug susceptible exposure includes, for age 2 to < 12 years, 12 weekly doses of isoniazid (25 mg/kg for children aged 2–12 years) and rifapentine dosed by weight: 10–14.0 kg: 300 mg; 14.1–25.0 kg: 450 mg; 25.1–32.0 kg: 600 mg; 32.1–49.9 kg: 750 mg; ≥ 50.0 kg: 900 mg maximum. Alternative regimens include rifampin 15–20 mg/kg (max 600 mg) daily for 4 months duration or isoniazid 10–15 mg/kg (max 300 mg) daily and rifampin 15–20 mg/kg (maximum 600 mg/day) for 3 months duration. Indications include a positive TST (TST ≥ 5 mm in children with HIV) or IGRA without previous TB treatment and close contact with any infectious TB case (repeated exposures warrant repeated post-exposure prophylaxis). Considerations state that TB disease must be excluded before starting treatment for latent TB infection.

### Latent tuberculosis screening tests and active tuberculosis infection rates in Turkish inflammatory bowel disease patients under anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy [^116BpysN]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

Patient selection

This study included patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) who received anti-TNF (infliximab, adalimumab) therapy between January 2007 and January 2014. Disease duration, IBD location, CD behavior pattern, anti-TNF agent, treatment duration, concomitant immunosuppressive treatment, and prophylactic isoniazid (INH) treatment (if any) were recorded.

LTBI screening tests

Purified protein derivative TST, IGRA, chest radiography, and/or chest tomography were used as screening methods for LTBI. TST was performed on the volar surface of the forearm using the intradermal Mantoux method, and the result was recorded after 72 h. An induration transverse diameter of ≥ 5 mm was considered as positive. TST anergic patients had the test repeated a week later. IGRA was studied using the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube. The blood sample used for the IGRA was collected before performing the TST. Evidence of LTBI included fibrotic changes in chest radiography, calcification areas larger than 5 mm, pleural thickening, and linear opacities.

Study design

Patients were considered as having LTBI if TST was ≥ 5 mm, IGRA was positive, or fibrotic changes were found in chest radiography. These patients were given prophylactic INH 300 mg/day for 9 months, one month of which was prior to onset of anti-TNF therapy. Over the course of the anti-TNF therapy, the occurrence of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary active TB infection was monitored clinically, radiologically, and microbiologically at 2-month intervals.

Patients who received azathioprine (for at least 3 months) or systemic steroids (a daily dose equivalent to ≥ 20 mg of prednisolone for ≥ 2 weeks) during LTBI screening were considered to be within the group of patients who received immunosuppressive therapy.

Patients who received INH for less than 9 months or those who did not use it regularly were considered to be patients without previous prophylactic treatment. Patients with previous TB history and those who received anti-TB treatment at sufficient duration and doses were not given INH prophylaxis.

The Ethics Committee of the Katip Çelebi University Faculty of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey approved this study.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) testing — cautions and limitations: While both IGRA and TST provide evidence for infection with Mtb, they cannot distinguish active from latent tuberculosis and the diagnosis of active TB must be excluded prior to treatment for LTBI; a large (> 15 mm) TST reaction is more likely to reflect infection, measurement variability exists for IFN-γ tests (the FDA accepts a variance of 11%), there are insufficient data for quantitative interpretation of IGRAs beyond FDA cut-points, results near the cut-point are less reliable, and the results of IFN-γ testing should be reported quantitatively; discordance between TST and IGRA is common and in low-risk populations discordant tests are likely to be false positives.

### Primary care screening and treatment for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^11238S4H]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Five to ten percent of individuals with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) progress to active tuberculosis (TB) disease. Identifying and treating LTBI is a key component of the strategy for reducing the burden of TB disease.

Objective

To review the evidence about targeted screening and treatment for LTBI among adults in primary care settings to support the US Preventive Services Task Force in updating its 1996 recommendation.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and trial registries, searched through August 3, 2015; references from pertinent articles; and experts. Literature surveillance was conducted through May 31, 2016.

Study Selection

English-language studies of LTBI screening, LTBI treatment with recommended pharmacotherapy, or accuracy of the tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs). Studies of individuals for whom LTBI screening and treatment is part of public health surveillance or disease management were excluded.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts and full-text articles. When at least 3 similar studies were available, random-effects meta-analysis was used to generate pooled estimates of outcomes.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, reliability, active TB disease, mortality, hepatotoxicity, and other harms.

Results

The review included 72 studies (n = 51 711). No studies evaluated benefits and harms of screening compared with no screening. Pooled estimates for sensitivity of the TST at both 5-mm and 10-mm induration thresholds were 0.79 (5-mm: 95% CI, 0.69–0.89 [8 studies, n = 803]; 10 mm: 95% CI, 0.71–0.87 [11 studies; n = 988]), and those for IGRAs ranged from 0.77 to 0.90 (57 studies; n = 4378). Pooled estimates for specificity of the TST at the 10-mm and 15-mm thresholds and for IGRAs ranged from 0.95 to 0.99 (34 studies; n = 23 853). A randomized clinical trial (RCT) of 24 weeks of isoniazid in individuals with pulmonary fibrotic lesions and LTBI (n = 27 830) found a reduction in absolute risk of active TB at 5 years from 1.4% to 0.5% (relative risk [RR], 0.35 [95% CI, 0.24–0.52]) and an increase in absolute risk for hepatoxicity from 0.1% to 0.5% (RR, 4.59 [95% CI, 2.03–10.39]) for 24 weeks of daily isoniazid compared with placebo. An RCT (n = 6886) found that 3 months of once-weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid was noninferior to 9 months of isoniazid alone for preventing active TB. The risk difference for hepatoxicity comparing isoniazid with rifampin ranged from 3% to 7%, with a pooled RR of 3.29 (95% CI, 1.72–6.28 [3 RCTs; n = 1327]).

Conclusions and Relevance

No studies evaluated the benefits and harms of screening compared with no screening. Both the TST and IGRAs are moderately sensitive and highly specific within countries with low TB burden. Treatment reduced the risk of active TB among the populations included in this review. Isoniazid is associated with higher rates of hepatotoxicity than placebo or rifampin.

Infectious diseases — pretransplant screening and management for liver transplantation (LT) candidates include comprehensive infection evaluation and latent tuberculosis (TB) treatment. "Active infection needs to be adequately treated before LT can be attempted". Candidates should undergo combined viral serologic evaluation and immunity confirmation: "a candidate should be screened serologically for viral infections including HBV, HCV, and HIV… Hepatitis A and B immunity should be confirmed and vaccination performed if necessary. Serological testing for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) is also indicated". "Latent syphilis and tuberculosis (TB) infections should be tested for", and TB screening "can be done by tuberculin skin testing (TST) or interferon-γ release assays such as QuantiFERON… or T-SPOT.TB". If latent TB is detected, "antimicrobial therapy is indicated pre-LT, typically with isoniazid 300 mg daily plus pyridoxine 50 mg daily for 6–9 months, a 3-month regimen of weekly isoniazid and rifapentine, or rifampin 600 mg daily for 4 months", and "Syphilis, if detected, needs to be treated pre-LT". Endemic infection guidance includes that "in areas such as the American Southwest where Coccidioidomycosis is endemic, pretransplant screening is indicated; if seropositive… lifelong prophylaxis with fluconazole posttransplant considered", while "routine screening for histoplasmosis or blastomycosis is not recommended" and "Serological screening for Strongyloides is indicated…; patients who are seropositive should be treated with ivermectin prior to transplant". Recommendations include: "LT candidates should be screened for bacterial, viral, and fungal infections prior to LT (1-A)" and "Treatment for latent TB should be initiated pre-LT (1-B)".

### Different screening strategies (single or dual) for the diagnosis of suspected latent tuberculosis: a cost effectiveness analysis [^112Eso4J]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Previous health economic studies recommend either a dual screening strategy [tuberculin skin test (TST) followed by interferon-gamma-release assay (IGRA)] or a single one [IGRA only] for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), the former largely based on claims that it is more cost-effective. We sought to examine that conclusion through the use of a model that accounts for the additional costs of adverse drug reactions and directly compares two commercially available versions of the IGRA: the Quantiferon-TB-Gold-In-Tube (QFT-GIT) and T-SPOT.TB.

Methods

A LTBI screening model directed at screening contacts was used to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis, from a UK healthcare perspective, taking into account the risk of isoniazid-related hepatotoxicity and post-exposure TB (2 years post contact) using the TST, QFT-GIT and T-SPOT.TB IGRAs.

Results

Examining costs alone, the TST/IGRA dual screening strategies (TST/T-SPOT.TB and TST/QFT-GIT; 162,387 pounds and 157,048 pounds per 1000 contacts, respectively) cost less than their single strategy counterparts (T-SPOT.TB and QFT-GIT; 203,983 pounds and 202,921 pounds per 1000 contacts) which have higher IGRA test costs and greater numbers of persons undergoing LTBI treatment. However, IGRA alone strategies direct healthcare interventions and costs more accurately to those that are truly infected. Subsequently, less contacts need to be treated to prevent an active case of TB (T-SPOT.TB and QFT-GIT; 61.7 and 69.7 contacts) in IGRA alone strategies. IGRA single strategies also prevent more cases of post-exposure TB. However, this greater effectiveness does not outweigh the lower incremental costs associated with the dual strategies. Consequently, when these costs are combined with effectiveness, the IGRA dual strategies are more cost-effective than their single strategy counterparts. Comparing between the IGRAs, T-SPOT.TB-based strategies (single and dual; 39,712 pounds and 37,206 pounds per active TB case prevented, respectively) were more cost-effective than the QFT-GIT-based strategies (single and dual; 42,051 pounds and 37,699 pounds per active TB case prevented, respectively). Using the TST alone was the least cost-effective (47,840 pounds per active TB case prevented). Cost effectiveness values were sensitive to changes in LTBI prevalence, IGRA test sensitivities/specificities and IGRA test costs.

Conclusion

A dual strategy is more cost effective than a single strategy but this conclusion is sensitive to screening test assumptions and LTBI prevalence.

### Primary prophylaxis to prevent tuberculosis infection in prison inmates: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114B4t9W]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

In many low- and middle-income countries, tuberculosis (TB) incidence in prisons is high, exposing incarcerated populations to an elevated risk of TB infection. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial among HIV-negative male inmates of a high TB burden prison to determine whether isoniazid given twice weekly (900 mg) for 12 months prevents TB infection. The primary outcome was QuantiFERON-TB Gold in Plus (QFT) conversion to ≥ 0.35 international units per milliliter (IU/mL) at 6 months; secondary outcomes included alternative QFT thresholds (≥ 0.7, ≥ 2.0, and ≥ 4.0 IU/mL). In total, 467 participants were randomly assigned to intervention (N = 258) or control (N = 209). In an interim analysis of participants who had completed 6 months of follow-up (N = 170), QFT conversion occurred in 20.8% (19/91) and 21.5% (17/79) of participants in intervention and control arms (efficacy: 2.9%, P = 0.91), respectively. The trial was then stopped according to the trial protocol, and the remaining participants prematurely discontinued. In an analysis of secondary outcomes, the intervention arm had significantly lower rates of conversion at a cutoff of ≥ 2.0 IU/mL (efficacy: 82.6%, P < 0.01). In conclusion, 900 mg of isoniazid, administered twice a week, did not effectively prevent QFT conversion at a cutoff point ≥ 0.35 IU/mL in a trial of QFT-negative inmates. Higher QFT cutoffs are associated with sustained conversion and greater protection. Future clinical trials that evaluate protection for latent infection should use the highest cutoff than that recommended by the manufacturer.

Interferon gamma release assay-testing outcomes

IGRA results were available for all participants. Overall, 118 (11.2%) PWH had a positive IGRA result (Fig. 1 and Table 1), and two had indeterminate results (0.2%, further information in Table S1, Supplemental Digital Content).

All PWH with a positive IGRA test were diagnosed with LTBI apart from one individual who was found to have active TB disease during clinical/radiological assessment of a positive T-SPOT. TB test, performed at a CD4 + cell count of 340 cells/μl but with a detectable HIV viral load of 182 copies/ml.

Of the 117 PWH diagnosed with LTBI, 100 (85.5%) commenced LTBI chemoprophylaxis (Fig. 1). Nine of 117 (7.7%) declined; treatment was not advised by the treating physician in two of 117 (1.7%) cases; and four of 117 (3.4%) moved away before chemoprophylaxis could be given. Treatment is pending in two of 117 (1.7%) cases. Reasons behind declination were not well documented in patient notes. Ninety-eight of 100 (98%) of those initiating chemoprophylaxis had isoniazid monotherapy; the remaining two (2%) had combined rifampicin/isoniazid.

Of the 100 patients commencing chemoprophylaxis, 96 (96%) completed treatment to the satisfaction of the treating physician. One individual moved away and it was unclear whether chemoprophylaxis had been completed, and one defaulted from treatment. Only two of 100 (2%) had to stop treatment prematurely because of adverse drug effects.

### Clinical overview of latent tuberculosis infection… [^112MvpnN]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

People with latent TB infection:

- Have a small number of TB bacteria in their body that are alive but inactive Cannotspread TB bacteria to others
- Do notfeel sick, but may become sick if the bacteria in their bodies become active
- Usually have a positiveTB blood test or TB skin test results indicating TB infection
- Have typically normalchest radiographs
- Have negativesputum smears and cultures
- Should consider treatment for latent TB infection to prevent TB disease
- Do notrequire respiratory isolation. TB disease must be excluded before initiating treatment for latent TB infection. Failure to do so may result in treatment failure and development of drug resistance. Keep Reading: Diagnosing Tuberculosis. Treatment and recovery People with latent TB infection should be treated to prevent the development of TB disease. Progression from untreated latent TB infection to TB disease accounts for approximately 80% of U. S. TB disease cases.

Treating latent TB infection is 90% effective in preventing the development of TB disease. There are several standard treatment regimens for the treatment of latent TB infection. Regimens use the drugs isoniazid, rifapentine, and/or rifampin. CDC and the National Tuberculosis Coalition of America preferentially recommend short-course, rifamycin-based, 3- or 4-month latent TB infection treatment regimens over 6- or 9-month isoniazid monotherapy. Short-course latent TB infection treatments are effective, safe, and have higher completion rates than treatment regimens.
- Three months of once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine
- Four months of daily rifampin
- Three months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin
- 6 to 9 months of isoniazid monotherapy are alternative, effective latent TB infection treatment regimens if a short-course treatment regimen is not an option.
- Although effective, 6H and 9H have higher serious toxicity risk and lower treatment completion rates than rifamycin-based short-course treatment regimens. Treatment must be modified if the patient is a contact of an individual with drug-resistant TB disease. Consultation with a TB expert is advised if the likely source of TB infection has drug-resistant TB disease.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^11187UEa]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Treatment for latent TB infection — children < 15 years old with HIV: LTBI treatment is highly effective for preventing TB disease, and after TB disease has been excluded, children with HIV should receive treatment for LTBI as soon as possible after a positive TST or IGRA result or presumptive LTBI treatment after exposure to infectious TB (regardless of whether the child has a negative TST or IGRA result or was previously treated for TB) (strong, high). Although isoniazid has been shown to prevent TB disease among those with known TB exposure or TB infection, evidence does not support its use for primary prevention in infants with low risk of TB exposure, such as in low incidence settings like the United States. One randomized controlled trial in infants with and without HIV who had no known TB exposure showed no difference in TB incidence, infection, or death.

### Completion rate and safety of programmatic screening and treatment for latent tuberculosis infection in elderly patients with poorly controlled diabetic mellitus: a prospective multicenter study [^115etAqM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Poor control of diabetes mellitus (DM) increases active tuberculosis (TB) risk. Understanding risk factors for latent TB infection (LTBI) in this population and intervention completion rates is crucial for policy making.

Methods

Under a collaborative multidisciplinary team consisting of public health professionals, endocrinologists, and pulmonologists, patients aged > 45 years with poorly controlled DM (pDM), defined as having a glycated hemoglobin level of ≥ 9% within the preceding year, were enrolled by endocrinologists from 2 hospitals; these patients underwent LTBI screening by using QuantiFERON (QFT). Once-weekly isoniazid and rifapentine for 12 weeks (3HP) or daily isoniazid for 9 months (9H) was administered by pulmonologists. QFT-positivity predictors were evaluated using logistic regression. Completion rates and safety were also investigated.

Results

Among 980 patients with pDM (age: 64.2 ± 9.7 years), 261 (26.6%) were QFT-positive. Age, DM duration, chronic kidney disease stage ≥ 3, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor use, not using metformin, were associated with QFT-positivity. Preventive therapy (3HP: 138; 9H: 62) was administered in 200 (76.6%) QFT-positive patients. The completion rates of 3HP and 9H were 84.1% and 79.0%, respectively (P = 0.494). Nine (6.5%) and zero patients in the 3HP and 9H groups, respectively, developed systemic drug reactions (P = 0.059); 78.3% and 45.2% had ≥ 1 adverse drug reactions (P < .001); and post-treatment QFT conversion rates were 32% and 20%, respectively (P = 0.228).

Conclusions

LTBI prevalence exceeds 25% in elderly patients with pDM. Under care from a collaborative multidisciplinary team, the completion rate of preventive therapy, regardless of regimen could approach, or even exceed 80% in this population.

### Reversion of quantiFERON-TB gold in-tube test in individuals with and without prophylactic treatment for latent tuberculosis infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1131pgTf]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Reversion of tuberculosis (TB) infection testing has been suggested to be associated with prophylactic treatment efficacy. However, evidences based on randomized controlled study were sparse.

Methods

Studies on serial QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) test, among individuals with and without prophylactic treatment were identified in the databases of PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE up to 28 February 2018. The reversion rates were quantitatively summarized by means of meta-analysis using the random-effect model.

Results

A total of 52 eligible studies were included in the meta-analysis on QFT test reversion rate among participants with (20 studies) and without (32 studies) prophylactic treatment. Summarized reversion rate was found to be 24.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 18.4–32.9%) and 25.3% (95% CI: 19.6–32.0%) for those completed or without treatment, respectively. When the analysis was restricted to the participants completed treatment, higher summarized rate of QFT reversion was found among those with longer course therapy (9INH vs. the other regimens), studies from Asia (vs. Europe and America), and individuals with immunosuppression disorders (vs. general populations).

Conclusions

Our results suggested that QFT reversion was frequently observed regardless of with or without prophylactic treatment. Serial QFT testing might be inappropriate for evaluating preventive treatment efficacy.

### Metabolite changes in blood predict the onset of tuberculosis [^115zD1WQ]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2017, 10 million cases of tuberculosis (TB) disease and 1.6 million deaths due to TB were recorded globally, making it the deadliest infectious disease on Earth. A quarter of the world's population is estimated to be latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), and of these, less than 10% will develop active TB disease during their lifetime. Notably, the risk of TB incidence is 10-fold higher in individuals within the first year after infection.

Novel, cost-effective tools for control of TB must include not only new and improved drugs and vaccines, but also assays for rapid and sensitive diagnosis of TB. Defining biomarkers for risk of disease coupled with early and accurate TB diagnosis will enable strategies for prevention and early treatment to prevent progression to advanced disease pathology as well as transmission. Moreover, identifying infected people at high risk of developing TB will facilitate targeted enrollment into drug trials and post-exposure vaccine trials, thus profoundly reducing the number of study participants and trial costs and duration.

Until recently, the only measurable biomarkers associated with increased risk of developing TB were positive TST or IGRA test results. However, these tests have poor specificity for identifying incident TB as over 95% of HIV-negative and ~70% of HIV-positive individuals with TST/IGRA positivity never progress to active TB disease. Mass preventive therapy based on IGRA/TST screening in TB endemic countries would therefore require treatment of 50–80% of the population. This translates to treatment of an estimated 85 people with latent TB to prevent a single case of active TB according to currently available IGRA tests, thus putting many healthy individuals at unnecessary risk of adverse events. Such a strategy would neither be cost-effective nor feasible and would not prevent re-infection in high-incidence situations. This was demonstrated by the Thibela trial which enrolled South African mine workers in a setting with an 89% prevalence of latent MTB infectionbut mass isoniazid preventive therapy did not reduce TB incidence.

High-risk Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection — committee practice when initial testing is negative is described as follows: many committee members acknowledged that they perform a second test in clinical practice if patients at high risk for progression test negative, specifically performing a tuberculin skin test (TST) if an initial interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) is negative or an IGRA if an initial TST is negative, and if the second test is positive, they consider this evidence for infection with Mtb; this approach aims to increase sensitivity, is not based upon empirical evidence, and may be an acceptable trade off when the consequences of missing latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) are judged higher than those of a false-positive result.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for pulmonary tuberculosis, more specifically with respect to screening for latent tuberculosis, ATS/CDC/IDSA 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain an IGRA rather than a tuberculin skin test in ≥ 5 years old patients meeting the following criteria:

- likely to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis

- low or intermediate risk of disease progression

- it has been decided that testing for latent tuberculosis infection is warranted

- history of BCG vaccination or it is expected that the individual is unlikely to return to have the TST read.

### Guidelines for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020 [^113v2fGP]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Other Considerations

Following are several considerations for the use of these guidelines. First, the committee did not include cost-effectiveness in evaluating the evidence; recommendations were based on evaluating effectiveness and toxicity of the regimens. Second, the committee did not evaluate evidence regarding how to implement these regimens programmatically (e.g. who to test and treat and management of side effects). Third, these guidelines focus on treatment regimens for persons with LTBI living in countries with low TB disease incidence. These guidelines do not address other empiric TB prevention strategies (e.g. 1 month of isoniazid plus rifapentine among HIV-positive persons living in settings with a high TB incidence regardless of results from the TST or an interferon-gamma release assay). Finally, shorter regimens should not be used for patients in whom rifamycins are contraindicated, including those taking medications with significant drug-drug interactions with rifamycins.

### Screening of immigrants in the UK for imported latent tuberculosis: a multicentre cohort study and cost-effectiveness analysis [^112BZdY1]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2011). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and participants

We did this prospective multicentre study and cost-effectiveness analysis of immigrant screening in three centres in the UK: Westminster, London; Leeds, Yorkshire; and Blackburn, Lancashire. Together these centres serve 1·6 million peopleof whom 6·5% (IQR 4·3%–9·9%) are foreign born. Between 2007 and 2009, the average 3-year notifications in these centres ranged from 54 to 126, and incidence varied from 16 to 33 cases per 100 000 population per year.

Participants were foreign-born new entrants (arrival within the past 5 years) who were aged 35 years or younger and who were referred for and underwent tuberculosis screening between Jan 1, 2008, and July 31, 2010. Referrals to these centres were made either through port-of-entry screening systems, health-protection units, or after registration with primary-care services. Ethical approval was not needed because the study used fully anonymised observational data that were obtained as part of an assessment of routine clinical service.

Screening and management

We first screened immigrants who attended the centres with a symptom questionnaire followed by one-step IGRA (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube. Carnegie, Cellestis, Australia), a whole blood ELISA, containing ESAT-6 (early secretory antigenic target-6), CFP-10 (culture filtrate protein-10), and TB7.7 (Rv2654), which was done in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Results were positive, negative, or indeterminate, dependent on the manufacturer's criteria. A meta-analysisof the effectiveness of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube suggests that sensitivity is 84% and specificity is 99%. Immigrants who were symptomatic or who had a positive IGRA result were referred for chest radiography and further clinical assessment to discount active tuberculosis.

We defined latent tuberculosis infection as immigrants with a positive IGRA and normal chest radiography in the absence of any clinical features that would suggest active disease. Immigrants who were diagnosed with latent infection were offered chemoprophylaxis with either 3 months of rifampicin and isoniazid, or 6 months of isoniazid, in accordance with UK guidelines, dependent on clinician and patient preference.

Treatment for LTBI — several antibiotics are available; isoniazid was the first medication shown to prevent progression to active tuberculosis, but concerns about hepatotoxicity and drug resistance resulting from low adherence with long courses have prompted recommendations of shorter courses and use in combination with other medications such as rifampin and rifapentine. With the exception of twice-weekly isoniazid monotherapy, CDC-recommended regimens can be self-administered, including a once-weekly combination therapy with isoniazid and rifapentine taken for 3 months.

RESULTS

Study Population

Between April 2018 and June 2020, a total of 1057 patients with pDM (age [mean ± standard deviation]: 64.3 ± 9.6 years) were eligible for recruitment (Figure 1). Among them, 980 (92.7%) received QFT testing (age: 64.2 ± 9.7 years), 261 (26.7%) were QFT-positive, and 2 (0.2%) had an indeterminate QFT result. Among 261 QFT-positive patients, 2 (0.8%) were diagnosed as having active TB, and 59 (22.6%) refused undergoing TPT (75% of them due to concern of ADRs). Of the remaining 200 (76.6%) patients with pDM, 62 (31.0%) and 138 (69.0%) subsequently underwent the 9H and 3HP regimens, respectively.

Characteristics of Patients With QFT-Positivity or Negativity

Among 978 patients with pDM (age: 64.2 ± 9.6), 55.3% were men, and 10.5% had a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 27 kg/m², defined as indicating obesity by the Health Promotion Administration, Ministry of Health and Welfare of Taiwan (Table 1). Compared with QFT-negative patients, patients with a positive QFT result were more likely to have a BMI of ≥ 27 kg/m 2, systemic comorbidities, and a longer DM duration and less likely to receive metformin and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. No significant difference was observed in the income status and educational level between both groups. Baseline laboratory results were similar between both groups, except that the QFT-positive group had a higher average platelet count (227 ± 66 vs 208 ± 107 K/µL, P = 0.001) and a lower aspartate transaminase level (24.3 ± 9.8 vs 26.5 ± 12.9 U/L, P = 0.010) (Supplementary Table 1).

Latent TB Terminology: Origins, Evolution, and Pervasion/Pervasiveness

Since 1971, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) has regularly issued TB treatment guidelines. In 1994, these guidelines issued recommendations for the treatment of TB disease and TB infection with no mention of the word "latent". In 1999, the ATS issued for the first time a separate guideline that specifically addressed "latent tuberculosis infection" Not only did the terminology for TB infection change to LTBI, the terminology for its treatment also changed — from "preventive treatment" to "treatment of LTBI". The recommended treatment for LTBI (isoniazid monotherapy) remained unchanged from that for its namesake (TB infection) in 1994. The 1999 guidelines offered neither an explanation for the new name nor a definition. Rather, the definition was in a separate document published contemporaneously that contained guidelines for the diagnosis of TB. Here, LTBI was defined as "a positive reaction to the tuberculin skin test (TST), negative bacteriologic studies (if done), and no clinical, bacteriologic or radiologic evidence of active tuberculosis". In 2017, the updated guidelines modified the LTBI definition to "a state of persistent immune response to stimulation by Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens with no evidence of clinically manifest active TB".

The influential role of the ATS guidelines is reflected by endorsements from key organizations, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the American Academy of Pediatrics. It is not surprising then that their changed terminology for the exact same clinical condition — radiological evidence of inactive TB and/or TB immunoreactivity — had a profound influence on the field. Indeed, a PubMed search suggests this, showing a surge of papers using the term "latent tuberculosis" starting in 2000 (Figure 1). We did, however, find occasional indexed papers on latent TB as far back as 1894. Surely, the definition of latent TB in the 19th and early 20th century papers could not have been the same as the current one, given that the earliest articles predated tuberculin testing. What could latent TB have meant in the pretuberculin era? To understand this, we took our search back further, and identified the term "phthisie latent" (latent phthisis) in papers as early as 1819. Thus, the concept of latent TB predated not only tuberculin testing but also, by more than 60 years, the discovery of the tubercle bacillus.

QuantiFERON-TB Gold In Tube (QFT-GIT) — interpretation criteria state that the assay "is considered positive if the difference between the IFN-γ concentration in response to the Mtb antigens and the IFN-γ response to the nil control is ≥ 0.35 IU", and, "to control for high background in the nil control, the IFN-γ response to antigen must be 25% greater than the IFN-γ concentration in the nil control". An "indeterminate response" is "defined as either a lack of response in the PHA control well (IFN-γ concentration ≤ 0.5 IU) or a nil control that has a very high background (IFN-γ concentration ≥ 8 IU)".

### Management of long-term therapy with biological drugs in psoriatic patients with latent tuberculosis infection in real life setting [^113MqDFz]. Dermatologic Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Psoriatic patients with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) need a prophylaxis before starting a treatment with biological drugs. The aim of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of prophylaxis of LTBI in psoriatic patients receiving long-term biological drugs. The study included 56 patients (42 male and 14 female) affected by moderate-to-severe psoriasis (mean PASI: 12.8 ± 6.9 SD) treated with anti-TNF-α and/or anti IL 12, 23 and/or anti-CD11 drugs with a diagnosis of LTBI. LTBI diagnosis was based on tuberculin skin test and/or QuantiFERON TB Gold test positivity and chest X-ray suggestive, without clinical, or microbiological evidence of active disease. All patients received prophylactic therapy for 9 months with isoniazid (INH) 300 mg/day, starting 3 weeks before the beginning of biological treatment. Fifty-four patients completed prophylaxis with INH without any adverse events or intolerance; they continue the biological treatment without appearance of active tuberculosis. One patient developed tuberculosis pleurisy in course of treatment with etanercept. The infection has been treated and after a stable remission, treatment was restarted without tuberculosis reactivation. In this retrospective analysis, the prophylaxis of LTBI whit INH was effective and safe in longer follow-up period.

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115WVym7]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Screening tests for LTBI — two types are used in the US: the tuberculin skin test (TST) and the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). The TST requires intradermal purified protein derivative with interpretation 48 to 72 hours later, whereas the IGRA uses a single venous blood sample that measures the CD4 T-cell response with laboratory processing within 8 to 30 hours after collection. FDA-approved IGRAs include T-SPOT.TB, QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube, and QuantiFERON-Gold Plus; patients tested with an IGRA do not need to return for interpretation, and testing with IGRA may have advantages over TST for persons who have received a BCG vaccination because IGRA does not cross-react with the vaccine and for persons who may be unlikely to return. Diagnosis of LTBI is based on further clinical assessment and ruling out active tuberculosis by medical history, physical examination, chest radiograph, and other laboratory tests.

### Dynamic changes of interferon gamma release assay results with latent tuberculosis infection treatment [^113EsVFp]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Using QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) for monitoring tuberculosis (TB) and latent TB infection treatment effect is controversial. The present study aimed to evaluate the dynamic changes of interferon gamma (IFN-γ) levels along with latent TB infection treatment via a randomized controlled study.

Methods

A total of 910 participants treated with 8 weeks of once-weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid (group A), 890 treated with 6 weeks of twice-weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid (group B) and 818 untreated controls (group C) were followed for 2 years to track active TB development. QFT-GIT tests were repeated three times for all groups: before treatment (T0), at completion of treatment (T1) and 3 months after completion of treatment (T2).

Results

Similar rates of persistent QFT-GIT reversion were observed in groups A (19.0%, 173/910), B (18.5%, 165/890) and C (20.7%, 169/818) (p 0.512). The dynamic changes of IFN-γ levels were not statistically significant among the three groups. In treated participants, individuals with higher baseline IFN-γ levels showed increased TB occurrence (1.0%, 9/896) compared to those with lower baseline levels (0.2%, 2/904) (p 0.037). A similar but statistically insignificant trend was also observed in untreated controls (1.8% (7/400) vs. 0.5% (2/418), p 0.100). When TB cases were matched with non-TB cases on baseline IFN-γ levels, no significant differences were found with respect to the dynamic changes in IFN-γ levels with time, regardless of whether they received treatment.

Conclusions

QFT-GIT reversion or decreased IFN-γ levels should not be used for monitoring host response to latent TB infection treatment.

### Meta-analysis: new tests for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection: areas of uncertainty and recommendations for research [^116mwske]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Until recently, the tuberculin skin test was the only test for detecting latent tuberculosis (TB) infection, but 2 ex vivo interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) are now commercially licensed.

Purpose

To estimate sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of IGRAs (commercial or research versions of QuantiFERON [QFT] and Elispot) for diagnosing latent TB infection in healthy and immune-suppressed persons.

Data Sources

The authors searched MEDLINE and reviewed citations of all original articles and reviews for studies published in English.

Study Selection

Studies had evaluated IGRAs using Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antigens (RD1 antigens) and overnight (16- to 24-h) incubation times. Reference standards had to be clearly defined without knowledge of test results. DATA EXTRACTION AND QUALITY ASSESSMENT: Specific criteria for quality assessment were developed for sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility.

Data Synthesis

When newly diagnosed active TB was used as a surrogate for latent TB infection, sensitivity of all tests was suboptimal, although it was higher with Elispot. No test distinguishes active TB from latent TB. Sensitivity of the tuberculin skin test and IGRAs was similar in persons who were categorized into clinical gradients of exposure. Pooled specificity was 97.7% (95% CI, 96% to 99%) and 92.5% (CI, 86% to 99%) for QFT and for Elispot, respectively. Both assays were more specific than the tuberculin skin test in samples vaccinated with bacille Calmette-Guérin. Elispot was more sensitive than the tuberculin skin test in 3 studies of immune-compromised samples. Discordant tuberculin skin test and IGRA reactions were frequent and largely unexplained, although some may be related to varied definitions of positive test results. Reversion of IGRA results from positive to negative was common in 2 studies in which it was assessed.

Limitations

Most studies used cross-sectional designs with the inherent limitation of no gold standard for latent TB infection, and most involved small samples with a widely varying likelihood of true-positive and false-positive test results. There is insufficient evidence on IGRA performance in children, immune-compromised persons, and the elderly.

Conclusions

New IGRAs show considerable promise and have excellent specificity. Additional studies are needed to better define their performance in high-risk populations and in serial testing. Longitudinal studies are needed to define the predictive value of IGRAs.

Among HIV-positive persons living in areas with a high TB incidence, isoniazid is complementary to antiretroviral therapy in preventing TB disease. Two randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that isoniazid plus antiretroviral therapy decreased the incidence of TB disease to a greater extent than either isoniazid alone or antiretroviral therapy alone. Potential disadvantages of the regimen include its long duration, hepatoxicity, and low treatment completion rates (primarily due to the first two factors).

Screening and management

In our prospective screening study, we used QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFN-GIT), with gradual switching to QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) between May 2016 and January 2017. Results were positive, negative or indeterminate, dependent on manufacturers' criteria. Indeterminate results were included in the denominator.

The majority of PWH with CD4 + cell counts at least 200 cells/μl received a single IGRA test. Those with CD4 + cell counts less than 200 cells/μl generally received two tests (T-SPOT. TB plus a QuantiFERON-TB test), in most cases performed on the same day (where this was not possible, dual results were included if tests were taken within 14 days). PWH taking two tests were classed IGRA positive if either test was positive.

The most recent previous CD4 + cell count to an IGRA test was used as the CD4 + cell count classification at the time of the test. Individuals who had CD4 + cell counts performed more than a year prior to the planned time of IGRA testing had testing withheld until a more recent CD4 + cell count became available.

Individuals with positive IGRA tests were recalled for chest radiography and further clinical assessment to exclude active TB. We defined LTBI as PWH with a positive IGRA and normal chest radiography in the absence of any clinical features that would suggest active disease. PWH diagnosed with LTBI were offered chemoprophylaxis, in most cases, 6 months of isoniazid, in accordance with UK guidelines, although individual clinicians made the final decision dependent on clinician and patient preference. Where active TB was diagnosed, treatment again followed UK guidelines.

Data acquisition

Date of birth and sex at birth were recorded, together with NHS number wherever available, to verify records. Ethnicity and country-of-birth were ascertained from electronic hospital, HIV records or paper hospital records, and ethnicity was coded according to the national NHS data dictionary. Countries of birth were further classified into regions according to the World Bank Analytical Grouping. We took TB incidence in country-of-birth (< 50, 50–149, 150–249, 250–349 and ≥ 350 per 100 000 population) from WHO's Global Health Observatory and used figures available in March 2019.

### Optimization and interpretation of serial quantiFERON testing to measure acquisition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection [^117SPT35]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale

Conversion from a negative to positive QuantiFERON-TB test is indicative of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, which predisposes individuals to tuberculosis disease. Interpretation of serial tests is confounded by immunological and technical variability.

Objectives

To improve the consistency of serial QuantiFERON-TB testing algorithms and provide a data-driven definition of conversion.

Methods

Sources of QuantiFERON-TB variability were assessed, and optimal procedures were identified. Distributions of IFN-γ response levels were analyzed in healthy adolescents, Mtb-unexposed control subjects, and patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.

Measurements and Main Results

Individuals with no known Mtb exposure had IFN-γ values less than 0.2 IU/ml. Among individuals with IFN-γ values less than 0.2 IU/ml, 0.2–0.34 IU/ml, 0.35–0.7 IU/ml, and greater than 0.7 IU/ml, tuberculin skin test positivity results were 15%, 53%, 66%, and 91% (P < 0.005), respectively. Together, these findings suggest that values less than 0.2 IU/ml were true negatives. In short-term serial testing, "uncertain" conversions, with at least one value within the uncertainty zone (0.2–0.7 IU/ml), were partly explained by technical assay variability. Individuals who had a change in QuantiFERON-TB IFN-γ values from less than 0.2 to greater than 0.7 IU/ml had 10-fold higher tuberculosis incidence rates than those who maintained values less than 0.2 IU/ml over 2 years (P = 0.0003). By contrast, "uncertain" converters were not at higher risk than nonconverters (P = 0.229). Eighty-seven percent of patients with active tuberculosis had IFN-γ values greater than 0.7 IU/ml, suggesting that these values are consistent with established Mtb infection.

Conclusions

Implementation of optimized procedures and a more rigorous QuantiFERON-TB conversion definition (an increase from IFN-γ < 0.2 to > 0.7 IU/ml) would allow more definitive detection of recent Mtb infection and potentially improve identification of those more likely to develop disease.

### Serial interferon-gamma release assays after rifampicin prophylaxis in a tuberculosis outbreak [^1178GEw9]. Respiratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Even though some studies have reported the results of serial interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) during isoniazid prophylactic treatment, serial results have not been reported after rifampicin prophylaxis. A contact investigation was conducted after a tuberculosis (TB) outbreak in an accommodation facility. The tuberculin skin test (TST) and the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) test were performed in 214 contacts with normal chest radiographs. Rifampicin prophylaxis was initiated in TST+/QFT-GIT+ subjects, and the QFT-GIT test was repeated upon completion of 4 months of rifampicin treatment. Among the 214 contacts, the TST and QFT-GIT test results were positive in 67.7% and 56.7%, respectively, and the agreement between the two tests was fair-to-good (78.3%, kappa = 0.55, p < 0.001). The QFT-GIT test was positive in 77% (97/126) of contacts with positive TST results. Rifampicin prophylaxis was completed in 81 subjects with good compliance. Among 74 subjects with valid serial QFT-GIT test results, IFN-gamma levels decreased in 97.3% (72/74) of the subjects and QFT-GIT test reversion (positive to negative) was achieved in 31 subjects (41.9%). Subjects without QFT-GIT test reversion had a significantly higher baseline TST induration sizes (18.3 ± 4.8 vs. 14.9 ± 3.4mm, p < 0.01) and IFN-gamma levels (18.6 ± 17.9 vs. 3.2 ± 7.5IU/mL, p < 0.01) than the subjects with QFT-GIT test reversion. Thus, IGRAs may be useful in evaluating the therapeutic response to rifampicin prophylaxis in TB contacts. However, considering that this was not a controlled study, a prospective controlled study is needed to determine whether rifampicin prophylaxis truly affects QFT-GIT reversion.

### Recent developments in the diagnosis and management of tuberculosis [^1146GSZA]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

According to current recommendations, tuberculin skin test and interferon-gamma release assays can be considered interchangeable, and tuberculin skin test should not replace interferon-gamma release assays for LTBI diagnosis in low- and middle-income settings. Both tests are limited by the inability to predict the risk of reactivation and cannot distinguish between latent infection and active disease. In case of a positive result to any of them, active TB must be reasonably ruled out before starting LTBI treatment, which is essential to avoid the selection of drug resistances. A 6-month course of daily isoniazid is the only currently recommended option for treatment in resource-limited settings, with life-long administration encouraged among people living with HIV in high TB transmission areas. Alternative therapeutic regimens can be considered in high-income countries for patients other than children and HIV-positive individuals (Tables 3 and 4).

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Latent tuberculosis infection — 1 month of daily rifapentine plus isoniazid (1HP) versus 9 months of daily isoniazid (9H) in people living with HIV (PLWH) — was evaluated in high-burden settings with "TB incidence > 60 per 100,000 population". Participants had "The median CD4 count of study participants was 470 cells/mm³, 50% of the study population was on ART (efavirenz or nevirapine-based regimens) at study entry, and 21% of the study population was TST-positive". Outcomes showed "The event rate was 0.65 per 100 person-years in the 1HP arm and 0.67 per 100 person-years in the 9H arm; non-inferiority of the 1HP arm was established", and completion "were 97% in the 1HP arm and 90% in the 9H arm". Generalizability is limited: "only 10% of the study population was from the United States", with baseline characteristics including "only 23% of the participants had a positive test for LTBI; 1% of the participants at international sites did not have a TST due to manufacturer shortages, and IGRAs were only performed for U.S. participants", and "13% had baseline CD4 counts < 250 cells/mm3, and 50% were not on ART at entry". The authors note "these results suggest that 1HP might be an alternative regimen for treatment of LTBI in certain situations".

### Guidelines on interferon-γ release assays for tuberculosis infection: concordance, discordance or confusion? [^112hKrFk]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Identification of latent tuberculosis (TB) infection and preventive therapy is important for TB control, especially in high-risk populations. Since the advent of interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs), many studies have evaluated their role in the diagnosis of active and latent TB. With the growing evidence base, many guidelines now include IGRAs. We surveyed the literature and contacted experts to identify 33 guidelines and position papers from 25 countries and two supranational organizations. The results show considerable diversity in the recommendations on IGRAs, with four approaches commonly proposed: (i) two-step approach of tuberculin skin test (TST) first, followed by IGRA either when the TST is negative (to increase sensitivity, mainly in immunocompromised individuals), or when the TST is positive (to increase specificity, mainly in bacillus Calmette-Guérin-vaccinated individuals); (ii) Either TST or IGRA, but not both; (iii) IGRA and TST together (to increase sensitivity); and (iv) IGRA only, replacing the TST. Overall, the use of IGRAs is increasingly recommended, but most of the current guidelines do not use objective, transparent methods to grade evidence and recommendations, and do not disclose conflicts of interests. Future IGRA guidelines must aim to be transparent, evidence-based, periodically updated, and free of financial conflicts and industry involvement.

### Inflammatory bowel disease and mycobacteria: how much can we trust isoniazid prophylaxis during antitumor necrosis factor therapy? [^112jgEt9]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Isoniazid (INH) prophylaxis is recommended for the prevention of tuberculosis (TB) reactivation before or/and during initiation of treatment with tumour necrosis factor antagonists (anti-TNF agents). Nonetheless, the long-term effectiveness of chemoprophylaxis is not clear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the characteristics of patients who developed TB reactivation in spite of INH prophylaxis associated with anti-TNF treatment.

Patients and Methods

In this retrospective study, medical records of 1263 patients with inflammatory bowel disease were reviewed. Baseline TB screening tests (purified protein derivative test and/or QuantiFERON-TB Gold test) were performed on all patients before initiation of anti-TNF therapy. Patients with purified protein derivative of more than 5mm and/or a positive result of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test received INH prophylaxis for 9 months. We analysed the data of patients diagnosed with TB reactivation during the anti-TNF treatment despite INH chemoprophylaxis.

Results

Overall, 175 patients underwent anti-TNF treatment. Sixty of these 175 patients had pretreatment testing showing latent TB infection and therefore were treated concomitantly with INH for 9 months in addition to their anti-TNF treatment. TB reactivation occurred in four of these 60 co-INH/anti-TNF treated patients. Active TB was diagnosed after 37.5 ± 27 (range: 18–84) months of anti-TNF treatment. In two of the four patients that active TB was diagnosed, was also detected other Mycobacterium spp.: M. bovis in one patient and M. genavense in the other one.

Conclusion

INH chemoprophylaxis may not prevent the reactivation of TB during anti-TNF therapy in the long-term. Patients should be carefully and periodically screened for TB reactivation during anti-TNF therapy.

### Time for a change? Updated guidelines using interferon gamma release assays for detection of latent tuberculosis infection in the office setting [^112SqSxk]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alfa inhibitors and other systemic medications increases the risk of reactivating a latent tuberculosis (TB) infection. Therefore, screening for latent TB infection is important in dermatology patients eligible for treatment with these medications. Although the tuberculin skin test (TST) has its limitations, it has been the standard choice for diagnosis of latent TB infection. Since the development of interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs), the role of the TST has been re-evaluated and IGRAs have increasingly been incorporated into national guidelines. Although there are situations when either test may be performed, in individuals who have received a BCG vaccination and in those who are unlikely to return for a TST reading, IGRAs may be particularly helpful in distinguishing patients at risk for TB. This article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of both the TST and the IGRA and presents a summary of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2010 guidelines for using IGRAs.

### Completion rate and safety of programmatic screening and treatment for latent tuberculosis infection in elderly patients with poorly controlled diabetic mellitus: a prospective multicenter study [^112DbRSi]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Poor control of diabetes mellitus (DM) increases active tuberculosis (TB) risk. Understanding risk factors for latent TB infection (LTBI) in this population and intervention completion rates is crucial for policy making.

Methods

Under a collaborative multidisciplinary team consisting of public health professionals, endocrinologists, and pulmonologists, patients aged > 45 years with poorly controlled DM (pDM), defined as having a glycated hemoglobin level of ≥ 9% within the preceding year, were enrolled by endocrinologists from 2 hospitals; these patients underwent LTBI screening by using QuantiFERON (QFT). Once-weekly isoniazid and rifapentine for 12 weeks (3HP) or daily isoniazid for 9 months (9H) was administered by pulmonologists. QFT-positivity predictors were evaluated using logistic regression. Completion rates and safety were also investigated.

Results

Among 980 patients with pDM (age: 64.2 ± 9.7 years), 261 (26.6%) were QFT-positive. Age, DM duration, chronic kidney disease stage ≥ 3, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor use, not using metformin, were associated with QFT-positivity. Preventive therapy (3HP: 138; 9H: 62) was administered in 200 (76.6%) QFT-positive patients. The completion rates of 3HP and 9H were 84.1% and 79.0%, respectively (P = 0.494). Nine (6.5%) and zero patients in the 3HP and 9H groups, respectively, developed systemic drug reactions (P = 0.059); 78.3% and 45.2% had ≥ 1 adverse drug reactions (P < .001); and post-treatment QFT conversion rates were 32% and 20%, respectively (P = 0.228).

Conclusions

LTBI prevalence exceeds 25% in elderly patients with pDM. Under care from a collaborative multidisciplinary team, the completion rate of preventive therapy, regardless of regimen could approach, or even exceed 80% in this population.

### Immunologic-based diagnosis of latent tuberculosis among children younger than 5 years of age exposed and unexposed to tuberculosis in tanzania [^116M5opn]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Childhood tuberculosis (TB) is acquired after exposure to an infectious TB case, often within the household. We prospectively screened children 6–59 months of age, exposed and unexposed to an infectious TB case within the same household, for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

Methods

We collected medical data and clinical specimens (to evaluate for helminths, TB and HIV coinfections) and performed physical examinations at enrollment and at 3-month and 6-month follow-up surveys. LTBI was assessed using QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT) at enrollment and at 3 months.

Results

In total, 301 children had complete data records (186 with TB exposure and 115 without known TB exposure). The median age of children was 26 months (range: 6–58); 52% were females, and 4 were HIV positive. Eight children (3%) developed TB during the 6-month follow-up. We found equal proportions of children with LTBI among those with and without exposure: 20% (38/186) versus 20% (23/115) QFT-positive, and 2% (4/186) versus 4% (5/115) indeterminate QFT. QFT conversion rate was 7% (22 children) and reversion 8% (25 children). Of the TB-exposed children, 72% initiated isoniazid preventive therapy, but 61% of parents/caregivers of children with unknown TB exposure and positive QFT refused isoniazid preventive therapy.

Conclusions

In this high burden TB setting, TB exposure from sources other than the household was equally important as household exposure. Nearly one third of eligible children did not receive isoniazid preventive therapy. Evaluation for LTBI in children remains an important strategy for controlling TB but should not be limited to children with documented TB exposure.

### Tuberculosis: common questions and answers [^11592vQU]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Approximately 10 million people worldwide were infected with tuberculosis (TB) in 2019, resulting in 1.4 million deaths. In the United States that same year, there were nearly 9,000 reported cases of TB disease and up to 13 million people were living with latent TB infection (LTBI), which is an asymptomatic, noncommunicable infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Without treatment, LTBI will progress to active TB disease in approximately 5% to 10% of affected people. Individuals with symptoms of TB disease warrant testing. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends testing individuals at increased risk of LTBI with an interferon-gamma release assay or tuberculin skin testing. Because the incidence of LTBI in health care professionals is similar to that of the general population, periodic retesting is not recommended. After a positive test result, chest radiography should be performed and, in patients with suspected pulmonary TB disease, sputum collected for diagnosis. Both suspected and confirmed cases of LTBI and TB disease must be reported to local or state health departments. Preferred treatment regimens for LTBI include isoniazid in combination with rifapentine or rifampin, or rifampin alone for a duration of three and four months, respectively. Treatment of drug-susceptible TB disease includes an eight-week intensive phase with four drugs (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol), followed by a continuation phase lasting 18 weeks or more, with two drugs based on susceptibility testing results. Consultation with a TB expert is necessary if there is suspicion or confirmation of drug-resistant TB.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) testing in low-risk individuals — Recommendation 3a and contextual guidance: guidelines recommend that persons at low risk for Mtb infection and disease progression NOT be tested for Mtb infection, and the committee concurs, though such testing may be obliged by law or credentialing bodies; when testing is performed in individuals 5 years or older who are unlikely to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the panel notes that IGRA testing is more specific than TST testing and equally or more sensitive than TST testing, and that false-positive results are frequent among such individuals; accordingly, Recommendation 3a states, We suggest performing an IGRA instead of a TST in individuals 5 years or older who are unlikely to be infected with Mtb but who undergo testing for LTBI (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence), with the text noting there is an acceptable alternative in settings where an IGRA is unavailable, too costly, or too burdensome.

### Evaluation of the effect of treatment of latent tuberculosis infection on quantiFERON-TB gold assay results [^111fCgy9]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2009). Low credibility.

To evaluate the utility of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay for monitoring latent tuberculosis treatment efficacy, the assay was performed serially for healthcare workers receiving isoniazid therapy. After 9 months of isoniazid therapy, all of these healthcare workers remained QuantiFERON-TB Gold positive, and cellular proliferation assays revealed persistently strong purified protein derivative responses. These results do not support the use of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay to monitor therapy.

Box 1
Description of the cascade of tuberculosis care and associated actions in Brazil, based on national guidelines

How are household contacts identified?

Guidelines are to examine and test contacts of all ages. Individuals should be identified by nurses or doctors when the index patient is diagnosed, by asking the index patient who lives in the same house.

How are contacts screened?

All contacts should undergo symptom screening and a tuberculin skin test (TST).*

Any individual with symptoms of tuberculosis (TB) undergoes a chest X-ray and microbiological testing.
Asymptomatic individuals < 10 years receive a chest X-ray regardless of TST results.
Asymptomatic individuals ≥ 10 years receive a chest X-ray only when TST is positive.

How is TB infection diagnosed and treated?

Contacts with a positive TST (or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA)) and a normal chest X-ray are directly prescribed one of the following TB preventive treatment regimens:

3 months of once-weekly isoniazid and rifapentine (treatment of choice for adults ≤ 50 years).
4 months of daily rifampin (treatment of choice for children, adults > 50 years and those with liver disease).

Alternative options include:

6 months of daily isoniazid.
9 months of daily isoniazid.
3 months of daily isoniazid and rifampin.

Except for 3 months of once-weekly isoniazid and rifapentine (which has weekly follow-ups), all treatments require monthly follow-ups for pill refill, adherence check and evaluation of side effects. Although not nationally required, some cities implement a regimen under direct observed treatment (DOT) 2–3×/week.

How is TB disease diagnosed?

To diagnose TB, most small cities use two sputum samples for acid-fast bacilli smear microscopy, whereas large cities (notifying over 70% of TB episodes) collect one sputum sample for Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra testing. Sputum culture is prioritised for retreatment, contacts of drug-resistant TB, those with rifampin-resistance detected on Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (and subsequently confirmed with phenotypic drug-sensitivity tests), in prisons, Indigenous populations and for people who do not convert smear after 2 months of treatment. When an index patient is identified, a household contact investigation is initiated.
