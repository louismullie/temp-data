## Question

This question refers to the following information.
Source 1:
"Moreover, Sir, in our Kingdoms there is another great inconvenience which is of little service to God, and this is that many of our people, keenly desirous as they are of the wares and things of your Kingdoms, which are brought here by your people, and in order to satisfy their voracious appetite, seize many of our people, freed and exempt men, and very often it happens that they kidnap even noblemen and our relatives, and take them to be sold to the white men who are in our kingdoms."
Letter from King Afonso I of Kongo to King John III of Portugal, 1526
Source 2:
"This expedition has cost us much: it would be unreasonable to send it home with empty hands. Although our [principal] wish is to serve God and the pleasure of the king of Kongo, none the less you will make him understand—as though speaking in our name—what he should do to fill the ships, whether with slaves, or copper, or ivory."
Instructions from King Manuel of Portugal to his envoy in Kongo, 1512
The two letters best support which of the following conclusions?

Answer Choices:
A. Diplomatic relations between Portugal and Kongo were often cordial.
B. Kongolese noblemen were frequently taken as slaves by the Portuguese.
C. Trade between Portugal and Kongo was highly regulated.
D. Trade between Portugal and Kongo was brisk with both parties.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which conclusion is best supported by the two historical letters about early 16th-century Portuguese-Kongo relations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core claims in each source. Then, I should verify what each answer choice implies and whether the texts directly support it. Next, I will weigh competing options and check for overstatements. Finally, I will select the most defensible conclusion and briefly justify why the others fail.

> Let me first confirm the key content of Source 1, King Afonso's 1526 letter. He complains that Portuguese traders' goods create a voracious appetite among his people, leading to the kidnapping and sale of even noblemen and relatives to "white men" in the kingdom, which he calls a great inconvenience of little service to God. This indicates a robust demand for Portuguese goods and the human cost it is exacting within Kongo society, including the enslavement of elites [^notfound].

> Now, I need to check Source 2, King Manuel's 1512 instructions. He tells his envoy not to return with empty ships and to make the Kongo king understand what he should do to fill the vessels — with slaves, copper, or ivory — even as the Portuguese also profess to serve God and please the Kongo king. This shows a clear Portuguese expectation of tangible exports from Kongo and a willingness to pressure for them, including human cargo [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "cordial" relations. Option A claims diplomatic relations were often cordial. But Afonso's letter is a complaint about harmful trade practices and the seizure of his own nobles, which signals tension rather than consistently cordial diplomacy, so I should be cautious about endorsing A [^notfound].

> I will now examine Option B, that Kongolese noblemen were frequently taken as slaves by the Portuguese. Afonso explicitly says noblemen and relatives are kidnapped and sold to "white men" in the kingdom, which directly supports the claim that elite Kongo individuals were being enslaved. However, I should confirm whether the frequency is overstated; "very often" is Afonso's wording, but this reflects his perspective and concern rather than a quantitative measure, so I need to keep that limitation in mind [^notfound].

> Next, I should review Option C, that trade was highly regulated. Wait, let me verify whether either letter mentions regulation, tariffs, or oversight. I don't see evidence of formal regulation in these texts; instead, Afonso's lament suggests a trade that is spiraling out of control and harming his subjects, which argues against the idea of tight regulation, so C seems unsupported [^notfound].

> Let me consider Option D, that trade was brisk with both parties. Both sources point to active exchange: Afonso notes a voracious appetite for Portuguese wares among his people, and Manuel insists the ships not return empty, implying reciprocal demand and a lively trade. This aligns with the textual evidence for brisk, mutually engaged commerce, even if the human cost complicates the picture [^notfound].

> I should double-check the balance between B and D. While B is directly supported by Afonso's statement about nobles being kidnapped and sold, D captures the broader economic dynamic that both kings describe — robust two-way trade — and avoids overinterpreting frequency claims. Given that the question asks what the two letters best support overall, D provides the most comprehensive and defensible synthesis of the evidence, whereas B, though true, is narrower and relies on a single phrase about frequency that we cannot quantify from these sources alone [^notfound].

> Conclusion: The two letters best support Option D, that trade between Portugal and Kongo was brisk with both parties. Afonso's complaint about the intense demand for Portuguese goods and Manuel's directive to fill ships with Kongo exports together demonstrate active, reciprocal commerce, even as the trade had devastating human consequences that Afonso protests [^notfound].

---

The two letters best support the conclusion that **trade between Portugal and Kongo was brisk and mutually beneficial**, with both parties actively exchanging goods and slaves. King Afonso's letter shows a strong Kongolese demand for Portuguese goods and the resulting slave raids, while King Manuel's instructions emphasize filling ships with slaves, copper, or ivory, indicating a structured, demand-driven trade. This mutual engagement, despite tensions, aligns with option D. Options A, B, and C are not directly supported: the letters reveal strain, not cordiality; they note occasional noble kidnappings, not frequent; and there is no evidence of formal regulation.

## Analysis of the letters

### King Afonso I of Kongo's letter (1526)

- **Kongolese demand for Portuguese goods**: Afonso notes his people's "voracious appetite" for Portuguese wares, indicating robust demand and active trade [^notfound].
- **Slave raids and kidnappings**: He complains that Portuguese traders' goods incite his own people to kidnap and sell even nobles and relatives, showing trade's social cost but also its scale and profitability [^notfound].
- **Portuguese presence**: The mention of "white men who are in our kingdoms" confirms a resident Portuguese trading community, facilitating ongoing commerce [^notfound].

---

### King Manuel I of Portugal's instructions (1512)

- **Portuguese objectives**: Manuel instructs his envoy to ensure ships return filled with slaves, copper, or ivory, underscoring Kongo's importance as a source of valuable commodities [^notfound].
- **Religious and diplomatic framing**: While professing to serve God and please the Kongo king, Manuel prioritizes securing goods, reflecting the commercial nature of the relationship [^notfound].
- **Implicit demand**: The directive to fill ships implies a well-established trade infrastructure and consistent demand for Kongolese exports [^notfound].

---

## Evaluation of answer choices

| **Option** | **Claim** | **Support from letters** | **Conclusion** |
|-|-|-|-|
| A | Diplomatic relations were often cordial | - Afonso's complaints reveal significant tension and conflict over slave raids and social disruption [^notfound] <br/> - Manuel's instructions prioritize commercial gain over diplomatic harmony [^notfound] | Not supported |
| B | Kongolese noblemen were frequently taken as slaves | - Afonso mentions occasional kidnappings of nobles, but does not provide evidence of frequent or systematic enslavement of nobility [^notfound] <br/> - The letters do not quantify the frequency of such incidents | Not supported |
| C | Trade was highly regulated | - There is no mention of formal regulations, treaties, or trade laws in either letter [^notfound] <br/> - The chaotic nature of slave raids suggests a lack of effective regulation | Not supported |
| D | Trade was brisk with both parties | - Afonso's letter shows strong Kongolese demand for Portuguese goods and active trade [^notfound] <br/> - Manuel's instructions emphasize filling ships with Kongolese exports, indicating mutual benefit and brisk commerce [^notfound] | Strongly supported |

---

## Conclusion

The letters collectively support **option D**: trade between Portugal and Kongo was brisk and mutually beneficial, with both parties actively engaged in exchanging goods and slaves. Afonso's account of Kongolese demand and the resulting slave raids, together with Manuel's directive to secure Kongolese exports, demonstrate a vibrant, demand-driven trade relationship despite underlying tensions. Options A, B, and C are not directly supported by the textual evidence.

### Professional recommendations: disclosing facts and values [^b676eafb]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2001). Low credibility.

It is not unusual for patients and their families, when confronted with difficult medical choices, to ask their physicians for advice. This paper outlines the shades of meaning of two questions frequently put to physicians: "What should I do?" and "What would you do?" It is argued that these are not questions about objective matters of fact. Hence, any response to such questions requires an understanding, appreciation, and disclosure of the personal context and values that inform the recommendation. A framework for considering and articulating a response to these questions is suggested, using as a heuristic the phrasing "If I were you.../If it were me...".

### Counterfactual reasoning underlies the learning of priors in decision making [^3fb01587]. Neuron (2018). Low credibility.

Figure 5 
Descriptive Rendering of the Rule to Update Knowledge of the Base Rate

The Bayesian model and its alternatives can be characterized by the way they updatebased on the choice-confidence and the expectation of the base rate, expressed relative to the choice taken (, similar to a priori probability correct). The strength of the update is parameterized by.

(A) For the Choice-only model,is always equal to 1.

(B) For the Choice-confidence model,only depends on the reported confidence.

(C) For the Bayesian model,is the counterfactual confidence, which is a function of both reported confidence and.

(D) For the Empirical model, we used a flexible mapping (Equation 16) of confidence andtothat best fit the data.

To produce Figure 5 D, we used a flexible five-parameter mapping (Equation 16) to relateto the two quantities represented on the abscissa and ordinate. Unlike Figures 5 A–5C, in whichis derived from theory, in Figure 5 D,is obtained by fitting the data, as in Figure 4, by maximizing the likelihood of the choice and confidence data. The key difference is now we incorporate additional terms to specify(see STAR Methods). The resulting empirical map (Figure 5 D) resembles the Bayesian map in Figure 5 C. For a fixed level of confidence, knowledge of the base rate is affected more strongly when the prior expectation of the decision direction is less supportive of the choice (vertical gradient). For example, when this expectation opposes the chosen direction (i.e. lower half of the map), the update is stronger. Intuitively, this is because the reported confidence is a function of both the stimulus strength and the prior knowledge. Therefore, if the prior opposes the choice (expectation), then the confidence that the subject would have under a neutral prior (expectation) must be greater than the one reported. The exercise complements the conclusions drawn from model comparison by adopting a more open-ended answer to the question of what combination of confidence and prior expectation best supports the updating ofconsistent with choice. The answer is that confidence is not sufficient but is adjusted by prior expectation in a way that emulates the conversion to counterfactual confidence.

### It is time for consensus on' consensus statements' [^30d1fdf5]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Do consensus statements deserve the prestige they are afforded?

Expert opinion sits at the base of the evidence pyramid but when those experts gather, and take recent systematic reviews into account, their output—consensus statements—are given great weight. Consensus statements are some of the most downloaded and cited publications. They can inform state and sporting policy,which opens up the potential to impact individual behaviour and eventually patient outcomes. Judging how much to trust consensus statement recommendations can be difficult (see figure 1). How can the research community (consensus creators, Journal editors, media channels) ensure the great weight given to consensus statements is supported by a scientific, rigorous, transparent, replicable and equitable process?

### Expert opinion is necessary: Delphi panel methodology facilitates a scientific approach to consensus [^33dcc2a8]. Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Our current trend and focus on evidence-based medicine is biased in favor of randomized controlled trials, which are ranked highest in the hierarchy of evidence while devaluing expert opinion, which is ranked lowest in the hierarchy. However, randomized controlled trials have weaknesses as well as strengths, and no research method is flawless. Moreover, stringent application of scientific research techniques, such as the Delphi Panel methodology, allows survey of experts in a high quality and scientific manner. Level V evidence (expert opinion) remains a necessary component in the armamentarium used to determine the answer to a clinical question.

### A multinational Delphi consensus to end the COVID-19 public health threat [^9a1dc9fd]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Beneficial knowledge about COVID-19 aetiology, pathophysiology, prevention, vaccination, treatment and care has rapidly advanced through rigorous scientific, medical and public health inquiry, debate and collaboration –. Notwithstanding these advances, the responses of individual countries have been heterogeneous and often inadequate, in part because they lack coordination and clear goals.

To develop a global consensus regarding these ongoing problems, we carried out a Delphi study with a multidisciplinary, geographically diverse panel of 386 academic, health, non-governmental organization (NGO), government and other experts in COVID-19 response from 112 countries and territories (Table 1 and Methods). We achieved response rates of 85% in the second round (R2) and 82% and 81% in the third round (R3) surveys of the 41 statements and 57 recommendations, respectively. The mean levels of combined agreement (agree + somewhat agree) increased across the three rounds of the consensus statements (R1, 89%; R2, 90%; R3, 96%) and the two rounds of recommendations (R2, 93%; R3, 98%). The resulting consensus statements and recommendations (Fig. 1) can serve as a strong basis for decision-making to end COVID-19 as a public health threat, and permit a more durable resumption of social, cultural, religious, political, healthcare, economic and educational activities, with less burden on vulnerable populations.

### Viral genetic clustering and transmission dynamics of the 2022 mpox outbreak in Portugal [^f0033b8d]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Our transmission model has potential limitations in the assumptions adopted, which are important to consider when interpreting the results. Firstly, we assumed a homogeneous mixing of the entire MSM population living in Portugal, and we did not include network data among the MSM population because of the incompleteness of these data in the inquiries. Secondly, we relied on laboratory-confirmed case data as an indicator of epidemic size and used travel history as an approximation for the imported cases. Lastly, the model does not account for the possibility that some exposed individuals are perhaps less susceptible to the MPXV (for example, smallpox-vaccinated individuals), and the low number of vaccinated individuals during the period of this time series (less than 500) hampered the inclusion of the effect of vaccination on these dynamics.

Regarding the genomic epidemiological analysis, we were able to identify the B.1 sublineages (that is, genetic subclusters) with the highest impact on the mpox epidemic in Portugal and assess whether their circulation seemed to be higher in Portugal (owing to the lack of international sequences) or revealed multi-country dissemination (Fig. 3). Moreover, the inclusion of travel data, as well as data on sexual contacts with tourists, travelers or visitors, complemented the phylogenetic data to support the existence of multiple introductions of the same sublineage, even though different scenarios were observed. For example, sublineage B.1.9, which had intense circulation in Portugal since the beginning of the epidemic (Fig. 3), was found to have been reintroduced at a later stage after the epidemic peak. By contrast, other sublineages seemed to be introduced multiple times throughout the epidemic, although each introduction probably seeded limited transmission chains (for example, B.1.5 and B.1.7). Supporting the reliability of the disclosed international linkage, we found a link between travel-related or tourism-related countries and the countries with (a high proportion of) sequences in those subclusters. For instance, we found one travel-related introduction of sub-lineage B.1.2 from the United States, and this country represented around half (105 out of 214) of all B.1.2 sequences reported worldwide during the study period. In another example, Germany was the most frequently represented country (114 out of 161 sequences) within cluster 181 (corresponding to sublineage B.1.1), which was consistent with the travel history reported by one Portuguese case linked to that cluster. Still, it is noteworthy that travel history data also allowed the identification of other potential independent B.1.1 introductions from Brazil, Canada and Italy, which corroborates the complexity of such inferences, even with the vast epidemiological data and high sequence sampling rates (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Also, in a few instances, the lack of matches could have been underestimated because of the low number of sequences available in GenBank from some countries. For example, several cases across different subclusters reported travel history to Spain and Brazil, but only a few matches were found.

### Triazolam [^59f91090]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)] .
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] .

### Anagrelide [^6d45a681]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Cardiovascular Toxicity

Torsades de pointes and ventricular tachycardia have been reported with anagrelide. Obtain a pre-treatment cardiovascular examination including an ECG in all patients. During treatment with anagrelide monitor patients for cardiovascular effects and evaluate as necessary.

Anagrelide increases the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram and increases the heart rate in healthy volunteers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Do not use anagrelide in patients with known risk factors for QT interval prolongation, such as congenital long QT syndrome, a known history of acquired QTc prolongation, medicinal products that can prolong QTc interval and hypokalemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Hepatic impairment increases anagrelide exposure and could increase the risk of QTc prolongation. Monitor patients with hepatic impairment for QTc prolongation and other cardiovascular adverse reactions. The potential risks and benefits of anagrelide therapy in a patient with mild and moderate hepatic impairment should be assessed before treatment is commenced. Reduce anagrelide dose in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Avoid use of anagrelide in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

In patients with heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or electrolyte abnormalities, consider periodic monitoring with electrocardiograms [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Anagrelide is a phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) inhibitor and may cause vasodilation, tachycardia, palpitations, and congestive heart failure. Other drugs that inhibit PDE3 have caused decreased survival when compared with placebo in patients with Class III-IV congestive heart failure [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

In patients with cardiac disease, use anagrelide only when the benefits outweigh the risks.

5.2 Pulmonary Hypertension

Cases of pulmonary hypertension have been reported in patients treated with anagrelide. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of underlying cardiopulmonary disease prior to initiating and during anagrelide therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] .

5.3 Bleeding Risk

Use of concomitant anagrelide and aspirin increased major hemorrhagic events in a postmarketing study. Assess the potential risks and benefits for concomitant use of anagrelide with aspirin, since bleeding risks may be increased. Monitor patients for bleeding, including those receiving concomitant therapy with other drugs known to cause bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, PDE3 inhibitors, NSAIDs, antiplatelet agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) [see Drug Interactions (7.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### What a reviewer wants [^f4099ed6]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Understanding what a reviewer wants helps authors write better papers and design better research studies. Central to any research study is the research question. This is the first thing the reviewer looks for. The question, or research aim, should be relevant, original and very clearly defined. The paper should also be scientifically valid; the methods should achieve the aim by addressing the question, and the conclusions should match the results. The statistical analysis often attracts criticism, especially the relatively simple problems arising with the use of P-values and the concepts of statistical and clinical significance. There are several agreed guidelines describing exactly how studies should be reported. Following these is a great help to reviewers.

### Mavorixafor (Xolremdi) [^ab62ceb7]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

7.2 Effect of XOLREMDI on Other Drugs

CYP2D6 Substrates

The use of XOLREMDI with drugs that are another drug highly dependent on CYP2D6 for clearance is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)] .

Mavorixafor is a CYP2D6 inhibitor. Mavorixafor increases exposure of CYP2D6 substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of adverse reactions related to these substrates.

CYP3A4 Substrates

Monitor for CYP3A4 substrate related adverse reactions more frequently, unless otherwise recommended in the substrate's Prescribing Information, when XOLREMDI is used concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates where minimal substrate concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions.

Mavorixafor is an inhibitor of CYP3A4. Mavorixafor may increase the Cmaxand AUC of CYP3A4 substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of adverse reactions from the CYP3A4 substrate.

P-gp Substrates

Monitor for P-gp substrate related adverse reactions more frequently, unless otherwise recommended in the substrate's Prescribing Information, when XOLREMDI is used concomitantly with P-gp substrates where minimal substrate concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions.

Digoxin: Measure serum digoxin concentrations before initiating concomitant use with XOLREMDI, and continue monitoring serum digoxin concentrations as recommended in the Prescribing Information for digoxin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

Mavorixafor is an inhibitor of P-gp. Mavorixafor may increase the Cmaxand AUC of P-gp substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of adverse reactions from the P-gp substrate.

Metformin: Monitor for glycemic control and adjust the dose of metformin as necessary. Mavorixafor may decrease the mean Cmaxand AUC of metformin, which may reduce metformin's effectiveness. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown.

7.3 Drugs that Prolong the QTc Interval

Obtain an electrocardiogram when initiating, during concomitant use, and as clinically indicated in patients receiving concomitant medications with a known potential to prolong the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] .

XOLREMDI causes QTc interval prolongation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . Concomitant use of XOLREMDI with other products that prolong QTc interval may result in a greater increase in QTc interval and adverse reactions associated with QTc interval prolongation, including torsade de pointes, other serious arrythmias, and sudden death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] .

### A multinational Delphi consensus to end the COVID-19 public health threat [^64a9be8a]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Promote preventive behaviours

As noted above, vaccination alone will not end COVID-19 as a public health threat (Table 2 (STMT3.6)) for all people. Infection rates tend to increase when governments discontinue social measures, including non-pharmaceutical interventions, regardless of the level of vaccination (Table 3 (STMT4.5)). Thus, all countries should adopt a vaccines-plus approach, including a combination of COVID-19 vaccination, other prevention measures, treatment and possibly financial incentives (Table 6 (REC4.5)).

Although the nature and vectors of SARS-CoV-2 transmission were not clearly understood early in the pandemic, current evidence guided the panellists to near-unanimous agreement that SARS-CoV-2 is an airborne virus that presents the highest risk of transmission in indoor areas with poor ventilation (Table 3 (STMT4.1)). Risk-related communications from all actors should clearly emphasize that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is primarily caused by inhalation of the virus (Table 6 (REC4.3)). Considering the airborne nature of transmission, governments should regulate and incentivise structural prevention measures, such as ventilation and air filtration (Table 6 (REC4.1)), and high priority should be given to preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the workplace, educational institutions and commercial centres (Table 6 (REC4.6)).

Mammal-to-mammal transmission represents a reservoir for future zoonotic variants (Table 3 (STMT4.3)). Thus, substantial virological surveillance based on whole-genome sequencing of positive samples in human and high-risk mammal populations is an essential component of the continued pandemic response and preparedness (Table 5 (REC2.8)).

National and international travel restrictions should be based on current scientific knowledge and prevailing transmission rates of all variants that consider relevant, health-based factors (Table 6 (REC4.4)). Measures that are no longer scientifically valid for COVID-19 prevention should be immediately removed from COVID-19 guidance and policy (Table 6 (REC4.2)). Going forward, governments should consider imposing broad restrictions on civil liberties only in the event of variants of concern presenting risk of high rates of transmission and severity, coupled with waning immunity or vaccine resistance (Table 6 (REC4.7)).

### The PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies that evaluate healthcare interventions: explanation and elaboration [^f53f7495]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Item 9: Study selection

State the process for selecting studies (that is, for screening, for determining eligibility, for inclusion in the systematic review, and, if applicable, for inclusion in the meta-analysis).

Example “Eligibility assessment…[was] performed independently in an unblinded standardized manner by 2 reviewers…Disagreements between reviewers were resolved by consensus.”

Explanation There is no standard process for selecting studies to include in a systematic review. Authors usually start with a large number of identified records from their search and sequentially exclude records according to eligibility criteria. We advise authors to report how they screened the retrieved records (typically a title and abstract), how often it was necessary to review the full text publication, and if any types of record (such as letters to the editor) were excluded. We also advise using the PRISMA flow diagram to summarise study selection processes (see item 17 and box 3).

Efforts to enhance objectivity and avoid mistakes in study selection are important. Thus authors should report whether each stage was carried out by one or several people, who these people were, and, whenever multiple independent investigators performed the selection, what the process was for resolving disagreements. The use of at least two investigators may reduce the possibility of rejecting relevant reports.The benefit may be greatest for topics where selection or rejection of an article requires difficult judgments.For these topics, authors should ideally tell readers the level of inter-rater agreement, how commonly arbitration about selection was required, and what efforts were made to resolve disagreements (such as by contact with the authors of the original studies).

### Understanding systematic reviews and meta-analyses [ formula: see text ] [^a0b57635]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Systematic reviews should be distinguished from narrative reviews. In the latter, an editor asks an expert to sum up all of the information that is known about a particular topic. However, the expert is under no constraints regarding what he or she does, or does not, choose to include in the review. As a result, his or her bias can influence the final message. A systematic review, which may or may not be written by experts, typically asks a narrower question, and then answers it using the entirety of the medical literature. The systematic review process includes computer searches to identify the pertinent literature, a statement of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for identified studies, a list of items of interest to extract from each study, a method to assess the quality of each study, a summary of the evidence that has been found (which may or may not involve attempts to combine data), a discussion of the evidence and the limitations of the conclusions, and suggestions for future research efforts. If the data are combined, that process is called meta-analysis. In meta-analysis, an estimate of the reliability of each study is made, and those that appear to be more reliable are weighed more heavily when the data are combined. While systematic reviews depend on a more preplanned method and thus, unlike narrative reviews, contain sections on method, they can be easily read once the reader becomes familiar with the vocabulary.

### Fenofibrate (Antara) [^bdf65b4a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Prior to Initiation of Antara

Assess lipid levels before initiating therapy. Identify other causes (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, or medications) of high triglyceride levels and manage as appropriate.
Patients should be placed on an appropriate lipid-lowering diet before receiving Antara and should continue this diet during treatment with Antara.
In patients with diabetes and fasting chylomicronemia, improve glycemic control prior to considering starting Antara.

2.2 Recommended Dosage and Administration

• Severe hypertriglyceridemia : ○    The recommended dosage of Antara is 43 mg or 130 mg orally once daily. ○    Dosage should be individualized according to patient response, and should be adjusted if necessary following repeat lipid determinations at 4 to 8 week intervals. • Primary hyperlipidemia : ○    The recommended dosage of Antara is 130 mg orally once daily. •    Administer Antara as a single dose at any time of day, with or without food. •    Advise patients to swallow Antara capsules whole. Do not crush, break, dissolve, or chew capsules. •    Assess TG when clinically appropriate, as early as 4 to 8 weeks after initiating Antara. Discontinue Antara in patients who do not have an adequate response after two months of treatment. •    If a dose is missed, advise patients not to take an extra dose. Resume treatment with the next dose. •    Advise patients to take Antara at least 1 hour before or 4 hours to 6 hours after a bile acid binding resin to avoid impeding its absorption.

2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment

Assess renal function prior to initiation of Antara and periodically thereafter [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
Treatment with Antara should be initiated at a dosage of 43 mg orally once daily in patients with mild to moderately impaired renal function (eGFR 30 to <60 mL/min/1.73m), and increased only after evaluation of the effects on renal function and TG levels at this dose.
Antara is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m), including those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and those receiving dialysis [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.4 Recommended Dosage in Geriatric Patients

Dosage selection for the elderly should be made on the basis of renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]

### Three questions to ask before using model outputs for decision support [^276900e2]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

A way forward

Models tend to look right as they are presented with the claim of being realistic enough for their purpose. Looking right, though, has many dimensions, and we suggest the three screening questions presented here as a simple approach for decision makers to disentangle them. Once we know a model’s purpose, we can assess whether its organization is meaningful; once we know its purpose and organization, we can assess whether it represents the real system dynamics relevant to a specific problem; once we know which patterns it can reproduce, we can assess whether its model outputs can support decisions; and once we have answered all three questions for a suite of models they can be compared and taken into account to varying degrees. The three questions do not replace more detailed guidelines on GMP,, but they provide a simple and effective common language that will allow us to develop models and use their outputs for decision support in a more transparent, robust, and safe way.

It is still important to keep in mind that models can only support decisions. The responsibility for using model outputs lies with decision makers. Answers to the three screening questions allow them to transparently base their decisions on a weight-of-evidence approach, and to update their decisions when new data and updated models are available.
