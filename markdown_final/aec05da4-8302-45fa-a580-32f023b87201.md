## Question

Data on fecal transplant in c diff infection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about data on fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), including efficacy, safety, delivery methods, special populations, and guideline positioning, with attention to conflicting data and mechanisms. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical problem and why FMT is biologically plausible. Then, I should verify the highest-quality efficacy data from randomized trials and meta-analyses. Next, I will examine safety signals and how they vary by population and protocol. After that, I need to compare delivery routes and product types. I will then review special populations, especially immunocompromised hosts and IBD. Finally, I should align with current guidelines, reconcile conflicting studies, and synthesize practical recommendations with appropriate caveats [^115w4AKC] [^11267aqk].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and rationale. CDI is a leading healthcare-associated infection with recurrence rates around 15–30% after an initial episode and 40–60% after a first recurrence, driven by antibiotic-induced dysbiosis and impaired colonization resistance; FMT aims to restore a healthy microbial ecosystem and secondary bile acid metabolism that suppresses C. difficile, which is mechanistically compelling and supported by translational work [^113bv8ST] [^11267aqk] [^115A2ZWo].

> I will now examine the highest-quality efficacy evidence. The 2023 Cochrane review of six RCTs in immunocompetent adults with recurrent CDI found that FMT substantially increased resolution versus control (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.36–2.71; NNT ≈ 3), with moderate-certainty evidence, which I should treat as the anchor estimate for typical immunocompetent rCDI [^113BHu4j]. Wait, let me verify consistency across syntheses: an updated meta-analysis reported overall clinical effect around 91% with repeat FMT and 84% with single FMT at week 8, with superiority to antibiotics and a very low NNT versus vancomycin, reinforcing robust efficacy in rCDI [^1113ze8X]. But hold on, I should also acknowledge that RCT cure rates are generally lower than open-label series; pooled randomized data show about 76% cure with single FMT, whereas observational cohorts often exceed 90%, likely reflecting selection and performance biases, so I need to communicate this heterogeneity transparently [^112R45Gf].

> Next, I should review safety. The Cochrane review found no conclusive increase in serious adverse events with FMT and suggested a possible slight reduction, though confidence intervals were wide and event counts low, indicating uncertainty and the need for larger registries [^113BHu4j]. Let me double-check pooled safety estimates: a large meta-analysis of 61 studies (5,099 patients) found FMT-related SAEs in less than 1%, with unrelated SAEs around 2.9%, supporting a favorable short-term safety profile when donor screening and good practices are followed [^117AMzuL]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought SAEs were uniformly under 1% across all settings; however, a focused meta-analysis of high-quality RCTs reported a pooled SAE rate near 5.3%, reminding me that definitions, attribution, and populations matter, and that rare but serious infections can occur if screening is inadequate, as highlighted by FDA warnings following transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms [^113nfxL3] [^112jB6JA].

> I need to check delivery route and product effects. Frozen FMT is noninferior to fresh for clinical resolution in RCTs, enabling logistics and standardization, which is practically important [^114Uhs6T]. Colonoscopy and capsules generally outperform enema in observational syntheses, and capsules achieve roughly 82–85% cure in meta-analyses, with noninferiority to colonoscopy in several studies, though heterogeneity and protocol differences persist [^1113ze8X] [^112yViAA] [^115uNH9b]. Hold on, I should verify the role of live microbes: a recent randomized trial found that sterile fecal filtrate lacking live bacteria was inferior to live donor stool, supporting the necessity of viable microbial consortia for efficacy, which aligns with ecological and mechanistic data on bile acid restoration and engraftment [^115CGHf6] [^11267aqk].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with immunocompromised hosts. I should confirm that most RCTs excluded the severely immunocompromised, so evidence is largely observational; nonetheless, pooled data in immunocompromised cohorts show about 75% resolution after one FMT and 87% with repeat FMT, with SAEs around 10%, higher than in immunocompetent patients but still acceptable in many contexts, and recent guidance suggests FMT can be considered in mildly to moderately immunocompromised adults with rCDI after antibiotics [^11588fms] [^115GsL31]. I need to ensure counseling reflects the higher SAE risk and the need for meticulous donor screening and close follow-up in this group [^11588fms] [^112jB6JA].

> Now, I should review patients with inflammatory bowel disease. FMT is effective for rCDI in IBD with pooled cure rates near 78–88%, but IBD flares occur in roughly 27% of adults and 11% of children, and colectomy risk is nontrivial, so I must balance CDI treatment efficacy against IBD-specific risks and coordinate with IBD specialists [^111tZ5ai]. Let me reconsider whether FMT modifies IBD course; available data suggest no consistent benefit on underlying IBD activity, reinforcing that FMT is for CDI eradication rather than IBD treatment per se [^111tZ5ai].

> Next, I should review pediatric data. Retrospective series and small prospective studies suggest FMT is effective and generally safe in children with rCDI, with cure rates comparable to adults, but high-quality pediatric RCTs remain limited; thus, shared decision-making and careful donor screening are essential, and use should follow pediatric-experienced centers and evolving guidance [^115jjmf4] [^1136vFEv].

> I will now examine severe and fulminant CDI. Evidence is limited to case series and small trials, but structured protocols using sequential FMT combined with ongoing vancomycin have achieved high cure rates in severe and fulminant disease, and multiple guidelines suggest considering FMT as rescue when antibiotics fail and surgery is not feasible or as a bridge to avoid colectomy, albeit with very low certainty of evidence [^112DVzts] [^1178q9o3] [^1155ik9Y]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; these are conditional recommendations, and patient selection, hemodynamic stability, and local expertise are critical determinants of outcomes [^1178q9o3].

> Let me align with current guideline positions. Major societies recommend FMT after two or more recurrences of CDI following appropriate antibiotics, with strong or moderate recommendations and preference for colonoscopy or capsules; some guidance extends consideration to high-risk patients after the first recurrence or to severe/refractory cases not responding to antibiotics, reflecting evolving but still limited evidence [^114w94MX] [^115Gnp27] [^113ue2qN] [^113gqbC5]. I should confirm that repeat FMT is reasonable for early recurrence within 8 weeks and that suppressive vancomycin remains an alternative when FMT is not feasible or is declined [^114w94MX].

> But wait, what about conflicting randomized data. A recent double-blind RCT of capsule FMT versus placebo in patients who had just completed antibiotics and were symptom-free at randomization showed no reduction in 56-day recurrence, raising questions about timing, patient selection, and product formulation; critics argue this design enriched for sustained antibiotic responders and used a low-dose lyophilized regimen, limiting generalizability to typical rCDI populations and not overturning the broader RCT evidence base [^113Rsie1] [^112vR4qq] [^1168LyNy]. I should emphasize that guideline recommendations remain unchanged pending replication and that real-world cohorts continue to show high effectiveness [^1173UXxu].

> I should double-check mechanistic insights that inform expectations and failures. Host immunity, particularly CD4+ Foxp3+ T-regulatory cells, appears necessary for successful engraftment and resolution, explaining why excessive inflammation or immunodeficiency can blunt FMT efficacy; restoration of secondary bile acids and microbial diversity are consistently associated with cure, supporting the biological plausibility of microbiome-based therapy [^111fsiJW] [^115A2ZWo] [^113wEaKU].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations with appropriate cautions. For immunocompetent adults with rCDI after appropriate antibiotics, FMT is strongly favored and should be offered via colonoscopy or capsules, with frozen preparations acceptable; antibiotics should be held 1–3 days before FMT to optimize engraftment, and repeat FMT is reasonable for early recurrence [^115Gnp27] [^113gqbC5]. For immunocompromised patients, FMT can be considered with enhanced screening and surveillance given higher SAE rates but comparable effectiveness with retreatment; for IBD, coordinate care to mitigate flare risk; for severe/fulminant CDI not responding to antibiotics, consider FMT as rescue in experienced centers; and for pediatrics, use expert centers and shared decision-making until stronger trial data emerge [^115GsL31] [^11588fms] [^111tZ5ai] [^115jjmf4] [^1178q9o3].

> Finally, I need to ensure we address uncertainties and future directions. Long-term safety beyond 6–12 months remains incompletely defined, though large registries have not shown signal clustering to date; standardization of donor screening, product manufacturing, and outcome reporting is improving but still variable; and the field is moving toward defined microbial consortia and live biotherapeutics, which may enhance safety and scalability while preserving efficacy [^1173UXxu] [^112Pxk8B] [^114itdpP].

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is highly effective for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI), with **clinical resolution rates of 80–90%** after a single treatment and up to 98% with repeat FMT [^1113ze8X]. FMT is **superior to antibiotics** for rCDI, with a number needed to treat of 2–3, and is recommended by major guidelines after two or more recurrences [^113BHu4j] [^114w94MX] [^113ue2qN]. Serious adverse events are rare (< 1%), but **screening for multidrug-resistant organisms is essential** to prevent transmission [^117AMzuL] [^112jB6JA]. Capsule formulations are noninferior to colonoscopy and offer a less invasive option [^112yViAA] [^111kLfgk]. Evidence for primary CDI is limited; FMT is not standard first-line therapy but may be considered in select cases [^112fqaAu] [^114dZ4Ec].

---

## Efficacy of FMT in recurrent CDI

- **Clinical resolution rates**: FMT achieves 80–90% resolution after a single treatment, rising to 90–98% with repeat FMT [^1113ze8X] [^115uNH9b].

- **Comparison with antibiotics**: FMT is superior to standard antibiotics, with an NNT of 2–3 for rCDI [^113BHu4j] [^1113ze8X].

- **Long-term efficacy**: Sustained cure is reported in 75–80% at 6–12 months, with low recurrence after successful engraftment [^112wXqk1] [^1173UXxu].

---

## Efficacy of FMT in primary CDI

Evidence for primary CDI is **limited**; a randomized trial suggested noninferiority to vancomycin, but FMT is not standard first-line therapy pending more data [^112fqaAu] [^115w4AKC].

---

## Safety profile of FMT

- **Serious adverse events**: SAEs are rare (< 1%), including infections and bacteremia, especially in immunocompromised patients [^117AMzuL] [^111kLfgk].

- **Minor adverse events**: Common, self-limited GI symptoms (diarrhea, cramping, bloating, nausea) occur in 5–20% [^notfound].

- **Long-term safety**: No clear increase in autoimmune or malignancy risk, but continued surveillance is advised [^1173UXxu] [^113i9DLc].

---

## Comparison of FMT delivery methods

| **Delivery method** | **Efficacy** | **Safety** | **Patient acceptance** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Colonoscopy | High (85–90%) | SAEs rare | Moderate |
| Capsules | High (80–90%) | SAEs rare | High |
| Enema | Lower (60–70%) | SAEs rare | High |

- **Capsules**: Noninferior to colonoscopy, with high acceptance and comparable safety [^112yViAA] [^111kLfgk].

- **Enema**: Less effective, but acceptable when other methods are unavailable [^112R45Gf] [^114w94MX].

---

## Patient populations benefiting from FMT

Immunocompetent adults experience **high efficacy and safety**, with strong guideline support [^113BHu4j] [^114w94MX]. Immunocompromised patients have somewhat lower efficacy and higher SAE risk, but FMT remains a reasonable option with careful screening [^111kLfgk] [^115GsL31]. Pediatric patients have limited data; FMT appears safe and effective, though more research is needed [^115jjmf4] [^1136vFEv].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Standardization**: Variability in donor selection, preparation, and delivery affects outcomes [^1113ze8X] [^115CGHf6].

- **Regulatory issues**: FMT is investigational in many regions, requiring rigorous screening and consent [^113rxy7q] [^112Pxk8B].

- **Long-term risks**: Potential unknown effects of microbiome alteration remain under study [^116aSGJN] [^1173UXxu].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

IDSA/SHEA recommend **FMT** after two or more recurrences following appropriate antibiotics [^113M11WS]. ACG recommends FMT for multiple recurrences, with **colonoscopy or capsules** preferred [^114w94MX]. ESCMID recommends FMT for multiple recurrences and as rescue in **severe complicated CDI** when surgery is not feasible [^113ue2qN] [^1155ik9Y].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

- **Defined microbial products**: Live biotherapeutics aim to improve safety and standardization [^111oraeW] [^116jBRGS].

- **Mechanistic studies**: Clarifying how FMT restores colonization resistance will optimize therapies [^11267aqk] [^113wEaKU].

- **Expanded indications**: Research is exploring FMT for primary CDI, severe disease, and other microbiome-associated conditions [^112fqaAu] [^11399Shg].

---

FMT is a **highly effective, safe, and guideline-supported therapy** for rCDI, with multiple delivery options and a strong evidence base; continued research and standardization will broaden its role in clinical practice.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile (Clostridium difficile) [^113BHu4j]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Clostridioides difficile (formerly known as Clostridium difficile) is a bacterium that can cause potentially life-threatening diarrheal illness in individuals with an unhealthy mixture of gut bacteria, known as dysbiosis, and can cause recurrent infections in nearly a third of infected individuals. The traditional treatment of recurrent C difficile infection (rCDI) includes antibiotics, which may further exacerbate dysbiosis. There is growing interest in correcting the underlying dysbiosis in rCDI using of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT); and there is a need to establish the benefits and harms of FMT for the treatment of rCDI based on data from randomized controlled trials.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of donor-based fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection in immunocompetent people.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 31 March 2022.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomized trials of adults or children with rCDI for inclusion. Eligible interventions must have met the definition of FMT, which is the administration of fecal material containing distal gut microbiota from a healthy donor to the gastrointestinal tract of a person with rCDI. The comparison group included participants who did not receive FMT and were given placebo, autologous FMT, no intervention, or antibiotics with activity against C difficile.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. proportion of participants with resolution of rCDI and 2. serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 3. treatment failure, 4. all-cause mortality, 5. withdrawal from study, 6. rate of new CDI infection after a successful FMT, 7. any adverse event, 8. quality of life, and 9. colectomy. We used the GRADE criteria to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included six studies with 320 participants. Two studies were conducted in Denmark, and one each in the Netherlands, Canada, Italy, and the US. Four were single-center and two were multicenter studies. All studies included only adults. Five studies excluded people who were severely immunocompromised, with only one study including 10 participants who were receiving immunosuppressive therapy out of the 64 enrolled; these were similarly distributed between the FMT arm (4/24 or 17%) and comparison arms (6/40 or 15%). The route of administration was the upper gastrointestinal tract via a nasoduodenal tube in one study, two studies used enema only, two used colonoscopic only delivery, and one used either nasojejunal or colonoscopic delivery, depending on a clinical determination of whether the recipient could tolerate a colonoscopy. Five studies had at least one comparison group that received vancomycin. The risk of bias (RoB 2) assessments did not find an overall high risk of bias for any outcome. All six studies assessed the efficacy and safety of FMT for the treatment of rCDI. Pooled results from six studies showed that the use of FMT in immunocompetent participants with rCDI likely leads to a large increase in resolution of rCDI in the FMT group compared to control (risk ratio (RR) 1.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36 to 2.71; P = 0.02, I² = 63%; 6 studies, 320 participants; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 3; moderate-certainty evidence). Fecal microbiota transplantation probably results in a slight reduction in serious adverse events; however, the CIs around the summary estimate were wide (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.41; P = 0.24, I² = 26%; 6 studies, 320 participants; NNTB 12; moderate-certainty evidence). Fecal microbiota transplantation may result in a reduction in all-cause mortality; however, the number of events was small, and the CIs of the summary estimate were wide (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.45; P = 0.48, I² = 0%; 6 studies, 320 participants; NNTB 20; low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported colectomy rates.

Authors' Conclusions

In immunocompetent adults with rCDI, FMT likely leads to a large increase in the resolution of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection compared to alternative treatments such as antibiotics. There was no conclusive evidence regarding the safety of FMT for the treatment of rCDI as the number of events was small for serious adverse events and all-cause mortality. Additional data from large national registry databases might be required to assess any short-term or long-term risks with using FMT for the treatment of rCDI. Elimination of the single study that included some immunocompromised people did not alter these conclusions. Due to the low number of immunocompromised participants enrolled, conclusions cannot be drawn about the risks or benefits of FMT for rCDI in the immunocompromised population.

### A randomized controlled trial of efficacy and safety of fecal microbiota transplant for preventing recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection [^113Rsie1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the most common cause of healthcare-associated infections in US hospitals, with 15%-30% of patients experiencing recurrence. The aim of our randomized, double-blind clinical trial was to assess the efficacy of capsule-delivered fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) versus placebo in reducing recurrent diarrhea and CDI recurrence. The secondary aim was FMT safety assessment.

Methods

Between 2018 and 2022, Veterans across the Veterans Health Administration system with recurrent CDI who responded to antibiotic treatment were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to oral FMT or placebo capsules. Randomization was stratified by number of prior CDI recurrences (1 or ≥ 2). The primary endpoint was clinical recurrence by day 56, defined as > 3 unformed stools daily for ≥ 2 days with or without laboratory confirmation of C. difficile, or death within 56 days.

Results

The study was stopped due to futility after meeting prespecified criteria. Of 153 participants (76 FMT, 77 placebo) with an average age of 66.5 years, 25 participants (32.9%) in the FMT arm and 23 (29.9%) in the placebo arm experienced the primary endpoint of diarrhea and possible or definite CDI recurrence or death within 56 days of capsule administration (absolute difference, 3.0% [95% confidence interval, -11.7% to 17.7%]). Stratification by number of recurrences revealed no statistically significant differences. There were no clinically important differences in adverse events.

Conclusions

FMT therapy versus placebo did not reduce CDI recurrence or death at 56 days. There were no meaningful differences in adverse events between treatment groups.

Clinical Trials Registration

NCT03005379.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of fecal microbiota transplantation for treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection [^112wXqk1]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Goals

We investigated the long-term efficacy and safety of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) for the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI).

Background

FMT has emerged as a promising therapy for patients with rCDI unresponsive to standard medical therapy, though long-term efficacy and safety data are scarce.

Materials and Methods

A multicenter retrospective study was performed on patients treated with FMT for rCDI with ≥ 6 months of clinical follow-up post-FMT. Patients were contacted to document sustained efficacy, potential adverse events, and antibiotic exposure. The electronic medical record was reviewed to confirm patient-reported outcomes and obtain additional data. The primary outcome was sustained cure, as defined by the absence of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) at any timepoint after FMT.

Results

Of 528 patients treated, 207 were successfully contacted. The mean follow-up post-FMT was 34 (range: 6 to 84) months. One hundred fifty-seven patients (75.8%) reported sustained cure at the time of follow-up. One hundred patients (48%) reported the use of antibiotics for non-CDI indications post-FMT, of whom 11 (11%) had experienced CDI post-FMT. Fifty-two of the original 528 patients (9.8%) treated with FMT had died at the time of follow-up contact; none were felt attributable to the procedure. New medical conditions or diagnoses post-FMT were reported in 105 patients (50.5%). Fifteen reported improvement post-FMT in previously diagnosed medical conditions.

Conclusions

In this largest and longest study to date on efficacy and safety after FMT for treatment of rCDI, we found that the majority of patients experienced long-term cure. Although a number of new conditions developed post-FMT, there was no clustering of diseases associated with dysbiosis.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation in the treatment of Clostridium difficile infections [^111LxVTS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In recent years, Clostridium difficile infections have become more frequent, more severe, more refractory to standard treatment, and more likely to recur. Current antibiotic treatment regimens for Clostridium difficile infection alter the normal gut flora, which provide colonization resistance against Clostridium difficile. Over the past few years, there has been a marked increase in the knowledge of the gut microbiota and its role in health maintenance and disease causation. This has, fortuitously, coincided with the use of a unique microbial replacement therapy, fecal microbiota transplantation, in the treatment of patients with multiple recurrent Clostridium difficile infections. We briefly review current knowledge of the gut microbiota's functions. We then review the indications for use of fecal microbiota transplantation in Clostridium difficile infection, the techniques employed, and results of treatment. Fecal microbiota transplantation has been shown to be efficacious for patients with multiply recurrent Clostridium difficile infections (reported cure rates of 90%), with an excellent short-term safety profile, and has been included in the American College of Gastroenterology treatment guidelines for this troublesome disease.

### Faecal microbiota transplantation for Clostridioides difficile: mechanisms and pharmacology [^11267aqk]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has emerged as a remarkably successful treatment for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection that cannot be cured with antibiotics alone. Understanding the complex biology and pathogenesis of C. difficile infection, which we discuss in this Perspective, is essential for understanding the potential mechanisms by which FMT cures this disease. Although FMT has already entered clinical practice, different microbiota-based products are currently in clinical trials and are vying for regulatory approval. However, all these therapeutics belong to an entirely new class of agents that require the development of a new branch of pharmacology. Characterization of microbiota therapeutics uses novel and rapidly evolving technologies and requires incorporation of microbial ecology concepts. Here, we consider FMT within a pharmacological framework, including its essential elements: formulation, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. From this viewpoint, multiple gaps in knowledge become apparent, identifying areas that require systematic research. This knowledge is needed to help clinical providers use microbiota therapeutics appropriately and to facilitate development of next-generation microbiota products with improved safety and efficacy. The discussion here is limited to FMT as a representative of microbiota therapeutics and recurrent C. difficile as the indication; however, consideration of the intrinsic basic principles is relevant to this entire class of microbiota-based therapeutics.

### Mechanisms underpinning the efficacy of faecal microbiota transplantation in treating gastrointestinal disease [^115E4wRi]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is currently a recommended therapy for recurrent/refractory Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). The success of FMT for CDI has led to interest in its therapeutic potential in many other disorders. The mechanisms that underpin the efficacy of FMT are not fully understood. Importantly, FMT remains a crucial treatment in managing CDI and understanding the mechanisms that underpin its success will be critical to improve its clinical efficacy, safety and usability. Furthermore, a deeper understanding of this may allow us to expose FMT's full potential as a therapeutic tool for other disease states. This review will explore the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying the efficacy of FMT across a variety of diseases.

### Clostridioides difficile in transplant patients: early diagnosis, treatment, and prevention [^112u1GYC]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Clostridioides difficile infection is common in solid organ transplant and hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. These populations are also underrepresented in clinical trials, making optimal management difficult. Because of this, management of these populations follows national guideline recommendations. This review aims to summarize the recent relevant literature pertaining to the clinical management of C. difficile infection in transplant patients, with a particular focus on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.

Recent Findings

Early diagnosis of C. difficile colonization may mitigate both horizontal and vertical transmission (progression from colonization to colitis) of infection. Once diagnosed, recent literature suggests antibiotic treatment should align with that recommended by national guidelines. Fecal microbiota transplant is an emerging therapy for recurrent C. difficile infection, and recent data have demonstrated safety and efficacy. Prevention strategies including antimicrobial stewardship, probiotic administration, antibiotic administration, and bezlotoxumab may be beneficial in transplant populations, but more data are needed to confirm recent findings.

Summary

Studies evaluating C. difficile infection in transplant patients are only recently starting to emerge. Further research is needed to identify optimal treatment and prevention strategies, and to examine novel strategies such as microbiome manipulation.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for Clostridium difficile infection: a systematic review [^114dZ4Ec]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The role of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is not well-known.

Purpose

To assess the efficacy, comparative effectiveness, and harms of FMT for CDI.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1980 to January 2015), Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov, followed by hand-searching references from systematic reviews and identified studies.

Study Selection

Any study of FMT to treat adult patients with CDI; case reports were only used to report harms.

Data Extraction

Data were extracted by 1 author and verified by another; 2 authors independently assessed risk of bias and strength of evidence.

Data Synthesis

Two randomized, controlled trials (RCTs); 28 case-series studies; and 5 case reports were included. Two RCTs and 21 case-series studies (516 patients receiving FMT) reported using FMT for patients with recurrent CDI. A high proportion of treated patients had symptom resolution; however, the role of previous antimicrobials is unclear. One RCT comparing FMT with 2 control groups (n = 43) reported resolution of symptoms in 81%, 31%, and 23% of the FMT, vancomycin, or vancomycin-plus-bowel lavage groups, respectively (P < 0.001 for both control groups vs. FMT). An RCT comparing FMT route (n = 20) reported no difference between groups (60% in the nasogastric tube group and 80% in the colonoscopy group; P = 0.63). Across all studies for recurrent CDI, symptom resolution was seen in 85% of cases. In 7 case-series studies of patients with refractory CDI, symptom resolution ranged from 0% to 100%. Among 7 patients treated with FMT for initial CDI, results were mixed.

Limitation

Most studies were uncontrolled case-series studies; only 2 RCTs were available for analysis.

Conclusion

Fecal microbiota transplantation may have a substantial effect with few short-term adverse events for recurrent CDI. Evidence is insufficient on FMT for refractory or initial CDI treatment and on whether effects vary by donor, preparation, or delivery method.

### Faecal microbiota transplantation for recurrentinfection: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^1113ze8X]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is effective for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), but inconsistent effect rates and uncertain evidence levels have warranted caution. To clarify, we aimed to establish the evidence of FMT for recurrent CDI, updated across different delivery methods, treatment regimens, and in comparison with standard antibiotics.

Methods

In this updated systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, Clinical Key, and Svemed+ for FMT literature published in English until November 11, 2019. We included observational and clinical trials with or without antibiotic comparators and excluded studies with below 8 weeks follow-up and fewer than 15 patients. The primary outcome was clinical outcome by week 8. We comprehensively extracted patient and procedural data. In a random-effects meta-analysis, we estimated the clinical effect for repeat or single FMT, different delivery methods, and versus antibiotics. We rated the evidence according to the Cochrane and GRADE methods. The PROSPERO preregistration number is CRD42020158112.

Findings

Of 1816 studies assessed, 45 studies were included. The overall clinical effect week 8 following repeat FMT (24 studies, 1855 patients) was 91% (95% CI: 89–94%, I² = 53%) and 84% (80–88%, I² = 86%) following single FMT (43 studies, 2937 patients). Delivery by lower gastrointestinal endoscopy was superior to all other delivery methods, and repeat FMT significantly increased the treatment effect week 8 (P < 0·001). Compared with vancomycin, the number needed to treat (NNT) for repeat FMT was 1·5 (1·3–1·9, P < 0·001) and 2.9 (1·5–37·1, P = 0·03) for single FMT. Repeat FMT had high quality of evidence.

Interpretation

High-quality evidence supports FMT is effective for recurrent CDI, but its effect varies with the delivery method and the number of administrations. The superior NNT for FMT compared with antibiotics suggests that patients may benefit from advancing FMT to all instances of recurrent CDI.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation versus vancomycin for primaryInfection: a randomized controlled trial [^112fqaAu]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is recommended for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), but its role in primary CDI is unclear.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy and safety of FMT in primary CDI.

Design

Randomized, open-label, noninferiority, multicenter trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03796650).

Setting

Hospitals and primary care facilities in Norway.

Patients

Adults with CDI (C difficile toxin in stool and ≥ 3 loose stools daily) and no previous CDI within 365 days before enrollment.

Intervention

FMT without antibiotic pretreatment versus oral vancomycin, 125 mg 4 times daily for 10 days.

Measurements

The primary end point was clinical cure (firm stools or < 3 bowel movements daily) at day 14 and no disease recurrence within 60 days with the assigned treatment alone.

Results

Of 104 randomly assigned patients, 100 received FMT or the first dose of vancomycin and were eligible for analysis. Clinical cure and no disease recurrence within 60 days without additional treatment was observed in 34 of 51 patients (66.7%) with FMT versus 30 of 49 (61.2%) with vancomycin (difference, 5.4 percentage points [95.2% CI, -13.5 to 24.4 percentage points]; P for noninferiority < 0.001, rejecting the hypothesis that response to FMT is 25 percentage points lower than response to vancomycin). Eleven patients in the FMT group and 4 in the vancomycin group had additional C difficile treatment. Clinical cure at day 14 and no recurrence with or without additional treatment was observed in 40 of 51 patients (78.4%) with FMT and 30 of 49 (61.2%) with vancomycin (difference, 17.2 percentage points [95.2% CI, -0.7 to 35.1 percentage points]). No significant differences in adverse events were observed between groups.

Limitations

Open-label design and reliance on clinical end points.

Conclusion

FMT may be considered as first-line therapy in primary CDI.

### Adverse events in fecal microbiota transplantation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117AMzuL]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly efficacious procedure used most commonly for the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Despite the high value of incorporating FMT into practice, there remain concerns about its safety. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been an updated meta-analysis reporting pooled rates of adverse events in FMT for CDI.

Methods

A search for studies of FMT in patients with CDI was performed with the rate of serious adverse events (SAEs) related to FMT evaluated as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included SAEs unrelated to FMT and minor adverse events associated with FMT. A pooled analysis was then performed.

Results

Initial search identified 378 reference articles. Data were extracted from the 61 of these studies that met the inclusion criteria, comprising 5099 patients. Pooled analysis showed that SAEs related to FMT developed in less than 1% of patients. The pooled rate of SAEs not related to FMT was higher at 2.9%. The pooled rate of minor adverse events also showed infrequent self-limited gastrointestinal and systemic discomfort.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis supports FMT as a safe option for treating recurrent CDI. Future randomized trials are needed to improve our current understanding of FMT safety and further examine the improvements in the quality of life of patients treated with FMT compared to standard therapy of antibiotics.

### Methods and reporting studies assessing fecal microbiota transplantation: a systematic review [^111aUpXN]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) could be a novel treatment option for several chronic diseases associated with altered gut microbiota.

Purpose

To examine the conduct and reporting of studies assessing FMT.

Data Sources

Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science from inception to 31 January 2017.

Study Selection

Two reviewers independently examined titles and abstracts to identify all English-language reports of human clinical studies assessing the safety or efficacy of FMT.

Data Extraction

Three reviewers independently assessed study types and characteristics and the reporting of important methodological components of the FMT intervention.

Data Synthesis

Most (84%) of the 85 published reports found addressed the use of FMTs for Clostridium difficile infection or inflammatory bowel disease, and most (87%) were non-randomized controlled trials. Important methodological components that were not reported in published studies included the following: eligibility criteria for donors (47%), materials used for collecting stools and the period of collection (96%), methods used for conservation of stools (76%), the amount and type of stools used (for example, fresh or frozen), and duration of stool conservation (67%). Many (58%) did not report an analysis of microbiota composition.

Limitations

Lack of universal consensus regarding the most important methodological components of FMT and inability to assess the actual conduct of studies and whether the publication process affected the completeness of reporting.

Conclusion

Key components of FMT interventions, which are necessary to replicate and understand study findings about efficacy and safety, are poorly reported.

Primary Funding Source

No specific funding.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection [^117Gt23Q]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile, a major cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea due to perturbation of the normal gastrointestinal microbiome, is responsible for significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenditures. The incidence and severity of C difficile infection (CDI) is increasing, and recurrent disease is common. Recurrent infection can be difficult to manage with conventional antibiotic therapy. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), which involves instillation of stool from a healthy donor into the gastrointestinal tract of the patient, restores the gut microbiome to a healthy state. FMT has emerged as a promising new treatment for CDI. There are limited data on FMT for treatment of primary CDI, but FMT appears safe and effective for recurrent CDI. The safety and efficacy of FMT in patients with severe primary or severe recurrent CDI has not been established. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who undergo FMT for CDI may be at increased risk of IBD flare, and caution should be exercised with use of FMT in that population. The long-term safety of FMT is unknown; thus, rigorously conducted prospective studies are needed.

### European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases: 2021 update on the treatment guidance document for Clostridioides difficile infection in adults [^113ue2qN]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Scope

In 2009, the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) published the first treatment guidance document for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). This document was updated in 2014. The growing literature on CDI antimicrobial treatment and novel treatment approaches, such as faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and toxin-binding monoclonal antibodies, prompted the ESCMID study group on C. difficile (ESGCD) to update the 2014 treatment guidance document for CDI in adults.

Methods and Questions

Key questions on CDI treatment were formulated by the guideline committee and included: What is the best treatment for initial, severe, severe-complicated, refractory, recurrent and multiple recurrent CDI? What is the best treatment when no oral therapy is possible? Can prognostic factors identify patients at risk for severe and recurrent CDI and is there a place for CDI prophylaxis? Outcome measures for treatment strategy were: clinical cure, recurrence and sustained cure. For studies on surgical interventions and severe-complicated CDI the outcome was mortality. Appraisal of available literature and drafting of recommendations was performed by the guideline drafting group. The total body of evidence for the recommendations on CDI treatment consists of the literature described in the previous guidelines, supplemented with a systematic literature search on randomized clinical trials and observational studies from 2012 and onwards. The Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to grade the strength of our recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The guideline committee was invited to comment on the recommendations. The guideline draft was sent to external experts and a patients' representative for review. Full ESCMID endorsement was obtained after a public consultation procedure.

Recommendations

Important changes compared with previous guideline include but are not limited to: metronidazole is no longer recommended for treatment of CDI when fidaxomicin or vancomycin are available, fidaxomicin is the preferred agent for treatment of initial CDI and the first recurrence of CDI when available and feasible, FMT or bezlotoxumab in addition to standard of care antibiotics (SoC) are preferred for treatment of a second or further recurrence of CDI, bezlotoxumab in addition to SoC is recommended for the first recurrence of CDI when fidaxomicin was used to manage the initial CDI episode, and bezlotoxumab is considered as an ancillary treatment to vancomycin for a CDI episode with high risk of recurrence when fidaxomicin is not available. Contrary to the previous guideline, in the current guideline emphasis is placed on risk for recurrence as a factor that determines treatment strategy for the individual patient, rather than the disease severity.

### European consensus conference on faecal microbiota transplantation in clinical practice [^111R84A6]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an important therapeutic option for Clostridium difficile infection. Promising findings suggest that FMT may play a role also in the management of other disorders associated with the alteration of gut microbiota. Although the health community is assessing FMT with renewed interest and patients are becoming more aware, there are technical and logistical issues in establishing such a non-standardised treatment into the clinical practice with safety and proper governance. In view of this, an evidence-based recommendation is needed to drive the practical implementation of FMT. In this European Consensus Conference, 28 experts from 10 countries collaborated, in separate working groups and through an evidence-based process, to provide statements on the following key issues: FMT indications; donor selection; preparation of faecal material; clinical management and faecal delivery and basic requirements for implementing an FMT centre. Statements developed by each working group were evaluated and voted by all members, first through an electronic Delphi process, and then in a plenary consensus conference. The recommendations were released according to best available evidence, in order to act as guidance for physicians who plan to implement FMT, aiming at supporting the broad availability of the procedure, discussing other issues relevant to FMT and promoting future clinical research in the area of gut microbiota manipulation. This consensus report strongly recommends the implementation of FMT centres for the treatment of C. difficile infection as well as traces the guidelines of technicality, regulatory, administrative and laboratory requirements.

### Clinical practice and infrastructure review of fecal microbiota transplantation for Clostridium difficile infection [^1157Bzfi]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

A substantial proportion of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) cases recur after completion of antibiotic therapy, and antibiotic cure rates diminish with each recurrence of CDI. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective therapy for recurrent FMT, which otherwise requires prolonged or indefinite antibiotic treatment. FMT is performed by introducing the fecal microbial community obtained from a healthy donor or pool of donors into the stomach, small intestine, or colon of a patient with CDI. Multiple clinical trials support the usefulness of FMT in treating recurrent CDI, and CDI treatment guidelines now include consideration of FMT at the third CDI recurrence. However, there remain challenges to incorporating FMT into clinical practice. First, methods of fecal bacterial community processing vary, as do methods of FMT administration. Second, the optimal dosing strategy and expected benefit of FMT for refractory CDI, particularly for severe and severe complicated cases, are uncertain. Third, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers FMT an investigational treatment. Fourth, insurance reimbursement for FMT usually falls short of FMT administration costs. In the setting of rising C difficile incidence and growing evidence for FMT efficacy, the demand for FMT has increased. However, uncertainty surrounding optimal FMT preparation and administration methods, FDA oversight, and insurance reimbursement presently limits the clinical practice of FMT.

### An infectious diseases perspective on fecal microbiota transplantation for Clostridioides difficile infection in children [^115jjmf4]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2019). Medium credibility.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is efficacious for treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections (rCDIs). Pediatric experience with FMT for rCDIs is increasing, particularly at large centers. While retrospective studies suggest that FMT is generally safe in the short term, particularly in immunocompetent patients and with rigorous donor screening, additional large prospective studies are needed. This particularly includes those at high risk for infectious complications, such as immunocompromised hosts. Further, long-term implications of altering the intestinal microbiome with FMT are not well understood. The role of FMT in children, particularly in high-risk patients, will require continual reexamination with future availability of pediatric safety and efficacy data. This review summarizes key points for infectious diseases physicians to consider when evaluating a child for FMT.

### Faecal microbiota transplantation for recurrentinfection: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^112ZGbQr]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective treatment for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). CDI is a leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, and 22–32% experience prolonged or recurrent infections unresponsive to standard antibiotics. Recurrent CDI is associated with a high mortality, and preventing the infection poses a substantial therapeutic challenge with limited treatment options. During the last decade, FMT has emerged as a viable treatment for recurrent CDI. With effect rates of up to 94% in clinical trials, FMT is now recommended by scientific societies and National Health agencies for patients with 2 or more recurrences of CDI.

Previous systematic reviews have confirmed the high clinical effect of FMT for recurrent CDI and indicated that the treatment effect may depend on the method of delivery and treatment regimens. Still, no clear clinical evidence exists for the cumulative effect of FMT following single or repeated treatment regimens, and the quality of evidence for FMT compared with standard antibiotics has been rated as moderate in previous systematic reviews and guidelines due to inconsistencies. These inconsistencies have resulted in caution and questioned the position of FMT in the CDI treatment algorithm until the evidence for FMT has been evaluated in more detail. Now, further to these earlier systematic reviews, more evidence has accumulated, and new methods of delivery have emerged; as such, an update of the evidence with the latest data is pivotal to guide clinical decisions and improve the future recommendations for FMT in managing patients with recurrent CDI.

The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to establish the evidence for using FMT in recurrent CDI, to provide updated effect estimates specific to different delivery methods and treatment regimens, and to compare the effect of FMT with that of standard antibiotics.

### Mechanisms underpinning the efficacy of faecal microbiota transplantation in treating gastrointestinal disease [^111tksBd]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is currently a recommended therapy for recurrent/refractory Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). – It is also being explored in the research setting for many other indications. However, there are a number of associated concerns regarding its use, including the unpleasant prospect of the procedure, the potential need for invasive administration, the small, but recognised risk of transmission of infection, and the complex regulation associated with its use. The COVID-19 pandemic and potential risk of viral transmission through donor stool samples has brought its limitations to the fore. As such, from a therapeutic perspective, understanding the mechanisms that underpin the efficacy of FMT may enable us to refine FMT from its current relatively crude state to a more refined 'microbiome therapeutic', which is no longer FMT, but could have a greater overall safety profile. This review will explore the current understanding of the mechanisms that underpin the efficacy of FMT across a variety of diseases.

Current indications for FMT

There has been a wealth of evidence demonstrating that FMT for CDI is effective for recurrent and refractory CDI, and the treatment has therefore been adopted in national and international guidelines. – A meta-analysis of all these studies highlights clinical resolution in 92% (95% CI 89–94%) of cases. The success of FMT for CDI has led to interest in its therapeutic potential in many other disorders, but a report on these is beyond the scope of this review.

### Host immunity modulates the efficacy of microbiota transplantation for treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection [^111fsiJW]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a successful therapeutic strategy for treating recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection. Despite remarkable efficacy, implementation of FMT therapy is limited and the mechanism of action remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate a critical role for the immune system in supporting FMT using a murine C. difficile infection system. Following FMT, Rag1 heterozygote mice resolve C. difficile while littermate Rag1 -/- mice fail to clear the infection. Targeted ablation of adaptive immune cell subsets reveal a necessary role for CD4 + Foxp3 + T-regulatory cells, but not B cells or CD8 + T cells, in FMT-mediated resolution of C. difficile infection. FMT non-responsive mice exhibit exacerbated inflammation, impaired engraftment of the FMT bacterial community and failed restoration of commensal bacteria-derived secondary bile acid metabolites in the large intestine. These data demonstrate that the host's inflammatory immune status can limit the efficacy of microbiota-based therapeutics to treat C. difficile infection.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation across the lifespan: balancing efficacy, safety, and innovation [^111MPNyv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a rapidly growing therapy aimed at reconstituting the dysbiotic microbiota of a patient with the beneficial stool microbiota of a healthy individual. The efficacy rates of FMT are very robust for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection in both children and adults. Although complications of FMT have been reported, it is generally believed to be a safe procedure. Novel indications for FMT are being studied, with the hope that ultimately it may be useful for a variety of disorders. As this field continues to grow, however, it is necessary to consider efficacy, safety, and innovation across the lifespan. There are unique concerns regarding FMT as it pertains to children, adults, and the elderly. In this review, we seek to update clinicians, researchers, and regulators on how these factors must be balanced across the lifespan as we move forward with this innovative therapy.

### An ecological framework to understand the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation [^113wEaKU]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Human gut microbiota plays critical roles in physiology and disease. Our understanding of ecological principles that govern the dynamics and resilience of this highly complex ecosystem remains rudimentary. This knowledge gap becomes more problematic as new approaches to modifying this ecosystem, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), are being developed as therapeutic interventions. Here we present an ecological framework to understand the efficacy of FMT in treating conditions associated with a disrupted gut microbiota, using the recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection as a prototype disease. This framework predicts several key factors that determine the efficacy of FMT. Moreover, it offers an efficient algorithm for the rational design of personalized probiotic cocktails to decolonize pathogens. We analyze data from both preclinical mouse experiments and a clinical trial of FMT to validate our theoretical framework. The presented results significantly improve our understanding of the ecological principles of FMT and have a positive translational impact on the rational design of general microbiota-based therapeutics.

### Fecal microbiota transplant in patients with Clostridium difficile infection: a systematic review [^1146G7tX]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) restores a diverse bacterial profile to the gastrointestinal tract and may effectively treat patients with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of FMT in the treatment of CDI.

Methods

Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane database were used. The authors searched studies with 10 or more patients examining the resolution of symptoms after FMT in patients with CDI. Reviews, letters to the editors, and abstracts were excluded. Participants were patients with CDI. Intervention used was FMT. Quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Results were synthesized using a narrative approach.

Results

Retrospective and uncontrolled prospective cohort studies suggest that FMT is a highly effective therapy for recurrent/refractory CDI, with clinical success rates ranging from 83% to 100%, which is similar to rates published by two randomized controlled trials. Fecal microbiota transplantation may be effectively administered via antegrade (upper gastrointestinal) or retrograde (lower gastrointestinal) routes of delivery. Fecal microbiota transplantation rarely results in major adverse events. However, diarrhea, cramping, and bloating commonly occur and are typically self-limited. Most studies were uncontrolled retrospective studies.

Conclusion

Fecal microbiota transplantation should be considered in patients with recurrent episodes of mild to moderate CDI who have failed conventional antimicrobial therapy. There is insufficient evidence to recommend FMT for the treatment of severe CDI.

Level Of Evidence

Systematic review, level III.

### Prevention and treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection [^112EWRdz]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a significant burden on the health system, especially due to high recurrence rates. Since the beginning of the CDI epidemic in early 2000s, many strategies for combatting recurrence have been explored, with moderate success so far. This review will focus on the most recent developments in recurrent CDI prevention and treatment.

Recent Findings

There are two main mechanisms of CDI recurrence: alteration in microbiome and poor antibody response. Development of new antibiotics aims to minimize damage to the microbiome. Fecal transplant or other microbiome replacement therapies seek to replenish the missing elements in the microbiome. Fecal microbiota transplant is the most effective treatment for prevention of CDI recurrenceso far, but is difficult to standardize and regulate, leading to efforts to develop microbiome-derived therapeutics. A deficiency in developing antibodies to C. difficile toxins is another mechanism of recurrence. Active immunization using toxoid vaccines or passive immunization using mAbs address this aspect.

Summary

There are promising new treatments for recurrent CDI in development. Fecal microbiota transplant remains the most effective therapy for multiply recurrent CDI. New antibiotics, microbiome-derived therapeutics, and immunologic therapies are in development.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation and microbial therapeutics for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection in pediatric patients [^1136vFEv]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the most common cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and has high rates of recurrent disease. As a disease associated with intestinal dysbiosis, gastrointestinal microbiome manipulation and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) have evolved as effective, although relatively unregulated therapeutics and not without safety concerns. FMT for the treatment of CDI has been well studied in adults with increasing data reported in children. In this review, we discuss the current body of literature on the use of FMT in children including effectiveness, safety, risk factors for a failed FMT, and the role of FMT in children with comorbidities. We also review emerging microbial therapeutics for the treatment of rCDI.

### Gaps in knowledge and future directions for the use of faecal microbiota transplant in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease [^111F7o96]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has now been established into clinical guidelines for the treatment of recurrent and refractory Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Its therapeutic application in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is currently at an early stage. To date, there have been four randomized controlled trials for FMT in IBD and a multitude of observational studies. However, significant gaps in our knowledge regarding optimum methods for FMT preparation, technical aspects and logistics of its administration, as well as mechanistic underpinnings, still remain. In this article, we aim to highlight these gaps by reviewing evidence and making key recommendations on the direction of future studies in this field. In addition, we provide an overview of the current evidence of potential mechanisms of FMT in treating IBD.

### Real-world effectiveness of fecal microbiota transplantation for first or second Clostridioides difficile infection [^113iELGt]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is associated with high mortality. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an established treatment for recurrent CDI, but its use for first or second CDI remains experimental. We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of FMT for first or second CDI in a real-world clinical setting.

Methods

This multi-site Danish cohort study included patients with first or second CDI treated with FMT from June 2019 to February 2023. The primary outcome was cure of C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) 8 weeks after the last FMT treatment. Secondary outcomes included CDAD cure 1 and 8 weeks after the first FMT treatment and 90-day mortality following positive C. difficile test.

Results

We included 467 patients, with 187 (40%) having their first CDI. The median patient age was 73 years (interquartile range [IQR], 58–82 years). Notably, 167 (36%) had antibiotic-refractory CDI, 262 (56%) had severe CDI, and 89 (19%) suffered from fulminant CDI. Following the first FMT treatment, cure of CDAD was achieved in 353 patients (76%; 95% confidence interval, 71%-79%) at week 1. At week 8, 255 patients (55%; 95% CI, 50%-59%) maintained sustained effect. In patients without initial effect, repeated FMT treatments led to an overall cure of CDAD in 367 patients (79%; 95% CI, 75%-82%). The 90-day mortality was 10% (95% CI, 8%-14%).

Conclusion

Repeated FMT treatments demonstrate high effectiveness in managing patients with first or second CDI. Forwarding FMT in CDI treatment guidelines could improve patient survival.

Clinicaltrials

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for Clostridium difficile infection: benefits and barriers [^113i9DLc]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The incidence and severity of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) have increased worldwide in the past two decades. A principal function of the gut microbiota is to protect the intestine against colonization by exogenous pathogens. Increasingly, the gut microbiota have been shown to influence susceptibility to other genetic and environmentally acquired conditions. Transplantation of healthy donor fecal material in patients with CDI may re-establish the normal composition of the gut microbiota and has been shown to be effective in recurrent CDI. We intend to review the most recent data on fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and critically discuss potential advantages and handicaps of this new therapeutic approach.

Recent Findings

Evidence from case series and only one randomized clinical trial suggests that FMT is able to restore the wide diversity of microflora, improve C. difficile-related symptoms and prevent CDI recurrence.

Summary

FMT is a promising treatment option for serious and recurrent CDI, and current evidence (although weak) demonstrates consistent and excellent efficacy in clinical outcomes. However, many questions should be answered before it may be recommended as routine standard treatment. Mechanisms of action need to be better understood. Long-term follow-up studies are needed to determine long-lasting effects (including the association with autoimmune diseases).

### Critical care management of the patient with Clostridioides difficile [^117HhFmH]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To review published clinical evidence on management of Clostridioides difficile infection in critically ill patients.

Data Sources

We obtained relevant studies from a PubMed literature review and bibliographies of reviewed articles.

Study Selection

We selected English-language studies addressing aspects of C. difficile infection relevant to critical care clinicians including epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, with a focus on high-quality clinical evidence.

Data Extraction

We reviewed potentially relevant studies and abstracted information on study design, methods, patient selection, and results of relevant studies. This is a synthetic (i.e., not systematic) review.

Data Synthesis

C. difficile infection is the most common healthcare-associated infection in the United States. Antibiotics are the most significant C. difficile infection risk factor, and among antibiotics, cephalosporins, clindamycin, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, and piperacillin-tazobactam confer the highest risk. Age, diabetes mellitus, inflammatory bowel disease, and end-stage renal disease are risk factors for C. difficile infection development and mortality. C. difficile infection diagnosis is based on testing appropriately selected patients with diarrhea or on clinical suspicion for patients with ileus. Patients with fulminant disease (C. difficile infection with hypotension, shock, ileus, or megacolon) should be treated with oral vancomycin and IV metronidazole, as well as rectal vancomycin in case of ileus. Patients who do not respond to initial therapy should be considered for fecal microbiota transplant or surgery. Proper infection prevention practices decrease C. difficile infection risk.

Conclusions

Strong clinical evidence supports limiting antibiotics when possible to decrease C. difficile infection risk. For patients with fulminant C. difficile infection, oral vancomycin reduces mortality, and adjunctive therapies (including IV metronidazole) and interventions (including fecal microbiota transplant) may benefit select patients. Several important questions remain regarding fulminant C. difficile infection management, including which patients benefit from fecal microbiota transplant or surgery.

### Gaps in knowledge and future directions for the use of faecal microbiota transplant in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease [^112jegQK]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The potential role of faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has been explored in the treatment of a multitude of diseases, both gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI, structural and functional in nature. A significant proportion of the initial evidence for its efficacy was derived from observational studies, primarily in recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). – Despite the small size and heterogeneity of early studies, the consistently positive findings led to randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which confirmed the therapeutic role of FMT for this indication. It is recognized that distinctive alterations of both the composition and function of the gut microbiota characterize other GI diseases as well as other non-GI conditions. In particular, some of the initial evidence for its utility in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) came from subgroup analysis of RCTs of CDI and a handful of observational studies. – Although we may be able to translate our knowledge around principles and methodology from FMT studies in CDI, there are specific uncertainties and challenges for the therapeutic use of FMT for IBD that need to be addressed. In this review, we aim to summarize the current gaps in our knowledge regarding FMT in IBD from a clinical and mechanistic perspective, and to highlight potential areas to target and optimize in future studies.

### Host immunity modulates the efficacy of microbiota transplantation for treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection [^1146JxGY]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The microbiota, consisting of the community of bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoa organisms that inhabit a mammalian host, can impact susceptibility to a range of diseases including cancer, diabetes, allergy, obesity, and infection –. An altered or dysbiotic intestinal microbiota is observed in all of these disease states suggesting that resetting the intestinal microbiota with a composition of bacteria from healthy individuals could treat disease. This theory is supported by animal studies demonstrating alleviation of disease through transplantation of bacteria into the diseased host's intestinal tract –. Significant advancements have been made in defining the community of microbial species that are important in supporting human health –. Translating these findings into viable microbiota-based therapies has had limited success in the clinic, however, and is not yet considered a treatment option for most diseases impacted by microbial dysbiosis. One notable exception is the use of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to treat recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection. FMT treatment of C. difficile infection is the first microbiota-based therapy clinically proven to ameliorate disease. Before such treatment strategies can be broadly implemented, the underlying principles determining success for microbiota-based therapy need to be elucidated.

C. difficile, a gram positive, spore-forming, obligate anaerobe is currently the most common nosocomial infection encountered by hospitalized patients, with nearly a half million patients infected and an estimated 13,000–30,000 deaths annually in the United States alone –. This opportunistic pathogen infects the large intestine following perturbation of the intestinal microbiota. Vancomycin or fidaxomicin are first line treatment options that effectively target the vegetative form of C. difficile, but fail to resolve the underlying condition that promotes infection, a dysbiotic microbiota. Recurrence of C. difficile infection due to repeated failed antibiotic treatments is estimated as high as 25–35% and can cause potentially lethal fulminant colitis. The high recurrence rate following standard antibiotic treatment has spurred the development of new treatment modalities such as FMT. In 2013, the first controlled, double-blinded study reported the superior efficacy of FMT compared to antibiotics in treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection. Subsequent studies demonstrate FMT has an 80–90% cure rate in individuals and this treatment option is now incorporated as standard care for recurrent disease in both Europe and the United States –.

### Host immunity modulates the efficacy of microbiota transplantation for treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection [^11593NNZ]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Results

FMT mediated clearance of C. difficile infection resolves intestinal inflammation

Fecal microbiota transplantation is a proven treatment for recurrent C. difficile disease, however, whether the host's immune system contributes to FMT-mediated resolution of C. difficile is unknown. To address this question, we first established a murine model of C. difficile infection followed by FMT treatment (Fig. 1a). Similar to previous reports in both mice and humans, FMT reduced C. difficile burden and toxin levels in the large intestine of persistently infected C57BL/6 mice to below the limit of detection while sham PBS treatment did not impact C. difficile burden (Supplementary Fig. 1A, B). By day 10 post-FMT, recipient mice had resolved C. difficile infection-driven intestinal inflammation characterized by immune cell infiltration, submucosa edema (Supplementary Fig. 1C), large intestine crypt elongation (Supplementary Fig. 1D), and elevated mRNA expression of proinflammatory genes in the proximal colon (Supplementary Fig. 1E). These data establish that FMT can indirectly shape intestinal immune homeostasis via resolution C. difficile infection and provoke further investigation into the role of the immune system in supporting FMT-mediated C. difficile resolution.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for Clostridium difficile infection: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114GZGgV]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The clinical and economic burden of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is significant. Recurrent CDI management has emerged as a major challenge with suboptimal response to standard therapy. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been used as a treatment to reconstitute the normal microbial homeostasis and break the cycle of antibiotic agents that may further disrupt the microbiome. Given the lack of randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) and limitations in previous systematic reviews, we aimed to conduct a systematic review with robust methods to determine the efficacy and safety profile of FMT in CDI.

Methods

An electronic search was conducted using MEDLINE (1946-March 2012), EMBASE (1974-March 2012) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2012). The search strategy was not limited by language. Abstract data were excluded and only completed studies that underwent the full, rigorous peer-review process were included. Studies that used FMT via any delivery modality for laboratory or endoscopically proven CDI with clinical resolution as primary outcome were included. A sample size of 10 or more patients was a further criterion. Elements of the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination checklist and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence quality assessment for case series checklist were employed to determine study quality. Eligibility assessment and data extraction were performed by two independent researchers. Both unweighted pooled resolution rates (UPR) and weighted pooled resolution rates (WPR) were calculated with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for overall studies, as well as predefined subgroups.

Results

Eleven studies with a total of 273 CDI patients treated with FMT were identified; no RCTs were found as none have been published. Two-hundred and forty-five out of 273 patients experienced clinical resolution (UPR 89.7%; WPR 89.1% (95% CI 84 to 93%)). There was no statistically significant heterogeneity between studies (Cochran Q test P = 0.13, I(2) = 33.7%). A priori subgroup analysis suggested that lower gastrointestinal FMT delivery (UPR 91.4%; WPR 91.2% (95% CI 86 to 95%)) led to a trend towards higher clinical resolution rates than the upper gastrointestinal route (UPR 82.3%; WPR 80.6% (95% CI 69–90%)) (proportion difference of WPR was 10.6% (95% CI -0.6 to 22%)). No difference in clinical outcomes was detected between anonymous vs. patient selected donors. There were no reported adverse events associated with FMT and follow-up was variable from weeks to years.

Conclusions

FMT holds considerable promise as a therapy for recurrent CDI but well-designed, RCTs and long-term follow-up registries are still required. These are needed to identify the right patient, efficacy and safety profile of FMT before this approach can be widely advocated.

### Effect of fecal microbiota transplantation on recurrence in multiply recurrent Clostridium difficile infection: a randomized trial [^114vxJXQ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

To date, evidence for the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has been limited to case series and open-label clinical trials.

Objective

To determine the efficacy and safety of FMT for treatment of recurrent CDI.

Design

Randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01703494).

Setting

Two academic medical centers.

Patients

46 patients who had 3 or more recurrences of CDI and received a full course of vancomycin for their most recent acute episode.

Intervention

Fecal microbiota transplantation with donor stool (heterologous) or patient's own stool (autologous) administered by colonoscopy.

Measurements

The primary end point was resolution of diarrhea without the need for further anti-CDI therapy during the 8-week follow-up. Safety data were compared between treatment groups via review of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), and new medical conditions for 6 months after FMT. Fecal microbiota analyses were performed on patients' stool before and after FMT and also on donors' stool.

Results

In the intention-to-treat analysis, 20 of 22 patients (90.9%) in the donor FMT group achieved clinical cure compared with 15 of 24 (62.5%) in the autologous FMT group (P = 0.042). Resolution after autologous FMT differed by site (9 of 10 vs. 6 of 14 [P = 0.033]). All 9 patients who developed recurrent CDI after autologous FMT were free of further CDI after subsequent donor FMT. There were no SAEs related to FMT. Donor FMT restored gut bacterial community diversity and composition to resemble that of healthy donors.

Limitation

The study included only patients who had 3 or more recurrences and excluded those who were immunocompromised and aged 75 years or older.

Conclusion

Donor stool administered via colonoscopy seemed safe and was more efficacious than autologous FMT in preventing further CDI episodes.

### Patients eligible for trials of microbe-based therapeutics Do not represent the population with recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection [^114Kk6XE]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Although there are many industry-funded trials of microbe-based therapeutics for Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile infection (CDI), not all patients are eligible for these trials, due to their strict enrollment criteria. Furthermore, given the widespread availability of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and overwhelming evidence to support its efficacy, patients might refuse enrollment in trials with a placebo group. We analyzed willingness and eligibility of patients with recurrent CDI to participate in randomized controlled trials of microbe-based therapeutic agents.

Methods

We performed a retrospective study of 199 patients referred to 4 tertiary referral centers for treatment of CDI from August 1, 2018 through January 31, 2019. We collected data on eligibility for FMT and enrollment in randomized controlled trials.

Results

Of 130 patients deemed appropriate for FMT, 98 patients (75%) were ineligible for participation in a randomized controlled trial and 16 patients (17%) were eligible but refused to enroll. Immune compromise and inflammatory bowel diseases were the most common reasons for exclusion from trials.

Conclusions

Most patients with CDI who meet the guideline criteria for FMT are ineligible or unwilling to participate in randomized controlled trials of microbe-based therapeutics. Trial populations therefore do not represent the population of patients with CDI.

### Efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent C. difficile infection in inflammatory bowel disease [^116yKwnt]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is associated with poor outcomes in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Data are scarce on efficacy of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) for recurrent CDI in IBD patients.

Methods

We reviewed health records of IBD patients (18 years of age or older) with recurrent CDI who underwent FMT. Outcomes of FMT for CDI were assessed on the basis of symptoms and stool test results.

Results

We included 145 patients (75 women [51.7%]; median age, 46 years). Median IBD duration was 8 (range, 0–47) years, 36.6% had Crohn disease, 61.4% had ulcerative colitis, and 2.1% had indeterminate colitis. Median number of prior CDI episodes was 3 (range, 3–20), and 61.4% had received vancomycin taper. Diarrhea resolved after FMT in 48 patients (33.1%) without further testing. Ninety-five patients (65.5%) underwent CDI testing owing to post-FMT recurrent diarrhea; 29 (20.0%) had positive results. After FMT, 2 patients received empiric treatment of recurrent CDI without symptom resolution, suggesting IBD was the cause of symptoms. The overall cure rate of CDI after FMT was 80.0%, without CDI recurrence at median follow-up of 9.3 (range, 0.1–51) months. Forty-three patients (29.7%) had planned IBD therapy escalation after CDI resolution; none de-escalated or discontinued IBD therapy. Overall, 7.6% had worsening IBD symptoms after FMT that were treated as new IBD flares. No clinical predictors of FMT failure were identified.

Conclusions

Few patients had new IBD flare after FMT. Fecal microbiota transplantation effectively treats recurrent CDI in IBD patients but has no apparent beneficial effect on the IBD course.

### Outcomes of fecal microbiota transplantation for C. difficile infection in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111tZ5ai]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a safe and effective therapy for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Data on FMT for CDI in patients with underlying inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are emerging but conflicting. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to describe the efficacy and safety of FMT for CDI in IBD and its impact on IBD outcomes.

Methods

A systematic search of multiple databases including Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science was performed. Our primary analysis focused on pooled rate of CDI resolution after single and multiple FMTs in IBD patients. Additional analyses included rates of IBD-associated outcomes (flare, surgery, symptom improvement) after FMT. The random-effects model was used to calculate pooled rates.

Results

Among 457 adult patients, 363 had CDI resolution after first FMT with a pooled cure rate of 78% [95% confidence interval (CI): 73%-83%; I2 = 39%]. Overall pooled rate cure rate with single and multiple FMTs was 88% (95% CI: 81%-94%; I2 = 73%). The pooled rate of an IBD flare after FMT was 26.8% (95% CI: 22.5%-31.6%; I2 = 9%) and of colectomy was 7.3% (95% CI: 4.7%-10.5%; I2 = 56%). Among 141 pediatric patients, 106 had CDI resolution after first FMT with pooled cure rate of 78% (95% CI: 58%-93%; I2 = 59%). Overall pooled cure rate with single and multiple FMTs was 77% (95% CI: 50%-96%; I2 = 63%). The pooled rate of an IBD flare after FMT was 10.8% (95% CI: 5.7%-18.5% I2 = 43%), and of colectomy was 10.3% (95% CI: 2.1%-30.2% I2 = 23%).

Conclusions

FMT appears to be a highly effective therapy for preventing recurrent CDI in patients with IBD. Patients who fail a single FMT may benefit from multiple FMTs.

### Evolution of clinical guidelines for antimicrobial management ofinfection [^114kKMFz]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) has been an epidemic for many years. Our biggest challenge in treating CDI is preventing recurrence, which is seen in approximately 25% of patients with initial infection and in 40–60% of those with subsequent episodes. Given the major disease burden of this infection, appropriate data-driven treatment remains essential. Clinical treatment guidelines provide an unbiased critical analysis of the literature, integrating the quality of the available data to make recommendations. As CDI has been evolving and more research has become available, the frequency of guideline issue from various global societies has increased, as has the detail of the recommendations to fit more relevant clinical scenarios. In this review, we will discuss clinical guideline recommendations over three time periods: The Initial Guidelines 1995–1997, The Second Wave 2009–2013, and The Modern Era 2014-present. We see the changing recommendations from metronidazole or vancomycin for initial infection during earlier times to preferential treatment with fidaxomicin within the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) joint guidelines provisional update in late 2020. The recommended treatments for first recurrence were initially with the same antimicrobial as the first episode but have since changed to having multiple options for one or more recurrences. We have also seen the addition of immune boosting treatments, including fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)/microbiota restoration therapy (MRT) and bezlotoxumab in the more modern recommendations. As the guidelines are evolving with the times, it remains important to understand the differences among them so we can apply this information clinically and optimize patient outcomes.

### Cost-effectiveness of fecal microbiota transplantation for first recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection [^1169fosC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Both the American College of Gastroenterology and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America 2021 Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) guidelines recommend fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for persons with multiple recurrent CDI. Emerging data suggest that FMT may have high cure rates when used for first recurrent CDI. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of FMT for first recurrent CDI.

Methods

We developed a Markov model to simulate a cohort of patients presenting with initial CDI infection. The model estimated the costs, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of different CDI treatment regimens recommended in the 2021 IDSA guidelines, with the additional option of FMT for first recurrent CDI. The model includes stratification by the severity of initial infection, estimates of cure, recurrence, and mortality. Data sources were taken from IDSA guidelines and published literature on treatment outcomes. Outcome measures were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).

Results

When FMT is available for first recurrent CDI, the optimal cost-effective treatment strategy is fidaxomicin for initial nonsevere CDI, vancomycin for initial severe CDI, and FMT for first and subsequent recurrent CDI, with an ICER of $27 135/QALY. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis at a $100 000 cost-effectiveness threshold, FMT for first and subsequent CDI recurrence was cost-effective 90% of the time given parameter uncertainty.

Conclusions

FMT is a cost-effective strategy for first recurrent CDI. Prospective evaluation of FMT for first recurrent CDI is warranted to determine the efficacy and risk of recurrence.

### Oral fecal microbiota transplant capsules are safe and effective for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112yViAA]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Goals

We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis to examine the efficacy and safety of oral fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) capsules for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI).

Background

FMT through colonoscopy is established as effective and safe in treating multiple recurrences of CDI, but consensus has not been established on delivery through oral capsules.

Study

A systematic literature search was performed with multiple databases including MEDLINE and EMBASE to identify original studies including at least 10 patients that investigated the role of oral FMT capsules to treat rCDI. Cure rates were pooled by a random effects model and publication bias was assessed with the Egger test. Secondary analyses assessed for differences between capsule preparation (frozen vs. lyophilized stool) and delivery modality (capsule vs. colonoscopy).

Results

Fifteen studies (12 case series and 3 randomized controlled trials) encompassing 763 patients were identified for inclusion. Significant variability existed in baseline patient characteristics and protocols. Meta-analysis of proportions showed efficacy of oral FMT capsules to be 0.821 (95% confidence interval: 0.762–0.874). No evidence for publication bias was found (P = 0.51). Secondary analyses did not find significant differences in efficacy. Fourteen adverse events leading to death or hospitalization were noted, none of which were attributed to FMT.

Conclusions

Oral FMT capsules for rCDI are promising because of ease of administration and noninvasive delivery. We found an overall efficacy of 82.1% with a low rate of serious adverse events. Further studies are needed to optimize protocols and outcomes.

### Development of fecal microbiota transplantation suitable for mainstream medicine [^111oraeW]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Fecal microbiota transplantation has emerged as an increasingly common treatment for patients with refractory Clostridium difficile infection. Although it can be relatively simple to perform, a number of challenges need to be overcome before this procedure is widely accepted in mainstream clinical practice. Most of the solutions to these challenges already exist, but some need further optimization and testing. Standardized fecal microbiota is being developed as a therapeutic agent, although it clearly challenges some of the existing paradigms of drug development, delivery, and regulation.

### Guidance on preparing an investigational new drug application for fecal microbiota transplantation studies [^113rxy7q]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective treatment for Clostridium difficile infections that are refractory to antibiotic therapy. Because of the important roles of the microbiota in the function of the gastrointestinal tract and other aspects of human physiology, there is a growing interest in studying FMT for other clinical indications. The US Food and Drug Administration regulates clinical studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of FMT. Studies of FMT for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection or other indications could require submission of an investigational new drug application. Most academic physicians and investigators do not have the regulatory experience necessary to undertake this process. We provide guidance to researchers on the preparation and submission of investigational new drug applications to study FMT.

### Effects of lyophilised faecal filtrate compared with lyophilised donor stool on Clostridioides difficile recurrence: a multicentre, randomised, double-blinded, non-inferiority trial [^115CGHf6]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is highly effective in preventing recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection. However, it is not known whether live microbes are necessary in mediating FMT efficacy. This study aims to determine whether lyophilised sterile faecal filtrate (LSFF), free of live bacteria, is non-inferior to lyophilised donor stool (LFMT) in efficacy.

Methods

This multicentre, randomised, double-blinded, non-inferiority trial was done at four academic centres in Canada. Eligible patients were adults aged 18 years or older with recurrent C difficile infection (at least two recurrences). Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1 using a prespecified computer-generated randomisation list with permutation blocks of 2 and 4, stratified by age > 65 years or < 65 years) to receive oral LSFF or LFMT. Each treatment dose consisted of 15 capsules that appeared identical. Participants and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants without recurrent C difficile infection (absence of more than three Bristol type 6 or 7 bowel movements per 24 h persisting more than 2 consecutive days) at 8 weeks. Analysis was done in the per protocol population, in which participants with unknown outcome status at 8 weeks due to death or loss to follow-up were excluded. Non-inferiority was established if the lower bound of the one-sided 95% CI for the difference in proportions of participants without recurrent C difficile between the LSFF and LFMT groups was above the non-inferiority margin of -10%. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03806803, and is complete.

Findings

Between March 27, 2019, and Nov 6, 2023, we assessed 409 patients for eligibility. 271 were excluded and the remaining 138 were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive LSFF (n = 72) or LFMT (n = 66). Participants' mean age was 61·2 years (SD 18·6); 91 (66%) of 138 patients were women and 47 (34%) were male. 127 participants (92%) were White. 130 (94%) of 138 participants completed the trial. At the planned interim analysis, 47 (65%) of 72 participants in the LSFF group and 57 (88%) of 65 participants in the LFMT group did not have C difficile recurrence at 8 weeks (difference -23%, one-sided 95% CI -33·8% to infinity; p = 0·96). Given the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -10%, non-inferiority of LSFF to LFMT could not be established and the study was terminated at the recommendation of the data safety monitoring board. Serious adverse events included one death (LFMT group) and five hospitalisations (four unrelated, one possibly related to interventions [LSFF group]). One event occurred before treatment and all others 2–20 weeks after study intervention. The most common adverse events were abdominal discomfort (48 [67%] of 72 patients in the LSFF group and 36 (55%) of 66 patients in the LFMT group) and nausea (13 [18%] in the LSFF group and 21 [32%] in LFMT group).

Interpretation

Among adults with recurrent C difficile infection, non-inferiority of LSFF to LFMT was not established for the prevention of recurrent C difficile infection over 8 weeks, supporting the crucial role of live microbes in mediating clinical efficacy.

### Safety and efficacy of encapsulated fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection: a systematic review [^117FhBHg]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) has been shown to be effective for the treatment of recurrent clostridium difficile infection (CDI). The efficacy and safety of freeze-dried encapsulated FMT for the treatment of recurrent CDI is unclear. We performed a systematic review to evaluate and analyze the current evidence in this respect.

Materials and Methods

A systematic literature search was performed using the PubMed, Embase, and Medline databases until December 2017 to identify all original studies that investigated the role of administration of encapsulated FMT in recurrent CDI. The study included patients of all ages. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed the quality of publications; a third investigator resolved any discrepancies.

Results

A total of six studies, five case series and one randomized-controlled trial, were included in this review. Overall, 341 patients completed treatment with encapsulated FMT. Only three major adverse events were reported and no deaths occurred directly related to FMT. In all, 285 patients responded to the first treatment, with no recurrence during the specified follow-up period set to meet the primary endpoint. Forty-two patients underwent a second treatment, with resolution of symptoms in 28 patients. At least five patients were reported to undergo a third treatment, with resolution in three of them. Only one patient was reported to have received four treatments without long-term resolution of symptoms.

Conclusion

Low-quality to moderate-quality evidence showed that encapsulated FMT is safe and cost-effective for the treatment and prevention of recurrent CDI. Its efficacy is not inferior to FMT performed through the nonoral route. Randomized-controlled trials are necessary to compare its efficacy with oral antimicrobial drugs and also to evaluate the potential adverse effects associated with the treatment.

### Expert opinion on fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment ofinfection and beyond [^113ZJUPi]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a procedure involving transfer of stool from a healthy donor into the intestinal tract of a diseased recipient to restore intestinal microbial composition and functionality. FMT's tremendous success in recurrent and refractory Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) catalyzed gut microbiota research and opened the door to microbiome-based therapy for various gastrointestinal and other disorders. Areas covered: We used PubMed search engine to identify significant publications in the field of CDI and FMT. Here we present an overview of the current literature on FMT's use for recurrent, non-severe, severe, and fulminant CDI and on promising future application. Expert opinion: FMT as the best tool for treatment of antibiotic-refractory CDI has gained immense popularity over the last decade. The future of gut microbiota-based therapy should include oral formulations that contain well-described ingredients in effective doses, clear mechanism of action, and excellent safety profile.

### Resolution rates in clinical trials for microbiota restoration for recurrentinfection: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^113jonvA]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the most common healthcare-associated infection in the United States with over 50% of patients developing recurrences after two or more episodes. Microbiota replacement therapy (MRT) is used to treat recurrent CDI by restoring a healthy gut microbiome. Guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America recommend MRT after appropriate antibiotic treatment after two or more CDI recurrences in patients who have failed appropriate antibiotic treatments.

The efficacy of MRT for recurrent CDI in observational studies is more than 85% but efficacy in controlled clinical trials appears to be lower. Our 2017 meta-analysis showed an overall cure rate of 76% in clinical trial settings with efficacy being lower (67%) in trials with a comparator group compared to open-label trials. Most trials included in that meta-analysis had different methodologies including recurrent CDI diagnostic and inclusion criteria, MRT preparations, and comparator group leading to a significant heterogeneity. These inconsistencies have resulted in limiting the generalizability of these results and pose a caution in positioning MRT as a therapy for CDI.

Since the earlier systematic review and meta-analysis, more evidence from trials regarding use of MRT has emerged. These have included phase III trials of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and standardized live biotherapeutics for recurrent CDI. We performed an updated meta-analysis with the latest evidence to reassess the efficacy of microbiota restoration in clinical trials.

### Adverse events in fecal microbiota transplantation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116aSGJN]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

The primary challenge faced by our review was the determination of SAE causality. The process for determining whether or not to attribute an adverse event to FMT was based on each study's own standards. An area that highlights this difficulty is the unclear causality of inflammatory bowel disease flares and FMT. While some studies listed this as a sequela of FMT, others ruled it to be unrelated. An additional challenge was the mild inconsistency in several of the measured outcomes. This can probably be attributed to the heterogeneous patient populations and study protocols. Similarly, the average duration of follow up varied widely, as did symptom reporting. Missing data on demographics, method of stool transplantation, volume and amount of stool, and relationships of donor and recipients were also common.

This study, despite its limitations, demonstrated that FMT is a largely safe procedure. As the understanding of the effects of the fecal microbiome expands, causal relationships with new adverse events and long-term sequelae of FMT may continue to be discovered. Nevertheless, our current knowledge of both related and unrelated SAEs indicates that FMT should be a therapy strongly considered for patients with recurrent CDI.

This meta-analysis supports FMT as a safe option for treating recurrent CDI. While the short-term safety of fecal microbiota transplantation for treating recurrent CDI is promising from our meta-analysis, the potential long-term consequences of altering a patient's gut microbiota are not fully known. Future randomized trials are needed to improve our current understanding of FMT safety and further clarify the improvements in the quality of life of patients treated with FMT compared to standard antibiotic therapy.

Summary Box

What is already known:

● Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly efficacious procedure used in the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection
● A residual concern in the integration of FMT is concerns about the safety of the procedure
● Published studies have struggled with heterogeneous protocols that display various durations of follow up

What the new findings are:

● Our analysis shows a very low pooled rate of significant adverse events related to FMT, in total less than 1%, despite a significant portion of patients being immunocompromised or having underlying gastrointestinal conditions
● The pooled rate of minor adverse events was also relatively rare, and were most commonly diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting
● Further high-quality randomized control trials are necessary to evaluate the longer-term safety of FMT and its impact on quality of life

### Adverse events of fecal microbiota transplantation: a meta-analysis of high-quality studies [^113nfxL3]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has shown excellent efficacy in treating Clostridioides difficile infection, as well as promise in several other diseases. The heightened interest is accompanied by concerns over adverse events (AE) and safety. To further understand that in FMT, we performed a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis of high-quality, prospective randomized controlled trials FMT.

Methods

Studies were selected based on predefined exclusion criteria and were assessed for quality. Only prospective, randomized, controlled studies of high quality were included in the final analysis. Data were extracted on demographics, AE, indication, delivery method and follow-up duration.

Results

Out of 334 articles reviewed, 9 high quality studies with 756 FMTs were selected for final analysis. The pooled rate of AE was 39.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.19–0.642) as they were reported by 112 patients who received FMT. The SAE rate was 5.3% (95%CI 3.1–8.8%). The most common AE reported was abdominal pain, followed by diarrhea. The most common SAE was Clostridium difficile infection. Upper gastrointestinal tract delivery was associated with a higher rate of total AE, but not SAE.

Conclusions

Based on the selected studies, the AE rate of FMT is 39.3%, with most AE being mild and self-limiting. SAE were uncommon at 5.3%, and many were only possibly related to the FMT. Adherence to standardized reporting of AE as well as longitudinal studies and registries will help further clarify the safety of FMT in the future.

### Clostridioides difficile infections; new treatments and future perspectives [^116jBRGS]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

FAECAL MICROBIOTA TRANSPLANTATION

Primary insights into the efficacy of gut microbiota restoration came from faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments, where the delivery of minimally manipulated faeces from a healthy donor to a recipient with recurrent CDI can restore colonization resistance leading to clinical cure rates of 76.1%. The mechanisms underpinning the efficacy of FMT are largely unknown but likely to be multifactorial, combining the restoration of microbial diversity and the metabolic landscape. Bile acids have been shown to affect C. difficile germination and vegetative cell growth; therefore, restoration of bile acid metabolism through the reconstitution of bile salt hydrolases has been implicated in FMT efficacy. FMT has been recommended to treat multiply recurrent CDI (second or subsequent recurrence) after treatment with either fidaxomicin or vancomycin. More recent studies have demonstrated a potential role for FMT in treating a first or second CDI episode, severe and severe-complicated CDI. Despite the efficacy of FMT against recurrent CDI, safety concerns have been raised over the potential transmission of pathogens after the transfer of an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli resulted in recipient fatalities. With the gut microbiota being linked to other extra-intestinal diseases, the application of an undefined microbiota could have unknown long-term health implications, highlighting the need for standardized procedures for screening and processing and a move towards a more defined and characterized intervention. In 2022–2023, the US Food and Drug Administration authorized two first-in-class live biotherapeutics for the treatment of recurrent CDI.

### Evolution of clinical guidelines for antimicrobial management ofinfection [^113bv8ST]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) has been an epidemic for many years. Our biggest challenge in treating CDI is preventing recurrence, which is seen in approximately 25% of patients with initial infection and in 40–60% of those with subsequent episodes. Given the major disease burden of this infection, appropriate data-driven treatment remains essential. Clinical treatment guidelines provide an unbiased critical analysis of the literature, integrating the quality of the available data to make recommendations. As CDI has been evolving and more research has become available, the frequency of guideline issue from various global societies has increased, as has the detail of the recommendations to fit more relevant clinical scenarios. In this review, we will discuss clinical guideline recommendations over three time periods: The Initial Guidelines 1995–1997, The Second Wave 2009–2013, and The Modern Era 2014–present. We see the changing recommendations from metronidazole or vancomycin for initial infection during earlier times to preferential treatment with fidaxomicin within the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) joint guidelines provisional update in late 2020. The recommended treatments for first recurrence were initially with the same antimicrobial as the first episode but have since changed to having multiple options for one or more recurrences. We have also seen the addition of immune boosting treatments, including fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)/microbiota restoration therapy (MRT) and bezlotoxumab in the more modern recommendations. As the guidelines are evolving with the times, it remains important to understand the differences among them so we can apply this information clinically and optimize patient outcomes.

### Systematic review with meta-analysis: encapsulated faecal microbiota transplantation-evidence for clinical efficacy [^115uNH9b]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background:

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI) and is being applied experimentally in other diseases. Encapsulated administration may be equivalent in efficacy to delivery through other routes.

Methods:

A systematic review was undertaken of studies using encapsulated FMT up to 26 October 2020. Data on indication, clinical outcomes, safety, treatment protocol and capsule preparation were collected and reported. Pooled rates of clinical efficacy in rCDI were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. The impact of single variables on clinical efficacy was evaluated using univariate meta-regression.

Results:

A total of 35 studies reporting the treatment of 960 patients with encapsulated FMT for eight different indications met the inclusion criteria. Most studies (n = 18, 51%) and patients (n = 755, 79%) were from studies on rCDI. Cure rates after single and multiple courses of treatments with encapsulated FMT in rCDI were 85% (95% CI: 82%-88%) and 93% (95% CI: 88%-96%) respectively. The treatment outcome was not significantly affected by dose, number of delivered capsules, anaerobic/aerobic processing, single/multi-donor treatment, lyophilisation, or any other single factor in the production or delivery of encapsulated FMT. Promising but non-comparable results from the treatment of ulcerative colitis and multidrug-resistant organisms were reported.

Conclusions:

Encapsulated FMT is an effective and safe treatment of rCDI, with cure rates comparable to FMT delivered through other routes. The treatment is effective despite variations in donor screening, preparation and treatment protocol. For other indications, the role of FMT capsules is still not sufficiently examined, although some studies show promising results.

Plain Language Summary

Transfer of faecal material through capsules in the treatment of various diseases. Evidence for clinical efficacy

The bacteria and other microorganisms of the gut is different in patient with various diseases in comparison with healthy subjects.

Therefore, ways to change the microorganisms of the gut in a beneficial direction has been the subject of various research projects within recent years.

Faecal microbiota transplantation often referred as FMT is a method of transferring microorganisms from healthy donors to patients with various diseases and is seen as one way to change the microbial community of the gut in a beneficial direction.

Faecal microbiota transplantation can be performed in different ways such as through endoscopy, enemas or capsules. The transfer through capsules is preferred by the patients and has advantages since it can be administered long-term and can be delivered to the patients in their home. In this paper, we evaluated all accessible research reporting treatment with encapsulated faecal microbiota transplantation in the treatment of various diseases. We report the following major findings:

-Treatment with capsules is safe when guidelines for screening donors and testing faecal material is followed.

-The treatment is highly effective in the treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection, a disease with high mortality often caused by repeated antibiotic treatments. The treatment was effective in 596 of 723 patients following one course of capsule treatment.

-Faecal microbiota transplantation delivered through capsules is as effective as treatment delivered through other routes in the treatment of C. difficile infection.

-The treatment is effective in the treatment of C. difficile infection across studies and countries, despite great differences in the ways the capsules were prepared and delivered.

-Increasing the amount of faecal material used in the production did not affect the efficacy of the treatment.

-There are promising results in the treatment of other diseases such as liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease and the treatment of multi-drug resistant bacteria.

### Clostridioides difficile: treating sustained antibiotic responders with fecal microbiota transplantation does not improve efficacy [^112vR4qq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

 — Drekonja et al describe a randomized placebo-controlled trial with lyophilized fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) capsules to prevent recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI). We believe the results should be interpreted cautiously due to trial design aspects, such as the exclusion criteria and primary endpoint.

Patients with rCDI face high morbidity and mortality, are notoriously difficult to treat with antibiotics alone, and often require additional therapies such as FMT. Given the high risk of rapid recurrence, current guidelines recommend initiating FMT within 4 days after completing antibiotic treatment for rCDI.

Inclusion in the trial required successful antibiotic treatment of rCDI and no signs of recurrence 2–14 days after antibiotics completion. This made patients with refractory disease or early recurrence ineligible, and 2563 (87%) of 2931 potential participants were not included. This likely caused a serious selection bias that severely limits the generalizability of the results. In essence, the study reports the effect of FMT versus placebo in a small subset of patients responding to antibiotics and without early recurrence. If patients had been included regardless of their response to antibiotics or symptom recurrence following its cessation, the results would reflect real-world clinical practice and would have provided valuable data for comparing FMT and placebo for recurrence prevention. The conclusion might even have aligned with the multiple previous studies demonstrating the superiority of FMT.

The primary endpoint was definite or possible rCDI or death within 56 days of randomization. While we agree with the authors that a pragmatic study with patient-centered outcomes is desirable, we find the broad definition of possible recurrence problematic. This definition included all patients with symptoms (diarrhea) regardless of test results, and also patients with no stool samples and patients with negative tests using both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) toxin tests.

Factors such as FMT dosing, processing, and donor potentially influenced the observed outcomes. The dosing regimen of 5 FMT capsules administered once was much lower than in previous studies. Unlike most studies using frozen FMT capsules, this study used lyophilized FMT capsules, highlighting the need to evaluate new processing methods. The study included only 4 donors, and if the fecal donations of only 1 or 2 of these were associated with low cure rates, this could contribute to the lack of efficacy.

### Clostridioides difficile: treating sustained antibiotic responders with fecal microbiota transplantation does not improve efficacy [^1168LyNy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

In short, the trial population does not reflect most patients with rCDI. The study investigates the use of FMT in the small subset of patients with a sustained response to antibiotics — a response that clinicians have no chance of reliably predicting. We find the trial incomparable to previous randomized controlled trials and literature that included all patients regardless of antibiotic response. Clinical decisions to minimize recurrence risk should necessarily be made during and not after acute antibiotics therapy. Given the severity of rCDI, this includes considering timely FMT as an exit strategy. The present study should not change clinical guidelines as the existing literature establishes FMT as the most effective treatment of rCDI.

### Adverse events in fecal microbiota transplantation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1129p6Xw]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) has emerged as a significant cause of human morbidity and mortality. It is now estimated that CDI has an incidence up to 32.6 per 100,000 person-years, with a direct care cost of $4.8 billion per year in the United States alone. This gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobe is the most common cause of pseudomembranous colitis — a condition characterized by intractable diarrhea with the formation of intestinal pseudomembranes of cellular material in the colon. As a result of these physical characteristics, as well as the development of multidrug resistance, the challenge of effectively treating CDI continues to grow.

Given the prevalence and increasing antibiotic resistance of CDI, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is emerging as an exciting alternative to antibiotic therapies in preventing recurrent and complicated CDI. Since its initial implementation, the frequency of use has grown significantly. Current guidelines recommend FMT for patients with multiple recurrences of antibiotic-treated CDI. Accurate study of FMT is challenging, given the heterogeneity of administration protocols. One issue that arises is the variation in stool preparation — studies have described usage of both fresh and frozen stool, various sources of stool (family, pooled, or standardized preparation), and inconsistent donor and stool screening protocols. An additional challenge has been the quality of these studies; many of the randomized controlled trials that have compared FMT to antibiotic therapy have limited follow up as well as antibiotic protocols not within the standard of care. Regardless, FMT has been shown to be of comparable efficacy to standard medical management. Evidence regarding its efficacy with various routes of administration shows inconsistent results, but has widely demonstrated significant efficacy.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of Clostridioides difficile infection [^111kLfgk]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2021). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection — Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) indications, delivery, efficacy, and safety are as follows: In general, conventional antibiotic treatment should be used for at least 2 recurrences (ie, 3 CDI episodes) before offering fecal microbiota transplantation, and randomized, controlled trials have shown similar CDI cure rates after fecal transplants performed with fresh and frozen fecal samples. Although a number of methods of administration have been described, the most common transplant delivery route is via colonoscopy; however, oral capsules were found to be noninferior to colonoscopic delivery for preventing recurrent infection, and overall success rates for fecal transplantation, regardless of the delivery mode, are reported to be between 60% and 90% after a single treatment. A small, randomized, controlled trial compared primary fecal transplant (n = 9) with metronidazole therapy (n = 11) and suggested that transplant may be an alternative to antibiotics in this setting. There have been recent reports of fecal transplantation transmitting infectious agents, and prospective donors should be screened for colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms in addition to more typical infections; furthermore, in June 2019, in response to 2 fecal transplant-related deaths in immunosuppressed patients, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a warning detailing the importance of obtaining proper patient consent, including a discussion regarding risks related to the therapy.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation: the evolving risk landscape [^112jB6JA]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been recommended in clinical guidelines for the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). However, it is considered investigational by most regulatory agencies. As the adoption of FMT has increased from a small group of CDI experts alone to more widespread use, there has been a corresponding increase in concern regarding potential risk. FMT is largely considered a safe procedure although risks described range from mild gastrointestinal symptoms to serious infection. Currently, there is variability in how "FMT" is characterized specifically regarding testing approach, which, in turn, impacts the risk profile. This has been highlighted by the rare cases of multidrug-resistant organisms, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia and enteropathogenic E. coli, recently reported, where these organisms were not screened. These cases have prompted additional screening mandates from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has maintained its policy of enforcement discretion for the use of FMT for CDI not responding to standard therapy. Here, we examine the evolving risk landscape of FMT.

### The current landscape and lessons from fecal microbiota transplantation for inflammatory bowel disease: past, present, and future [^113rqKJ3]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has changed the standard of care for Clostridium difficile infection. However, there is limited data focusing on efficacy and safety profile of FMT in patients with C. difficile infection with underlying inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including the risk of IBD flare. Recently, there is also emerging evidence supporting the role of FMT to treat IBD including promising randomized trials in ulcerative colitis. However, with heterogeneity across these studies, the clinical application of this emerging therapy has yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we aim to review the current landscape of this rapidly developing field, mapping the efficacy and safety of FMT (1) to treat C. difficile infection in patients with IBD, (2) to treat underlying IBD, and (3) outline ongoing clinical trials and the future of the microbiome space.

###: diagnosis and treatments [^115w4AKC]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium) is a major cause of healthcare associated diarrhea, and is increasingly present in the community. Historically, C difficile infection was considered easy to diagnose and treat. Over the past two decades, however, diagnostic techniques have changed in line with a greater understanding of the physiopathology of C difficile infection and the use of new therapeutic molecules. The evolution of diagnosis showed there was an important under- and misdiagnosis of C difficile infection, emphasizing the importance of algorithms recommended by European and North American infectious diseases societies to obtain a reliable diagnosis. Previously, metronidazole was considered the reference drug to treat C difficile infection, but more recently vancomycin and other newer drugs are shown to have higher cure rates. Recurrence of infection represents a key parameter in the evaluation of new drugs, and the challenge is to target the right population with the adapted therapeutic molecule. In multiple recurrences, fecal microbiota transplantation is recommended. New approaches, including antibodies, vaccines, and new molecules are already available or in the pipeline, but more data are needed to support the inclusion of these in practice guidelines. This review aims to provide a baseline for clinicians to understand and stratify their choice in the diagnosis and treatment of C difficile infection based on the most recent data available.

### Host immunity modulates the efficacy of microbiota transplantation for treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection [^115A2ZWo]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Intestinal dysbiosis in C. difficile -infected patients is characterized by a loss of bacterial diversity and altered production of microbiota-derived intestinal metabolites. Successful FMT restores homeostasis both in the intestinal microbial community and metabolome. For example, following FMT, commensal bacteria that convert host-derived primary (1°) bile acids into secondary (2°) bile acids repopulate the large intestine and 2° bile acid pools are restored to levels observed in healthy individuals. The presence of 2° bile acid converting bacteria promotes colonization resistance against C. difficile and restoration of the 2° bile acid pools is associated with successful FMT in recurrent C. difficile -infected patients –. These reports provide evidence that efficacy of the FMT is dependent on the bacterial consortium successfully engrafting in the intestine of the infected host to restore the intestinal microenvironment to pre-infection conditions and create an inhospitable environment for C. difficile. The role of host immune factors in supporting FMT engraftment and subsequent clearance of C. difficile has not been explored and is the focus of this report.

In this study, we demonstrate that multiple strains of immunodeficient mice, all of which lack CD4 + Foxp3 + T-regulatory (T reg) cells, exhibit increased intestinal inflammation compared to immunocompetent mice when persistently infected with C. difficile and fail to resolve infection following FMT. The transplanted bacteria from the FMT inoculum do not completely engraft in the large intestine of FMT non-responsive mice and the intestinal metabolite profile is not restored to pre-infection levels. These data reveal an important role for the host immune system in supporting bacterial engraftment and subsequent resolution of C. difficile infection.

### Factors associated with failure of fecal microbiota transplant for recurrentinfection [^111WsHGq]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile infection (CDI) has emerged as a common antibiotic-associated infection in the United States. With nearly 500,000 American patients diagnosed with CDI annually, implications extend beyond individual health, significantly impacting infection control and healthcare expenditures. – 5%–45% of patients with CDI experience recurrence, and in patients with recurrence, the risk of future recurrent CDIs (rCDI) increases to 60%. – The main mechanism of rCDI is thought to be through decreased microbiome diversity leading to increased susceptibility to relapse or reinfection with C. difficile. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), which aims to restore the physiologic diversity of intestinal microbiota and resist colonization, has emerged as the most effective therapy for rCDI. With success rates of 80%–95%, FMT has revolutionized rCDI treatment; guidelines recommend offering FMT to patients with rCDI who have failed antibiotic treatment.– We have utilized FMT in our dedicated C. difficile clinic, which has outperformed antibiotic treatment, especially in patients who had three or more recurrent episodes.

Despite FMT's high efficacy, FMT remains ineffective in 5%–20% of cases. Prior studies have highlighted potential associations between antidepressant use, cholecystectomy, inpatient status, pseudomembranes, immunocompromised status, and FMT failure, but definitive risk factors for FMT failure remain poorly understood. In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of FMT in the treatment of rCDI and identify factors that may contribute to FMT failure.

### Cost-effectiveness of hospital-at-home and fecal microbiota transplantation in treating older patients with Clostridioides difficile [^115eibKb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a global healthcare challenge that predominantly affects older patients with comorbid conditions. In older patients experiencing their first CDI, 90-day mortality rates are 24%–36%, and these patients face an increased risk of complications and physical decline due to multimorbidity.

CDI imposes a substantial economic burden due to its complications, with hospital-acquired CDI cases typically incurring higher healthcare-related costs than cases without CDI. A significant share of these costs, approximately 37%, is attributed to complications arising from the infection, leading to prolonged hospital stays, readmissions, and additional treatments. In Europe, the annual cost of CDI was estimated at €3 billion in 2019 and is expected to double in the future. This highlights the importance of effective treatment for older patients with CDI to improve survival rates and reduce morbidity rates and costs.

Current European CDI treatment guidelines recommend antibiotic therapy for both the initial infection and the first recurrence. In patients with a second recurrence (ie, ≥ 3 episodes), fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is recommended. FMT has demonstrated high clinical efficacy, reducing the risk of recurrent CDI and mortality rates compared with those in patients treated solely with antibiotics. Independent studies have documented the cost-effectiveness of FMT for CDI compared with antibiotics alone. Despite this, FMT is used in only approximately 10% of eligible patients in Europe.

In a previous randomized clinical trial, the CLODIfrail study, we investigated the effects of an geriatric team intervention tailored to older patients with CDI. This intervention combined hospital-at-home (HaH) care with FMT and consisted of early comprehensive geriatric assessment, frailty evaluation, home visits, assessment for and treatment with FMT, and an 8-week follow-up. Patients who received the geriatric intervention had fewer CDI recurrences and readmissions than patients who received standard care. The intensified use of FMT was a contributing factor. While the CLODIfrail study demonstrated that the intervention was clinically effective, its cost-effectiveness remains to be determined. In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a combined HaH and FMT intervention for older patients with CDI, compared with standard treatment, using data from the CLODIfrail study.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on fecal microbiota-based therapies for select gastrointestinal diseases [^113gqbC5]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in immunocompetent adults — The AGA suggests the use of fecal microbiota–based therapies upon completion of standard of care antibiotics over no fecal microbiota–based therapies (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence), with implementation considerations specific to outpatient, nonsevere, nonfulminant recurrent CDI. Diagnosis requires acute-onset, clinically significant, new-onset diarrhea (eg, 3 or more unformed stools in 24 hours) with appropriate testing, and recurrent CDI is typically defined by a confirmatory positive test within 8 weeks after completing CDI antibiotics. Fecal microbiota–based options include conventional fecal microbiota transplant (FMT), fecal microbiota live-jslm, and fecal microbiota spores live-brpk; prevention can be considered after the second recurrence (third episode) or in select high-risk patients, including those who have recovered from severe, fulminant, or treatment-refractory CDI or who have significant comorbidities, and careful consideration is recommended when frequent or long-term antibiotics are required. For conventional FMT administration, antibiotics for CDI should be stopped 1–3 days beforehand; if a bowel purge is used FMT can be given 1 day after stopping, otherwise allow 3 days off antibiotics, and note that some patients recur within 1–2 days of stopping CDI antibiotics. Conventional FMT should use appropriately screened donor stool, may be delivered via multiple routes with insufficient evidence to recommend a specific route, and reasonable alternatives for those not pursuing fecal microbiota–based therapies include a vancomycin taper, tapered-pulsed fidaxomicin, or bezlotoxumab.

ACG Clinical Guidelines — management of CDI recurrence and prevention specify that we suggest fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) be considered for patients with severe and fulminant CDI refractory to antibiotic therapy, particularly when patients are deemed poor surgical candidates (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). For a first recurrence, we suggest tapering/pulsed dosing of vancomycin be considered after an initial course of fidaxomicin, vancomycin, or metronidazole (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence), and we recommend fidaxomicin for patients experiencing a first recurrence after an initial course of vancomycin or metronidazole (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We recommend patients experiencing their second or further recurrence of CDI be treated with FMT to prevent further recurrences (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We recommend FMT be delivered through colonoscopy or capsules for treatment of recurrent CDI; we suggest delivery by enema if other methods are unavailable (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). We suggest repeat FMT for patients experiencing a recurrence of CDI within 8 wk of an initial FMT (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). For patients with rCDI who are not candidates for FMT, who relapse after FMT, or who require ongoing or frequent courses of antibiotics, suppressive oral vancomycin may be used to prevent further recurrences (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Oral vancomycin prophylaxis may be considered during subsequent systemic antibiotic use in patients with a history of CDI who are at high risk of recurrence to prevent further recurrence (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). We suggest bezlotoxumab be considered for prevention of CDI recurrence in patients who are at high risk of recurrence (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We suggest against discontinuation of antisecretory therapy in patients with CDI, provided there is an appropriate indication for their use (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

### Frozen vs fresh fecal microbiota transplantation and clinical resolution of diarrhea in patients with recurrent Clostridium difficile infection: a randomized clinical trial [^114Uhs6T]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major burden in health care and community settings. CDI recurrence is of particular concern because of limited treatment options and associated clinical and infection control issues. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a promising, but not readily available, intervention.

Objective

To determine whether frozen-and-thawed (frozen, experimental) FMT is noninferior to fresh (standard) FMT in terms of clinical efficacy among patients with recurrent or refractory CDI and to assess the safety of both types of FMT.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, noninferiority trial enrolling 232 adults with recurrent or refractory CDI, conducted between July 2012 and September 2014 at 6 academic medical centers in Canada.

Interventions

Patients were randomly allocated to receive frozen (n = 114) or fresh (n = 118) FMT via enema.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome measures were clinical resolution of diarrhea without relapse at 13 weeks and adverse events. Noninferiority margin was set at 15%.

Results

A total of 219 patients (n = 108 in the frozen FMT group and n = 111 in the fresh FMT group) were included in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population and 178 (frozen FMT: n = 91, fresh FMT: n = 87) in the per-protocol population. In the per-protocol population, the proportion of patients with clinical resolution was 83.5% for the frozen FMT group and 85.1% for the fresh FMT group (difference, -1.6% [95% CI, -10.5% to ∞]; p = 0.01 for noninferiority). In the mITT population the clinical resolution was 75.0% for the frozen FMT group and 70.3% for the fresh FMT group (difference, 4.7% [95% CI, -5.2% to ∞]; P < .001 for noninferiority). There were no differences in the proportion of adverse or serious adverse events between the treatment groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with recurrent or refractory CDI, the use of frozen compared with fresh FMT did not result in worse proportion of clinical resolution of diarrhea. Given the potential advantages of providing frozen FMT, its use is a reasonable option in this setting.

### Faecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection: current promise and future needs [^112E56Kb]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The use of faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) as treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has increased rapidly over the past few years. In this review, we highlight clinical studies of FMT for treatment of recurrent CDI and discuss the safety, standardization and future of this treatment option. The major risk factor for CDI is prior antibiotic use, which results in an altered state of the gut microbiota characterized by decreased microbial diversity. This altered gut microbiota increases the patient's susceptibility to CDI. In patients with recurrent CDI, the microbiota remains in a state with decreased diversity, and FMT from a healthy individual restores the gut microbiota and subsequently colonization resistance against the pathogen.

Recent Findings

Recent studies have shown the success rate for FMT as treatment for recurrent CDI being greater than 90%. Standardized, frozen preparations of faeces can be used, which increases the availability of faeces for FMT and decreases the cost of screening individual donors. In addition, there have been recent advances in identifying a defined microbial community isolated from faeces that can restore colonization resistance against C. difficile.

Summary

The use of FMT is a successful treatment for recurrent CDI when primary treatment options have failed. However, more work needs to define potential long-term consequences of this treatment and understand how specific members of the gut microbiota can restore colonization resistance against C. difficile.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation in relapsing Clostridium difficile infection [^116Ua9Mc]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection rates are Climbing in frequency and severity, and the spectrum of susceptible patients is expanding beyond the traditional scope of hospitalized patients receiving antibiotics. Fecal microbiota transplantation is becoming increasingly accepted as an effective and safe intervention in patients with recurrent disease, likely due to the restoration of a disrupted microbiome. Cure rates of > 90% are being consistently reported from multiple centers. Transplantation can be provided through a variety of methodologies, either to the lower proximal, lower distal, or upper gastrointestinal tract. This review summarizes reported results, factors in donor selection, appropriate patient criteria, and the various preparations and mechanisms of fecal microbiota transplant delivery available to clinicians and patients.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation is highly effective in real-world practice: initial results from the FMT national registry [^1173UXxu]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is used commonly for treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections (CDIs), although prospective safety data are limited and real-world FMT practice and outcomes are not well described. The FMT National Registry was designed to assess FMT methods and both safety and effectiveness outcomes from North American FMT providers.

Methods

Patients undergoing FMT in clinical practices across North America were eligible. Participating investigators enter de-identified data into an online platform, including FMT protocol, baseline patient characteristics, CDI cure and recurrence, and short and long-term safety outcomes.

Results

Of the first 259 participants enrolled at 20 sites, 222 had completed short-term follow-up at 1 month and 123 had follow-up to 6 months; 171 (66%) were female. All FMTs were done for CDI and 249 (96%) used an unknown donor (eg, stool bank). One-month cure occurred in 200 patients (90%); of these, 197 (98%) received only 1 FMT. Among 112 patients with initial cure who were followed to 6 months, 4 (4%) had CDI recurrence. Severe symptoms reported within 1-month of FMT included diarrhea (n = 5 [2%]) and abdominal pain (n = 4 [2%]); 3 patients (1%) had hospitalizations possibly related to FMT. At 6 months, new diagnoses of irritable bowel syndrome were made in 2 patients (1%) and inflammatory bowel disease in 2 patients (1%).

Conclusions

This prospective real-world study demonstrated high effectiveness of FMT for CDI with a good safety profile. Assessment of new conditions at long-term follow-up is planned as this registry grows and will be important for determining the full safety profile of FMT.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation: a review on current formulations ininfection and future outlooks [^114vdorm]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The role of the gut microbiota in health and the pathogenesis of several diseases has been highlighted in recent years. Even though the precise mechanisms involving the microbiome in these ailments are still unclear, microbiota-modulating therapies have been developed. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has shown significant results against Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), and its potential has been investigated for other diseases. Unfortunately, the technical aspects of the treatment make it difficult to implement. Pharmaceutical technology approaches to encapsulate microorganisms could play an important role in providing this treatment and render the treatment modalities easier to handle.

Areas Covered

After an overview of CDI, this narrative review aims to discuss the current formulations for FMT and specifically addresses the technical aspects of the treatment. This review also distinguishes itself by focusing on the hurdles and emphasizing the possible improvements using pharmaceutical technologies.

Expert Opinion

FMT is an efficient treatment for recurrent CDI. However, its standardization is overlooked. The approach of industrial and hospital preparations of FMT are different, but both show promise in their respective methodologies. Novel FMT formulations could enable further research on dysbiotic diseases in the future.

### Systematic review with meta-analysis: encapsulated faecal microbiota transplantation-evidence for clinical efficacy [^111QyL8A]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI) and is being applied experimentally in other diseases. Encapsulated administration may be equivalent in efficacy to delivery through other routes.

Methods

A systematic review was undertaken of studies using encapsulated FMT up to 26 October 2020. Data on indication, clinical outcomes, safety, treatment protocol and capsule preparation were collected and reported. Pooled rates of clinical efficacy in rCDI were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. The impact of single variables on clinical efficacy was evaluated using univariate meta-regression.

Results

A total of 35 studies reporting the treatment of 960 patients with encapsulated FMT for eight different indications met the inclusion criteria. Most studies (n = 18, 51%) and patients (n = 755, 79%) were from studies on rCDI. Cure rates after single and multiple courses of treatments with encapsulated FMT in rCDI were 85% (95% CI: 82%-88%) and 93% (95% CI: 88%-96%) respectively. The treatment outcome was not significantly affected by dose, number of delivered capsules, anaerobic/aerobic processing, single/multi-donor treatment, lyophilisation, or any other single factor in the production or delivery of encapsulated FMT. Promising but non-comparable results from the treatment of ulcerative colitis and multidrug-resistant organisms were reported.

Conclusions

Encapsulated FMT is an effective and safe treatment of rCDI, with cure rates comparable to FMT delivered through other routes. The treatment is effective despite variations in donor screening, preparation and treatment protocol. For other indications, the role of FMT capsules is still not sufficiently examined, although some studies show promising results.

Plain Language Summary

Transfer of faecal material through capsules in the treatment of various diseases. Evidence for clinical efficacy The bacteria and other microorganisms of the gut is different in patient with various diseases in comparison with healthy subjects. Therefore, ways to change the microorganisms of the gut in a beneficial direction has been the subject of various research projects within recent years. Faecal microbiota transplantation often referred as FMT is a method of transferring microorganisms from healthy donors to patients with various diseases and is seen as one way to change the microbial community of the gut in a beneficial direction. Faecal microbiota transplantation can be performed in different ways such as through endoscopy, enemas or capsules. The transfer through capsules is preferred by the patients and has advantages since it can be administered long-term and can be delivered to the patients in their home. In this paper, we evaluated all accessible research reporting treatment with encapsulated faecal microbiota transplantation in the treatment of various diseases. We report the following major findings:-Treatment with capsules is safe when guidelines for screening donors and testing faecal material is followed.-The treatment is highly effective in the treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection, a disease with high mortality often caused by repeated antibiotic treatments. The treatment was effective in 596 of 723 patients following one course of capsule treatment.-Faecal microbiota transplantation delivered through capsules is as effective as treatment delivered through other routes in the treatment of C. difficile infection.-The treatment is effective in the treatment of C. difficile infection across studies and countries, despite great differences in the ways the capsules were prepared and delivered.-Increasing the amount of faecal material used in the production did not affect the efficacy of the treatment.-There are promising results in the treatment of other diseases such as liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease and the treatment of multi-drug resistant bacteria.

### Treating Clostridium difficile infection with fecal microbiota transplantation [^113zcYCt]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection is increasing in incidence, severity, and mortality. Treatment options are limited and appear to be losing efficacy. Recurrent disease is especially challenging; extended treatment with oral vancomycin is becoming increasingly common but is expensive. Fecal microbiota transplantation is safe, inexpensive, and effective; according to case and small series reports, about 90% of patients are cured. We discuss the rationale, methods, and use of fecal microbiota transplantation.

### ACG clinical guidelines: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections [^115Gnp27]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Prevention of CDI recurrence with fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) — indications, delivery, and efficacy: We recommend for patients experiencing their second or further recurrence of CDI be treated with FMT to prevent further recurrences (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We recommend FMT be delivered through colonoscopy (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence) or capsules (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence) for treatment of rCDI; delivery by enema if other methods are unavailable (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). We suggest repeat FMT for patients experiencing a recurrence of CDI within 8 weeks of an initial FMT (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Most studies of rCDI have defined eligibility as 3 or more confirmed episodes, and the first randomized controlled trial reported cure with nasoduodenal FMT after vancomycin of 81% vs 31% with standard‑of‑care vancomycin.

### ACG clinical guidelines: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections [^112DVzts]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for severe and fulminant Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is indicated and operationalized as follows: We suggest FMT be considered for patients with severe and fulminant CDI refractory to antibiotic therapy; in particular, when patients are deemed poor surgical candidates (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). Reported single-FMT cure in case reports ranges from 66%–91%. A pseudomembrane-driven protocol treats patients who fail to respond to 5 days of vancomycin ± intravenous metronidazole with colonoscopic FMT, restarts oral vancomycin within 24–48 hours, and repeats FMT at 3- to 5-day intervals until resolution. Using this protocol, 100% of severe CDI and 87% of fulminant CDI patients were cured during the same admission. In an open-label randomized trial, overall success was 75% with a single FMT–vancomycin and 100% with multiple FMT–vancomycin (P = 0.01), with 57% fulminant cases in the multiple-FMT group. Mortality improvements accompanying FMT include reductions from 43.2% to 12.1% and, with early FMT within 2–4 days of diagnosis, from 42.2% to 12.1% (P < 0.001). During sequential therapy, administration of oral vancomycin 125 mg every 6 hours or fidaxomicin 200 mg every 12 hours should be continued as long as pseudomembrane is present, and if discharged before resolution, therapy should be continued for a minimum of 5 days followed by a final outpatient FMT.

### The evolving landscape of fecal microbial transplantation [^11399Shg]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

The human gastrointestinal tract houses an enormous microbial ecosystem. Recent studies have shown that the gut microbiota plays significant physiological roles and maintains immune homeostasis in the human body. Dysbiosis, an imbalanced gut microbiome, can be associated with various disease states, as observed in infectious diseases, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Modulation of the gut microbiome has become a therapeutic target in treating these disorders. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from a healthy donor restores the normal gut microbiota homeostasis in the diseased host. Ample evidence has demonstrated the efficacy of FMT in recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI). The application of FMT in other human diseases is gaining attention. This review aims to increase our understanding of the mechanisms of FMT and its efficacies in human diseases. We discuss the application, route of administration, limitations, safety, efficacies, and suggested mechanisms of FMT in rCDI, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Finally, we address the future perspectives of FMT in human medicine.

### Effectiveness and safety of fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection in immunocompromised patients [^11588fms]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) poses a significant health risk to immunocompromised hosts due to the increased risk of severe infection and recurrence. Microbiota-based therapies have emerged as a promising strategy for CDI, but safety and efficacy in immunocompromised populations remain underexplored.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search across Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid EMBASE, Clinicaltrials.gov, and Scopus from inception until December 16, 2024, identified studies meeting inclusion criteria, covering fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for recurrent CDI (rCDI) in immunocompromised individuals, including those on immunosuppressants, transplant recipients, undergoing chemotherapy, and with advanced HIV. Case reports and studies not separately reporting outcomes in immunocompromised patients were excluded. Statistical analysis was performed using random-effects models to account for heterogeneity among studies.

Results

A total of 44 studies (31 full-text articles, 13 abstracts) were included, comprising 3,476 participants, of whom 1,208 were immunocompromised. The population included solid organ transplant recipients (n = 219), cancer patients on chemotherapy (n = 101), hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients (n = 29), and advanced HIV patients (n = 11). The most common FMT route was colonoscopy (n = 12 studies), followed by upper gastrointestinal routes, capsules, and rectal retention enemas. The clinical resolution rate after a single FMT was 75.3% (95% CI 71.7%-78.6%), increasing to 87.4% (95% CI 84.8%-89.6%) with consecutive treatments. The recurrence rate was 23.9% (95% CI 19.2%-29.4%), and the serious adverse event rate was 10.1% (95% CI 6.7%-14.8%).

Conclusions

The safety and effectiveness outcomes of FMT in mild to moderately immunocompromised populations for recurrent CDI are comparable to those in immunocompetent cohorts.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for Clostridium difficile infection: back to the future [^111sbbXu]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a leading cause of diarrhea in the industrialized world. The estimated costs of this infection are impressive: over 3.2 billion dollars annually in the US. The introduction of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to clinical practice can be considered a Copernican Revolution. The rationale of this approach consists of correcting the imbalance of the organisms dwelling in the gut by reintroducing a normal flora.

Areas Covered

This review focuses on the indication for FMT in CDI; it examines in-depth the most relevant aspects of the techniques used, and the safety and efficacy of this new 'old' therapy.

Expert Opinion

Authoritative guidelines about the management of CDI strongly recommend FMT for multiple recurrent episodes of infection by C. difficile unresponsive to repeated antibiotic treatment. The cure rates are about 90%, with no serious adverse events having been reported. The main concerns are the long-term outcomes, lack of a standardized procedure for the delivery of donor material, and a cultural barrier to the transplantation of fecal microbiota. A promising solution to some of these problems could be the use of a more acceptable administration route of fecal material, namely, oral capsules.

### Australian consensus statements for the regulation, production and use of faecal microbiota transplantation in clinical practice [^112Pxk8B]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has proved to be an extremely effective treatment for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection, and there is interest in its potential application in other gastrointestinal and systemic diseases. However, the recent death and episode of septicaemia following FMT highlights the need for further appraisal and guidelines on donor evaluation, production standards, treatment facilities and acceptable clinical indications.

Design

For these consensus statements, a 24-member multidisciplinary working group voted online and then convened in-person, using a modified Delphi approach to formulate and refine a series of recommendations based on best evidence and expert opinion. Invitations to participate were directed to Australian experts, with an international delegate assisting the development. The following issues regarding the use of FMT in clinical practice were addressed: donor selection and screening, clinical indications, requirements of FMT centres and future directions. Evidence was rated using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system.

Results

Consensus was reached on 27 statements to provide guidance on best practice in FMT. These include: (1) minimum standards for donor screening with recommended clinical selection criteria, blood and stool testing; (2) accepted routes of administration; (3) clinical indications; (4) minimum standards for FMT production and requirements for treatment facilities acknowledging distinction between single-site centres (eg, hospital-based) and stool banks; and (5) recommendations on future research and product development.

Conclusions

These FMT consensus statements provide comprehensive recommendations around the production and use of FMT in clinical practice with relevance to clinicians, researchers and policy makers.

### Low cure rates in controlled trials of fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112R45Gf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is highly effective for treating recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in observational studies (> 90%), but cure rates in clinical trials are lower. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of FMT for recurrent CDI in open-label studies and clinical trials.

Methods

A systematic search from January 1978 to March 2017 was performed to include clinical trials of FMT for CDI. We analyzed CDI resolution by calculating weighted pooled rates (WPRs).

Results

Thirteen trials were included, comprising 610 patients with CDI treated with single FMT. Overall, 439 patients had clinical cure (WPR, 76.1%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 66.4%-85.7%). There was significant heterogeneity among studies (I2 = 91.35%). Cure rates were lower in randomized trials (139/216 patients; WPR, 67.7%; 95% CI, 54.2%-81.3%) than in open-label studies (300/394 patients; WPR, 82.7%; 71.1%-94.3%) (P < .001). Subgroup analysis by FMT delivery modality showed lower cure rates with enema than colonoscopy (WPR, 66.3% vs 87.4%; P < .001) but no difference between colonoscopy and oral delivery (WPR, 87.4% vs 81.4%; p = 0.17). Lower rates were seen for studies including both recurrent and refractory CDI than for those including only recurrent CDI (WPR, 63.9% vs 79%; P < .001).

Conclusions

FMT was associated with lower cure rates in randomized trials than in open-label and in observational studies. Colonoscopy and oral route are more effective than enema for stool delivery. The efficacy also seems to be higher for recurrent than for refractory CDI.
