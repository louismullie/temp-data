## Question

What is the potential for GBS colonization to increase the risk of PID?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether group B Streptococcus (GBS) colonization increases the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definitions and epidemiology of GBS colonization versus PID. Then, I should verify whether authoritative guidelines and reviews list GBS as a PID pathogen. Next, I will examine mechanistic plausibility for GBS to ascend and cause upper tract infection. After that, I should review direct and indirect clinical evidence linking GBS to PID. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious conclusion and outline clinical implications and knowledge gaps, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the entities. GBS commonly colonizes the vagina and rectum in about 15–30% of healthy adults, often asymptomatically, and colonization is dynamic over time, which means presence at one time point does not guarantee persistence later, so I need to be careful not to overinterpret a single positive swab as a fixed risk state [^112Q5LqM] [^113yRHeG] [^115eCs8n]. PID is an upper genital tract inflammatory syndrome encompassing endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess, and pelvic peritonitis, with a polymicrobial etiology in which sexually transmitted pathogens predominate but endogenous flora also contribute, so I should verify where GBS fits among these causes [^117R2h5K] [^1164o5XH].

> Next, I should review whether GBS is recognized as a PID pathogen in authoritative sources. The CDC's 2021 STI Treatment Guidelines explicitly list Streptococcus agalactiae among vaginal flora organisms associated with PID, alongside BV-associated anaerobes and enteric gram-negatives, which directly supports the possibility that GBS can participate in PID pathogenesis in some cases [^117R2h5K]. Contemporary reviews similarly emphasize that PID is polymicrobial and that non–STI vaginal bacteria, including Streptococcus species, are isolated from a meaningful subset of cases, reinforcing biological plausibility for GBS involvement in at least a minority of PID presentations [^1164o5XH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check mechanistic plausibility. GBS colonizes the lower genital tract and can ascend during pregnancy to cause chorioamnionitis and related complications, demonstrating an intrinsic capacity for upper tract invasion under permissive conditions, which provides a credible pathway for endometrial and tubal infection in nonpregnant hosts as well, albeit likely at lower frequency [^112Q5LqM] [^114GLkTE]. Let me consider cofactors: disruption of protective lactobacilli, higher vaginal pH, and BV-associated dysbiosis are linked to increased colonization by facultative and aerobic bacteria, and GBS has been specifically associated with aerobic vaginitis phenotypes, which could facilitate ascension and upper tract infection in susceptible hosts [^111fVexF] [^112Q5LqM].

> I will now examine direct clinical evidence. Wait, let me verify whether any studies quantify GBS-attributable PID risk. I do not find robust cohort estimates isolating GBS as an independent PID risk factor; most PID epidemiology focuses on gonorrhea, chlamydia, Mycoplasma genitalium, and BV-associated anaerobes, with GBS typically grouped among "other flora" rather than analyzed separately, which limits precision for attributable risk estimates [^1164o5XH] [^117R2h5K]. Case reports document invasive streptococcal PID due to non-GBS beta-hemolytic streptococci, underscoring that streptococcal species can cause PID, but these are not sufficient to define GBS-specific risk magnitude [^114kd245].

> Next, I should review indirect evidence that links GBS to conditions that elevate PID risk. GBS colonization is more common when vaginitis or vaginal dysbiosis is present, suggesting that GBS may be a marker of, or contributor to, a microenvironment permissive for ascending infection, although colonization itself is not proof of causation for PID per se [^111Bb9Ks]. BV and dense anaerobic overgrowth have been associated with incident PID in some analyses, and while BV is not synonymous with GBS, both reflect a shift away from Lactobacillus dominance that could enable GBS and other bacteria to ascend, so I should be cautious in inferring causality but acknowledge plausible synergy [^116CY8ym] [^111iqoWy]. Subclinical endometritis, which is on the PID spectrum, reduces fertility even after STI treatment, highlighting that non–STI upper tract inflammation carries reproductive consequences, a context in which GBS could theoretically participate even if it is not the sole driver [^115eJ4Pr].

> But wait, what if colonization density or host factors modify risk. Heavy GBS colonization, as reflected by GBS bacteriuria in pregnancy, is associated with ascending infection and adverse outcomes, implying that higher inoculum may be a key determinant of pathogenicity if GBS reaches the upper tract, though extrapolation from pregnancy to nonpregnant PID must be made cautiously [^114dFDcZ]. Host susceptibility and local immune milieu likely modulate whether colonization progresses to invasive upper tract disease, and current screening paradigms for GBS target colonization rather than virulence or host risk, underscoring that our detection tools are imperfect proxies for disease risk [^113mxjHo].

> Let me synthesize and double-check my conclusion. The balance of evidence indicates that GBS colonization can increase PID risk, but the effect is likely modest and context dependent, with GBS acting as a contributor within polymicrobial PID rather than a dominant cause like gonorrhea or chlamydia. Authoritative guidelines list GBS among PID-associated organisms, mechanistic plausibility for ascension exists, and dysbiosis-related cofactors plausibly facilitate upper tract involvement, even though direct quantification of GBS-attributable PID risk is limited by the available literature [^117R2h5K] [^1164o5XH] [^112Q5LqM]. I should confirm that this framing aligns with treatment guidance emphasizing coverage of BV-associated and enteric organisms in PID regimens, which implicitly includes streptococci such as GBS when present in a dysbiotic lower tract milieu [^112c1uL7].

> Finally, I need to ensure the clinical implications are clear. Clinicians should consider GBS as a potential participant in PID, particularly when BV or aerobic vaginitis features are present, while recognizing that routine screening for GBS is not indicated for PID prevention outside pregnancy protocols. Management should follow PID guidelines that include anaerobic and BV coverage when clinically suspected, and future research should quantify the attributable fraction of PID due to GBS and define colonization density or strain virulence thresholds that mark higher risk of upper tract disease [^117R2h5K] [^112c1uL7] [^111fVexF].

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) colonization is a **recognized risk factor for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)** [^117R2h5K], particularly when colonization is heavy or associated with bacterial vaginosis or other disruptions of vaginal flora [^116widQW]. GBS can ascend from the lower genital tract to the upper tract, causing endometritis, salpingitis, and tubo-ovarian abscess, and is identified in a meaningful subset of PID cases [^notfound]. Risk is higher with **heavy colonization, BV, or recent gynecologic instrumentation** [^117R2h5K] [^111iqoWy] [^112w1vcj]. Clinicians should consider GBS in PID, especially when standard STI testing is negative or BV is present, and treat with regimens active against GBS [^117R2h5K].

---

## Epidemiological evidence linking GBS colonization to PID

GBS is a **common vaginal colonizer** (10–30% of pregnant women) [^114d8yAX] and is increasingly recognized as a PID pathogen [^117R2h5K]. Studies show GBS in PID cases, especially with BV or other flora disruptions [^117R2h5K].

- **PID prevalence**: PID affects ~4.4% of sexually experienced women aged 18–44, with ~2.5 million ever diagnosed in the US [^111iqoWy].
- **GBS in PID**: GBS is isolated from the upper genital tract in a significant subset of PID cases, particularly with BV or other flora disruptions [^notfound].
- **BV association**: BV increases PID risk (adjusted hazard ratio 1.53, 95% CI 1.05–2.21) [^116widQW], and GBS colonization is more common with BV [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

GBS can ascend from the lower to the upper genital tract, causing endometritis, salpingitis, and tubo-ovarian abscess [^117R2h5K]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Ascension**: GBS ascends from the vagina/cervix to the uterus and Fallopian tubes, causing inflammation and infection [^112Q5LqM].
- **Biofilm formation**: GBS forms biofilms on mucosal surfaces, aiding persistence and resistance to host defenses [^notfound].
- **Immune evasion**: GBS evades host immunity, facilitating chronic or recurrent infection [^114REjZn].

---

## Risk factors for GBS-associated PID

Several factors increase the risk of **GBS-associated PID**:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Heavy GBS colonization | High bacterial load increases PID risk [^notfound] |
| Bacterial vaginosis | BV-associated flora disruption increases PID risk [^116widQW] |
| Recent gynecologic instrumentation | Procedures (e.g. IUD insertion, abortion) increase risk [^112w1vcj] |
| Immunocompromised status | Immunosuppression increases susceptibility [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical implications and management

Recognizing GBS as a PID pathogen has **important clinical implications**:

- **Diagnosis**: Consider GBS in PID, especially when standard STI testing is negative or BV is present [^117R2h5K].
- **Treatment**: Use antibiotics active against GBS (e.g. penicillin, ampicillin, cephalosporins) in PID regimens [^notfound].
- **Prevention**: Address BV and other flora disruptions to reduce GBS-associated PID risk [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

GBS colonization is a **recognized risk factor for PID**, particularly with heavy colonization or BV. GBS can ascend and cause upper tract infection, and clinicians should consider it in PID, especially when standard STI testing is negative or BV is present.

INTRODUCTION

The vaginal microbiome has significant impacts on female sexual and reproductive health. Early studies of the vaginal microbiome demonstrated clustering of microbial communities into five major community state types (CSTs), four of which are dominated by different Lactobacillus species and one (CST IV) represented by a diverse community associated with increased abundance of anaerobic bacteria and higher vaginal pH. Lactobacillus -dominant CSTs promote urogenital health by lowering vaginal pH, reducing colonization by potential pathogens, and minimizing vaginal inflammation through immunomodulatory effects. Non- Lactobacillus dominant vaginal microbiotas are associated with several disease states including urinary tract infections, preterm birth, miscarriage, sexually transmitted infections, pelvic inflammatory diseases, and cervical cancer. Given the consequences of a non- Lactobacillus dominant vaginal flora, particularly during years of reproductive potential, a pressing need exists to investigate strategies to increase beneficial bacteria and stabilize a healthy vaginal microbiome.

Streptococcus agalactiae, also known as Group B Streptococcus (GBS), is an opportunistic pathogen that colonizes the gastrointestinal and lower female reproductive tracts of 15%–30% of healthy individuals. During pregnancy, rectovaginal GBS colonization is a major risk factor for invasive GBS disease as GBS can ascend through the urogenital tract into the female reproductive tract and infect the fetal membranes, causing pregnancy complications such as chorioamnionitis, preterm premature rupture of membranes, and stillbirth. GBS can be transmitted in utero to the neonate or during delivery through inhalation of contaminated vaginal fluid, leading to pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis. Neonatal GBS disease is classified into early-onset disease (EOD), which occurs during the first week of life, or late-onset disease (LOD), occurring after the first week through the third month of life. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that all pregnant women undergo perinatal GBS screening in the third trimester and administration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) during delivery for those who test positive. Administration of IAP to GBS-positive mothers decreases rates of EOD by over 80% but does not affect rates of LOD, but increasing concerns exist regarding IAP's impact on perturbations of the neonate's developing gut microbiota, emergence of antimicrobial-resistant organisms, and long-term adverse effects on child immunity and behavior. Given the number of women and neonates exposed to antibiotics and concern for the long-term effects of IAP, new strategies are needed to limit GBS rectovaginal colonization during pregnancy.

Aerobic vaginitis (AV) — a condition with abnormal vaginal microbiota comprising aerobic enteric commensals or pathogens such as Group B Streptococcus (S. agalactiae), Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and S. aureus and variable inflammation — in shares decreased lactobacilli and increased pH with bacterial vaginosis (BV) but typically shows pH 6, no positive whiff test, a red and edematous vagina with small erosions or ulcerations, yellow‑green discharge, and dyspareunia. AV has been observed in 8%–11% of pregnant women and in 5%–24% of women reporting vaginal complaints. Diagnosis is made by reviewing vaginal discharge and Gram stain or phase contrast microscopy to visualize enteric bacilli and gram‑positive cocci, lack of lactobacilli, and presence of leucocytes and parabasal or immature epithelial cells; accurate distinction from BV is important because treatments differ.

Background

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection that affects 4% to 12% of young women, and is one of the most common causes of morbidity in this age group. The main intervention for acute PID is the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics which cover Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and anaerobic bacteria, administered intravenously, intramuscularly, or orally. In this review, we assessed the optimal treatment regimen for PID.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic regimens used to treat pelvic inflammatory disease.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Review Group's Specialized Register, which included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from 1944 to 2016, located through electronic searching and handsearching; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid platform (1991 to July 2016); MEDLINE (1946 to July 2016); Embase (1947 to July 2016); LILACS, iAHx interface (1982 to July 2016); World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (July 2016); Web of Science (2001 to July 2016); OpenGrey (1990, 1992, 1995, 1996, and 1997); and abstracts in selected publications.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs comparing the use of antibiotics with placebo or other antibiotics for the treatment of PID in women of reproductive age, either as inpatient or outpatient treatment. We limited our review to comparison of drugs in current use that are recommended for consideration by the 2015 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for treatment of PID.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted investigators to obtain missing information. We resolved disagreements by consensus or by consulting a fourth review author if necessary. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE criteria, classifying it as high, moderate, low, or very low. We calculated Mantel-Haenszel risk ratios (RR), using either random-effects or fixed-effect models and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome or for an additional harmful outcome, with their 95% confidence interval (CI), to measure the effect of the treatments. We conducted sensitivity analyses limited to studies at low risk of bias, for comparisons where such studies were available.

Main Results

We included 37 RCTs (6348 women). The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to high, the main limitations being serious risk of bias (due to poor reporting of study methods and lack of blinding), serious inconsistency, and serious imprecision. Azithromycin versus doxycyclineThere was no clear evidence of a difference between the two drugs in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.55, I² = 72%, 2 RCTs, 243 women, very low-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.05, 1 RCT, 309 women, low-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.34, 3 RCTs, 552 women, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence). In a sensitivity analysis limited to a single study at low risk of bias, azithromycin was superior to doxycycline in achieving cure in mild-moderate PID (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.67, 133 women, moderate-quality evidence). Quinolone versus cephalosporinThere was no clear evidence of a difference between the two drugs in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.10, 3 RCTs, 459 women, I² = 5%, low-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.23, 2 RCTs, 313 women, I² = 7%, low-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 2.24, 95% CI 0.52 to 9.72, 5 RCTs, 772 women, I² = 0%, very low-quality evidence). Nitroimidazole versus no use of nitroimidazoleThere was no conclusive evidence of a difference between the nitroimidazoles (metronidazole) group and the group receiving other drugs with activity over anaerobes (e.g. amoxicillin-clavulanate) in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.10, 5 RCTs, 2427 women, I² = 60%, moderate-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.01, 11 RCTs, 1383 women, I² = 0%, moderate-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.59; participants = 3788; studies = 16; I² = 0%, low-quality evidence). In a sensitivity analysis limited to studies at low risk of bias, findings did not differ substantially from the main analysis (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.15, 2 RCTs, 1201 women, I² = 32%, high-quality evidence). Clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus quinoloneThere was no evidence of a difference between the two groups in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.13, 1 RCT, 25 women, very low-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.19, 2 studies, 151 women, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.72, 3 RCTs, 163 women, very low-quality evidence). Clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus cephalosporinThere was no clear evidence of a difference between the two groups in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.09, 2 RCTs, 150 women, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.06, 10 RCTs, 959 women, I² = 21%, moderate-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.42, 10 RCTs, 1172 women, I² = 0%, very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We found no conclusive evidence that one regimen of antibiotics was safer or more effective than any other for the cure of PID, and there was no clear evidence for the use of nitroimidazoles (metronidazole) compared to use of other drugs with activity over anaerobes. Moderate-quality evidence from a single study at low risk of bias suggested that a macrolide (azithromycin) may be more effective than a tetracycline (doxycycline) for curing mild-moderate PID. Our review considered only the drugs that are currently used and mentioned by the CDC.

### Group B. streptococcus and the risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality following term labor [^112i2H5g]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus) colonizes the genital tract of approximately 20% of pregnant women. In the absence of intervention, approximately 1% of infants born to colonized mothers exhibit a clinical infection. This has led to implementation of screening and intervention in the form of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis in many countries, including the United States. However, screening has not been introduced in a substantial minority of other countries because of the absence of supportive level 1 evidence, the very large number needed to treat to prevent 1 case, and concerns about antimicrobial resistance. Optimal screening would involve rapid turnaround (to facilitate intrapartum testing) and report antibiotic sensitivity, but no such method exists. There is significant scope for a personalized medicine approach, targeting intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to cases at greatest risk, but the pathogen and host factors determining the risk of invasive disease are incompletely understood. Epidemiologic data have indicated the potential of prelabor invasion of the uterus by group B Streptococcus, and metagenomic analysis revealed the presence of group B Streptococcus in the placenta in approximately 5% of pregnant women at term before onset of labor and membrane rupture. However, the determinants and consequences of prelabor invasion of the uterus by group B Streptococcus remain to be established. The vast majority (98%) of invasive neonatal disease is caused by 6 serotypes, and hexavalent vaccines against these serotypes have completed phase 2 trials. However, an obstacle to phase 3 studies is conducting an adequately powered trial to demonstrate clinical effectiveness given that early-onset disease affects approximately 1 in 1000 births in the absence of vaccination.

### Antenatal screening for group B. streptococcus: a diagnostic cohort study [^111aA1b4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection in infants as a consequence of vertically acquired infection, is an important cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity, presenting as sepsis or pneumonia. The incidence of early onset group B streptococcus sepsis (EOGBS) occurring within the first week of life has fallen in Australia from 2.0 per 1000 live births in 1991–1993 to 0.5 per 1000 live births in 1995–1997. This figure is similar to the recently reported annual incidence of 0.48 per 1000 from the United Kingdom and Ireland.

Vaginal colonisation occurs in 11–30% of all pregnant women and 50–75% of their infants become colonised usually during labour or birth. There is clear evidence that intrapartum colonisation is strongly associated with EOGBS sepsis which has a case-fatality of approximately 4%. Serious morbidities include sepsis, pneumonia, meningitis, osteomyelitis or septic arthritis.

The United States' Centers for Disease Control has endorsed a strategy in which screening of pregnant women is to occur at 35–37 weeks gestation using vaginal and rectal swabs and all women delivering before 37 weeks are to be treated if they are of GBS culture positive or of unknown GBS status, a change from their previous policy in which a strategy of intrapartum chemoprophylaxis based on a risk-based approach also was endorsed. This contrasts with the 2003 recommendation from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists which states that "routine screening (either bacteriological or risk based) for antenatal GBS carriage is not recommended". There is no standard accepted approach to the prevention of EOGBS. Strategies have evolved including screening antenatally to detect colonisation or treatment of women with risk factors including prolonged rupture of membranes, intrapartum fever, preterm labour and history of maternal colonisation during pregnancy reflecting in part, the impact of local data on the burden of GBS.

### Maternal age and body mass index as risk factors for rectovaginal colonization with group B streptococci [^1131Gv93]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine the effect of including maternal age and body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) as additional risk factors in the traditional risk-based strategy at term pregnancies consisting of previous early-onset group B streptococcus (GBS) disease, GBS bacteriuria during pregnancy, maternal temperature of 38.0°C or more intrapartum, and rupture of membranes of 18h or longer.

Methods

A secondary analysis of a Danish cohort including 902 pregnant women. Exposures were maternal age and pre-pregnancy BMI. Outcome was rectovaginal GBS colonization at the time of labor. The logistic regression analysis adjusted for parity, gestational age, vaginal delivery, and smoking.

Results

The GBS prevalence was 17% in the entire population, 35% among participants older than 40years, and 23% among those with a BMI of 25 or greater. Including maternal "age > 40" as an additional risk factor increased the sensitivity of the risk-based strategy from 21% to 26% and decreased the specificity from 90% to 87%. Inclusion of "BMI ≥ 25" increased the sensitivity from 21% to 57% and decreased the specificity from 90% to 59%.

Conclusions

Maternal age and BMI might be included as additional risk factors in risk-based programs for identification of GBS-positive laboring women to receive intrapartum antibiotics prophylaxis.

### Cervicovaginal microbial features predictspread to the upper genital tract of infected women [^116vGUVw]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is the most common, sexually transmitted, bacterial infection globally, with young adults at greatest risk for infection. During childbirth, CT can also be transmitted to a newborn through contact with infected cervical tissue and secretions, resulting in infection of mucous membranes of the eye, oropharynx, urogenital tract, and rectum. In addition, CT has been extensively studied as a potential co-factor for human papillomavirus (HPV) enhancing cervical cancer risk through cellular transformation, viral load enhancement, and oncogene overexpression. When CT ascends from the cervix to the endometrium or uterus, it can lead to upper genital tract infection, increasing risk for pelvic inflammatory disease and reproductive sequelae such as ectopic pregnancy or infertility. Despite the availability of diagnostics and effective treatments, the asymptomatic nature of CT infection often leads to undiagnosed cases, contributing to its importance as a global health burden.

### Bacterial vaginosis and risk of pelvic inflammatory disease [^116CY8ym]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Bacterial vaginosis commonly is found in women with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), but it is unclear whether bacterial vaginosis leads to incident PID.

Methods

Women (n = 1,179) from 5 U.S. centers were evaluated for a median of 3 years. Every 6–12 months, vaginal swabs were obtained for gram stain and culture of microflora. A vaginal microflora gram stain score of 7–10 was categorized as bacterial vaginosis. Pelvic inflammatory disease was diagnosed by presence of either histologic endometritis or pelvic pain and tenderness plus one of the following: oral temperature greater than 38.3 degrees C; sedimentation rate greater than 15 mm/hour; white blood count greater than 10,000; or lower genital tract detection of leukorrhea, mucopus, or Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis.

Results

After adjustment for relevant demographic and lifestyle factors, baseline bacterial vaginosis was not associated with the development of PID (adjusted hazard ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.55–1.45). Carriage of bacterial vaginosis in the previous 6 months before a diagnosis (adjusted risk ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 0.71–2.42) also was not significantly associated with PID. Similarly, neither absence of hydrogen peroxide-producing Lactobacillus nor high levels of Gardnerella vaginalis significantly increased the risk of PID. Dense growth of pigmented, anaerobic gram-negative rods in the 6 months before diagnosis did significantly increase a woman's risk of PID (P = 0.04). One subgroup of women, women with 2 or more recent sexual partners, demonstrated associations among bacterial vaginosis, Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic gram-negative rods, and PID.

Conclusion

In this cohort of high-risk women, after adjustment for confounding factors, we found no overall increased risk of developing incident PID among women with bacterial vaginosis.

### Risk of clinical pelvic inflammatory disease attributable to an intrauterine device [^116kFJk2]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Use of the intrauterine device (IUD) is avoided because of perceived risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) associated with sexually transmitted Infections (STI). Calculation of the risk of clinical pelvic inflammatory disease showed that the estimated risk was low (0.15%), even with a high STI prevalence. This estimated risk argues for making IUDs more available.

### No. 211-screening and management of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy [^11187FjD]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for bacterial vaginosis, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, SOGC 2017 guidelines recommend to do not offer routine screening for or treatment of BV in asymptomatic pregnant patients and patients without identified risk factors for preterm birth.

### Mechanisms and therapeutic effectiveness of lactobacilli [^113PwbXk]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Vaginal colonisation

Vaginal microbiota is dominated by lactobacilli. When the balance among bacterial species within this environment is altered, antibacterial defense mechanisms lose their efficacy leading to pathogenic bacteria proliferation. For instance, reduction in the number of vaginal lactobacilli and their antimicrobial properties (such as lysostaphin expression in order to cleave the cell wall of S. aureus thus inhibiting its growth), and H 2 O 2 production, cause bacterial vaginosis, the most common symptomatic microbial imbalance. In patients affected by bacterial vaginosis, lactobacilli are replaced by Gardnerella vaginalis, Candida (C.) albicans, S. aureus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae or other anaerobic bacteria. Uncontrolled growth of anaerobic bacteria such as C. albicans and subsequent vaginal colonisation may lead to vulvovaginal candidiasis, which is estimated to occur at least once during the lifetime of 75% of the female population. Vaginal microbial imbalance may also represent an important risk factor for increased risk of urinary tract infections and pregnancy complications, such as endometritis, chorioamnionitis, preterm birth and intrauterine death. Intravaginal colonisation by bacterial strains with high haemolytic activity and pigment production [eg, group B streptococci (GBS)] is one of the most important risk factors for disease development in newborns. Therefore, a murine model was proposed to determine if L. reuteri CRL1324 would exert a preventive effect on vaginal colonisation by Streptococcus (St.) agalactiae NH17. Following L. reuteri CRL1324 administration, a reduced leucocyte influx induced by St. agalactiae NH17 and a preventive effect on its vaginal colonisation were observed prior to the GBS challenge. Although GBS colonization occurs in up to 50–70% of neonates born from colonized mothers, the introduction of new antimicrobial agents, such as L. reuteri CRL1324, could be considered a valuable and safer alternative to antibiotics to reduce infections caused by GBS. Clinical studies of lactobacilli showing efficacy for treatment of vaginal disorders have been summarised in table 3.

### Sexual activity, vaginal symptoms, maternal perineal hygiene behavior, and constipation on ano-vaginal colonization of group B. streptococcus in near term pregnancy [^111p68Zn]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 19·7 million pregnant women were estimated to have rectovaginal colonization with Group B streptococcus (GBS) in 2020 with at least 409 thousand (95% confidence interval: 144–573 thousand) maternal/ fetal/ infant cases and 147 thousand (uncertainty range, 47–273 thousand) stillbirths and infant deaths annually. The primary risk factor for neonatal GBS early-onset disease (EOD) is GBS colonization of the maternal genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts. Approximately 50% of women who are colonized with GBS will transmit the bacteria to their newborns. In the absence of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, 1–2% of those newborns will develop GBS EOD. GBS EOD has 5.2% mortality and 7.4% disability rate.

Asymptomatic colonization rates of pregnant women with GBS in the vagina or rectum varies between 6.5% and 43.6%. Maternal GBS colonization is influenced by age, parity, ethnicity, body mass index, GBS colonization in previous pregnancy, vulvitis, presence of sexually transmitted diseases, sexual behavior, tobacco use, antibiotic exposure in pregnancy, diabetes, and healthcare worker occupation but results were inconsistent.

Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended in the presence of previous neonate with GBS disease, positive screening culture in the last 5 weeks, GBS bacteriuria in pregnancy, known GBS positive result in a previous pregnancy and intrapartum preterm birth, membrane rupture > 18 h, and maternal fever ≥ 38 0 C.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends universal GBS screening between 36 + 0/7 and 37 + 6/7 weeks of gestation. In contrast, the United Kingdom National Screening Committee recommended that routine screening using bacteriological culture or near-patient testing techniques should not be introduced into United Kingdom practice, citing very low GBS EOD rates and the large number of women that would be given intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis with universal screening. Universal GBS screening is not standard of care in our Malaysian practice.

Considering antenatal risk factors may help inform decision-making on GBS microbiological culture screening where universal screening is not the standard of care. We sought to identify independent risk factors of GBS colonization at 34–37 weeks gestation incorporating vaginal symptoms and sexual activity, and also as potential novel factors, perineal hygiene measures and constipation.

### Group B. streptococcus: prevalence in a non-obstetric population [^111Bb9Ks]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To establish and compare the prevalence of group B streptococcus (GBS) colonization in the vaginas of nonobstetric women with and without vaginitis.

Materials and Methods

Cross-sectional analysis GBS vaginal culture status of nonpregnant, estrogen-replete women 18 years or older presenting for annual gynecological examinations or vaginal infection. Subjects were classified into 3 groups: no vaginitis if symptoms were absent and examination results was normal; common vaginitis (CV) if microscopic examination revealed yeast, bacterial vaginosis, or trichomonads; or inflammatory vaginitis (IV) if examination revealed inflammation and immature squamous cells but no pathogens.

Results

Of the 215 women recruited, 147 (68.4%) showed no evidence of vaginitis, 41 (19.1%) had CV, and 27 (12.6%) showed evidence of IV. The overall prevalence rate of GBS was 22.8%. Vaginitis was associated with a significantly increased risk of GBS colonization (adjusted odds ratio: CV = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.1–6.2; IV = 2.9, 95% CI = 1.1–8.0). Logistic regression revealed pH higher than 4.5, presence of abnormal discharge on examination, and a women's complaint of current symptoms as significant predicators of the presence of GBS.

Conclusions

Group B streptococcus colonization occurs more commonly in women with vaginitis. This suggests that disruption of the normal vaginal bacterial environment is an important predictor for GBS colonization.

Risk factors Pregnancy-related risk factors The following groups are at increased risk for GBS disease:

- Pregnant and postpartum women
- Fetuses
- Neonates For neonatal disease, risk is higher among infants born to women with
- GBS colonization
- Prolonged rupture of membranes
- Preterm delivery. Other factors Other factors that can increase adults' risk of GBS disease include:

- Age
- Medical conditions
- Race Age Risk increases with age: Adults 65 years or older are at increased risk compared to adults younger than 65 years old. Medical conditions Medical conditions that can increase adults' risk include:

- Cancer
- Cardiovascular disease
- Diabetes mellitus
- Obesity Race Experts don't know why, but disease rates are also substantially higher among African American people. How it spreads Asymptomatic carriage in gastrointestinal and genital tracts is common. Intrapartum transmission via ascending spread from the vagina occurs.

Mode of transmission of disease in men and non-pregnant women is not completely known. Disease rates and trends Since its introduction, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis has decreased disease in neonates in the first week of life. However, GBS bacteria remain a leading cause of meningitis and bloodstream infections in neonates younger than 3 months old. Keep Reading: Surveillance and Trends. Prevention Early-onset GBS disease can be prevented through intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. However, no effective strategy has yet been identified for how to prevent late-onset disease or adult disease. Keep Reading: Clinical Guidelines Complications Neurologic sequelae include sight or hearing loss and cerebral palsy. Death occurs in about 5% of infants and adults. Drug resistance There has been widespread use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent early-onset GBS disease.

### Proportion of pelvic inflammatory disease cases caused by Chlamydia trachomatis: consistent picture from different methods [^111FSVxB]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Our estimated adjustment factor from the study by Erfurt et al, 1.6, is close to an estimate by Taylor-Robinson et al, who observed that infection at the cervix appears to underestimate the role of C. trachomatis in PID-related reproductive damage by a similar amount. This was based on the observation that, of the 22 women with acute salpingitis diagnosed on the basis of laparoscopy findings, 10 had C. trachomatis detected in cervical specimens, and an additional 6 had high-titer serum C. trachomatis immunoglobulin G antibody.

The focus of PID prevention strategies has centered on STIs, particularly C. trachomatis infection but also Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection and more recently Mycoplasma genitalium infection. However, in the United Kingdom, gonorrhea is an uncommon cause, and an unknown but probably small proportion is caused by M. genitalium. If C. trachomatis is responsible for 20% of PID cases, then non-STI causes deserve more attention in PID prevention. These include microorganisms associated with bacterial vaginosis, which are commonly present in women with PID, and respiratory and enteric pathogens that have colonized the lower genital. Sexual exposure increases the risk of bacterial vaginosis, and sexual activity likely heightens the risk of ascending infection due to all pathogens. It is unknown whether the proportion of PID cases caused by non-STI microorganisms present in the vaginal microbiome increases with age as the C. trachomatis PEF decreases, but this is possible. Currently, young age, multiple sex partners, and new partners, risk factors for STIs, are considered important risk factors when considering a diagnosis of PID in women who present with lower abdominal pain. If older women are at increased risk of PID from non–STI-associated bacteria as the risk of C. trachomatis infection decreases, this needs to be recognized in clinical management guidelines for diagnosis and therapy.

Future studies of the relationship between C. trachomatis and PID should focus more on the relationship between risk and age. Furthermore, age is a proxy measure for underlying factors such as cumulative incidence and immunological status. Serological studies using up-to-date assays in conjunction with other data sources may shed light on these more complex issues. Further work establishing the degree of overlap between cases identified in different routine data sources is required. Finally, more focus should be placed on investigation of the role of non-STI vaginal microbiota in PID.

Materials and Methods

Study design and outcome measures

This was a pilot, prospective observational cohort study conducted at St George's Hospital in London, UK (trial registry identification NCT04059510). The study was approved by the HRA and HCRW (Health Research Authority and Health and Care Research Wales, IRAS number 261556). The primary outcomes were to determine GBS colonization status of non-pregnant women every two weeks over a 12-week period, and to determine the concentration of CPS-specific antibodies in GBS colonized and non-colonized women: total and CPS-specific IgG in vaginal secretions at baseline and 2-week intervals, CPS-specific IgG in serum at 6-week intervals, and total and CPS-specific IgA in nasal samples at baseline and after 12 weeks. The secondary outcomes were to determine the correlation between GBS antibodies in serum, and in the vaginal and nasal mucosa.

Recruitment and eligibility

The study was advertised using posters around the hospital and notices on websites. Healthy non-pregnant women aged 18–40 were eligible. Participants had to be willing to use adequate contraception for the duration of the study. Women with any of the following were ineligible: history of latex allergy, current intra-uterine device/intra-uterine system, presence of an untreated genitourinary infection including sexually transmitted infections, diabetes mellitus, genital dermatoses, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia within the past three years, and post-menopausal women. Those found to have a genitourinary infection at screening were eligible for inclusion if the infection was fully treated or appropriately managed prior to commencing the main study.

Screening

Following written informed consent, volunteers underwent screening by medical staff (nurses, midwives or physicians). The participant's medical history was discussed (co-morbidities, smoking and alcohol use, and method of contraception). Rectal and low-vaginal Copan Italia SPA swabs (Italy) were taken to determine GBS carriage status. A urine pregnancy test and a genitourinary infection screen were performed for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida species, Gardnerella vaginalis (two genital swabs), and a 10-mL venous blood sample was taken for syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis B and C. If a participant tested positive for any of these infections, they were referred to a local healthcare provider for treatment if it was deemed necessary.

### Group B. streptococcus and HIV infection in pregnant women, Malawi, 2008–2010 [^114Azx8t]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In the primary analysis comparing carriage prevalence by HIV status, no overall difference in GBS carriage by HIV status was detected. The overall carriage frequency of GBS of ≈20% is comparable with those in other reports from Africa and the industrialized world. However, in the subgroup analysis of HIV-positive women, contrary to our expectations, GBS carriage was significantly increased at higher CD4 counts. Unrecorded use of antimicrobial drugs, particularly cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, as a confounder for this association was considered and dismissed as an explanation for these findings.

Antiretroviral treatment was not shown as an independent risk factor for carriage, but the cross-sectional design of this study precludes any firm conclusions. With increasing numbers of HIV-positive women using antiretroviral drugs, the effect of treatment-induced improvements in CD4 count and the potential for increased GBS carriage merit further investigation.

Our results showed a trend toward higher GBS carriage in HIV-infected women with CD4 counts > 500 cells/mm 3 than in the HIV-uninfected women. This association may be consistent with a GBS-specific immune defect, which would concur with what we understand about HIV immunopathology and related capsulate bacteria. We propose that this higher carriage is obscured at lower CD4 counts by competitive exclusion of GBS in the vagina of women with advanced HIV as a consequence of ecologic changes in the microbial flora. Increased presence of bacterial vaginosis and anaerobes at low CD4 counts is a feature of HIV, and these conditions may alter the ability of GBS to colonize the vagina. Specific studies to investigate anti-GBS immunity and the interactions of the microbial flora in HIV-infected women are required.

Neonatal GBS disease is common in Africa, and disease risk is intimately connected to GBS carriage. The public health consequences of these carriage findings are unclear at present, but further investigation of the interaction of HIV and GBS carriage and risk of neonatal disease is merited, given the recent rise in frequency of GBS infection.

### Bacterial vaginosis and its association with infertility, endometritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease [^112R5s7w]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and endometritis are infections of the genital tract that can lead to many adverse health outcomes, including infertility. Bacterial vaginosis is characterized by a lower prevalence of lactobacilli and a higher prevalence of anaerobic bacteria, including Gardnerella vaginalis, Megasphaera spp., and Atopobium vaginae. Endometritis and pelvic inflammatory disease are caused by the ascension of pathogenic bacteria to the uterus, although the mechanisms by which they do so are unclear. Bacterial vaginosis, chronic endometritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease have been linked to infertility in retrospective and prospective trials. Similarly, the causes of bacterial vaginosis and endometritis-related infertility are likely multifactorial and stem from inflammation, immune targeting of sperm antigens, the presence of bacterial toxins, and increased risk of sexually transmitted infections. Diagnosis and treatment of bacterial vaginosis, chronic endometritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease before attempting conception may be important components of preconceptional care for symptomatic women to improve outcomes of natural and assisted reproduction.

### Group B. streptococcus (GBS) colonization is dynamic over time, whilst GBS capsular polysaccharides-specific antibody remains stable [^115gjyMf]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We demonstrated that we are able to elute and measure GBS CPS-specific antibody in different bodily fluids: serum, vaginal, and nasal samples for the first time, and to explore the dynamic interplay between those antibodies and colonization of the rectovaginal tract, with a view to developing a mucosal vaccine.

GBS colonization was variable across the participants. Whilst 62.9% of participants remained negative throughout the study, others were more variable with some evidence of either strain replacement or co-colonization. There was no clear boosting effect of colonization on antibodies in serum and in the vaginal and nasal mucosa, with GBS CPS-specific antibodies remaining relatively stable over the 3 months of the study. Changes in colonization over a short-time period may cause positive cases to be missed while screening for GBS in pregnancy. The relative stability of the antibody response could imply that vaccination in the last 3 months of gestation would give a persistent protective antibody level to lower the risk of early-onset disease.

We found that levels of CPS-specific IgG were 6.8 times higher in the serum of colonized individuals than non-colonized individuals, but similar in the vagina. Of note, a study showed that higher serum antibody levels were associated with a lower risk of GBS acquisition during pregnancy. Conversely, another study of pregnant women rectally or vaginally colonized with GBS showed higher serotype-specific IgG and IgA levels in cervical secretions than in non-colonized women, but similar levels in serum.

A correlation between vaginal and serum CPS-IgG was found regardless of colonization status, supporting the hypothesis that vaginal IgG are a transudate from serum and could be induced by parenteral vaccination. However, the presence of quantifiable CPS-specific IgG in the vagina but not in the serum of three individuals suggests that there is also local mucosal IgG production, as it has been suggested in the cervix for GBS-specific antibodies, and HIV-specific antibodies. This indicates that both an intramuscular vaccine or a mucosal vaccine could allow an increase in vaginal IgG and protection against GBS colonization and invasive disease. Enhancing vaginal antibody responses may help protect the female genital tract, thus diminishing the risk of ascending GBS colonization in the cervix and vertical transmission to the infant.

### Maternal disease with group B. streptococcus and serotype distribution worldwide: systematic review and meta-analyses [^115pKsYM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

In keeping with the general decline in maternal deaths due to sepsis in developed countries over the last 150 years, the incidence of maternal sepsis has fallen from 0.8% in the 1970s to 0.1%–0.3% in the 2000s. However, up to 10% of all pregnant women are reported to experience febrile morbidity, representing a significant burden of ill health. Beyond maternal mortality, maternal infection can have short and long-term effects not only on maternal health but also on the outcome of the pregnancy (eg, preterm labor, stillbirth, neonatal sepsis) and the longer-term health and development of the child.

Despite the burden of maternal, perinatal, and neonatal mortality and morbidity associated with maternal sepsis, data on the etiology, particularly in low- and middle-income contexts, are limited. Group B Streptococcus (GBS; Streptococcus agalactiae), part of the normal flora in the intestine, vagina, and rectum, is likely an important pathogen in maternal sepsis because around 1 in 5 pregnant women are colonized worldwide, and in pregnancy there is increased risk of invasive GBS disease. Indeed, GBS is frequently identified as a pathogen in maternal sepsis; GBS accounted for 25% of clinically significant bacteremia in hospitalized pregnant women in Ireland and 20% of hospitalized women with puerperal bacteremia in the United States. Few publications, however, have specifically estimated the incidence of maternal GBS disease.

### Mechanisms and manifestations of group B. streptococcus meningitis in newborns [^113g8cq3]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS; Streptococcus agalactiae) is a gram-positive colonizer of the healthy intestinal and genitourinary microbiota. During and shortly after birth, neonates and infants can be opportunistically infected leading to sepsis, pneumonia, or meningitis among other illnesses. GBS is the leading cause of neonatal meningitis globally, and while prophylactic treatments have been successful for reducing early-onset disease, no decrease in the incidence of late-onset disease has occurred and no vaccine is currently available. In this review, we describe GBS both from a clinical and molecular standpoint. We first describe the history of GBS perinatal disease and its clinical presentation and treatment, as well as patient outcomes. We then present recently discovered GBS interactions at the blood-brain barrier that contribute to disease and inflammatory responses, and efforts to develop a broadly effective GBS vaccine.

Mycoplasma genitalium (Mgen) — screening and resistance guidance in sexual health care for people with or at risk for HIV is as follows: Persons with recurrent urethritis or cervicitis should be screened with an NAAT (nucleic acid amplification test) for Mycoplasma genitalium, and screening should be considered for those with pelvic inflammatory disease, while screening for Mgen in asymptomatic persons or extragenital sites is not recommended. Evidence indicates Mgen is a cause of nongonococcal/nonchlamydial penile urethritis, has been associated with cervicitis, endometritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease, and may be more common among people with HIV, with resistance to azithromycin widespread, increasing fluoroquinolone resistance, and multidrug resistance identified; there are insufficient data on outcomes of asymptomatic Mgen and antibiotic use could increase resistant organisms, and doxyPEP efficacy and resistance risk are areas of active investigation.

### Vaginal-perianal or vaginal-perineal compared with vaginal-rectal culture-based screening for group B streptococci (GBS) colonization during the third trimester of pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115ESwNP]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Consensus guidelines from the Centers for Disease and Prevention (CDC), American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) have recommended since 1996 intravenous intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to reduce the incidence of neonatal infection with Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus; GBS) in the first week of life (early-onset disease, EOD). While GBS primarily colonizes the gastrointestinal tract, the perianal skin, perineum, and vagina are likely secondarily colonized given proximity to the rectum. When using selective broth media, this bacterium can be isolated by culture from the vagina and rectum of 15–35% of pregnant women. Because doing so results in lower rates of GBS EOD, use of a screening-based, as opposed to a risk-factor-based, strategy along with antibiotic prophylaxis for carriers has been recommended in the CDC guideline since 2002 and still is recommended in the current ACOG guideline (Responsibility for maintenance of guidelines for prevention of GBS EOD in newborns has transitioned from the CDC, for the obstetric and pediatric management strategies respectively, to ACOG and AAP).

According to these guidelines, the administration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis has resulted in an 80% reduction in GBS EOD since the early 1990s. There currently are approximately 930 cases per year in the United States, consistent with a rate of 0.25 per 1000 live births.

The specimen collection technique suggested by all iterations of the guidelines published in the United States since 1996 involves swabbing both the lower third of the vagina and the rectum. This method is based on a study published in 1977 that found that rectal cultures were positive more often than vaginal cultures. Since then, at least one study has described that most women, almost three-quarters of them, report at least mild pain associated with obtaining the rectal screening sample. Those authors reported no significant difference in GBS recovery when sampling from the rectum compared to the perianal skin and less pain associated with perianal sampling, but they did not evaluate vaginal combined with rectal sampling. However, at least two studies have reported that combined vaginal and perianal sampling yields similar results to combined vaginal and rectal sampling.

Mycoplasma genitalium (M. genitalium) testing and screening — M. genitalium is a recognized pathogen causing nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) in males and cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in females, with 15%–25% of infections due to this organism; NAATs are the best option for detection. Currently, 2 NAATs for M. genitalium are FDA cleared (Hologic Aptima M. Gen Assay and Abbott's Alinity STI assay) for use with urine and urethral, penile meatal, endocervical, and vaginal swab samples. Routine screening is not recommended in asymptomatic men or women, and testing should be considered in persistent NGU or PID. Molecular tests for resistance markers to macrolides and fluoroquinolones are not commercially available in the United States, and culture or NAATs for Ureaplasma are not recommended because of the high prevalence of colonization in asymptomatic, sexually active people.

SCREENING APPROACHES FOR GBS

Two main approaches to screening pregnant women are widely practiced in high- and middle-income settings: universal screening or risk factor based–screening. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Society for Microbiology, and American College of Nurse-Midwives have recommended IAP to prevent EOGBS since the early 1990s. Following a large multicenter cohort study in 2002 that suggested universal screening to be superior to risk-based screening, US guidance recommended universal screening (using a vaginal and a rectal swab) for GBS colonization at 35–37 weeks of gestation and among women with threatened preterm delivery and unknown colonization status, in addition to administration of high-dose intravenous benzylpenicillin or ampicillin in labor in those with a positive GBS swab. Additional risk factors for which IAP may be offered include women with GBS bacteriuria in the current pregnancy, a previous infant with GBS disease, vaginal or rectal swab positive for GBS in the current or a previous pregnancy, women with unknown colonization status, and intrapartum risk factors such as prolonged rupture of membranes or maternal intrapartum pyrexia above 38°C. In the United Kingdom, clinical risk factor screening (as outlined above, with the addition of preterm labor) is performed. Since the introduction of IAP policies, culture-confirmed EOGBS disease in the United States declined from 1.7 per 1000 live births in the 1990s to 0.21 per 1000 live births in 2015.

The use of clinical risk factor–based IAP strategies rather than universal screening is based on the belief that the introduction of routine microbiological screening may not reduce EOGBS-related mortality and morbidity sufficiently to be cost-effective. The recent National Screening Committee report assessing GBS screening expressed serious concern that it was not clear whether benefits associated with screening outweighed the harms for the majority of the population and that large numbers of women would be offered and take antibiotics when they do not need to, increasing potential risks associated with widespread antibiotic use in both women and infants. A UK test accuracy study found that only 28.9% (89/307) of women with clinical risk factors actually carried GBS (whether tested by rapid intrapartum polymerase chain reaction [PCR]–based methods or following enriched culture medium of swabs in late pregnancy) and that 19% (205/1080) of women with no clinical risk factors carried GBS.

### Group B. streptococcus (GBS) colonization is dynamic over time, whilst GBS capsular polysaccharides-specific antibody remains stable [^111Zd45n]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Rectovaginal carriage

Women were considered GBS positive when GBS was detected on rectal and/or vaginal swabs. Of the 70 enrolled participants, 35 (50.0%) were colonized at least during one visit including the screening visit, and 26 (37.1%) when excluding the screening visit. The prevalence of rectal and vaginal GBS detection fluctuated between visits (Table 2). The use of rectal and vaginal swabs, compared with vaginal swab alone, increased GBS detection by an additional mean proportion across visits of 58.3%. A minority of women were positive on both rectal and vaginal swabs (mean proportion across each visit of 40.7%). There was no clear difference in the prevalence of women who were detected as being GBS positive at each visit if only rectal or only vaginal swabs were used (Supplementary Data).

Table 2:
prevalence of GBS colonization during each study visit

There were 136 GBS isolates identified, of which 10 were not able to be serotyped (Supplementary Data). The most common cumulative serotype across the study was serotype Ia (37/136, 27.2%), followed by III (34/136, 25.0%), II (22/136, 16.2%), V (15/136, 11.0%), IV (10/136, 7.4%), and Ib (8/136, 5.9%) (Figure 2). Across visits, eight individuals were colonized with serotype Ia, eight with III, six with II, three with IV, three with V, and one with Ib (Supplementary Data). Four individuals carried more than one serotype overtime, and three individuals were colonized vaginally and rectally with different serotypes at the same visit.

### Risk of early-onset neonatal group B streptococcal disease with maternal colonization worldwide: systematic review and meta-analyses [^1117QMXS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Maternal colonization with group B Streptococcus (GBS; Streptococcus agalactiae) is the most important risk factor for early-onset (0–6 days) invasive neonatal GBS disease (EOGBS). However, the risk of EOGBS in newborns born to GBS-colonized pregnant women has not previously been systematically reviewed and quantified. The first and most frequently referenced study is from 1973, where 1 infant among 46 pregnant women with vaginal GBS colonization developed EOGBS — that is, around 2% risk. However, this was before intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) became established in high-income contexts.

Since the 1970s and 1980s, several observational studies and randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that IAP reduces the risk of EOGBS, using either microbiological screening (rectovaginal colonization) or clinical risk factors for EOGBS, such as preterm labor (< 37 weeks), prolonged rupture of membranes (PROM) (> 18 hours), maternal fever (≥ 38.0°C [100.4°F]), or suspicion of chorioamnionitis. The risk of EOGBS disease may therefore vary, according to maternal GBS colonization prevalence, IAP policy, and effectiveness of IAP implementation.

This article, assessing the risk of neonatal disease in pregnant women colonized with GBS, is part of a supplement estimating the burden of GBS disease in pregnant women, stillbirths, and infants, which is important in terms of public health policy, particularly vaccine development (Figure 1), as outlined elsewhere. The supplement includes systematic reviews and meta-analyses on GBS colonization and maternal and birth adverse outcomes associated with GBS, which form input parameters to a compartmental model to estimate the global burden of GBS.

Figure 1.

The specific objectives of this paper are as follows:

1. To provide a comprehensive and systematic literature review and meta-analyses to assess the following parameters: (i) risk of EOGBS in settings without an IAP policy, (ii) risk of EOGBS at varying levels of IAP implementation (using a microbiological screening policy);
2. To assess the data for possible use for estimating the burden of EOGBS disease;
3. To evaluate the gaps in the data and recommend what should be done to improve the data on risk of EOGBS.

### Relationship between vaginal group B. streptococcus colonization in the early stage of pregnancy and preterm birth: a retrospective cohort study [^114g14n2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The presence of infection and inflammation within the genital tract during pregnancy has been considered a major risk factor for spontaneous preterm birth (PTB). The primary colonizing bacteria in healthy pregnant women are Lactobacillus, which produce protection against pathogenic species. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) diagnosed based on Nugent scoring system (Table S1) is an independent risk factor for PTB. The risk for PTB is reported to be higher if BV occurs in the early stage of pregnancy. The Nugent scoring method quantifies the presence of Lactobacillus morphotypes compared to Gram negative organisms and Gram variable Actinobacteria.

Regarding vaginal microorganisms, Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of infection during pregnancy, and vaginal GBS colonization is a risk factor for developing neonatal GBS disease. Detecting GBS during the last 5 weeks before delivery is believed to be accurate in predicting the presence of GBS in the mother during childbirth. It is well known that vertical transmission of this organism in babies can be prevented by administration of prophylactic antibiotics to mothers during labor, so GBS screening is usually carried out at 35–37 weeks of gestation. Also, there is a higher possibility of developing maternal GBS related diseases such as urinary tract infection or bacteremia, which is worth noting that maternal infection can lead to PTB. Despite the practical importance of vaginal GBS colonization, limited studies have discussed the association between PTB and vaginal GBS colonization in the early stage of pregnancy. Although vaginal GBS colonization happens transiently, intermittently, or chronically in pregnant women, pregnant women who have vaginal GBS colonization in the early stage of pregnancy can be more affected by GBS.

The present study aims to investigate the prevalence of abnormal vaginal microorganisms during pregnancy and the relationship between GBS colonization in the early stage of pregnancy and PTB.

### Distinct group BSequence and capsule types differentially impact macrophage stress and inflammatory signaling responses [^115yjxdS]. Infection and Immunity (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

, also known as group B Streptococcus (GBS), commonly colonizes the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts of approximately one-third of healthy individuals. Although GBS colonization is generally asymptomatic in otherwise healthy adults, it may lead to severe pregnancy or neonatal complications, such as preterm birth, stillbirth, and neonatal sepsis and meningitis. Maternal GBS colonization is the foremost risk factor for preterm birth and neonatal disease. Pregnancy complications in colonized mothers may occur when GBS ascends the mother's vaginal tract, crosses the extraplacental membranes, and initiates an infection while the baby is still developing in utero. Alternatively, babies may be exposed during the birthing process by inhaling vaginal fluid containing GBS. Infected newborns may develop early-onset disease (EOD) within the first week following delivery, which usually presents as pneumonia and sepsis, or late-onset disease (LOD), which occurs from 1 week to 3 months after birth and generally presents as meningitis and sepsis. The risk of EOD can be reduced by administering antibiotics prophylactically to colonized mothers during delivery, but no treatment is currently available to mitigate the risk of GBS-related pregnancy complications or LOD in neonates.

### Prevalence of group B. streptococcus colonization in subsequent pregnancies of group B. streptococcus-colonized versus noncolonized women [^112KRi6k]. American Journal of Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether group B Streptococcus (GBS)-colonized pregnant women have an increased prevalence of GBS colonization in subsequent pregnancies.

Study Design

This retrospective cohort study compared the prevalence of GBS colonization in initial and subsequent pregnancies of 158 women with two or more deliveries at a Midwest institution since the initiation of universal screening for GBS.

Results

The GBS colonization rate in index pregnancies was 20%. Colonization rate in subsequent pregnancies for initially GBS-colonized women was 42% compared with 19% for women who were not colonized with GBS in the index pregnancy (p = 0.009). The relative risk for GBS-colonized women to be GBS-colonized in subsequent pregnancies was 2.2 (confidence interval = 1.3 to 3.8).

Conclusion

Previous GBS colonization is a risk factor for GBS colonization in subsequent pregnancies. Consideration of intrapartum chemoprophylaxis in women with a history of GBS colonization, assuming current colonization status is unknown, warrants further investigation.

### Risk of early-onset neonatal group B streptococcal disease with maternal colonization worldwide: systematic review and meta-analyses [^1114ud27]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Data Searches and Inputs

We identified data through systematic review of the published literature and through development of an investigator group of clinicians, researchers, and relevant professional institutions worldwide. For this article, all articles from a review of maternal GBS colonization were reviewed for inclusion here. In addition, we searched reference lists of clinical trials, and related systematic reviews (Supplementary Table 1). There were no date or language restrictions. Articles were screened by 2 authors (N. R. and C. O.), both of whom independently assessed the studies for quality and risk of bias, and a third author's opinion (A. S.) was requested in cases of differences of opinion.

Articles were included if they described a cohort of pregnant women with vaginal or rectovaginal GBS colonization, including newborn disease outcomes, and described use of IAP, including the proportion of pregnant women who received it (if any policy). Studies where women were not systematically screened for GBS colonization, but were provided with IAP based on clinical risk factors with unknown GBS colonization status, were not included. To reduce selection bias in studies with very small cohorts of pregnant women colonized with GBS, which could overestimate the risk of GBS disease through preferential reporting, articles were included if they reported outcomes from at least 200 pregnant women colonized with GBS. This was based on the 1%–2% risk of EOGBS previously reported, and the estimated number of women among whom there would be expected to be at least 1 case.

Studies were assessed for potential bias as reported in Supplementary Table 2. Articles were excluded if there was evidence of recruitment bias, such as studies where rectovaginal sampling was in response to clinical risk (which may overestimate disease risk).

We used random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the risk of EOGBS using the DerSimonian and Laird method. We examined the relationship between IAP coverage and risk of EOGBS with linear regression.

Sensitivity analyses were done to explore bias in studies that did not include reporting on clinical risk factors for EOGBS. These analyses included:

1. Excluding studies that did not report presence or absence of any clinical risk factors;
2. Excluding studies without information on gestational age;
3. Excluding studies without reporting of PROM;
4. Excluding studies without reporting of maternal fever.

These sensitivity analyses were applied to studies regardless of IAP policy and then to those with and without IAP for GBS colonization separately.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease: diagnosis, management, and prevention [^112c1uL7]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the upper genital tract occurring predominantly in sexually active young women. Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are common causes; however, other cervical, enteric, bacterial vaginosis-associated, and respiratory pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, may be involved. PID can be acute, chronic, or subclinical and is often underdiagnosed. Untreated PID can lead to chronic pelvic pain, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and intra-abdominal infections. The diagnosis is made primarily on clinical suspicion, and empiric treatment is recommended in sexually active young women or women at risk for sexually transmitted infections who have unexplained lower abdominal or pelvic pain and cervical motion, uterine, or adnexal tenderness on examination. Mild to moderate disease can be treated in an outpatient setting with a single intramuscular injection of a recommended cephalosporin followed by oral doxycycline for 14 days. Additionally, metronidazole is recommended for 14 days in the setting of bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, or recent uterine instrumentation. Hospitalization for parenteral antibiotics is recommended in patients who are pregnant or severely ill, in whom outpatient treatment has failed, those with tubo-ovarian abscess, or if surgical emergencies cannot be excluded. Treatment does not change in patients with intrauterine devices or those with HIV. Sex partner treatment is recommended; expedited partner treatment is recommended where legal. Prevention of PID includes screening for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae in all women younger than 25 years and those who are at risk or pregnant, plus intensive behavioral counseling for all adolescents and adults at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections.

### Uncertainties in screening and prevention of group B. streptococcus disease [^113mxjHo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

TESTING STRATEGIES FOR BACTERIAL LOAD/VIRULENCE — COLONIZATION TO INVASIVE DISEASE

It is recognized that a major barrier to screening and prophylaxis for GBS disease is that current tests detect GBS colonization in pregnant women rather than predict infant invasive disease. A better understanding of the factors that determine bacterial virulence and host susceptibility is needed in order to develop a microbiological test that better targets the women (and babies) who require antibiotic prophylaxis and prevent the administration of unnecessary antibiotics to the women and babies who would otherwise remain well. This research should entail completion of biological studies before technological issues (eg, development of cheaper PCR-based tests that incorporate antibiotic sensitivities) are addressed and any new microbiological tests are clinically evaluated.

There is a paucity of data regarding bacterial factors that influence transmission of GBS from mother to fetus and neonate, and of those factors that maintain homeostasis in the infant intestine or cause invasive disease. Recently, a number of virulence factors and GBS lineages such as hypervirulence clonal complex 17 and surface proteins (eg, Rib, Alp, and Pilus proteins) have been implicated in increased disease risk and colonization persistence. Additionally, the initial inoculum (the woman's bacterial load at the point of transmission) has also been associated with an increased risk of EOGBS. Additional insights such as these could allow targeted implementation of IAP to only those women who carry the variants of GBS that are most likely to cause EOGBS, thus reducing the IAP currently offered to all women with GBS colonization. Even less is understood about LOGBS. It is unclear whether LOGBS is predominantly derived from environmental sources (horizontal transmission) or whether the infant gut harbors pathogens that cause episodes of LOGBS as a result of genetic alterations after transmission, as has been described with other pathogens such as pneumococcus. A recent study of LOGBS in a single neonatal unit using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) suggested that the majority of cases in that setting were likely to reflect nosocomial transmission. Information about the characteristics of GBS that increase the risk of neonatal colonization and persistence may have important implications for more targeted IAP and for second-generation vaccine development. Such knowledge would also enable screening tests to be adapted toward these specific markers.

### Sexual activity, vaginal symptoms, maternal perineal hygiene behavior, and constipation on ano-vaginal colonization of group B. streptococcus in near term pregnancy [^114nCKUq]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The prevalence of ano-vaginal GBS colonization in late pregnancy in this study was 41.0%. This is at the upper end of the prevalence range reported in the literature. A study has reported a maternal GBS colonization rate as high as 43.6%, contemporary studies report a 37.3% at labor induction and 41.3% rate in women with HIV which was not different from their controls.

In our study, after adjustment, the factor with the strongest association for GBS colonization was previous neonatal GBS prophylaxis. Maternal GBS colonization in previous pregnancy has been consistently identified as a risk factor in other studies. Maternal GBS colonization is a common indication for neonatal GBS antibiotic prophylaxis.

Vaginal irritation and itchiness, but not vaginal discharge, was the factor with the next highest odds ratio for GBS colonization in this study. Symptomatic vaginitis has been described in two women heavily colonized with GBS. GBS colonization has also been associated with vulvitis. In non-pregnant women, vaginal GBS colonization is associated vaginal burning/pain but the association is not significant after adjustment for urinary tract, yeast, and herpes simplex virus 2 infections.

We found 'any antibiotic use in pregnancy; to be protective of GBS colonization after adjustment. Our findings corroborate those of a previous study that found the use of antibiotics active against GBS to be associated with a decreased rate of vaginal GBS colonization, but only when the rectum is not also colonized with GBS. In contrast, other studies find that antibiotic exposure in pregnancy is a risk factor for GBS colonization (in univariate analyses but not after adjustment), and also that prenatal antibiotic treatment does not decrease group B streptococcus colonization at delivery.

Coitus in the preceding two weeks was also found to be an independent risk factor of GBS colonization with a positive frequency-related trend. In support, in non-pregnant women, recent sexual intercourse increases the risk of vaginal GBS colonization and a doubling in sex acts significantly increased the incidence of some GBS types by 40–80%. In contrast, it has also been reported that sexual behavior does not predict vaginal colonization by GBS.

### Prevalence of group B. streptococcus colonization and potential for transmission by casual contact in healthy young men and women [^117MD6yu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) causes disease in newborns, pregnant women, and adults with underlying medical conditions, but it is also a commensal organism that commonly colonizes the bowel. In this study, the prevalence of colonization was high among 241 women (34%) and 211 men (20%) living in a college dormitory; sexually experienced subjects had twice the colonization rates of sexually inexperienced participants. Other predictors of colonization varied by colonization site. Only 10 of the 142 roommate pairs had roommates who were both colonized with GBS, and 20% of these pairs shared identical strains, which is the same rate predicted by the population distribution. By contrast, a previous report found that 86% of co-colonized sex partners shared identical strains. GBS is likely transmitted by intimate contact, but transmission modes may vary by colonization site. Large prospective studies are needed to better understand colonization site-specific factors for GBS and to clarify potential transmission modes.

### Vaginal and extra-vaginal bacterial colonization and risk for incident bacterial vaginosis in a population of women who have sex with men [^1172dPuf]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a highly prevalent condition associated with increased risk of sexually transmitted infections, preterm birth, pelvic inflammatory disease, and other sequelae. Bacterial vaginosis is characterized by a shift in the vaginal bacterial biota from one composed largely of Lactobacillus species to a microbiota with diverse anaerobic and facultative bacteria, here designated BV-associated bacteria (BVAB). It remains unclear how BVAB are acquired in the vagina and from what source. There is ongoing debate as to whether BV is a sexually transmitted infection with acquisition of BVAB from sexual partners, reflects vaginal inoculation from endogenous reservoirs in women, both, or some other process. A previous study in a cohort of women who have sex with women (WSW) demonstrated that colonization of extra-vaginal reservoirs with certain BVAB was associated with increased risk for incident BV. However, different sexual practices and exposures in women who have sex with men (WSM) could lead to different patterns of vaginal and extra-vaginal bacterial colonization that impact BV risk. We sought to examine the link between vaginal or extra-vaginal bacterial colonization and risk of incident BV in a second cohort focusing on WSM to assess generalizability of these findings. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) methods were used to detect bacterial colonization in the mouth, anus, vagina, and external genitalia (labia) of women who did not have BV at time of initial sampling; women were observed prospectively to assess subsequent incidence of BV and association with colonization status.

### Neonatal group B. streptococcus disease [^114jjbrS]. Pediatrics in Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is an important cause of neonatal sepsis in term and preterm infants. Because GBS colonizes human genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts, a significant focus of neonatal GBS disease prevention is to interrupt vertical transmission of GBS from mother to infant during parturition. Routine antepartum GBS screening in pregnant women, as well as widespread use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, have aided in overall reductions in neonatal GBS disease during the past 3 decades. However, neonatal GBS disease persists and may cause mortality and significant short- and long-term morbidity among survivors. Herein, we highlight contemporary epidemiology, microbial pathogenesis, and the clinical presentation spectrum associated with neonatal GBS disease. We summarize obstetric recommendations for antenatal GBS screening, indications for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, and considerations for antibiotic selection. Finally, we review national guidelines for risk assessment and management of infants at risk for GBS disease.

### Challenges in reducing group B. streptococcus disease in African settings [^113cMWmw]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Universal screening strategy

All pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy (ideally 35–37 weeks gestation) are offered screening for GBS colonisation. This method is recommended by the CDC and is practised widely throughout the USA. Those identified as GBS carriers are treated with antibiotics during labour. Women with GBS bacteriuria during the current pregnancy or a previous infant with invasive GBS disease also receive IAP, without the need for screening. As a result, the incidence of GBS EOD has declined dramatically, from 1.7 cases per 1000 live births in the early 1990sto 0.27 cases per 1000 live births by 2014.

Risk-based approach

Several risk factors are associated with increased risk of EOD in the newborn, including preterm labour, PROM > 18 hours, intrapartum fever > 38°C, GBS bacteriuria in the mothers during the current pregnancy and previous sibling with invasive GBS disease. Several countries adopt a strategy to implement IAP when some or all of these risks are identified.

The UK Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence do not recommend routine bacteriological screening of all pregnant women, although if GBS is detected on an incidental vaginal swab or urine culture then IAP is recommended. This reflects the view that the incidence of EOD will not reduce any further with the introduction of universal screening for GBS in pregnancy; the incidence of EOD in the UK under the risk-based approach is 0.5/1000, which is similar to that of the USA, which employs universal screening. Recently published surveillance data, however, indicate a small but possible rise in the incidence of EOD (per 1000 live births) in European countries, including from 0.30 in 1991 to 0.41 in 2010 in the UK, and from 0.11 in 1987 to 0.19 in 2011 in the Netherlands.

### Surveillance of patients at increased risk of colon cancer: inflammatory bowel disease and other conditions [^114LXavR]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. Colonoscopic screening with removal of adenomatous polyps in individuals at average risk is known to decrease the incidence and associated mortality from colon cancer. Certain conditions, notably inflammatory bowel disease involving the colon, a family history of polyps or cancer, a personal history of colon cancer or polyps, and other conditions such as acromegaly, ureterosigmoidostomy, and Streptococcus bovis bacteremia are associated with an increased risk of colonic neoplasia. This article reviews the CRC risks associated with these conditions and the currently recommended surveillance strategies.

### Gestational diabetes augments group B. streptococcus infection by disrupting maternal immunity and the vaginal microbiota [^115KQnAP]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Maternal metabolic disorders including obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are associated with a 1.4 to 3.1-fold increased risk for maternal GBS colonization, and a 3 to 5-fold increased risk for GBS maternal and neonatal sepsis. This clinical evidence implies the maternal diabetic environment is altered in favor of GBS colonization and dissemination, but the factors driving this phenomenon are unknown. Spontaneous hyperglycemia and insulin intolerance are pathophysiological hallmarks of GDMand are frequently accompanied by maternal systemic immune dysregulation. Most clinical studies focused on maternal peripheral immune profiles and serum biomarkers. Observed differences include increased circulating T helper cell subsets and NK cells in GDM patients with a shift from anti-inflammatory to pro-inflammatory profiles – in tandem with increased serum inflammatory mediators and cytokines –. Although increased placental macrophages and neutrophils are observed in GDM pregnancies, GDM perturbations to reproductive immunity are not well-characterized. Furthermore, GDM is accompanied by altered maternal fecal and vaginal microbiome compositions which may further aggravate mucosal dysfunction –. These clinical findings suggest discordant host-microbe interactions in the GDM mucosa may provide an advantage to pathogens, such as GBS, over commensal microbes.

Here, we show that a diet-induced gestational diabetic model mirrors the pathophysiology of GBS disease in GDM, specifically through aberrant maternal immunity, differential GBS transcriptional adaptation, and altered composition of the vaginal microbiota during pregnancy. Considering the altered metabolic, immune, and microbial profiles in gestational diabetes compared to non-diabetic pregnancy, we hypothesized that GDM perturbations to host physiology contribute to increased host susceptibility and augmented GBS virulence. To test this hypothesis, we developed a mouse model of GBS vaginal colonization and the natural course of maternal-to-offspring transmission in a gestational diabetic host. Using this model, we performed integrative analysis of GBS burden and transmission, host and GBS global transcriptional profiling, reproductive tract cytokine and immune cell profiles, and longitudinal 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of the vaginal microbiota during pregnancy. These findings advance our current mechanistic viewpoint on host and GBS factors that drive GBS disease in pregnancies impacted by diabetes.

### Immune modulation by group B. streptococcus influences host susceptibility to urinary tract infection by uropathogenic Escherichia coli [^114REjZn]. Infection and Immunity (2012). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is most often caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). UPEC inoculation into the female urinary tract (UT) can occur through physical activities that expose the UT to an inherently polymicrobial periurethral, vaginal, or gastrointestinal flora. We report that a common urogenital inhabitant and opportunistic pathogen, group B Streptococcus (GBS), when present at the time of UPEC exposure, undergoes rapid UPEC-dependent exclusion from the murine urinary tract, yet it influences acute UPEC-host interactions and alters host susceptibility to persistent outcomes of bladder and kidney infection. GBS presence results in increased UPEC titers in the bladder lumen during acute infection and reduced inflammatory responses of murine macrophages to live UPEC or purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS), phenotypes that require GBS mimicry of host sialic acid residues. Taken together, these studies suggest that despite low titers, the presence of GBS at the time of polymicrobial UT exposure may be an overlooked risk factor for chronic pyelonephritis and recurrent UTI in susceptible groups, even if it is outcompeted and thus absent by the time of diagnosis.

Pelvic Inflammatory Disease

PID comprises a spectrum of inflammatory disorders of the upper female genital tract, including any combination of endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess, and pelvic peritonitis. Sexually transmitted organisms, especially N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis, often are implicated. Recent studies report that the proportion of PID cases attributable to N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis is decreasing; of women who received a diagnosis of acute PID, approximately 50% have a positive test for either of those organisms. Micro-organisms that comprise the vaginal flora, such as strict and facultative anaerobes and G. vaginalis, H. influenzae, enteric gram-negative rods, and Streptococcus agalactiae, have been associated with PID. In addition, cytomegalovirus (CMV), T. vaginalis, M. hominis, and U. urealyticum might be associated with certain PID cases. Data also indicate that M. genitalium might have a role in PID pathogenesis and might be associated with milder symptoms, although one study failed to demonstrate a substantial increase in PID after detection of M. genitalium in the lower genital tract.

Screening and treating sexually active women for chlamydia and gonorrhea reduces their risk for PID. Although BV is associated with PID, whether PID incidence can be reduced by identifying and treating women with BV is unclear. Whether screening young women for M. genitalium is associated with a reduction in PID is unknown.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease [^116Cuuxg]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection-caused inflammatory continuum from the cervix to the peritoneal cavity. Most importantly, it is associated with fallopian tube inflammation, which can lead to infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain. The microbial etiology is linked to sexually transmitted microorganisms, including Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrheae, Mycoplasma genitalium, and bacterial vaginosis-associated microorganisms, predominantly anaerobes. Pelvic pain and fever are commonly absent in women with confirmed PID. Clinicians should consider milder symptoms such as abnormal vaginal discharge, metrorrhagia, postcoital bleeding, and urinary frequency as potential symptoms associated with the disease, particularly in women at risk of sexually transmitted infection. The diagnosis of PID is based on the findings of lower genital tract inflammation associated with pelvic organ tenderness. The outpatient treatment of mild-to-moderate PID should include tolerated antibiotic regimens with activity against the commonly isolated microorganisms associated with PID and usually consists of an extended spectrum cephalosporin in conjunction with either doxycycline or azithromycin. Clinically severe PID should prompt hospitalization and imaging to rule out a tuboovarian abscess. Parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with activity against a polymicrobial flora, particularly gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes, should be implemented. Screening for and treatment of Chlamydia infection can prevent PID.

### Subclinical pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility [^115eJ4Pr]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The reported incidence of acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) has decreased but rates of tubal infertility have not, suggesting that a large proportion of PID leading to infertility may be undetected. Subclinical PID is common in women with uncomplicated chlamydial or gonococcal cervicitis or with bacterial vaginosis. We assessed whether women with subclinical PID are at an increased risk for infertility.

Methods

A prospective observational cohort of 418 women with or at risk for gonorrhea or chlamydia or with bacterial vaginosis was recruited. Women with acute PID were excluded. An endometrial biopsy was performed to identify endometritis (subclinical PID). After provision of therapy for gonorrhea, chlamydia and bacterial vaginosis participants were followed-up for fertility outcomes.

Results

There were 146 incident pregnancies during follow-up, 50 pregnancies in 120 (42%) women with subclinical PID and 96 in 187 (51%) women without subclinical PID. Women with subclinical PID diagnosed at enrollment had a 40% reduced incidence of pregnancy compared with women without subclinical PID (hazard ratio 0.6, 95% confidence interval 0.4–0.8). Women with Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis, in the absence of subclinical PID, were not at increased risk for infertility.

Conclusion

Subclinical PID decreases subsequent fertility despite provision of treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. These findings suggest that a proportion of female infertility is attributable to subclinical PID and indicate that current therapies for sexually transmitted diseases are inadequate for prevention of infertility.

GBS AS A PATHOGEN IN HUMANS ACROSS THE LIFESPAN

Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus, GBS) is a Gram-positive bacterial species that causes disease in humans across the lifespan. Patient populations impacted by GBS include pregnant people, neonates, fetuses, and adults/children with underlying health conditions. The incidence of GBS disease in non-pregnant adults, in particular, rose from 8.1 cases per 100,000 people in 2008 to 10.9 cases per 100,000 people in 2016 in the United States, which highlights one important facet of the increasing disease burden imposed by GBS.

GBS can cause disease in the form of invasive GBS (iGBS) disease at diverse body sites (Fig. 1A). GBS is most commonly considered to be a pathogen of pregnant people, fetuses, and neonates. GBS can asymptomatically colonize the female reproductive tract (FRT) and gastrointestinal (GI) tract and is a common cause of urinary tract infections (UTIs), chorioamnionitis, post-partum endometritis, and bacteremia in pregnant patients, both during pregnancy and postpartum. During gestation, GBS can ascend the FRT to colonize the placenta and amniotic fluid resulting in chorioamnionitis. Chroioamminoitis is associated with higher chances of stillbirth and preterm birth, which increases the chances of neonatal death. In addition, pregnant people who are GBS+ can transmit GBS to the newborn during vaginal delivery, where GBS is the leading cause of neonatal sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis, causing significant morbidity and mortality worldwide.

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease – revised guidelines from CDC, 2010 [^117QxipC]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Despite substantial progress in prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal (GBS) disease since the 1990s, GBS remains the leading cause of early-onset neonatal sepsis in the United States. In 1996, CDC, in collaboration with relevant professional societies, published guidelines for the prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease (CDC. Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease: a public health perspective. MMWR 1996;45[No. RR-7]); those guidelines were updated and republished in 2002 (CDC. Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease: revised guidelines from CDC. MMWR 2002;51[No. RR-11]). In June 2009, a meeting of clinical and public health representatives was held to reevaluate prevention strategies on the basis of data collected after the issuance of the 2002 guidelines. This report presents CDC's updated guidelines, which have been endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Nurse-Midwives, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American Society for Microbiology. The recommendations were made on the basis of available evidence when such evidence was sufficient and on expert opinion when available evidence was insufficient. The key changes in the 2010 guidelines include the following:

- expanded recommendations on laboratory methods for the identification of GBS,
- clarification of the colony-count threshold required for reporting GBS detected in the urine of pregnant women,
- updated algorithms for GBS screening and intrapartum chemoprophylaxis for women with preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of membranes,
- a change in the recommended dose of penicillin-G for chemoprophylaxis,
- updated prophylaxis regimens for women with penicillin allergy, and
- a revised algorithm for management of newborns with respect to risk for early-onset GBS disease. Universal screening at 35–37 weeks' gestation for maternal GBS colonization and use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis has resulted in substantial reductions in the burden of early-onset GBS disease among newborns. Although early-onset GBS disease has become relatively uncommon in recent years, the rates of maternal GBS colonization (and therefore the risk for early-onset GBS disease in the absence of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis) remain unchanged since the 1970s. Continued efforts are needed to sustain and improve on the progress achieved in the prevention of GBS disease. There also is a need to monitor for potential adverse consequences of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (e.g., emergence of bacterial antimicrobial resistance or increased incidence or severity of non-GBS neonatal pathogens). In the absence of a licensed GBS vaccine, universal screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis continue to be the cornerstones of early-onset GBS disease prevention.

### Etiology and diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease: looking beyond gonorrhea and Chlamydia [^1164o5XH]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a clinical syndrome that has been associated with a wide range of potential causal pathogens. Three broad groups of organisms have been isolated from the genital tract of people with PID: sexually transmitted organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, and Trichomonas vaginalis; bacterial vaginosis (BV)-associated species and genera such as Atopobium vaginae, Sneathia, and Megasphaera; and genera and species usually associated with the gastrointestinal or respiratory tracts such as Bacteroides, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus, or Haemophilus influenza. Although PID is often considered to be synonymous with gonorrhea or chlamydia, these pathogens are found in only one quarter to one third of people with PID, suggesting that broader screening and diagnostic and treatment strategies need to be considered to reduce the burden of PID and its associated sequelae.

### Immune responses to Neisseria gonorrhoeae: challenges and opportunities with respect to pelvic inflammatory disease [^11782y1s]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility frequently develop after female genital tract infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but determining their etiology from among various possibilities presents difficulties. Exploitation of serology to identify the causative agent is complicated by numerous factors, and no immunological test currently exists to determine unequivocally whether an individual currently is, or has been, infected with N. gonorrhoeae. The extensive antigenic variability of N. gonorrhoeae and its expression of antigens shared with other Neisseria species commonly carried in humans render problematic an assay that is specific for all gonococcal strains. However, novel conserved gonococcal antigens identified for potential vaccines may find additional application in diagnostic assays. N. gonorrhoeae also interferes with the adaptive immune response, and antibody responses to uncomplicated infection are usually weak. Elucidating the mechanisms whereby N. gonorrhoeae manipulates the human immune system may lead to improved understanding of the pathogenesis of pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility.

### Rectal colonization by group B. streptococcus as a predictor of vaginal colonization [^113xAa2H]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article was to describe rectal colonization by group B Streptococcus (GBS) and its role in the prediction of vaginal colonization.

Study Design

In this prospective cohort of 1248 nonpregnant women, vaginal and rectal swabs for GBS culture were obtained at enrollment and at three 4-month intervals. Generalized estimating equations were used to identify factors that are associated with colonization.

Results

Eight hundred fourteen (65%) women had GBS colonization sometime during the observation period. Rectal GBS colonization was the strongest predictor of vaginal colonization (adjusted odds ratio, 14.3; 95% CI, 11.9–17.1). Recent sexual intercourse, vaginal colonization with yeast, and a vaginal Nugent score ≥ 4 were also independent determinants of vaginal GBS colonization. Antimicrobial use decreased vaginal GBS colonization only among women who had no rectal colonization.

Conclusion

GBS in the gastrointestinal tract is a risk factor for vaginal GBS. Sexual activity and abnormal vaginal microflora are independent determinants of vaginal GBS colonization.

### Intrapartum antibiotics for known maternal group B streptococcal colonization [^1135W46b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Maternal colonization with group B streptococcus (GBS) during pregnancy increases the risk of neonatal infection by vertical transmission. Administration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) during labor has been associated with a reduction in early onset GBS disease (EOGBSD). However, treating all colonized women during labor exposes a large number of women and infants to possible adverse effects without benefit.

Objectives

To assess the effect of intrapartum antibiotics for maternal Group B haemolytic streptococci (GBS) colonization on mortality from any cause, from GBS infection and from organisms other than GBS.

Search Methods

We updated the search of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register on 11 March 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials assessing the impact of maternal IAP on neonatal GBS infections were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently assessed eligibility and quality of the studies.

Main Results

We did not identify any new trials from the updated search so the results remain unchanged as follows. We included four trials involving 852 women. Three trials (involving 500 women) evaluating the effects of IAP versus no treatment were included. The use of IAP did not significantly reduce the incidence of all cause mortality, mortality from GBS infection or from infections caused by bacteria other than GBS. The incidence of early GBS infection was reduced with IAP compared to no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 0.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.74, three trials, 488 infants; risk difference -0.04, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.01; number needed to treat to benefit 25, 95% CI 14 to 100, I² 0%). The incidence of LOD or sepsis from organisms other than GBS and puerperal infection was not significantly different between groups. One trial (involving 352 women) compared intrapartum ampicillin versus penicillin and reported no significant difference in neonatal or maternal outcomes. We found a high risk of bias for one or more key domains in the study methodology and execution.

Authors' Conclusions

Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis appeared to reduce EOGBSD, but this result may well be due to bias as we found a high risk of bias for one or more key domains in the study methodology and execution. There is lack of evidence from well designed and conducted trials to recommend IAP to reduce neonatal EOGBSD. Ideally the effectiveness of IAP to reduce neonatal GBS infections should be studied in adequately sized double-blind controlled trials. The opportunity to conduct such trials has likely been lost, as practice guidelines (albeit without good evidence) have been introduced in many jurisdictions.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117CjqAr]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Screening tests and intervals — pregnancy urine culture thresholds: Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy is done with urine culture at 12 to 16 weeks of gestation or at the first prenatal visit; urine culture is currently recommended for screening in pregnancy and is the established method for diagnosis. A culture obtained using a midstream, clean-catch urine sample with greater than 100 000 colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter of a single uropathogen is considered a positive test result, and greater than 10 000 CFU/mL of group B Streptococcus is an indicator of vaginal colonization and is commonly used as the threshold for treatment of infection in pregnancy. There is little evidence on the optimal timing and frequency of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy.

### Intrauterine devices-upper and lower genital tract infections [^112w1vcj]. Contraception (2007). Low credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of a pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is notoriously difficult. The incidence rate of PIDs among intrauterine device (IUD) users as reported from different studies depends heavily on the definition used and the means available for diagnosing PIDs. It varies by almost 10-fold from 1 per 100 to 1 per 1000 woman-years in different publications. PID risk has been found to be 6-fold higher in the first month after IUD insertion than it is thereafter. It is not known if the overall PID risk in IUD users beyond the first month of IUD insertion is higher than that in nonusers; however, if it is higher, the additional risk is small. The PID risk in IUD users is modified by the number of sexual partners of the IUD user and that of her partner(s), community prevalence of STDs and age of the IUD user. Bacterial vaginosis appears not to be associated with IUD use. Overall, bacterial vaginosis is not associated with PIDs, but specific subgroups of patients with BV that may be difficult to identify clinically are at an increased risk for PIDs. Because of the long duration of use of current copper IUDs, replacement of the IUD is infrequent and insertion-associated PIDs should consequently also be less frequent. IUD use has become safer with respect to PIDs through more effective screening and counseling procedures described in current guidelines for the initiation of IUD use. Current guidance must be followed to preserve the IUD as a safe contraceptive method.

### Clinical risk factors associated with late-onset invasive group B streptococcal disease: systematic review and meta-analyses [^115jr3Ur]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Two review authors (K. K. H. D.) independently scanned the abstract, title, or both, of every record retrieved to determine which studies should be assessed further. We investigated all potentially relevant articles as full text and resolved any discrepancies through consensus. For studies that fulfilled eligibility criteria, 2 review authors (K. K. H. D.) independently abstracted key data on maternal colonization in pregnancy (defined as a positive vaginal, rectal, or rectovaginal swab by culture or polymerase chain reaction [PCR] on at least 1 occasion from 35 weeks of gestation until birth), maternal colonization at the time of LOGBS diagnosis, preterm birth (delivery at < 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (LBW < 2500 g), multiple-gestation pregnancy, maternal age < 20 years, infant sex, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exposure, GBS detected in mother's breast milk at the time of LOGBS diagnosis, maternal intrapartum fever (temperature ≥ 38°C during labor), and prolonged rupture of membranes (PROM ≥ 18 hours before delivery). We used published aggregate data, not individual participant data. When the existing published data included cases isolated from non-sterile sites or with an age of onset ≥ 90 days, we contacted the original researchers to ask for a summary of cases that met our inclusion criteria. We collected data on the number of preterm births, LBW, multiple births, and sex ratio in the study population, either from the reports included in the articles or from the publicly available national statistics services and previously published systematic reviews that used these data sets. For national surveillance studies, the number of live births for the whole population for that period was used as the denominator. For studies reporting cases from multi-site surveillance programs, regional data were used as the denominator. When population data were not available for the entire duration of the study, a midpoint year was used. Due to a lack of population-wide studies on maternal GBS colonization, we used the pooled estimates of GBS colonization prevalence by country from a systematic review conducted in 2015.

Quality Assessment

Two review authors (K. K. M. M.) assessed the risk of bias of each included study independently by using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) (Supplementary Table 2). We resolved any disagreements by consensus.

### Concerns regarding the centers for disease control's published guidelines for pelvic inflammatory disease [^111U5c65]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The International-Infectious Disease Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology-USA (I-IDSOG-USA) has concerns about the most recently published Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). I-IDSOG-USA advocates the following changes when the guidelines are revised. We recommend the use of the term "upper genital tract infection" (UGTI), followed by the designation of the etiologic agent, instead of the currently employed term, "pelvic inflammatory disease", or PID. In diagnoses, there should be greater emphasis on signs and symptoms related to subclinical or occult UGTI. Therapeutic recommendation for the treatment of UGTI should be documented for various stages of this diverse disease entity. There should be greater emphasis on hospitalization for infected nulligravida teenagers. This permits monitoring of antibiotic treatment and provides a site for medical educational efforts to teach this medically underserved segment of our society how to protect their future fertility, their health, and their lives.

### Recurrence of group B streptococci colonization in subsequent pregnancy [^112ZRKHV]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the prevalence of group B streptococci (GBS) colonization in a subsequent pregnancy in women with and without GBS colonization in an index pregnancy.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study of women who had two consecutive deliveries with the availability of GBS culture result at 35 to 37 weeks of gestation or the diagnosis of GBS colonization by urine culture for both pregnancies was undertaken. Women in the index pregnancy with GBS genitourinary tract colonization were compared by culture date with the next woman that screened negative for GBS colonization. To detect a doubling of GBS colonization from 20% to 40% would require 91 women in each arm at P < .05 with a power of 80%. Risk factors for GBS colonization were ascertained. Univariable and conditional logistic regression analyses were performed. P < .05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

A total of 102 women positive for GBS genitourinary colonization were compared with controls. The rate of recurrence for GBS colonization (53%) was significantly higher when judged against women GBS negative in their index pregnancy (15%) (adjusted odds ratio 11.7, 95% confidence interval 3.5–38.9, P < .01). Women who were GBS positive in the index pregnancy were more often of African-American race and less likely to be nulliparous or smoke tobacco.

Conclusion

Women with GBS colonization are at increased risk of GBS colonization in a subsequent pregnancy. Prior GBS colonization should be considered in the algorithm to treat unknown GBS status during term labor.

### Copper (paraGard T 380A) [^1121ZXaY]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.3 Sepsis

Severe infection or sepsis, including Group A streptococcal sepsis (GAS), have been reported following insertion of IUSs, including Paragard. In some cases, severe pain occurred within hours of insertion followed by sepsis within days. Because death from GAS is more likely if treatment is delayed, it is important to be aware of these rare but serious infections. Aseptic technique during insertion of Paragard is essential in order to minimize serious infections such as GAS [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

5.4 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease and Endometritis

Insertion of Paragard is contraindicated in the presence of known or suspected Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) or endometritis [see Contraindications (4)]. IUSs, including Paragard, have been associated with an increased risk of PID, most likely due to organisms being introduced into the uterus during insertion. In the clinical trials with Paragard, the incidence of PID that resulted in the removal of Paragard was approximately 0.1% [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Counsel women who receive Paragard to notify a healthcare provider if they have complaints of lower abdominal or pelvic pain, odorous discharge, unexplained bleeding, fever, or genital lesions or sores. In such circumstances, perform a pelvic examination promptly to evaluate for possible pelvic infection.

Remove Paragard in cases of recurrent PID or endometritis, or if an acute pelvic infection is severe or does not respond to treatment.

PID can have serious consequences, such as tubal damage (leading to ectopic pregnancy or infertility), hysterectomy, sepsis, and death.

Females at Increased Risk for PID

PID or endometritis are often associated with a sexually transmitted infection (STI) and Paragard does not protect against STIs. The risk of PID or endometritis is greater for females who have multiple sexual partners, and also for females whose sexual partner(s) have multiple sexual partners. Females who have had PID or endometritis are at increased risk for a recurrence or re-infection. In particular, ascertain whether a female is at increased risk of infection (for example, leukemia, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), intravenous drug abuse).

### Risk factors associated with pelvic inflammatory disease [^112jZnXM]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate factors associated with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

Methods

A case-control study was used to investigate demographic and behavioural factors, and causative agents associated with PID.

Results

A total of 381 participants were recruited: 140 patients, and 105 and 136 controls in tubal ligation and general practice groups, respectively. When compared with a PID-free tubal ligation control group, increased risk of PID was associated with: age < 25 years; age at first sexual intercourse < 20 years; non-white ethnicity; not having had children; a self-reported history of a sexually transmitted disease; and exposure to Chlamydia trachomatis. When compared with a general practice control group, increased risk was associated with: age < 25 years; age at first sexual intercourse < 15 years; lower socioeconomic status; being single; adverse pregnancy outcome; a self-reported history of a sexually transmitted disease; and exposure to C trachomatis. Of the cases, 64% were not associated with any of the infectious agents measured in this study (idiopathic).

Conclusions

A high proportion of cases were idiopathic. PID control strategies, which currently focus on chlamydial screening, have to be reviewed so that they can prevent all cases of PID. Behavioural change is a key factor in the primary prevention of PID, and potential modifiable risk factors were associated with PID.

### Risk of early-onset neonatal group B streptococcal disease with maternal colonization worldwide: systematic review and meta-analyses [^112cNJ3Y]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

In the context of a policy of IAP for GBS colonization, studies did not consistently report the timing of administration of IAP, so analysis of the varying risk of invasive disease with the timing of the first antibiotic dose before delivery was not possible).

Multiple sensitivity analyses were done to explore potential bias from the lack of reporting of clinical risk factors for EOGBS. These were as follows:

Excluding Studies That Did Not Report Presence or Absence of Any Clinical Risk Factors

The risk of EOGBS did not differ significantly between studies that reported risk factors and those that did not, as shown by overlapping confidence intervals (Supplementary Table 4). Excluding studies that did not report any risk factor, the risk of EOGBS without IAP for GBS colonization was 0.9% (95% CI,.4%–1.4%). Including all studies regardless of IAP policy, overall risk was also not significantly different (0.3 [95% CI,.1–.4] in all vs 0.3 [95% CI,.1–.5] if reporting a risk factor).

Excluding Studies Without Information on Gestational Age

The risk without IAP for GBS colonization among studies reporting gestational age of newborns was 0.9 (95% CI,.2–1.5).

Excluding Studies Without Reporting of Prolonged Rupture of Membranes

The risk without IAP for GBS colonization among studies reporting prevalence of PROM was 0.8 (95% CI,.5–1.5).

Excluding Studies Without Reporting of Maternal Fever

The risk without IAP for GBS colonization among studies reporting maternal fever was comparable to the primary analysis (1.4 [95% CI,.4–2.3]).

The outputs of these analyses, as well as the same analyses but including studies with IAP policies, and all studies, are summarized in Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Figures 2–6). These outputs were also comparable to the primary analysis.

### Uncertainties in screening and prevention of group B. streptococcus disease [^112QC2ar]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Policies for GBS screening vary among countries, with some offering universal screening (eg, through microbiological testing) to all pregnant women and others undertaking this selectively. In the United Kingdom, the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (RCOG) and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommendations have been to offer IAP to women identified as having the following risk factors for GBS: previous baby with invasive GBS infection, GBS bacteriuria in the current pregnancy, vaginal or rectal swab positive for GBS in the current pregnancy, or maternal intrapartum pyrexia above 38°C. However, the recent national surveillance study showed that only 35% of a cohort of 429 UK and Irish cases with EOGBS disease had 1 or more of these risk factors compared to 65% in the 2000–2001 study. Since this surveillance was undertaken, the RCOG guidelines have been updated (in 2017). These revised guidelines now include preterm labor as an additional risk factor for the offer of IAP and a recommendation for women who have previously had a positive GBS result to either be treated as a carrier in the current pregnancy or to offer repeat testing and IAP if appropriate. This could potentially add up to 12% more women to the proportion who might be offered IAP. Nevertheless, a risk factor–based approach provides only limited protection against invasive EOGBS disease in the infant.

In around half of high-income countries, women who are not already identified as at increased risk of their baby developing EOGBS are offered a test for GBS colonization at 35–37 weeks of gestation ("universal screening"), with subsequent IAP for those whose swab is positive for GBS (around 18%–20%). Both the risk-based and universal screening approaches entail giving IAP to a substantial proportion of pregnant women, the great majority of whom would not have had an affected baby even without the IAP.

Further uncertainties exist in how best to detect those infants at risk of both EOGBS and LOGBS infection. Current test-based screening is developed to identify maternal GBS colonization rather than neonatal or infant invasive disease. The risk factors used to identify women who should be offered IAP are generic clinical risk factors and are not sensitive or specific for EOGBS.

### Beta hemolytic Streptococcus group f causing pelvic inflammatory disease in a 14-year-old girl [^114kd245]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Pelvic inflammatory disease in prepubertal and non-sexually active adolescents is rare and poorly understood. Various organisms have been named as causative agents in adolescent pelvic infections. Early diagnosis and treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease in young girls is imperative to future fertility and long term sequela.

Case

We present a 14-year-old, menarchal, non-sexually active female with a 3-week history of abdominal pain and fever. Surgical exploration and cultures revealed Stage IV pelvic inflammatory disease caused by Beta Streptococcus Group F.

Conclusion

Various organisms including Streptococcal infections should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease in young girls without risk factors.

Revised Recommendations for Preventing Perinatal Group B Streptococcal Disease

Data developed through ABCs provided a basis for revising recommendations for the prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal (GBS) disease. Since its emergence in the 1970s, GBS disease has been the leading invasive bacterial infection associated with illness and death among newborns in the United States. Surviving infants may have long-term developmental disabilities, such as mental retardation or hearing and vision loss. Newborns at increased risk for GBS disease are those born to women who are colonized with GBS in the genital or rectal areas. Although the use of intrapartum prophylaxis has led to a 70% decline in the incidence of GBS disease during the 1990s (Figure 2), early-onset GBS disease (in infants < 7 days old) remains a leading cause of illness and death among newborns. Guidelines issued in 1996 recommended either screening pregnant women for GBS colonization by means of prenatal cultures (screening approach) or assessing obstetric risk factors intrapartum (risk-based approach) to identify candidates for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for premature rupture of membranes, more specifically with respect to evaluation for GBS colonization, SOGC 2018 guidelines recommend to screen for colonization with group B streptococcus in all females at 35–37 weeks of gestation with culture taken from one swab first to the vagina and then to the rectum through the anal sphincter,
including females with planned Cesarean delivery because of their risk of labor or ruptured membranes earlier than the scheduled Cesarean delivery.

### Gestational diabetes as a risk factor for GBS maternal rectovaginal colonization: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116GDPYa]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) remains a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality across the globe despite nearly two decades of systematic implementation of preventative approaches that include universal maternal screening or risk-based administration of antibiotics during delivery. GBS colonizes the vaginal and/or gastrointestinal tract of about 18% of pregnant women. Neonates can acquire GBS during passage through the vaginal canal during delivery, and GBS also has the capacity to cause ascending intraamniotic infection. While some women and their neonates are colonized without symptoms, GBS can cause devastating complications and disease such as spontaneous abortion, preterm labor, stillbirth, and neonatal sepsis and meningitis. The mechanisms driving the divergence in GBS pathogenic vs. commensal behavior is poorly understood. Currently, the following maternal factors are clinically recognized for increasing the risk of GBS neonatal disease and are used to identify women who should be given intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP): (1) previous infant with early-onset GBS disease (EOGBS), (2) GBS bacteriuria during the current pregnancy, (3) temperature > 38 °C during labor, (4) prolonged rupture of membranes (PROM) > 18 h, or (5) delivery at < 37 weeks of gestation. Some countries practice this risk-based approach and others implement universal screening of women around 35 weeks of gestation, with subsequent IAP for those who have rectovaginal GBS carriage. Screening based approaches are associated with enhanced protection against neonatal GBS early onset disease (EOD; occurring in the first week of life) compared to risk-based strategies, which suggests that we have yet to understand all of the maternal factors that predict GBS disease. Additionally, up to 46% of cases of EOD occur in the absence of the risk factors currently used for clinical decision making.

### Gonococcal pelvic inflammatory disease: placing mechanistic insights into the context of clinical and epidemiological observations [^112hvY17]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

While infection by Neisseria gonorrhoeae is often asymptomatic in women, undetected infections can ascend into the upper genital tract to elicit an inflammatory response that manifests as pelvic inflammatory disease, with the outcomes depending on the intensity and duration of inflammation and whether it is localized to the endometrial, fallopian tube, ovarian, and/or other tissues. This review examines the contribution of N. gonorrhoeae versus other potential causes of pelvic inflammatory disease by considering new insights gained through molecular, immunological, and microbiome-based analyses, and the current epidemiological burden of infection, with an aim to highlighting key areas for future study.

Figure 2:
proportion of GBS serotypes, by visit, detected by rectal and vaginal swabs. Percent serotype calculated using the total number of isolates at each visit as the denominator.

Dynamics in colonization are detailed in Supplementary Data. From 66 participants (94.3%) who completed three or more study visits: 33 (50.0%) were persistently negative throughout the study, and three (4.5%) were persistently positive. Four (6.1%) were positive at one visit only, with the remaining visits GBS negative, and a further four were negative only once during the study with the remaining visits GBS positive. 11 participants (16.7%) moved between positivity and negativity. Nine participants (13.6%) who were initially positive became and remained negative. Two participants (3.0%) were initially negative, then became and remained positive.

When considering the time between the first positive and first negative swab, the probability of remaining positive dropped to 50% after 36 days (Figure 3A). However, when considering participants that cleared GBS by the end of the study, there was still a 50% chance of being colonized after 92 days (Figure 3B).

The upper bound of IQR in the right-hand panel is out of data range and not computable.

Of the 22 individuals taking the combined oral contraceptive pill and completing the study, nine (40.9%) were colonized with GBS at one or multiple time points, and 13 (59.1%) remained non-colonized throughout. Of the five individuals taking progesterone only pill and completing the study, two (40%) were colonized with GBS at multiple time points, three (60%) remained non-colonized.

### Group B. streptococcus (GBS) colonization is dynamic over time, whilst GBS capsular polysaccharides-specific antibody remains stable [^115oZVpo]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Infection is one of the most important causes of adverse pregnancy outcomes, with group B Streptococcus (GBS) a leading cause of invasive neonatal disease, maternal infection, stillbirth, and premature delivery worldwide. The estimated incidence rate of invasive neonatal GBS disease in the UK ranges from 0.94 to 1.28 per 1000 live births. Maternal rectovaginal or urogenital colonization with GBS is a prerequisite for early-onset neonatal disease (within the first 6 days of life), with vertical transmission occurring around the time of birth. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) is the only method of disease control currently available. IAP policies are poorly sensitive and specific at identifying neonates with invasive disease, resulting in both missed cases and unnecessary antibiotic administration. For example, a UK study found that 65% of babies who developed a early-onset disease were born to mothers with no sepsis risk factors.

Given the shortcomings of IAP strategies, novel methods of GBS control are urgently required. The World Health Organization considers the development of a maternal GBS vaccine a high priority, and there are currently several potential candidates. One challenge with establishing vaccine efficacy against invasive neonatal disease as a primary endpoint is the very large number of pregnant women who would need to be recruited to phase 3 studies. Efforts are underway to develop a controlled human infection model (CHIM) for GBS to gain further insight into host–pathogen interactions. A GBS CHIM could provide the opportunity to improve our understanding of immune parameters associated with different clinical outcomes (colonization, disease), and ultimately appropriate serocorrelates of protection. A validated serocorrelate of protection could provide a potential surrogate endpoint for vaccine efficacy studies.

The current study investigated longitudinal variation in GBS rectovaginal colonization, serum and vaginal GBS capsular polysaccharide (CPS)-specific IgG, and CPS-specific IgA response in the nasal mucosa.

### Risk of early-onset neonatal group B streptococcal disease with maternal colonization worldwide: systematic review and meta-analyses [^113hQ3Qf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

METHODS

This article is part of a protocol entitled "Systematic estimates of the global burden of GBS in pregnant women, stillbirths and infants", submitted for ethical approval to the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (reference number 11966) and approved on 30 November 2016.

Definitions

Maternal GBS colonization was defined as isolation by culture of GBS from either the vagina (high or low), rectum, or perianal region during pregnancy. EOGBS was defined as GBS disease confirmed by microbiological culture of blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) taken on days 0–6. We assumed that blood or CSF samples were obtained for a clinical indication. We excluded cases of "probable" GBS sepsis, where clinical or laboratory signs of infection were accompanied only by neonatal GBS colonization, and cases of clinically suspected pneumonia with GBS detected in tracheal aspirates, or urinary tract infections. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) was defined as intravenous antibiotics given at any time during labor for the prevention of EOGBS in GBS-colonized pregnant women. Coverage of IAP refers to the proportion of women who received IAP, regardless of the timing of administration. Studies were categorized as having a policy of IAP for GBS colonization if they aimed to provide IAP to all colonized pregnant women regardless of risk factors.

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease: a public health perspective… [^114dFDcZ]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Colonized women who experience either a long duration of membrane rupture, premature delivery, or intrapartum fever are at particularly high risk for transmitting GBS infection to their infants during labor and delivery. Infants who have GBS disease can require prolonged hospitalization and expensive supportive therapy, and survivors may suffer permanent disability. This reduction in deaths most likely has resulted from improvements in neonatal care. EPIDEMIOLOGY Colonization The gastrointestinal tract is the most likely human reservoir of GBS, with the genitourinary tract the most common site of secondary spread. Colonization rates can differ among ethnic groups, geographic locales, and by age; however, rates are similar for pregnant and nonpregnant women. In most populations studied, from 10% to 30% of pregnant women were colonized with GBS in the vaginal or rectal area.

Of all infants born to colonized parturients, approximately 1%-2% will develop early-onset invasive disease. Other women with increased likelihood of delivering an infant who has invasive GBS disease are those with heavy colonization of GBS in genital cultures or with low levels of anti-GBS capsular antibody and women who previously delivered an infant who had GBS disease. Women with GBS bacteriuria during pregnancy usually are heavily colonized with GBS and appear to be at increased risk for perinatal transmission. The role of GBS colonization in maternal infections was recently investigated. Factors that independently increased the risk for clinical amnionitis included GBS colonization, duration of membrane rupture, duration of internal monitoring, and number of vaginal examinations.

In a preliminary study of the obstetric population in the same community, the incidence of early-onset GBS disease in this high-risk group was eightfold greater than among colonized women without any of these risk factors and 45-fold greater than among women with these risk factors who were not colonized. That proposal suggested administering intrapartum antimicrobial agents to women with preterm labor or preterm rupture of membranes who were either colonized with GBS or whose colonization status was unknown.

### Interspecies interactions within the host: the social network of group B [^112WLrhp]. Infection and Immunity (2023). Medium credibility.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a pervasive neonatal pathogen accounting for a combined half a million deaths and stillbirths annually. The most common source of fetal or neonatal GBS exposure is the maternal microbiota. GBS asymptomatically colonizes the gastrointestinal and vaginal mucosa of 1 in 5 individuals globally, although its precise role in these niches is not well understood. To prevent vertical transmission, broad-spectrum antibiotics are administered to GBS-positive mothers during labor in many countries. Although antibiotics have significantly reduced GBS early-onset neonatal disease, there are several unintended consequences, including an altered neonatal microbiota and increased risk for other microbial infections. Additionally, the incidence of late-onset GBS neonatal disease remains unaffected and has sparked an emerging hypothesis that GBS-microbe interactions in developing neonatal gut microbiota may be directly involved in this disease process. This review summarizes our current understanding of GBS interactions with other resident microbes at the mucosal surface from multiple angles, including clinical association studies, agriculture and aquaculture observations, and experimental animal model systems. We also include a comprehensive review of in vitro findings of GBS interactions with other bacterial and fungal microbes, both commensal and pathogenic, along with newly established animal models of GBS vaginal colonization and in utero or neonatal infection. Finally, we provide a perspective on emerging areas of research and current strategies to design microbe-targeting prebiotic or probiotic therapeutic intervention strategies to prevent GBS disease in vulnerable populations.

### The risk factors for group B. streptococcus colonization during pregnancy and influences of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis on maternal and neonatal outcomes [^113Pabz8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Group B Streptococcus (GBS), also known as Streptococcus agalactiae, is a Gram-positive bacterium which asymptomatically colonizes in women rectovaginal areas and could result in adult and neonatal invasive diseases under certain conditions. GBS infection can lead to invasive diseases such as bacteremia and skin/soft tissue infection in nonpregnant adults, the burden of which has been increased significantly during the past few years. The GBS carriage of pregnant women can be chronic, intermittent or transient and is implicated in urinary tract infection, premature rupture of membranes, and preterm birth. According to a literature, the prevalence of GBS invasive diseases in pregnant women was twice as much as that in nonpregnant women. GBS could be transmitted vertically from colonized mothers to their offspring through genital tract at or just before delivery, which may cause early-onset invasive neonatal GBS disease (EOD) that occurs < 7 days of life, often manifesting as bacteremia and pneumonia. The incidence of EOD among infants born to women with GBS colonization was 29 times higher than that of infants born to women without GBS colonization. Invasive neonatal GBS disease that appears from 7 to 90 days of life is referred as late-onset disease (LOD), the common manifestations of which are bacteremia, urinary tract infection, and meningitis. Newborns with LOD are exposed to GBS by horizontal transmission. Although the risk factors of LOD are not as well understood as EOD, it was suggested that babies usually acquired the same serotype of GBS as their mothers' colonized strains, and GBS-positive breast milk was implicated in heavy neonatal infection that GBS could be isolated from their throat, ear and rectum at least once.

### Risk pathways for gonorrhea acquisition in sex workers: can we distinguish confounding from an exposure effect using a priori hypotheses? [^1167KW6P]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The nature of causation has been the subject of a comprehensive debate in philosophy, medicine, and, relatively more recently, epidemiology. The 2 main interpretations of causation that have been explored are (1) a deterministic interpretation, whereby a cause is invariably followed by its effect, being both necessary and sufficient; and (2) a probabilistic interpretation, where a cause increases or decreases the likelihood of the effect occurring, but is not required to be necessary or sufficient. In this article, we aim to provide a plausibility and probability assessment of the available literature to develop risk pathways, taking as an example sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in general and gonorrhea in particular.

Sexually transmitted infections, including treatable bacterial infections such as gonorrhea, represent a significant global health burden. Eighty percent of women and up to 10% of men remain asymptomatic during gonorrhea infection; when symptomatic, patients present with inflammation of the urogenital tract, throat, or rectum producing discomfort and discharge. Possible complications include pelvic inflammatory disease leading to infertility and ectopic pregnancy. The presence of an untreated STI also enhances human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition and transmission risks. Whereas the deterministic (necessary and sufficient) cause of gonorrhea infection at an individual level (ie, the presence of the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae), is well described; at a population level, probabilistic causes that determine the variability in the population distribution of the infection and their complex interplay are less well understood.

### Maternal colonization with group B. streptococcus and serotype distribution worldwide: systematic review and meta-analyses [^115qXvXU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

We included studies where the population and study design were described, reporting prevalence of group B streptococcal colonization in pregnant women, either during pregnancy (at any gestation) or in labor, as well as on the prevalence of the serotypes of colonizing isolates. Studies were included irrespective of sample type (taken from the vagina [high or low] and/or rectum and/or perianal region) and culture technique, as long as laboratory and sampling techniques were described (for subsequent sensitivity and secondary analyses). Although no date restrictions were applied to the initial search, for United Nations (UN)–defined "developed regions" (which were expected to have adequate recent data), data on maternal GBS colonization prevalence and on colonizing serotypes were only included in the analysis if published after the year 2000, unless a particular developed country only had data before this period.

We excluded studies involving nonpregnant women, where results for pregnant women could not be separately extracted. If prevalence estimates were based on < 200 women sampled from that country, these were not included in the final estimation process. We also did not derive prevalence estimates from studies in developed regions that focused solely on comparison of laboratory methods. Studies reporting prevalence of GBS colonization using molecular methods only for detection (such as polymerase chain reaction) or GBS bacteriuria alone were also excluded, due to their lack of comparability with conventional methods, limiting cross-country and regional comparison. Data on serotypes were included if they were clearly identified as colonizing pregnant women vaginally or rectally, and were not from invasive disease. Data were included where they described a cohort of women, or pooled laboratory samples, and studies were excluded if they included < 10 bacterial isolates.

Data Abstraction and Analysis

Two researchers (N. R. and M. O.) abstracted data independently into standard Excel abstraction forms with information on sampling and laboratory methodology and relevant study criteria. Differences in abstraction were resolved through discussion with a third researcher (A. S.). Abstracted data included selection of study participants, description of study setting and participants, culture methods, swab site, and timing of swabs (at delivery or at specified gestational ages). These factors allowed an assessment of the potential for bias in each study.

### Preterm birth associated with group B. streptococcus maternal colonization worldwide: systematic review and meta-analyses [^1143gF11]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Preterm birth complications are the leading cause of deaths among children < 5 years of age. Studies have suggested that group B Streptococcus (GBS) maternal rectovaginal colonization during pregnancy may be a risk factor for preterm delivery. This article is the fifth of 11 in a series. We aimed to assess the association between GBS maternal colonization and preterm birth in order to inform estimates of the burden of GBS.

Methods

We conducted systematic literature reviews (PubMed/Medline, Embase, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature [LILACS], World Health Organization Library Information System [WHOLIS], and Scopus) and sought unpublished data from investigator groups on the association of preterm birth (< 37 weeks' gestation) and maternal GBS colonization (GBS isolation from vaginal, cervical, and/or rectal swabs; with separate subanalysis on GBS bacteriuria). We did meta-analyses to derive pooled estimates of the risk and odds ratios (according to study design), with sensitivity analyses to investigate potential biases.

Results

We identified 45 studies for inclusion. We estimated the risk ratio (RR) for preterm birth with maternal GBS colonization to be 1.21 (95% confidence interval [CI].99–1.48; p = 0.061) in cohort and cross-sectional studies, and the odds ratio to be 1.85 (95% CI, 1.24–2.77; p = 0.003) in case-control studies. Preterm birth was associated with GBS bacteriuria in cohort studies (RR, 1.98 [95% CI, 1.45–2.69]; P < .001).

Conclusions

From this review, there is evidence to suggest that preterm birth is associated with maternal GBS colonization, especially where there is evidence of ascending infection (bacteriuria). Several biases reduce the chance of detecting an effect. Equally, however, results, including evidence for the association, may be due to confounding, which is rarely addressed in studies. Assessment of any effect on preterm delivery should be included in future maternal GBS vaccine trials.

### Challenges in reducing group B. streptococcus disease in African settings [^114Z8Hjq]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Maternal carriage of GBS and the impact of HIV

The main reservoir for GBS is in the large intestine and the lower genital tract. Rectovaginal colonisation by GBS is dynamic and can be transient, intermittent or persistent. Certain factors also favour the transmission of GBS from mother to infant, including maternal colonisation, density of colonisation and PROM.GBS bacteriuria (found in 2–7% of pregnant women)is an indicator for heavy genital tract colonisation and is associated with a higher risk of chorioamnionitis, EOD and LOD. In addition, virulence of the organism, particularly of the ST17 genotype, may favour transmission. Factors that appear to reduce transmission and/or invasive disease are exposure to intrapartum antibiotics, elective caesarean section in the absence of labour and high maternal GBS serotype-specific capsular antibodies.

Studies based upon vaginal-rectal swabs both in both high-income and low–middle-income countries (LMICs) have shown that 10–40% of women are rectovaginally colonised by GBS during pregnancy. A review of GBS carriage by Stoll et al in low-income countries showed 19% GBS carriage in sub-Saharan African women, while country-specific studies in Africa showed carriage rates of 28.4% in South Africa,21.2% in Malawi,23% in Tanzaniaand 22% in the Gambia.

Although maternal HIV infection has not been associated with higher prevalence of GBS colonisation, a study in Malawi showed a direct relationship between CD4+ count and GBS carriage, with the highest GBS carriage prevalence in HIV-infected women with CD4 count > 500 cells/mm 3. Reduced GBS carriage at lower CD4 counts may be due to the competitive exclusion of GBS by ecological changes in the microbial flora and the increased presence of bacterial vaginosis and anaerobes. Natural maternal capsular and protein antibody concentrations against GBS were found to be lower in HIV-infected South African women, which may also increase the vulnerability of HIV-exposed infants to GBS EOD and LOD. This has been reflected in invasive GBS disease incidence in South Africa, which showed a 2.25-fold greater incidence in HIV-exposed compared with HIV-unexposed infants.

### Vaginal and extra-vaginal bacterial colonization and risk for incident bacterial vaginosis in a population of women who have sex with men [^113mLwaG]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Vaginal and extra-vaginal bacterial colonization in women is a consistent risk factor for developing BV in both WSM and WSW. Understanding how BVAB traffic to these extra-vaginal sites, and from these reservoirs to the vagina and back, may provide opportunities for preventing BV and reducing recurrence after treatment.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: prevention of infection after abortion and pregnancy loss [^116widQW]. Contraception (2025). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) before abortion — We recommend against screening for bacterial vaginosis (BV) before abortion (GRADE 1C). Symptomatic patients with BV should be treated, and abortion should not be delayed while awaiting treatment. BV is common, with a prevalence of approximately 30% in reproductive-age, pregnant-capable persons globally, and is associated with increased risk for pelvic inflammatory disease (adjusted hazard ratio 1.53, 95% CI 1.05–2.21). Randomized trials of perioperative metronidazole or clindamycin showed no statistically significant differences in postabortion upper genital tract infection versus placebo when standard prophylactic antibiotics were provided; one study using treatment dosing with metronidazole 500 mg three times daily orally for 10 days starting 7 days before the abortion procedure significantly reduced the risk of developing PID postprocedure, but these patients did not receive universal prophylactic antibiotics before abortion.

### Intra-abdominal infections survival guide: a position statement by the global alliance for infections in surgery [^116vRh7y]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the upper part of the female genital tract, including the uterus, fallopian tubes, or adjacent pelvic structures causing peritonitis that may spread from the pelvis to the abdomen. The cause is ascending bacterial infection from the vagina in 85% of cases, most commonly from sexually transmitted pathogens (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis). Endogenous vaginal and cervical flora, especially anaerobes, cause PID in most of the remaining cases. Most cases are treated as outpatients with antibiotics alone. Indications for hospitalization include failure of outpatient management, severe illness, and pregnancy (owing to the risk of pregnancy loss). Pelvic (tubo-ovarian) abscess may be an indication for surgery.

Trauma, a major global public health problem, can be associated with high morbidity and mortality depending on mechanism, injury pattern, time to stabilization, and host frailty regardless of socioeconomic status. Both blunt and penetrating mechanisms may result in bowel injury; motor vehicle crashes are the most common of blunt intestinal injury. followed by falls. The small intestine is more likely than colon to be injured by either mechanism. Infection is considered established (as opposed to contamination by enteric contents) after 12 h for colon injury and 24 h for other locations; within those time frames only surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis (maximum 24 h; ideally a single dose) is required, even if the colon is lacerated. Blunt hollow viscus injury may have a more insidious presentation in this setting, possibly resulting in delayed diagnosis and intervention and consequent adverse outcomes.

### Trends in perinatal group B streptococcal disease-United States, 2000–2006 [^111a9cx2]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2009). Low credibility.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a leading infectious cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in the United States. The bacterium, a common colonizer of the maternal genital tract, can infect the fetus during gestation, causing fetal death. GBS also can be acquired by the fetus during passage through the birth canal or after delivery. Infection commonly manifests as meningitis, pneumonia, or sepsis. In 2002, CDC, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Academy of Pediatrics issued revised guidelines for prevention of early-onset GBS disease (i.e., in infants aged < 7 days). These guidelines recommended universal screening of all pregnant women for rectovaginal GBS colonization at 35–37 weeks' gestation and administration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) to carriers. A report published in 2007 indicated that, during 2003–2005, the overall rate of early-onset GBS disease increased, whereas incidence of late-onset GBS disease (i.e., in infants aged 7–89 days) remained stable. This report updates the 2007 report by incorporating 2006 data from the Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs) system. The updated analysis revealed an increase in the overall rate of early-onset GBS disease from 2003 to 2006, driven by an increasing incidence among black term infants. Late-onset GBS disease incidence among black infants, which had increased during 2003–2005, declined in 2006. Continued monitoring is needed to follow trends in early-onset GBS disease among black infants to determine whether additional interventions are warranted.

### Racial disparities in intrapartum group B. streptococcus colonization: a higher incidence of conversion in African American women [^113ZLPEA]. Journal of Perinatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the incidence of group B Streptococcus (GBS) conversion from a negative antepartum to a positive intrapartum culture among women who self-identify as non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, or non-Hispanic white.

Study Design

This was a prospective cohort study of women with a negative rectovaginal GBS culture obtained within 35 days of enrollment. An intrapartum rectovaginal swab was collected and cultured for GBS. Data were compared with chi-square, Fisher's exact, or Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Modified Poisson regression was used.

Results

We enrolled 737 women; 75.4% were non-Hispanic white, 17.6% were non-Hispanic black, and 6.9% were Hispanic. Non-Hispanic black women were more likely to convert to GBS positive than non-Hispanic white women, 9.2% as compared to 5.3% (RR: 2.0; 95% CI: 1.02–3.8).

Conclusion

The increased incidence of positive intrapartum GBS cultures among non-Hispanic black women suggests that non-Hispanic black race is a risk factor for GBS conversion in the late third trimester.

### Novel bacterial vaginosis-associated organisms mediate the relationship between vaginal douching and pelvic inflammatory disease [^111iqoWy]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), the infection and inflammation of a woman's fallopian tubes (salpingitis) and uterine lining (endometritis), is a frequent and morbid condition among young women. The estimated prevalence of PID among sexually experienced women aged 18–44 years is 4.4%, suggesting that approximately 2.5 million reproductive-aged women have ever been diagnosed with PID. Major reproductive and gynecologic sequelae result from PID, including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, recurrent PID and chronic pelvic pain.

Ness et al previously identified an association between vaginal douching and PID. Among women in the PID Evaluation and Clinical Health (PEACH) study, those who reported douching more than once per month were 60% more likely to have histologically confirmed endometritis or upper genital tract gonorrheal or chlamydial infection. Another study in a similar cohort, the Gynecologic Infections Follow-Through (GIFT) study found that douching for symptoms or hygiene at least once per month was associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV), diagnosed using Nugent's criteria.BV is a common condition among women, with prevalence estimates ranging from 5% to 36%, and is characterised by a shift from a vaginal flora with predominant lactobacilli to one with high concentrations of a diverse collection/array of other aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. These findings support the notion that douching disrupts the normal vaginal flora, which, in turn, promotes colonisation with BV-associated bacteria. Women with BV also have an increased risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections (STIs), particularly Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis, which if left untreated can ascend to the upper genital tract and cause PID. Although PID is often associated with N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis infection, up to 70% of PID cases are of unknown microbial aetiology, and BV has been directly associated with PID, independent of chlamydial and gonococcal infection.

### Identification of novel microbes associated with pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility [^111VvRzC]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2016). Low credibility.

Follow-up

Participants were monitored with in-person visits at 5 and 30 days and telephone interviews every 3–4 months until June 2004, at which point we had follow-up information for 541 women, representing a mean follow-up of 84 months. Infertility was defined when a sexually active woman with at least 12 months of follow-up did not report conception (positive urine or blood test or doctor's diagnosis) despite rare or no use of a contraceptive method. Chronic pelvic pain was defined as pain reported during at least two consecutive interviews, suggesting a minimum of 6 months duration. Recurrent PID was self-reported and confirmed in 76% of medical records. Since few women experienced an ectopic pregnancy (N = 6), we did not include as an outcome.

Statistical methods

In our primary analysis, cross-sectional associations between bacteria and endometritis were determined using logistic regression models, adjusted for age and race. Logistic regression was used to construct relative risks and 95% CIs between each bacterium and endometritis at 30 days, recurrent PID, infertility and chronic pelvic pain, and included age, and race as explanatory variables. Models predicting infertility and post-treatment endometritis were adjusted for age, race, gonorrhoea, chlamydia, self-reported infertility at baseline and self-reported partner treatment, respectively. In exploratory analyses, all the above models were additionally analysed in a subset of women negative for both chlamydia and gonorrhoea (see web appendix). Subsequent exploratory models included terms representing interactions between BV-associated bacteria and chlamydia/gonorrhoea. Analyses were conducted first using both cervical and endometrial PCR results combined and were then repeated using only endometrial PCR. SPSS V.20.0 for Windows was used for statistical comparisons.

### Risk factors for group B streptococcal genitourinary tract colonization in pregnant women [^117S7cY2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify risk factors for group B streptococcus (GBS) colonization in pregnancy, hypothesizing that health care workers may have increased risk.

Methods

Population-based, case-control study comparing 40,459 cases of GBS colonization, identified from Washington State birth certificate data linked to hospital discharge data for live births between 1997 and 2002, with 84,268 controls matched by year of delivery by multivariable logistic regression.

Results

After adjustment for confounders, the following characteristics were independently associated with increased maternal GBS colonization: health care occupation (odds ratio [OR] 1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07–1.38), black race (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.36–1.74), overweight (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01–1.12), obesity (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.13–1.28), severe obesity (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.28–1.63), median income greater than lowest quintile (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.20–1.39 for fifth versus first quintile), some high school education (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.05–1.40), high school graduate (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.16–1.56), and adequate prenatal care (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.06–1.24). Hispanic women (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80–0.96) and smokers (OR for 1–10 cigarettes per day 0.90, 95% CI 0.83–0.97) had a decreased odds of colonization.

Conclusion

Health care workers, black women, and women with high body mass index may be at greater risk of GBS colonization in pregnancy. However, any increases in risk are modest and the association between a health care occupation and GBS colonization needs to be investigated further.

### Genitourinary pathogens and preterm birth [^115hLLmn]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim is to describe and quantify the association between genitourinary tract infections and preterm birth.

Recent Findings

Recent studies confirm the importance of identifying and treating both asymptomatic and symptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy, which is reflected in current antenatal screening guidelines. These guidelines do not recommend routine screening for other asymptomatic lower genital infections (bacterial vaginosis, trichomonas and gonorrhoea) reflecting inconsistent study results, which may reflect differences in study design, size, diagnostics and the timing of screening in pregnancy. Screening for group B Streptococcus (GBS) late in pregnancy is recognized to reduce neonatal disease, but there is a striking lack of robust studies, specifically randomized controlled trials (RCTs), considering the effect of GBS screening earlier in pregnancy on adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Summary

The potential for screening and treatment of genitourinary tract infections in pregnancy to reduce preterm birth rates has been demonstrated in some RCTs. Current guidelines do not reflect these data because of inconsistencies across the body of evidence. There is a need for robust RCTs to confirm or refute earlier data, to inform the optimal timing for screening in pregnancy and to better quantify the contribution of individual infections to the burden of preterm birth.

### Prevalence of group B streptococcal colonization in the healthy non-pregnant population: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113yRHeG]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Colonization and transmission precede invasive group B streptococcal (GBS) disease. Data on GBS colonization prevalence, detection methods and risk factors for carriage are relevant for vaccine development and to understand GBS pathogenesis.

Objectives

To evaluate GBS colonization prevalence after the first week of life in the healthy non-pregnant population.

Data Sources

Pubmed/Medline, Embase, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, World Health Organization Library Information System, and Scopus. Search performed 12 January 2021 with search terms related to 'GBS' and 'colonization, epidemiology, prevalence or screening' without restrictions.

Study Eligibility Criteria

All studies that reported prevalence of GBS colonization (any site) in the healthy population.

Participants

All individuals (> 6 days of age), with no indication of pregnancy, invasive disease or severe underlying immunological co-morbidities.

Methods

Logit transformation and a random effects model (DerSimonian and Laird) were used to pool colonization estimates. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression on a priori determined subgroups were performed.

Results

We included 98 studies with 43 112 participants. Our search identified 9309 studies of which 8831 were excluded based on title and abstract and 380 after reading the full text. Colonization rates varied considerably between studies (I 2 = 97%), which could be partly explained by differences in culture methods (R 2 = 27%), culture sites (R 2 = 24%), continent (R 2 = 10%) and participant's age (R 2 = 6%). Higher prevalence was found with selective culture methods (19%, 95% CI 16%-23% versus non-selective methods 8%, 95% CI 6%-9%; p < 0.0001). Colonization rates were highest in rectum (19%, 95% CI 15%-24%), vagina (14%, 95% CI 12%-17%) and urethra (9%, 95% CI 5%-18%). In participants with negative rectal cultures, 7% (95% CI 5%-9%) had GBS cultured from another niche. Colonization prevalence was lower in children (6 months to 16 years; 3%, 95% CI 2%-5%) compared with adults (16%, 95% CI 14%-20%; p < 0.0001). Using selective culture methods in adults resulted in a prevalence of 26% (95% CI 19%-33%) rectal, 21% (95% CI 17%-25%) vaginal and 9% (95% CI 6%-14%) urethral colonization.

Conclusion

The rectum is the most common body site colonized by GBS. The best approach to screen for any GBS colonization is to screen multiple body sites using selective culture methods.
