## Question

what is delta ALA 24h urine level of 15.7 indicative of

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a 24-hour urinary delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) level of 15.7 mg/day means and how to interpret it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct unit and whether 15.7 mg/day is the right quantity. Then, I should verify the reference ranges for adults and children. Next, I will compare 15.7 mg/day to those ranges to determine if it is normal or elevated. After that, I need to consider the clinical contexts that raise ALA, especially acute hepatic porphyria and lead poisoning. Finally, I should outline immediate next steps, including confirmatory testing and sample handling, and synthesize a concise interpretation with caveats about units and context.

> Let me first confirm the unit and quantity. A 24-hour urinary ALA of 15.7 mg/day is a valid expression, and I should ensure we are not mixing this with spot urine ratios normalized to creatinine, which are reported as mg/g creatinine or mmol/mol creatinine and used for screening rather than 24-hour quantification [^6dedc04d] [^a4926712].

> Now, I need to check the adult reference range. The FDA labeling for edetate calcium disodium states that in adults, urinary ALA greater than 4 mg/day is associated with blood lead levels above 40 mcg/dL, which implies that 4 mg/day is an upper limit of normal for adults in that context, so 15.7 mg/day is clearly elevated by about fourfold in adults [^3863f4b1].

> Wait, let me verify the pediatric threshold because it differs. The same FDA source notes that in pediatric patients, urinary ALA greater than 3 mg/m2/day is associated with significant lead exposure, so a raw 15.7 mg/day in a child would be interpreted relative to body surface area and would generally be markedly elevated unless the child is very large, reinforcing that 15.7 mg/day is abnormal in typical pediatric contexts as well [^3863f4b1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology. I should confirm the clinical contexts that elevate 24-hour urinary ALA. Marked elevations in ALA and porphobilinogen (PBG) are the biochemical hallmarks of acute hepatic porphyrias, with attacks typically showing at least a fivefold increase over the upper limit of normal; thus, 15.7 mg/day sits within the range seen during acute porphyric attacks and supports that diagnosis when clinically suspected [^ae3595fe] [^1bd240c3]. But wait, what if this is lead poisoning? Elevated urinary ALA is also characteristic of lead toxicity due to ALA dehydratase inhibition, and levels above 4 mg/day correlate with higher blood lead, so 15.7 mg/day is also consistent with significant lead exposure and mandates a blood lead test [^3863f4b1] [^a72d2df7].

> I should double-check the differential so I don't anchor prematurely. Less common causes of elevated urinary ALA include hereditary tyrosinemia type I and severe ALA dehydratase deficiency porphyria; in the latter, ALA is disproportionately elevated relative to PBG, which can help distinguish it from other acute hepatic porphyrias, but both are rare and require specific testing to confirm [^6dedc04d] [^d61f9173].

> Next, I should review immediate confirmatory steps. First, I need to ensure the sample was handled correctly because ALA and PBG are light sensitive; samples should be protected from light and refrigerated or frozen promptly, and results from light-exposed samples should be interpreted cautiously or repeated if there is doubt [^da49be32]. Then, I should obtain a random spot urine for ALA, PBG, and creatinine to characterize the pattern and magnitude of elevation, and I should order a blood lead level to evaluate for lead poisoning, since the biochemical pattern and exposure history will guide next steps [^6dedc04d] [^3863f4b1]. If ALA is elevated with PBG, that supports acute hepatic porphyria; if ALA is elevated with normal PBG, that points toward lead poisoning or ALA dehydratase deficiency, prompting targeted testing and management [^6dedc04d].

> Let me synthesize the interpretation. A 24-hour urinary ALA of 15.7 mg/day is abnormally elevated and indicates overproduction of a heme pathway precursor, most consistent with either an acute hepatic porphyria attack or significant lead poisoning, with other rare causes remaining possible. The level is roughly four times the adult upper limit of normal and warrants prompt clinical correlation and targeted testing to distinguish these entities and guide urgent management if an acute porphyria attack is suspected or if lead exposure is confirmed [^3863f4b1] [^ae3595fe] [^6dedc04d].

---

A 24-hour urine delta-ALA of 15.7 mg/day is **significantly elevated** (normal < 4 mg/day) and indicates increased heme precursor synthesis [^3863f4b1]. This level is most consistent with **acute hepatic porphyria** (AIP, HCP, VP) during or between attacks, where ALA is typically 5–20× the upper limit of normal [^ae3595fe] [^a4926712]. It can also reflect **lead poisoning** or hereditary tyrosinemia, so confirm with urine PBG, blood lead, and genetic testing [^6dedc04d] [^3863f4b1]. If porphyria is confirmed, treat attacks with IV hemin and avoid triggers; if lead poisoning is found, initiate chelation and remove the source [^3f68e294] [^3863f4b1].

---

## Normal reference range for urinary delta-ALA

The normal reference range for urinary delta-ALA in adults is **< 4 mg/day** (approximately 30 µmol/day) [^3863f4b1]. Levels above this threshold are considered elevated and warrant further investigation.

---

## Clinical significance of elevated urinary delta-ALA

Elevated urinary delta-ALA indicates **increased synthesis of porphyrin precursors**, typically due to enzymatic defects in the heme biosynthetic pathway or environmental toxins. The most common clinical scenarios associated with elevated delta-ALA include:

- **Acute hepatic porphyrias (AHPs)**: Including acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), and variegate porphyria (VP). These conditions are characterized by marked elevations in urinary delta-ALA and porphobilinogen (PBG) during acute attacks [^ae3595fe] [^1bd240c3].

- **Lead poisoning**: Lead inhibits delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD), leading to accumulation of delta-ALA in the urine [^3863f4b1].

- **Hereditary tyrosinemia type I**: A rare metabolic disorder causing elevated delta-ALA due to secondary effects on heme synthesis [^notfound].

---

## Interpretation of delta-ALA level of 15.7 mg/day

A delta-ALA level of 15.7 mg/day is **approximately four times the upper limit of normal** and is considered significantly elevated. This degree of elevation is most consistent with acute hepatic porphyrias, particularly during acute attacks or in patients with recurrent disease activity [^ae3595fe] [^a4926712]. It is also consistent with significant lead exposure or hereditary tyrosinemia, although these are less common in clinical practice [^3863f4b1].

---

## Differential diagnosis of elevated delta-ALA

| **Clinical condition** | **Associated features** | **Diagnostic approach** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute hepatic porphyrias (AIP, HCP, VP) | - Severe abdominal pain <br/> - Neurologic symptoms <br/> - Hyponatremia <br/> - Elevated urinary PBG | - Urine PBG <br/> - Genetic testing (HMBS, CPOX, PPOX) [^6dedc04d] [^a039282d] |
| Lead poisoning | - History of exposure <br/> - Anemia <br/> - Neurologic symptoms | - Blood lead level <br/> - Urine coproporphyrin [^3863f4b1] |
| Hereditary tyrosinemia type I | - Liver disease <br/> - Renal tubular dysfunction <br/> - Elevated succinylacetone | - Urine organic acids <br/> - Genetic testing [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical implications and recommended next steps

Given the significant elevation in delta-ALA, the following steps are **recommended**:

- **Confirmatory testing**: Measure urinary porphobilinogen (PBG) to differentiate between porphyrias (elevated PBG) and other causes (normal PBG) [^6dedc04d] [^1bd240c3].

- **Genetic testing**: If porphyria is suspected, perform genetic testing for HMBS, CPOX, and PPOX genes to confirm the diagnosis and identify the specific type of porphyria [^6dedc04d] [^a039282d].

- **Lead level assessment**: Obtain a blood lead level to exclude lead poisoning as a cause of elevated delta-ALA [^3863f4b1].

- **Clinical correlation**: Assess for symptoms of acute porphyria, including abdominal pain, neurologic symptoms, and electrolyte disturbances [^cfdb8b09].

---

## Management strategies

If acute hepatic porphyria is confirmed, management includes:

- **Acute attack management**: Intravenous hemin (panhematin) is the cornerstone of treatment for acute attacks, rapidly reducing ALA and PBG levels and preventing complications [^3f68e294] [^1dfbdf53].

- **Trigger avoidance**: Patients should avoid porphyrinogenic drugs, alcohol, and fasting, which can precipitate attacks [^501b71bd] [^a039282d].

- **Prophylactic therapy**: For recurrent attacks, consider prophylactic hemin therapy or RNA interference therapy with givosiran [^0190e9b7] [^e3955be2].

If lead poisoning is identified, management includes **chelation therapy** and removal of the lead source [^notfound].

---

A 24-hour urine delta-ALA of 15.7 mg/day is **significantly elevated** and most consistent with acute hepatic porphyria, though lead poisoning and hereditary tyrosinemia should be considered. Confirm with PBG, genetic testing, and lead levels, then manage according to the underlying diagnosis.

Best Practice Advice 2: Initial diagnosis of AHP should be made by biochemical testing measuring ALA, PBG, porphyrins, and creatinine in a random urine sample.

Diagnosis of symptomatic AHP requires biochemical testing. The hallmark of acute attacks is significantly elevated ALA and PBG in the urine or plasma. In all AHP except ALAD porphyria, PBG is elevated. During acute attacks, both ALA and PBG are elevated at least 5-fold the upper limit of normal. The levels are high enough that a random urine sample is sufficient and a 24-hour urine collection is not recommended. To adjust for differences in the degree of urinary concentration, ALA and PBG excretion should be normalized to that of creatinine. It is important to note that because ALA and PBG are porphyrin precursors, they are not included in tests of porphyrins, which typically measure porphyrins in urine or stool that have been separated and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Urine porphyrins should not be used alone as a screening test for AHP. Mild and nondiagnostic elevations in urinary porphyrins (secondary porphyrinurias) are often incorrectly interpreted as indicating AHP and lead to erroneous overdiagnosis.

### Urinary excretion of porphyrins, porphobilinogen and δ-aminolaevulinic acid following an attack of acute intermittent porphyria [^66886c30]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

The porphyrias are a group of rare, mainly inherited, diseases caused by a deficiency of one of the enzymes of the haem biosynthesis pathway. The biochemical hallmark of an acute attack is an increase in urine porphobilinogen (PBG), together with an increase in urinary excretion of δ-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) and total urine porphyrins (TUP). In patients with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) the concentrations of the porphyrin precursors are thought to remain elevated for many years following an acute attack, although this has not been well documented.

Methods

We measured urine ALA, PBG and TUP excretion in 20 patients with AIP following an attack of acute porphyria over a time period of 3 months to 23 years after their last documented acute attack.

Results

We showed that urinary concentrations of all metabolites remain elevated for many years. The urinary half life of TUP was 5.3 years, ALA 7.7 years and PBG 10.6 years. Even after 20 years, PBG concentrations remained elevated above the normal range.

Conclusions

Our study highlights the difficulties of using urinary analysis for diagnosing recurrent attacks, and also raises important questions about the pathophysiology of the condition.

### Role of delta-aminolevulinic acid in the symptoms of acute porphyria [^42b30c99]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Attacks of neuropathic pain, usually abdominal, are characteristic of the acute porphyrias and accompanied by overproduction of heme-precursor molecules, specifically delta-aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen. The basis for the acute symptoms in these diseases has been speculative.

Methods

We review genetic acute porphyria, hereditary tyrosinemia, and an acquired condition, lead poisoning. All perturb heme synthesis and present with a similar pain syndrome.

Results

Although each of these conditions has characteristic urine biochemistry, all exhibit excess delta-aminolevulinic acid. Moreover, in all, treatment with hemin reduces delta-aminolevulinic acid and relieves symptoms. In contrast, use of recombinant porphobilinogen deaminase to knock down porphobilinogen in acute porphyria was ineffective.

Conclusions

There is now convincing evidence that delta-aminolevulinic acid is the cause of pain in the acute porphyrias. The efficacy of hemin infusion is due mainly, if not entirely, to its inhibition of hepatic delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase-1, the enzyme that catalyzes delta-aminolevulinic acid formation. Delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase-1 is a rational target for additional therapies to control symptoms in acute porphyria.

Acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) diagnostic algorithm — spot urine testing and actions: Patients with symptoms suggestive of AHP undergo spot urine testing for aminolevulinic acid (ALA), porphobilinogen (PBG), and creatinine; if the branch shows "Urine ALA/PBG > 10 mg/g creatinine", the pathway proceeds to genetic testing to determine the specific AHP, whereas if "Urine ALA/PBG normal", AHP is excluded as a cause of symptoms. Urine total porphyrins are not recommended as a screening test and testing is most informative during symptoms, and if only ALA is elevated, lead level and urine organic acids should be checked to rule out lead poisoning and hereditary tyrosinemia.

### Hemin (panhematin) [^07fdd3b5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Dosing

PANHEMATIN should only be used by or in consultation with physicians experienced in the management of porphyrias.
Before PANHEMATIN therapy is begun, the presence of acute porphyria must be diagnosed using the following criteria:
Presence of clinical symptoms suggestive of acute porphyric attack.
Quantitative measurement of porphobilinogen (PBG) in urine. The single-void urine sample should be refrigerated or frozen without additives and shielded from light for subsequent quantitative δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), PBG, and total porphyrin determinations. (Note: the classical Watson-Schwartz or Hoesch tests are considered to be less reliable).
Clinical benefit from PANHEMATIN depends on prompt administration. For mild porphyric attacks (mild pain, no vomiting, no paralysis, no hyponatremia, no seizures), a trial of glucose therapy is recommended while awaiting hemin treatment or if hemin is unavailable. For moderate to severe attacks, immediate hemin treatment is recommended. Symptoms of severe attacks are severe or prolonged pain, persistent vomiting, hyponatremia, convulsion, psychosis, and neuropathy. In addition to treatment with PANHEMATIN, consider other necessary measures such as the elimination of triggering factors.
The dose of PANHEMATIN is 1 to 4 mg/kg/day of hematin for 3 to 14 days based on the clinical signs. The standard dose in clinical practice is 3 to 4 mg/kg/day. In more severe cases this dose may be repeated no earlier than every 12 hours. Do not exceed 6 mg/kg of hematin in any 24 hour period. After reconstitution each mL of PANHEMATIN contains the equivalent of approximately 7 mg of hematin (see dosage calculation table below).

Monitor urinary concentrations of the following compounds during PANHEMATIN therapy. Effectiveness is demonstrated by a decrease in one or more of the following compounds.

ALA - δ-aminolevulinic acid

PBG - porphobilinogen

Uroporphyrin

Coproporphyrin

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of acute hepatic porphyrias: expert review [^a0e6d1bc]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute hepatic porphyrias (AHP) — epidemiology, presentation, diagnosis, and management are outlined as follows: acute intermittent porphyria is the most common AHP with an estimated prevalence of approximately 1 in 100,000; the major clinical presentation involves attacks of severe pain, usually abdominal and generalized, without peritoneal signs or abnormalities on cross-sectional imaging, occurring mainly in women in their childbearing years, and AHP should be considered especially in women aged 15–50 years with recurrent severe abdominal pain not ascribable to common causes; patients with elevations in urinary porphobilinogen and/or δ-aminolevulinic acid should initially be presumed to have AHP; the cornerstones of management include discontinuation of porphyrinogenic drugs and chemicals, administration of oral or intravenous dextrose and intravenous hemin, and use of analgesics and antiemetics; diagnosis can be confirmed after initial treatment by testing for pathogenic variants in HMBS, CPOX, PPOX, and ALAD; AHP is associated with chronic symptoms and long-term risks including systemic arterial hypertension, chronic renal and liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma; and liver transplantation is curative and reserved for patients with intractable symptoms who have failed other treatment options.

Acute hepatic porphyria biochemical testing patterns — In the small population of patients with AHP with recurrent acute attacks, urine ALA and PBG are typically elevated even at baseline between attacks. By contrast, when testing is performed in patients with sporadic AIP when they are asymptomatic, 15%–44% can have normal urine ALA and PBG values; the same, or even higher, percentages are likely true for HCP and VP, and in these patients, confirmatory testing may require repeat testing during an acute attack.

Summary of Case Series

Data and references from all cases are presented in Table 1 (see also Supporting Table S1).

Table 1
Detailed Description of ADP Cases

All DNA‐confirmed ADP patients were male. Seven patients experienced porphyric symptoms during childhood. Six patients presented with abdominal pain, one with pain in his extremities. Only the late‐onset patient presented with neuropathy of the extremities but no pain. Acute neuropathy was seen in various degrees in all patients, ranging from muscle weakness to severe paralysis. Four patients with paralysis required mechanical ventilation for transient respiratory failure.

Seven patients were treated with glucose and/or heme for attacks. Heme treatment was partially effective at reducing acute attack symptoms; it reduced abdominal pain and stabilized neurological symptoms. Three patients with a partial response were given weekly infusions to prevent attacks. In all 3 patients urinary ALA levels remained elevated. Liver transplantation had no effect in one case.

### Edetate calcium disodium [^3863f4b1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General Precautions

Edetate calcium disodium may produce the same renal damage as lead poisoning, such as proteinuria and microscopic hematuria. Treatment-induced nephrotoxicity is dose-dependent and may be reduced by assuring adequate diuresis before therapy begins. Urine flow must be monitored throughout therapy which must be stopped if anuria or severe oliguria develop. The proximal tubule hydropic degeneration usually recovers upon cessation of therapy. Edetate calcium disodium must be used in reduced doses in patients with pre-existing mild renal disease. Patients should be monitored for cardiac rhythm irregularities and other ECG changes during intravenous therapy.

Information for patients

Patients should be instructed to immediately inform their physician if urine output stops for a period of 12 hours.

Laboratory tests

Urinalysis and urine sediment, renal and hepatic function and serum electrolyte levels should be checked before each course of therapy and then be monitored daily during therapy in severe cases, and in less serious cases after the second and fifth day of therapy. Therapy must be discontinued at the first sign of renal toxicity. The presence of large renal epithelial cells or increasing number of red blood cells in urinary sediment or greater proteinuria call for immediate stopping of edetate calcium disodium administration. Alkaline phosphatase values are frequently depressed (possibly due to decreased serum zinc levels), but return to normal within 48 hours after cessation of therapy. Elevated erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels (> 35 mcg/dL of whole blood) indicate the need to perform a venous blood lead determination. If the whole blood lead concentration is between 25 to 55 mcg/dL a mobilization test can be considered (see Diagnostic Test).7,8An elevation of urinary coproporphyrin (adults: > 250 mcg/day; pediatric patients under 80 lbs: > 75 mcg/day) and elevation of urinary delta aminolevulinic acid (ALA) (adults: > 4 mg/day; pediatric patients: > 3 mg/m2/day) are associated with blood lead levels > 40 mcg/dL. Urinary coproporphyrin may be falsely negative in terminal patients and in severely iron-depleted pediatric patients who are not regenerating heme.9In growing pediatric patients long bone x-rays showing lead lines and abdominal x-rays showing radio-opaque material in the abdomen may be of help in estimating the level of exposure to lead.

### Acute porphyrias [^6536ebc0]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Porphyrias are a group of eight metabolic disorders characterized by defects in heme biosynthesis. Porphyrias are classified into two major categories: 1) the acute or inducible porphyrias and 2) the chronic cutaneous porphyrias. The acute hepatic porphyrias are further classified into acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), hereditary coproporphyria, variegate porphyria, and porphyria due to severe deficiency of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase (ALADP).

Discussion

AIP is the most common, and ALADP is the least common acute porphyria. The clinical presentations of acute porphyrias are nonspecific. There are no pathognomonic signs or symptoms. The most frequent presenting symptom is abdominal pain, but pain in the chest, back, or lower extremities may also occur. Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormality during acute attacks, and hypomagnesemia is also common. Both are risk factors for development of seizures, which occur in ∼ 20–30% of acute attacks.

Conclusion

Once suspected, the diagnosis of porphyria can be rapidly established by checking random urinary porphobilinogen. Initial management of acute porphyria includes discontinuation of all potentially harmful drugs and management of symptoms. Acute attacks should be treated emergently with intravenous heme and glucose to avoid considerable morbidity and mortality. Acute attacks last a few days, and the majority of patients are asymptomatic between attacks. Prognosis is good if the condition is recognized early and treated aggressively.

### Recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of the acute porphyrias [^fe73eb45]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The acute porphyrias, 4 inherited disorders of heme biosynthesis, cause life-threatening attacks of neurovisceral symptoms that mimic many other acute medical and psychiatric conditions. Lack of clinical recognition often delays effective treatment, and inappropriate diagnostic tests may lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. We review the clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and genetics of the acute porphyrias and provide recommendations for diagnosis and treatment on the basis of reviews of the literature and clinical experience. An acute porphyria should be considered in many patients with unexplained abdominal pain or other characteristic symptoms. The diagnosis can be rapidly confirmed by demonstration of a markedly increased urinary porphobilinogen level by using a single-void urine specimen. This specimen should also be saved for quantitative measurement of porphobilinogen, 5-aminolevulinic acid, and total porphyrin levels. Intravenous hemin therapy, started as soon as possible, is the most effective treatment. Intravenous glucose alone is appropriate only for mild attacks (mild pain, no paresis or hyponatremia) or until hemin is available. Precipitating factors should be eliminated, and appropriate supportive and symptomatic therapy should be initiated. Prompt diagnosis and treatment greatly improve prognosis and may prevent development of severe or chronic neuropathic symptoms. We recommend identification of at-risk relatives through enzymatic or gene studies.

### Pilot trial on the effect of 5-aminolevulinic acid on glucose tolerance in patients with maternally inherited diabetes and deafness [^3e73ee7d]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

The AUC of plasma glucose excursion from 0 to 120 min (AUC glucose 0–120 min) during the OGTT at 24 weeks was not significantly different from that measured at baseline. However, the late phase of glucose excursion determined by AUC glucose 60–120 min (mg/dL) at 24 weeks was significantly decreased compared with baseline (357 ± 42 versus 391 ± 50, p = 0.041) (Fig. 2 e). The AUCs of C-peptide and proinsulin also increased from baseline to 24 weeks, but not significantly (Fig. 2 g, h).

The results of the comparisons of the laboratory and isCGM data between baseline and 24 weeks after the initiation of 5-ALA/SFC treatment are presented in Table 3. The mean level of HbA1c tended to decrease from 8.3 ± 1.2% at baseline to 7.9 ± 0.3% at 24 weeks (p = 0.36), even though the required dosage of insulin did not change. Figure 3 shows the time course of mean HbA1c levels during 24 weeks, but the levels of each time point were not significantly different.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of acute hepatic porphyrias: expert review [^0190e9b7]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute hepatic porphyrias — diagnosis, acute attack treatment, and risk counseling — The key diagnostic test is a spot urine for ALA, PBG, porphyrins, and creatinine. Treatment of acute attacks should be with intravenous hemin given by peripherally inserted central catheter line or central port, 3–4 mg/kg body weight/d for 3–5 days, and givosiran should be considered in patients with biochemically and genetically documented AHP and with frequent attacks (4 or more per year). Acute attacks occur especially in women aged approximately 15–50 years, and long-term risks of AHPs include systemic arterial hypertension, chronic liver and renal diseases, and development of HCC even in the absence of cirrhosis, so patients should have ongoing assessments for such potential complications.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The effectiveness of PANHEMATIN for the amelioration of recurrent attacks of acute intermittent porphyria was evaluated in five open-label studies, one compassionate-use study, case reports, and an observational study investigating patient reported outcomes in patients with acute porphyrias.

Open-Label Studies

In the initial 5 open-label studies,1–599 patients with acute porphyrias (72 with AIP) were treated with 3–4 mg/kg/day of hemin once or twice daily. Of the 99 patients in these studies, 30 received prior or concomitant glucose administration. Patients experienced a clinical response in 85.5% (141/165) of treatment courses (Figure 1). Clinical response was defined by improvement of symptoms and reduction in pain. All patients experienced a chemical response which was defined as normalization of urinary aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG).

Watson et al.1studied the use of hemin treatment in 15 patients with acute porphyrias, of whom 11 were with AIP. Seven patients were female and four were male with an age range of 19–45 years with biochemical evidence of AIP. Preparations of 4 mg/ kg IV of hemin were infused at 12- or 24-hour intervals for 1 to 4 days after trials of glucose of various durations and dosages in all patients. All patients, with exception of one, experienced a clear clinical response most of which was rapid after hemin infusion. All patients also demonstrated a chemical response based on 58%-100% reduction in urinary ALA and PBG levels.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of acute hepatic porphyrias: expert review [^3f68e294]. Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Best Practice Advice 4: Acute attacks of AHP that are severe enough to require hospital admission should be treated with intravenous hemin, given daily, preferably into a high-flow central vein.

The currently approved treatment for acute attacks is intravenous hemin infusion, – usually given once daily at a dose of 3–4 mg/kg body weight, typically for 4 days. Hemin rapidly down-regulates ALAS1 expression in the liver, thus ameliorating the continued overproduction and accumulation of ALA and PBG. Symptom relief depends on elimination of excess ALA and PBG and typically requires 48–72 hours, although recovery from neurologic symptoms can vary significantly. Timely initiation of hemin therapy results in normalization of ALA and PBG levels, symptom improvement, and decreased risk of long-term neurologic complications.

A random urine for ALA, PBG, and creatinine should be collected before the start of hemin treatment. Due to the lack of available rapid ALA or PBG tests, initiation of hemin can be made on empirical grounds in patients with confirmed AHP. Because of potential thrombophlebitis from hemin, it is best given into a high-flow central vein via a peripherally inserted central catheter or central port. In addition, heme bound to human serum albumin is preferred due to heme stabilization and less irritation to veins.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of acute hepatic porphyrias: expert review [^ba237e44]. Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Both ALA and PBG can be measured with high sensitivity and specificity. – Unfortunately, these tests are performed at large reference laboratories only, and results often require 1–2 weeks to be reported. Rapid, qualitative urine PBG tests have been available since the 1950s (Hoesch or Watson-Schwartz test), but their clinical use has been limited due to lack of use by most hospitals. Recently, a new rapid test for PBG was approved in the United States (Teco Diagnostics).

For most patients with AHP, those who experience only a few acute attacks in their lifetimes, testing for urine ALA, PBG, and creatinine is most useful during an acute attack. Unless the patient has been treated with intravenous hemin, testing for ALA and PBG can be performed days after the acute attack. Studies of patients with AIP found that ALA and PBG can remain elevated in urine for months to years after an acute attack. However, ALA and PBG levels can fall quickly after an acute attack in patients with HCP or VP. When testing is performed in patients with sporadic AIP when they are asymptomatic, 15%–44% can have normal urine ALA and PBG values. The same, or even higher, percentages are likely true for HCP and VP. In these patients, confirmatory testing may require repeat testing during an acute attack.

In the small population of patients with AHP with recurrent acute attacks, urine ALA and PBG are typically elevated even at baseline between acute attacks. In patients who have frequent symptoms suggestive of acute attacks, normal ALA and PBG levels likely rule out AHP as the etiology of the symptoms.

Description

The acute hepatic porphyrias (AHP) are rare, inborn errors of heme-metabolism and include acute intermittent porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, variegate porphyria, and porphyria due to severe deficiency of 5-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase. Acute intermittent porphyria is the most common type of AHP, with an estimated prevalence of patients with symptoms of approximately 1 in 100,000. The major clinical presentation involves attacks of severe pain, usually abdominal and generalized, without peritoneal signs or abnormalities on cross-sectional imaging. Acute attacks occur mainly in women in their childbearing years. AHP should be considered in the evaluation of all patients, and especially women aged 15–50 years with recurrent severe abdominal pain not ascribable to common causes. The screening tests of choice include random urine porphobilinogen and δ-aminolevulinic acid corrected to creatinine. All patients with elevations in urinary porphobilinogen and/or δ-aminolevulinic acid should initially be presumed to have AHP. The cornerstones of management include discontinuation of porphyrinogenic drugs and chemicals, administration of oral or intravenous dextrose and intravenous hemin, and use of analgesics and antiemetics. Diagnosis of AHP type can be confirmed after initial treatment by genetic testing for pathogenic variants in HMBS, CPOX, PPOX, and ALAD genes. AHP is also associated with chronic symptoms and long-term risk of systemic arterial hypertension, chronic renal and liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients who have recurrent acute attacks (4 or more per year) should be considered for prophylactic therapy with intravenous hemin or subcutaneous givosiran. Liver transplantation is curative and reserved for patients with intractable symptoms who have failed other treatment options.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership, and underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These Best Practice Advice (BPA) statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Because systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Women aged 15–50 years with unexplained, recurrent severe abdominal pain without a clear etiology after an initial workup should be considered for screening for an AHP. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Initial diagnosis of AHP should be made by biochemical testing measuring δ-aminolevulinic acid, porphobilinogen, and creatinine on a random urine sample. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Genetic testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis of AHP in patients with positive biochemical testing. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Acute attacks of AHP that are severe enough to require hospital admission should be treated with intravenous hemin, given daily, preferably into a high-flow central vein. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: In addition to intravenous hemin, management of acute attacks of AHP should include pain control, antiemetics, management of systemic arterial hypertension, tachycardia, and hyponatremia, and hypomagnesemia, if present. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Patients should be counseled to avoid identifiable triggers that may precipitate acute attacks, such as alcohol and porphyrinogenic medications. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Prophylactic heme therapy or givosiran, administered in an outpatient setting, should be considered in patients with recurrent attacks (4 or more per year). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Liver transplantation for AHP should be limited to patients with intractable symptoms and significantly decreased quality of life who are refractory to pharmacotherapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Patients with AHP should be monitored annually for liver disease. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Patients with AHP, regardless of the severity of symptoms, should undergo surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma, beginning at age 50 years, with liver ultrasound every 6 months. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Patients with AHP on treatment should undergo surveillance for chronic kidney disease annually with serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Patients should be counseled on the chronic and long-term complications of AHP, including neuropathy, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma, and need for long-term monitoring.

Acute intermittent porphyria as a mimic of cyclic vomiting syndrome — acute intermittent porphyria occurs infrequently and generally does not present before puberty. It can present with recurrent vomiting and abdominal pain, mimicking CVS, but usually has 1 or more symptoms of anxiety, depression, hallucination, seizures, cranial nerve weakness, and paresis of the extremeties. The diagnosis can be confirmed by finding an increased urinary d-aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen in a spot urine during the episode.

### Clinical remission of delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase deficiency through suppression of erythroid heme synthesis [^8e5c63d5]. Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Case Report

A Dutch patient was admitted 2 days after birth, with sudden onset of tetraplegia and respiratory insufficiency. During this episode the etiology remained unresolved. He partially recovered, and his childhood was marked by walking difficulties due to bilateral ankle contractures, impaired hearing, mild intellectual disability, and autism. As an adult, he was independent with regard to activities of daily living, with domestic assistance, and performed volunteer work for 2 days a week.

During a second episode, at age 44 years, he presented with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and progressive asymmetrical weakness of both extremities. ADP was diagnosed based on increased urinary delta‐aminolevulinic acid (ALA) levels, normal porphobilinogen levels, and low ALAD enzyme activity (10%‐13% of the mean of normal). Lead poisoning, tyrosinemia, and other acute porphyrias were excluded. DNA sequencing detected two compound heterozygous mutations in the ALAD gene (Supporting Fig. S1).

He was treated with heme arginate 250 mg (Normosang; Orphan Europe). Following recurring attacks and disappointing recovery, prophylactic weekly heme therapy was initiated (plasma ALA then decreased to 1,977 nmol/L). The frequency of attacks decreased, but attacks still recurred. After several months, he developed resistant hypertension, and his neurological status slowly deteriorated with increasing weakness of all extremities, in parallel with a marked rise in plasma ALA (13,412 nmol/L).

A literature search on ADP was performed. Although ADP is considered a hepatic acute porphyria, there were more cases in which standard therapy was not satisfactory.

Notably, Thunell et al. 2 reported on a boy in whom liver transplantation did not cure his ADP and postulated that the disease might be erythroid in origin. Also, the only late‐onset case, of a Belgian patient, supported this hypothesis; he developed ADP due to a monoclonal erythroid disease, 3 polycythemia vera.

On top of weekly heme, we initiated weekly blood transfusions and hydroxycarbamide 1,000 mg once daily, to reduce erythroid heme synthesis. Within 2 weeks, symptoms improved and blood pressure returned to normal. Three months later he was still improving. He has no abdominal pain or weaknesses. Plasma ALA dropped from 10,270 to 3,298 nmol/L.

### The third case of doss porphyria (delta-amino-levulinic acid dehydratase deficiency) in Germany [^8cb052aa]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2004). Low credibility.

Delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) deficiency porphyria, or Doss porphyria, was first reported in Germany in 1979. Only four bona fide cases of Doss porphyria have been reported to date that were confirmed by immunological and molecular analyses of their ALAD mutations. Here we describe the fifth case of Doss porphyria. A 17-year-old German male suffered from colicky abdominal pain and severe polyneuropathy for 2 years. Urinary delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) was increased 32-fold, and coproporphyrin 76-fold compared with the upper limit of their respective normal ranges. Urinary excretion of porphobilinogen (PBG) and uroporphyrin was only slightly increased. Faecal porphyrins were within the normal range. Erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin concentrations were elevated 5.4-fold. ALAD activity in erythrocytes was decreased to 10% of the normal value, and was not activated by zinc and by dithiothreitol. Blood lead levels were within the normal range, excluding lead poisoning in the proband. Erythrocyte ALAD activity was about one-half of the normal value in both parents, whereas it was normal in the proband's brother. Urinary excretion of ALA, PBG and total porphyrins was within the normal range in both parents and the brother. Molecular genetic studies of the ALAD gene in the proband revealed two base changes, C to A and C to T, both in intron 3 at -11 bp upstream of the exon 3 start site. In addition to the proband, the father carried the (-11)C-to-T, while the mother carried the ALAD gene in the proband's brother. These findings suggest that the observed compound heterozygosity of the ALAD gene may be responsible for Doss porphyria in the proband. The proband was successfully treated with haem arginate infusion. The clinical condition improved, and urinary excretion of ALA and coproporphyrin fell to levels of approximately 50% compared with their pretreatment levels during acute relapses. The haem therapy was continued once weekly for 1 year. At the end of 1 year, urinary ALA and porphyrin levels were significantly lowered, and the proband is now almost free of clinical symptoms.

The course of delta-aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase activity was studied over the 23 years in erythrocytes of two male patients. The enzyme activity was originally 1–2%, which then increased to approximately 8%, of normal levels several years after clinical manifestation of the acute hepatic porphyria syndrome. Urinary excretions of delta-aminolaevulinic acid and coproporphyrin III were excessively increased in the two patients with compound-heterozygous delta-aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase deficiency porphyria.

### Porphyric neuropathy [^66092795]. Muscle & Nerve (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute hepatic porphyrias are inherited metabolic disorders that may present with polyneuropathy, which if not diagnosed early can lead to quadriparesis, respiratory weakness, and death. Porphyric neuropathy is an acute to subacute motor predominant axonal neuropathy with a predilection for the upper extremities and usually preceded by a predominantly parasympathetic autonomic neuropathy. The rapid progression and associated dysautonomia mimic Guillain-Barré syndrome but are distinguished by the absence of cerebrospinal fluid albuminocytologic dissociation, progression beyond 4 wk, and associated abdominal pain. Spot urine test to assess the porphyrin precursors delta-aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen can provide a timely diagnosis during an acute attack. Timely treatment with intravenous heme, carbohydrate loading, and avoidance of porphyrinogenic medications can prevent further neurological morbidity and mortality.

### Stability of porphyrins and porphyrin precursors in urine and plasma samples: implications for sample handling and storage [^da49be32]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

The porphyrias are rare disorders of haem biosynthesis. Diagnosis requires demonstrating increased porphyrins or porphyrin precursors in blood, urine and faeces. Patients may only be investigated once, and therefore, understanding the preanalytical factors affecting the reliability of results is crucial. Guidance for sample handling exists, but published evidence regarding the stability of porphyrins and their precursors is limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of light exposure and different storage temperatures on analyte stability for measurement of urinary aminolaevulinic acid and porphobilinogen, total urine porphyrin and plasma porphyrin. Our results confirm that all samples should be protected from light. Results from samples exposed to light for greater than 4hours should be interpreted with caution and repeat samples requested. If transported to a specialist laboratory, samples should be stored at 4°C before transport. Transit time at ambient temperatures should be less than 24 hours.

### Clinical remission of delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase deficiency through suppression of erythroid heme synthesis [^d3cca7f2]. Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We report on an ADP case with abdominal pain and progressive neurological symptoms despite prophylactic heme therapy to reduce hepatic ALA production. We demonstrate that these symptoms could be improved by also suppressing erythroid heme synthesis, through blood transfusions and hydroxycarbamide.

Patients with ADP seem to have a diminished response to standard therapy for acute hepatic porphyrias, despite hepatic 5′‐aminolevulinate synthase 1 mRNA being increased. 4 The failure of liver transplantation to cure 1 patient and the late manifestation coinciding with a monoclonal myeloproliferative neoplasm support the hypothesis that in ADP patients ALA can also be overproduced by bone marrow. ADP appears to be an erythrohepatic porphyria.

Suppression of erythroid ALA by blood transfusions and hydroxyurea may be considered, as reported here.

### Homozygous acute intermittent porphyria in a 7-year-old boy with massive excretions of porphyrins and porphyrin precursors [^82e334e7]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2004). Low credibility.

A 7-year-old boy demonstrating hepatosplenomegaly, mild anaemia, mild mental retardation, yellow-brown teeth and dark red urine had excessively elevated levels of urinary delta-aminolevulinic acid, porphobilinogen and uroporphyrin. Furthermore hepta-, hexa-, penta- and copro(I)porphyrins were highly increased in urine. This pattern of porphyrin precursor and metabolite excretion is characteristic of acute intermittent porphyria. The decreased copro(III)/copro(I+III) ratio, normally not found in acute intermittent porphyria, is discussed. The porphobilinogen deaminase activity in red cells was decreased to 2–4%. Mutation analysis revealed a novel homozygous L81P mutation in exon 6 of the porphobilinogen deaminase gene. The father and mother, shown to be gene carriers of the same mutation, are asymptomatic and have normal urinary porphyrin precursor and metabolite excretion.

### Clinical guide and update on porphyrias [^a72d2df7]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Physicians should be aware of porphyrias, which could be responsible for unexplained gastrointestinal, neurologic, or skin disorders. Despite their relative rarity and complexity, most porphyrias can be easily defined and diagnosed. They are caused by well-characterized enzyme defects in the complex heme biosynthetic pathway and are divided into categories of acute vs non-acute or hepatic vs erythropoietic porphyrias. Acute hepatic porphyrias (acute intermittent porphyria, variegate porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, and aminolevulinic acid dehydratase deficient porphyria) manifest in attacks and are characterized by overproduction of porphyrin precursors, producing often serious abdominal, psychiatric, neurologic, or cardiovascular symptoms. Patients with variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria can present with skin photosensitivity. Diagnosis relies on measurement of increased urinary 5-aminolevulinic acid (in patients with aminolevulinic acid dehydratase deficient porphyria) or increased 5-aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen (in patients with other acute porphyrias). Management of attacks requires intensive care, strict avoidance of porphyrinogenic drugs and other precipitating factors, caloric support, and often heme therapy. The non-acute porphyrias are porphyria cutanea tarda, erythropoietic protoporphyria, X-linked protoporphyria, and the rare congenital erythropoietic porphyria. They lead to the accumulation of porphyrins that cause skin photosensitivity and occasionally severe liver damage. Secondary elevated urinary or blood porphyrins can occur in patients without porphyria, for example, in liver diseases, or iron deficiency. Increases in porphyrin precursors and porphyrins are also found in patients with lead intoxication. Patients with porphyria cutanea tarda benefit from iron depletion, hydroxychloroquine therapy, and, if applicable, elimination of the hepatitis C virus. An α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone analogue can reduce sunlight sensitivity in patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria or X-linked protoporphyria. Strategies to address dysregulated or dysfunctional steps within the heme biosynthetic pathway are in development.

### Porphyria attacks in prepubertal children and adolescents [^93620841]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

The clinical and laboratory features of dominant acute hepatic porphyrias (AHPs) in prepubertal children and adolescents have not been well established.

Objective

To evaluate clinical and laboratory features of AHPs in prepubertal children and adolescents compared to adults.

Data Sources

OVID (Embase Classic+Embase and MEDLINE), Scopus, and Google Scholar.

Study Selection

Studies describing symptomatic children or adolescents (< 18 years old) with increased urinary porphobilinogen were included.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently extracted the data, with a third reviewer arbitrating discrepancies.

Results

100 studies were included describing 112 patients (26 prepubertal children and 86 adolescents). Differences were found between prepubertal children and adolescents regarding sex distribution (female-to-male ratio: 1:2 vs. 4:1), clinical manifestations, and concomitant clinical manifestations.

Limitations

There was variation in the methods used to diagnose porphyria attacks across studies, and some elements of the quality of individual studies were unclear.

Conclusions

Prepubertal children with AHPs and porphyria attacks presented with distinct demographic and clinical characteristics from adolescents and adults. Nearly two-thirds of the affected children were males, and about half had a concomitant medical condition that can constitutively upregulate hepatic δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase-1. Adolescents were comparable to adults in almost all respects.

### Hemin (panhematin) [^71ab6590]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In another study by Lamon et al.5seven patients with acute attacks of porphyria were administered 11 hemin courses (each course: 1 mg/kg every 24 hours for 3 to 13 days). Before and during hemin administration, patients were maintained on a 250–300 g/24H carbohydrate diet. Patients had elevated urinary ALA and PBG treatment and clinical evidence of an acute attack. Chemical response of a decrease in ALA and PBG occurred in every patient (except one PBG value in one patient) when treatment lasted 5 days or longer (p < 0.001).

Figure 1: Efficacy Data on Hemin in Acute Intermittent Porphyria from 5 Open-Label Studies

Compassionate Use Study

In the compassionate use, multi-center, open-label, non-comparative study6, 130 patients were enrolled with a diagnosis of acute porphyria and were treated with hemin. The patients were administered hemin for acute attacks [N = 90 (69%)], prophylaxis [N = 19 (15%)], or both [N = 21 (16%)]. There was a subset of patients in the "both" group (acute attacks and prophylaxis) who were treated for acute attacks prior to receiving prophylactic treatment. Seventy-two percent of the patients were female and 28% were male. Hemin was administered to 111 patients (enrolled in the "acute attack" and the "both" treatment groups) for the treatment of 305 acute attacks and to 40 patients (enrolled in the "prophylaxis" and the "both" treatment groups) for prophylactic treatment. Out of the 40 patients who received prophylaxis, 19 received prophylaxis only and 21 patients were treated for up to 3 acute attacks prior to receiving prophylactic treatment. Prophylaxis treatment varied greatly in frequency with the most common hemin regimen given once a week. Clinical response was achieved if the physician determined that the admitting symptoms were resolved, there was a clinically acceptable response, or the patient went into remission.

### Neurovisceral porphyrias: what a hematologist needs to know [^9a187f07]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

The acute or inducible hepatic porphyrias comprise four inherited disorders of heme biosynthesis. They usually remain asymptomatic for most of the lifespan of individuals who inherit the specific enzyme deficiencies but may cause life-threatening attacks of neurovisceral symptoms. Failure to consider the diagnosis frequently delays effective treatment, and inappropriate diagnostic tests and/or mistaken interpretation of results may lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. The four disorders are ALA dehydratase deficiency porphyria, acute intermittent porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, and variegate porphyria. Other conditions that clinically and biochemically may mimic acute porphyria include lead poisoning and hereditary tyrosinemia type I. The diagnosis of one of these acute porphyric syndromes should be considered in many patients with otherwise unexplained abdominal pain, severe constipation, systemic arterial hypertension, or other characteristic symptoms. Critical to the rapid diagnosis of the three most common of these disorders is demonstration of markedly increased urinary porphobilinogen (PBG) in a single-void urine specimen. The treatment of choice for all but mild attacks of the acute porphyrias is intravenous hemin therapy, which should be started as soon as possible. Intravenous glucose alone is recommended only for mild attacks (no weakness or hyponatremia) or until hemin is available.

### Influence of the delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) polymorphism on biomarkers of lead exposure in Turkish storage battery manufacturing workers [^c6f2c669]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The relationship between delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase polymorphism (ALAD) and biomarkers of exposure was investigated in Turkish lead workers in this study.

Methods

Seventy two male lead battery manufacturing workers were selected for the study. Blood lead (BPb) and urinary lead (UPb) concentrations were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. Erythrocyte ALAD activity and urinary 5-aminolevulinic acid (UALA) were measured spectrophotometrically. The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique was used to determine the genotype of the ALAD gene.

Results

In total, 51 workers (70.8%) had the ALAD 1–1 genotype, whereas 21 workers (29.2%) had the ALAD 1–2 genotype. No significant relationships were found between the two genotypes and BPb, UPb, and ALAD activity. ALAD1 homozygotes showed significantly higher levels of UALA in comparison with those ALAD2 carriers.

Conclusions

ALAD 1–1 individuals might be an increased risk compared to ALAD2 carriers to disturbance in heme biosynthetic pathway in high lead exposure.

6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The safety of Gleolan is supported by data from 5 open label clinical studies, which included 527 patients with glioma who received ALA HCl. Adverse reactions that occurred in > 1% of patients in the week following surgery were pyrexia, hypotension, nausea, and vomiting. Adverse reactions occurring in the first 6 weeks after surgery in < 1% of patients were: chills, photosensitivity reaction, solar dermatitis, hypotension, abnormal liver function test, and diarrhea. One patient experienced respiratory failure due to drug overdose [see Overdosage (10)].

Neurologic Events

Nervous system disorders occurred in 29% of patients within the first week after surgery. Events occurring in > 1% of patients included aphasia (8%), hemiparesis (7.8%), hemianopsia (3.2%), headache (2.7%), seizure (1.9%), hemiplegia (1.9%), monoparesis (1.3%) and hypoesthesia (1.1%). Brain edema occurred in < 1% of patients in the first 6 weeks after surgery. In a randomized clinical trial (Study 3), the numbers of serious neurologic adverse events in the post operative period were higher in patients randomized to ALA fluorescence arm compared to the control arm. An imbalance was notable for the adverse events aphasia, ataxia, convulsion and hemianopsia, and is likely related to the higher amount of brain resection performed in the ALA arm. At longer follow up periods, the numbers between the two arms appeared similar [see Clinical Trials (14)].

Elevated Liver Enzymes

Worsening of ≥ 2 Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grades in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) occurred in (15.8% and 11.6%, respectively) within the first week after surgery. Absolute levels ranged from 2 times to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) for each parameter. At 6 weeks, ALT remained elevated in 2.9% of patients (range 2 to greater than 5 × ULN), and GGT was elevated in 7.5% of patients (range 2 to greater than 10 × ULN). No cases of liver failure occurred.

1 INTRODUCTION

Acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) comprises a group of rare genetic diseases characterized by potentially life‐threatening acute attacks and, in some cases, chronic manifestations that impair daily functioning and quality of life (QOL). The four AHP types include acute intermittent porphyria (AIP, most common), variegate porphyria (VP), hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), and delta‐aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase‐deficiency porphyria (ADP). AHP results from hepatic heme biosynthesis defects, leading to induction of ALA synthase 1 (ALAS1), the initial and rate‐controlling enzyme in heme biosynthesis, and accumulation of the heme intermediates ALA and porphobilinogen (PBG), which likely are responsible for disease manifestations.

Common attack symptoms include severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, tachycardia, hypertension, mental status changes, muscle weakness, hyponatremia, and urine color change. Attacks often require hospitalization and, without prompt treatment, may result in paralysis, respiratory failure, and, rarely, death. Some patients experience debilitating chronic symptoms (e.g. pain, neuropathy, fatigue, nausea, insomnia, anxiety, depression) between attacks. Long‐term AHP‐related (particularly AIP‐related) complications and comorbidities include chronic kidney disease, systemic arterial hypertension, chronic neuropathy, and liver disease. Progressive physical and mental deterioration in patients with recurrent attacks can impair daily living activities and ability to work, and significantly reduce QOL. Patients with recurrent attacks often experience difficulties adjusting to the limitations of AHP, negatively impacting relationships.

### Phase 3 trial of RNAi therapeutic givosiran for acute intermittent porphyria [^e3955be2]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Up-regulation of hepatic delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1), with resultant accumulation of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen, is central to the pathogenesis of acute attacks and chronic symptoms in acute hepatic porphyria. Givosiran, an RNA interference therapy, inhibits ALAS1 expression.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned symptomatic patients with acute hepatic porphyria to receive either subcutaneous givosiran (2.5 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo monthly for 6 months. The primary end point was the annualized rate of composite porphyria attacks among patients with acute intermittent porphyria, the most common subtype of acute hepatic porphyria. (Composite porphyria attacks resulted in hospitalization, an urgent health care visit, or intravenous administration of hemin at home.) Key secondary end points were levels of ALA and porphobilinogen and the annualized attack rate among patients with acute hepatic porphyria, along with hemin use and daily worst pain scores in patients with acute intermittent porphyria.

Results

A total of 94 patients underwent randomization (48 in the givosiran group and 46 in the placebo group). Among the 89 patients with acute intermittent porphyria, the mean annualized attack rate was 3.2 in the givosiran group and 12.5 in the placebo group, representing a 74% lower rate in the givosiran group (P < 0.001); the results were similar among the 94 patients with acute hepatic porphyria. Among the patients with acute intermittent porphyria, givosiran led to lower levels of urinary ALA and porphobilinogen, fewer days of hemin use, and better daily scores for pain than placebo. Key adverse events that were observed more frequently in the givosiran group were elevations in serum aminotransferase levels, changes in serum creatinine levels and the estimated glomerular filtration rate, and injection-site reactions.

Conclusions

Among patients with acute intermittent porphyria, those who received givosiran had a significantly lower rate of porphyria attacks and better results for multiple other disease manifestations than those who received placebo. The increased efficacy was accompanied by a higher frequency of hepatic and renal adverse events. (Funded by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals; ENVISION ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03338816.).

### Dual gene defects involving delta-aminolaevulinate dehydratase and coproporphyrinogen oxidase in a porphyria patient [^44dfdfac]. British Journal of Haematology (2006). Low credibility.

Summary A Caucasian male had symptoms of acute porphyria, with increases in urinary delta-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA), porphobilinogen (PBG) and coproporphyrin that were consistent with hereditary coproporphyria (HCP). However, a greater than expected increase in ALA, compared with PBG, and a substantial increase in erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin, suggested additional ALA dehydratase (ALAD) deficiency. Nucleotide sequence analysis of coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPO) cDNA of the patient, but not of the parents, revealed a novel nucleotide transition G835→ C, resulting in an amino acid change, G279R. The mutant CPO protein expressed in Escherichia coli was unstable, and produced about 5% of activity compared with the wild-type CPO. Erythrocyte ALAD activity was 32% of normal in the proband. Nucleotide sequence analysis of cloned ALAD cDNAs from the patient revealed a C36→ G base transition (F12L amino acid change). The F12L ALAD mutation, which was found in the mother and a brother, was previously described, and is known to lack any enzyme activity. This patient thus represents the first case of porphyria where both CPO and ALAD deficiencies were demonstrated at the molecular level.

The diagnostic accuracy of PPIX–PDD in the males with positive biopsy at different total PSA levels was 2/2 (100%) patients for PSA levels within 0–4 ng/ml, 28/39 (71.8%) for PSA levels within 4–10 ng/ml, 11/15 (73.3%) for PSA levels within 10–20 ng/ml, and 19/25 (76.0%) for PSA levels > 20 ng/ml. The diagnostic accuracy at different tumor stages was 34/45 (75.6%) for tumor stage cT1, 22/32 (68.8%) for cT2, and 4/4 (100%) for cT3. The incidence of PPIX–PDD positivity did not increase with increase in the total PSA levels (p = 0.25) and tumor stage (p = 0.87). Furthermore, the diagnostic accuracy of PPIX–PDD in the males with positive biopsies was 15/24 (62.5%) for Gleason score (GS) 6, 26/34 (76.4%) for GS 7, and 19/23 (82.6%) for GS 8–10. The incidence of PPIX–PDD positivity increased with increasing GS, but the increase was not significant (p = 0.11) (Table 3).

### Liver transplantation for acute intermittent porphyria is complicated by a high rate of hepatic artery thrombosis [^ce73c6c4]. Liver Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Survival after LT for AIP. Two of the 10 patients who underwent LT for AIP died (1 patient at 98 days and 1 patient at 26 months). The median follow-up time was 23.4 months.

LT resulted in no further porphyria attacks for the recipients, who experienced a complete biochemical resolution of their urinary PBG excretion (Fig. 2 A). Urinary PBG and ALA levels can be expected to return to normal within 24 and 72 hours of transplantation, respectively (Fig. 2 B), and to remain normal thereafter. Monitoring PBG levels after transplantation is, therefore, unnecessary. One patient who underwent transplantation in 2002 at the center in Birmingham returned to full-time employment and gave birth to a healthy child.

Figure 2
AIP activity after LT. (A) Urine PBG/creatinine ratios for 9 of the 10 AIP patients before and after LT. All 9 patients experienced a complete biochemical resolution of their disease (reference level < 1.5 μmol/mmol). The 10th patient had an elevated pretransplant ratio of 74.3 μmol/mmol, but no posttransplant level was available. However, this patient was asymptomatic after transplantation, and the posttransplant level was, therefore, expected to be normal. (B) Short-term urinary PBG/creatinine and ALA/creatinine ratios for a single AIP patient before and after LT. The urinary PBG level returned to normal within 24 hours and remained normal thereafter.

Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) in parenteral nutrition — form, metabolism, and kinetics: In parenteral nutrition (PN) formulations, pyridoxine is supplied as pyridoxine hydrochloride because it is more stable than other forms and is phosphorylated to its active form, pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP), by the liver. Pyridoxine hydrochloride is an inactive compound that is metabolized in the liver to pyridoxal (PL) and pyridoxamine-5'-phosphate (PMP), and PLP undergoes oxidation in the liver to 4-pyridoxic acid, which is excreted. After infusion in normal volunteers, plasma steady-state concentration was reached within 30 minutes, the serum half-life was only a few minutes, and only 6.7% of the administered dose was detected unmetabolized in the urine, with urine amounts somewhat greater when active metabolites were included. PLP functions as a coenzyme for aminotransferases, is the coenzyme for glycogen phosphorylase with roles in glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, and PLP-dependent δ-aminolevulinate synthase is important for heme biosynthesis.

Methods

Data collection

In this single-centre retrospective longitudinal observational cohort study, all patients with AIP attending the clinic of the Porphyria Center in the Erasmus Medical Center (Rotterdam, the Netherlands) between 1960 and 2016 were included. The diagnosis AIP was based on either a known HMBS gene mutation, or on positive biochemistry (defined as a delta-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG) level at least four times the upper limit of normal) in combination with a decreased porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGd) enzyme activity measured in either erythrocytes or lymphocytes.

Data were collected by R. A.N. and J.G.L. from patients' electronic and paper records, and from self-reported questionnaires (Suppl. file 1). The patient charts and file data were first reviewed. When the retrospective data was unclear (e.g. due to old, poorly hand-written notes), a consensus was formed which was entered in the final database, or the data was discarded.

AIP patients with a proven diagnosis were eligible for inclusion. A confirmed acute porphyric attack was defined as an episode of abdominal pain in parallel with a significant rise in urinary ALA and PBG levels (≥ 4 times upper limit of normal) which necessitated a verified visit or admission to a hospital for diagnosis and treatment. Hospitalisations were defined as hospitalisations with a confirmed acute porphyric attack.

We collected data on (1) porphyria symptoms and long-term complications, (2) employment status, (3) hospitalisation episodes, hospitalisation days, amount and frequency of heme infusions (heme arginate, Normosang®, Orphan Europe), (4) heme dosage schedules, duration of prophylactic heme therapy, complications of heme therapy, placement of a Port-A-Cath® (PAC, Smiths Medical), oral contraception use, therapy with GnRH analogues, analgesia dependence and the age and cause of death. The annualised attack rate was defined as the number of attacks in all observed years of follow up, counting the number of confirmed acute porphyric attacks and dividing by the number of follow up years.

The medical ethics committee of the Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, approved prospective and retrospective data collection for this study (MEC 2014–593). Patients were asked to sign informed consent during visits to the outpatient clinic. Also, they have approved the use of anonymous retrospective medical data without informed consent.

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the small interfering ribonucleic acid, givosiran, in patients with acute hepatic porphyria [^8d5d64f0]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Givosiran is a small interfering ribonucleic acid agent that was recently approved in the United States for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria (AHP). This phase I study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profile of subcutaneously (SC) administered givosiran in patients with acute intermittent porphyria, the most common AHP type. Givosiran was rapidly absorbed from the SC injection site with peak plasma concentrations achieved within 0.5–5 hours followed by elimination with a short half-life of 4–10 hours. Plasma exposures of AS(N-1)3' givosiran, an active metabolite with equal potency as givosiran, was 35%-75%. Givosiran treatment resulted in a rapid and dose-dependent reduction in urinary aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG) towards the upper limit of normal (ULN) in AHP patients. Greater and more sustained reductions in ALA and PBG were achieved with once monthly dosing compared with once quarterly dosing. After monthly dosing, trough ALA levels were reduced to below the ULN, approximately 95% reduction from baseline, at both the 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg doses.

Porphyrias

The porphyrias are inherited metabolic disorders of heme biosynthesis in which specific patterns of heme precursor overproduction are associated with characteristic clinical features. Each type of porphyria is the result of a specific impairment of the activity of one of the enzymes involved in heme biosynthesis. Porphyrias are classified as erythropoietic or hepatic in type, depending on the primary organ in which excess production of porphyrins or their precursors takes place.

Genetics and pathogenesis

The porphyrias are inherited by a dominant autosomal mechanism, except in the cases of congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) and delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) deficiency, which are inherited by a recessive autosomal mechanism. Not all gene carriers of inherited porphyrias develop clinical disease, and there is a significant interplay between the primary gene defect and the secondary acquired or environmental factors (e.g. medication, liver damage, hormonal changes and starvation).

Heme pathway intermediates are potentially toxic. Their overproduction causes the characteristic neurovisceral and/or photosensitizing symptoms. Porphyrins produce free radicals when exposed to ultraviolet light. As a result, skin damage ensues in light-exposed areas resulting in cutaneous porphyrias. In contrast to porphyrins, their precursors are associated with neurological symptoms or acute hepatic porphyrias. Porphyrins and their precursors are excreted in urine or stool depending on their solubility. Accordingly, the water-soluble uroporphyrin is excreted in urine, while the water-insoluble protoporphyrin is excreted via bile and stool. Coproporphyrin is excreted into both urine and stool because of its intermediate solubility. Porphyrin precursors are essentially all excreted in urine. During an acute attack of porphyria an increased production of heme precursors leads to the accumulation of porphyrin intermediates.

Clinical features

Erythropoietic porphyrias

Porphyrins in red blood cells can cause photosensitive cell lysis, resulting in hemolytic anemia. The two homozygous erythropoietic porphyrias, CEP and hepato-erythropoietic porphyria (HEP), are associated with hemolytic anemia of varying degrees. In contrast, erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), a heterozygous disease, rarely has accompanying hemolytic anemia. The effect of life-long anemia in CEP or HEP may lead to compensatory expansion of erythroid marrow, which may result in pathological fractures, vertebral compression or collapse, and shortness of stature. The hemolysis is also associated with varying degrees of splenomegaly and the production of pigment-laden gallstones.

### Hemin (panhematin) [^c1378a33]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pierach et al.2examined the use of 2 to 4 mg/kg of hemin IV in 57 patients with acute porphyrias, of whom 43 were with AIP. Out of 82 individual acute intermittent porphyria attacks with 476 hemin infusions (82 treatment courses) administered, a clinical response was seen in 74 (90%) acute attacks. A chemical response was seen for those patients who had elevated urinary ALA and PBG levels prior to hemin treatment.

McColl et al.3reported the use of 4 mg/kg of hemin IV given either every 12 or 24 hours for three to five days in the treatment of 13 attacks of acute porphyria in eight patients. Seven of these 8 patients had AIP. Five patients with AIP were female and two were male with a mean age of 25 years (range 19–31 years). All patients had biochemical and clinical evidence of an attack of acute porphyria at the time of hemin administration. All patients had a chemical response of approximately 50% reduction in urinary ALA and PBG from pre-treatment values. In addition, clinical response was seen after hemin treatment in a total of 7 attacks in 5 AIP patients.

Lamon et al.4reported on 12 patients with acute porphyrias, of whom 11 were with AIP. These AIP patients received 190 infusions of approximately 2 to 4 mg/kg of hemin IV given every 12 or 24 hours for 3 to 13 days as 20 separate courses of treatment, when high carbohydrate intake (300 g for a minimum of 72 hours) and supportive measures were unsuccessful. Urinary ALA and PBG levels were collected as well as clinical signs and symptoms of AIP recorded. Out of 20 treatment courses for acute attacks, there was a clinical response in 14. All patients had significant reductions in ALA and/or PBG levels after hemin treatment (p-value in the range from less than 0.001 to 0.05).

### Nitisinone [^1b188a5e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Dosage

Starting Dosage

The recommended starting dosage of nitisinone capsules is 0.5 mg/kg administered orally twice daily.

Maintenance Regimen

In patients 5 years of age and older who have undetectable serum and urine succinylacetone concentrations after a minimum of 4 weeks on a stable dosage of nitisinone, the total daily dose of nitisinone capsules may be given once daily (e.g., 1 to 2 mg/kg once daily) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Dosage Titration

Titrate the dosage in each individual patient based on biochemical and/or clinical response.

Monitor plasma and/or urine succinylacetone concentrations, liver function parameters and alpha-fetoprotein levels.
If succinylacetone is still detectable in blood or urine 4 weeks after the start of nitisinone treatment, increase the nitisinone dosage to 0.75 mg/kg twice daily. A maximum total daily dosage of 2 mg/kg may be needed based on the evaluation of all biochemical parameters.
If the biochemical response is satisfactory (undetectable blood and/or urine succinylacetone), the dosage should be adjusted only according to body weight gain and not according to plasma tyrosine levels.
During initiation of therapy, when switching from twice daily to once daily dosing, or if there is a deterioration in the patient's condition, it may be necessary to follow all available biochemical parameters more closely (i.e. plasma and/or urine succinylacetone, urine 5-aminolevulinate (ALA) and erythrocyte porphobilinogen (PBG)-synthase activity).
Maintain plasma tyrosine levels below 500 micromol/L by dietary restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine intake [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In patients who develop plasma tyrosine levels above 500 micromol/L, assess dietary tyrosine and phenylalanine intake. Do not adjust the nitisinone capsules dosage in order to lower the plasma tyrosine concentration.

2.2 Administration

Administration of Nitisinone Capsules

Maintain dietary restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine when taking nitisinone capsules.
Take at least one hour before, or two hours after a meal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. For patients who have difficulty swallowing the capsules, the capsules may be opened and the contents suspended in a small amount of water, formula or apple sauce immediately before use.

### Association of renal function and delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase polymorphism among Vietnamese and Singapore workers exposed to inorganic lead [^c8b16336]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the effect of delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) polymorphisms on the association between blood lead and renal function among Vietnamese and Singaporean workers who were exposed to low to medium levels of inorganic lead, and to study the distribution of ALAD polymorphism among Vietnamese, Chinese, Malays and Indians.

Methods

A total of 459 male and female workers were studied. Blood and urine were collected for each worker in order to determine ALAD genotype, blood lead, and urinary delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALAU). Renal function tests included urine albumin (Ualb), urine beta2 microglobulin (Ubeta2m), urinary alpha1 microglobulin (Ualpha1m), N-acetyl-glucosaminidas (NAG), and urine retinol blinding protein (RBP). A multiple regression model with interaction term was applied to fit the entire data and to explore the modifying effect of ALAD polymorphism on the relation of blood lead to each renal function parameter.

Results

ALAD1-1 was the predominant genotype for all the ethnic groups while ALAD2-2 was the rarest. The frequency of ALAD2 allele was higher among Malays (8.8%) and Indians (10.6%) compared to the Chinese (5.0%) and Vietnamese (4.3%). The geometric mean of blood lead for all workers was 19.0 microg/dl. The models for Ubeta2m, Ualpha1m, and NAG showed that the ALAD1-2/2–2 group had higher beta coefficients than the ALAD1-1 group. Corresponding to 10 microg/dl blood lead, ALAD1-1 homozygotes had an increment of 1.288 microg/g Cr, 1.175 mg/g Cr, and 1.995 U/g Cr for Ubeta2m, Ualpha1m, and NAG, respectively. ALAD1-2/2–2 subjects had higher increments of 3.802 microg/g Cr, 2.138 mg/g Cr, and 3.89 U/g Cr for Ubeta2m, Ualpha1m, and NAG, respectively.

Conclusion

The frequency of the ALAD2 allele is as low in Vietnamese workers as in Chinese. Workers with the ALAD2 allele appeared more susceptible to the effects of lead (especially at higher levels) on renal function.

### Role of 5-aminolevulinic acid in the diagnosis and treatment of superficial bladder cancer: improvement in diagnostic sensitivity [^982607fe]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To use 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) in diagnostic cystoscopy and during transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) to treat transitional cell carcinoma. The efficacy of this new technique was compared with standard cystoscopy.

Methods

The 5-ALA, instilled in the bladder 2 hours before cystoscopy, makes the pathologic tissue fluorescent when illuminated with blue light (375 to 400 nm). This allows a better recognition of the neoplastic forms for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes during TURB. This method has been used since May 1997 on 49 patients in whom bladder tumor was diagnosed either immediately or during postchemotherapy follow-up.

Results

One hundred seventy-nine biopsies were taken of fluorescent and nonfluorescent areas (3.5 per patient) to check the effectiveness of the new method compared with standard cystoscopy. A good correlation was found between 5-ALA cystoscopy and the histopathologic diagnosis, with a good sensitivity (87%). The 5-ALA cystoscopy allowed the diagnosis of a tumor in 24 patients with negative standard cystoscopic findings. Furthermore, 5-ALA cystoscopy detected 7 cases of carcinoma in situ. Neither local nor systemic (because of endovesical instillation) side effects were noted.

Conclusions

We believe that 5-ALA could be routinely used in the diagnosis of superficial bladder tumors, as it was shown to improve the diagnostic sensitivity for carcinoma in situ and to reduce the risk of recurrence related to missed cancerous lesions or incomplete TURB.

### Porphyrias [^58e5aa2e]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Seven different porphyrias form a group of inherited metabolic disorders, each resulting from a partial deficiency of a specific enzyme in the haem biosynthesis pathway. Clinically, the three most important entities are an acute porphyric attack and acute and chronic skin symptoms. Porphyrias are rare and sometimes misdiagnosed, because various symptoms and signs mimic other diseases. Once porphyria is suspected, biochemical analyses easily detect porphyrins and their precursors from blood, urine, or faeces. Mutation screening can be done at the quiescent phase of the disease. Pathogenetic mechanisms and clinical manifestations differ in individual porphyrias and most of them require a specific treatment. Early diagnosis and information about precipitating factors can diminish mortality and prevent subsequent attacks among patients with acute porphyrias, so mutation screening is recommended for family members.

### Porphyrin precursors and risk of primary liver cancer in acute intermittent porphyria: a case-control study of 188 patients [^67b89316]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is a rare hereditary metabolic disease characterized by acute attacks and accumulation of the porphyrin precursors 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG). Patients with AIP have a high risk of primary liver cancer (PLC). We aimed to assess the association between porphyrin precursor excretion and the risk for PLC in patients with AIP. We studied 48 patients with AIP who developed PLC between 1987 and 2015 and 140 age and sex matched controls with AIP but no PLC. Data on all available urinary PBG and ALA samples collected from 1975 until 1year before PLC diagnosis were analyzed and compared between cases and controls using logistic regression. Porphyrin precursor excretion was higher in patients with PLC (PBG median 7.9 [IQR 4.4–21.9] mmol/mol creatinine) than in controls (3.8 [1.2–9.8]) (adjusted odds ratio 1.07, 95% confidence interval: 1.02–1.12). None of the 28 patients with all registered samples below the upper limit of normal (ULN) developed PLC, and only one of the 45 patients with all samples < 2× ULN developed PLC. Among non-PLC controls, ALA and PBG levels decreased after age 50–60 while an increasing trend was observed after age 65 among those who developed PLC. Increased urinary porphyrin precursors are associated with a high risk of developing PLC. Patients with normal levels appear to have a low risk while high or increasing ALA and PBG after age 65 indicates high risk, which should be considered in surveillance decisions.

### EXPLORE: a prospective, multinational, natural history study of patients with acute hepatic porphyria with recurrent attacks [^a4926712]. Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Baseline and On‐Study Biomarker Assessments

The nonattack mean (SD) urine ALA levels (all samples collected excluding those taken during an attack or when affected by hemin treatment) when they were not experiencing attacks (baseline and during study period) were 14.1 (9.5) mmol/mol creatinine in patients with AIP and 3.6 (3.4) mmol/mol creatinine in patients with HCP and VP (although there were only 8 patients with HCP or VP; Supporting Fig. S2 A). These values compare with an upper limit of normal (ULN) of 1.5 mmol/mol creatinine for urinary ALA in healthy non‐AHP individuals as determined by LC‐MS/MS assay (see Study Assessments). 35 The nonattack mean (SD) urine PBG levels were 32.1 (18.6) mmol/mol creatinine in patients with AIP and 1.6 (2.4) mmol/mol creatinine in patients with HCP and VP (Supporting Fig. S2 B). These values compare with healthy non‐AHP individuals in whom the ULN for urinary PBG is 0.14 mmol/mol creatinine as determined by LC‐MS/MS assay (see Study Assessments). 35

During attacks on study (any attack type), the maximum urine ALA and PBG levels increased by an average of 193% and 146%, respectively, compared with the nonattack mean (Fig. 2 A and 2B). For attacks that required treatment at a health care facility or with hemin, mean peak urine ALA and PBG values were slightly higher compared with other attack types (220% and 164%, respectively, for all patients). Following treatment with hemin, mean ALA and PBG levels decreased to near or below levels recorded between attacks.

### Update on the diagnosis and management of the autosomal dominant acute hepatic porphyrias [^cfc61852]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

The autosomal dominant acute hepatic porphyrias (AHPs), acute intermittent porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) and variegate porphyria (VP), are low penetrance adult onset disorders caused by partial deficiency of enzymes of haem biosynthesis. All are associated with acute neurovisceral attacks, which are a consequence of the increased hepatic demand for haem triggered by hormones, stress, drugs or systemic infections which leads to upregulation of the pathway and overproduction of haem precursors 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG). Acute episodes are characterised by severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hyponatraemia, hypertension and tachycardia, behavioural disturbance and can progress to include seizures, peripheral motor neuropathy and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome if undiagnosed and untreated. VP and HCP may also present with photocutaneous skin lesions either alone or during acute symptoms. Diagnosis involves demonstrating increased excretion of PBG in urine. Treatment focuses on removing or managing triggers, supportive treatment and suppressing the hepatic haem pathway by administering human haemin. Chronic complications include hypertension, chronic kidney disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. A small proportion of symptomatic patients with AHP progress to repeated acute attacks which require preventative therapy. A new RNA interference therapy has recently been licensed and is likely to become the treatment of choice in this situation.

### Givosiran sodium (Givlaari) [^da64acd5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1	Mechanism of Action

Givosiran is a double-stranded small interfering RNA that causes degradation of aminolevulinate synthase 1 (ALAS1) mRNA in hepatocytes through RNA interference, reducing the elevated levels of liver ALAS1 mRNA. This leads to reduced circulating levels of neurotoxic intermediates aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG), factors associated with attacks and other disease manifestations of AHP.

12.2	Pharmacodynamics

The pharmacodynamic effects of GIVLAARI were evaluated in chronic high excreters treated with 0.035 to 2.5 mg/kg single dose and AHP patients treated with 2.5 to 5 mg/kg once monthly and 2.5 to 5 mg/kg once quarterly dose via subcutaneous injection. Dose-dependent reduction in urinary ALAS1 mRNA, ALA and PBG levels was observed over the 0.035 to 5 mg/kg dose range (0.14 to 2-fold the approved recommended dosage). Median reductions from baseline in urinary ALA and PBG of 83.7% and 75.1%, respectively, were observed 14 days after the first dose of GIVLAARI 2.5 mg/kg once monthly in AHP patients. Maximal reductions in ALA and PBG levels were achieved around Month 3, with median reductions from baseline of 93.8% for ALA and 94.5% for PBG, and were sustained thereafter with repeated once monthly dosing.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

The effect of GIVLAARI on the QTc interval was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study and the open-label extension in 94 patients. No large mean increase in QTc (i.e. > 20 ms) was detected at the 2.5 mg/kg once monthly dose level. A dedicated thorough QT study has not been conducted with GIVLAARI.

### Nitisinone (Orfadin) [^fe59b824]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

2.1 Dosage

Starting Dosage

The recommended starting dosage of ORFADIN is 0.5 mg/kg administered orally twice daily.

Maintenance Regimen

In patients 5 years of age and older who have undetectable serum and urine succinylacetone concentrations after a minimum of 4 weeks on a stable dosage of nitisinone, the total daily dose of ORFADIN may be given once daily (e.g., 1 to 2 mg/kg once daily) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Dosage Titration

Titrate the dosage in each individual patient based on biochemical and/or clinical response.

Monitor plasma and/or urine succinylacetone concentrations, liver function parameters and alpha-fetoprotein levels.
If succinylacetone is still detectable in blood or urine 4 weeks after the start of nitisinone treatment, increase the nitisinone dosage to 0.75 mg/kg twice daily. A maximum total daily dosage of 2 mg/kg may be needed based on the evaluation of all biochemical parameters.
If the biochemical response is satisfactory (undetectable blood and/or urine succinylacetone), the dosage should be adjusted only according to body weight gain and not according to plasma tyrosine levels.
During initiation of therapy, when switching from twice daily to once daily dosing, or if there is a deterioration in the patient's condition, it may be necessary to follow all available biochemical parameters more closely (i.e. plasma and/or urine succinylacetone, urine 5-aminolevulinate (ALA) and erythrocyte porphobilinogen (PBG)-synthase activity).
Maintain plasma tyrosine levels below 500 micromol/L by dietary restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine intake [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In patients who develop plasma tyrosine levels above 500 micromol/L, assess dietary tyrosine and phenylalanine intake. Do not adjust the ORFADIN dosage in order to lower the plasma tyrosine concentration.

### Phase I open label liver-directed gene therapy clinical trial for acute intermittent porphyria [^6ded008d]. Journal of Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) results from porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) haploinsufficiency, which leads to hepatic over-production of the neurotoxic heme precursors porphobilinogen (PBG) and delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and the occurrence of neurovisceral attacks. Severe AIP is a devastating disease that can only be corrected by liver transplantation. Gene therapy represents a promising curative option. The objective of this study was to investigate the safety of a recombinant adeno-associated vector expressing PBGD (rAAV2/5-PBGD) administered for the first time in humans for the treatment of AIP.

Methods

In this phase I, open label, dose-escalation, multicenter clinical trial, four cohorts of 2 patients each received a single intravenous injection of the vector ranging from 5×10(11) to 1.8×10(13) genome copies/kg. Adverse events and changes in urinary PBG and ALA and in the clinical course of the disease were periodically evaluated prior and after treatment. Viral shedding, immune response against the vector and vector persistence in the liver were investigated.

Results

Treatment was safe in all cases. All patients developed anti-AAV5 neutralizing antibodies but no cellular responses against AAV5 or PBGD were observed. There was a trend towards a reduction of hospitalizations and heme treatments, although ALA and PBG levels remained unchanged. Vector genomes and transgene expression could be detected in the liver one year after therapy.

Conclusions

rAAV2/5-PBGD administration is safe but AIP metabolic correction was not achieved at the doses tested in this trial. Notwithstanding, the treatment had a positive impact in clinical outcomes in most patients.

Lay Summary

Studies in an acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) animal model have shown that gene delivery of PBGD to hepatocytes using an adeno-associated virus vector (rAAV2/5-PBG) prevent mice from suffering porphyria acute attacks. In this phase I, open label, dose-escalation, multicenter clinical trial we show that the administration of rAAV2/5-PBGD to patients with severe AIP is safe but metabolic correction was not achieved at the doses tested; the treatment, however, had a positive but heterogeneous impact on clinical outcomes among treated patients and 2 out of 8 patients have stopped hematin treatment.

Clinical Trial Number

The observational phase was registered at Clinicaltrial.gov as NCT 02076763. The interventional phase study was registered at EudraCT as n° 2011-005590-23 and at Clinicaltrial.gov as NCT02082860.

### Comparison of aminolevulinic acid and hexylester aminolevulinate induced protoporphyrin IX distribution in human bladder cancer [^125ac01a]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Successful photodynamic therapy of epithelial cancer requires a specific photosensitization of malignant tissue. We evaluate the intensity and localization of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in superficial transitional cell carcinoma and nonmalignant cells of the human bladder following topical administration of its precursor, either aminolevulinic acid (ALA) or hexylester aminolevulinate (HAL).

Materials and Methods

Solutions of ALA or HAL were instilled into the bladder of 18 patients presenting with recurrent transitional cell carcinoma. The distribution of PpIX through the bladder wall was studied on frozen biopsies using fluorescence microscopy and correlated with pathological findings.

Results

Topical bladder instillation with 180 mmol (3%) ALA administered for 6 hours or 8 mmol (0.2%) HAL administered for 4 hours gave similar results regarding intensity and tissue distribution of PpIX fluorescence, whereas 8 mmol HAL administered for 2 hours followed by 2 hours of resting time (2+2 hours concept) induced a PpIX fluorescence twice as high. The fluorescence remained limited to cancer cells. Only a trace of PpIX fluorescence was observed in suburothelial connective tissue, that is chorion, but none in the bladder smooth muscle regardless of experiment conditions.

Conclusions

HAL is an excellent precursor for PpIX synthesis in bladder cancer. With the 2+2 hour topical administration condition it yielded the highest PpIX fluorescence intensity and fluorescence contrast between normal and malignant urothelial cells. This approach allows us to optimize PpIX tissue distribution for photodynamic therapy in superficial bladder cancer.

### Nitisinone (Nityr) [^f134cb78]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Dosage

The recommended starting dosage of NITYR is 0.5 mg/kg (actual body weight) administered orally twice daily. Titrate the dose in each individual patient based on biochemical and/or clinical response.

Administer NITYR with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Maintain dietary restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine when administering NITYR.

Maintenance Dosage

The recommended maintenance dosage of NITYR in patients 5 years of age and older who have undetectable serum and urine succinylacetone concentrations after a minimum of 4 weeks on a stable dosage of nitisinone, is 1 to 2 mg/kg once daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

A maximum total daily dosage of 2 mg/kg may be needed based on the evaluation of all biochemical parameters.

Missed Dose

If a dose of NITYR is missed, do not administer two doses at once to make up for a missed dose. Take the next dose at the scheduled time.

2.2 Dosage Titration and Monitoring

Monitor plasma and/or urine succinylacetone concentrations, liver function parameters and alpha-fetoprotein levels.

Monitor all biochemical parameters more closely (i.e. plasma and/or urine succinylacetone, urine 5-aminolevulinate (ALA), and erythrocyte porphobilinogen (PBG)-synthase activity during initiation of therapy, when switching from twice daily to once daily dosing, or if there is a deterioration in the patient's condition.

If succinylacetone is still detectable in blood or urine 4 weeks after the start of nitisinone treatment, increase the NITYR dosage to 0.75 mg/kg twice daily. If the biochemical response is satisfactory (undetectable blood and/or urine succinylacetone), the dosage should be adjusted only according to body weight gain and not according to plasma tyrosine levels.

Maintain plasma tyrosine levels below 500 micromol/L by dietary restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine intake [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In patients who develop plasma tyrosine levels above 500 micromol/L, assess dietary tyrosine and phenylalanine intake. Do not adjust the NITYR dosage in order to lower the plasma tyrosine concentration.

### Excess risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with porphyria: a population-based cohort study [^38fe22d4]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Results

The 200 mothers with porphyria had 398 singleton deliveries between 1967 and 2006 (Table 1). Compared with controls, they were in general younger, had a higher parity, and a higher proportion of deliveries during the earlier parts of the study period.

a Gestational age ≥ 16 weeks, stillborn or died during first seven days of life

b As defined by the Medical Birth Registry of Norway

Women with active acute disease had higher recorded urinary excretion of ALA (p = 0.013) and PBG (p = 0.001) compared with women with latent acute disease (Table 2). There were no statistically significant differences between the highest recorded urinary excretions of total porphyrins among the subgroups with PCT. All women with PCT had a high urinary excretion of uro- and hepta porphyrins compared with coproporhyrins.

Among the 136 deliveries in the group with active acute porphyria, the estimate of excess risk of perinatal death did not reach statistical significance (Table 3). However, when the analyses were restricted to firstborn children only, an almost fivefold increased risk of perinatal death was observed [adjusted OR 4.9 (1.5–16.0)]. Among the 95 deliveries in the familial PCT group, a threefold increased risk of perinatal death was observed (Table 4). All the women experiencing perinatal loss belonged to different families and carried private mutations (three in the hydroxymethylbilane synthase gene, one in the protoporphyrinogen oxidase gene, and four in the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase gene), as is common in the porphyrias.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of acute hepatic porphyrias: expert review [^dcb65139]. Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Best Practice Advice 1: Women aged 15–50 years with unexplained, recurrent severe abdominal pain without a clear etiology after an initial workup should be considered for screening for an AHP.

Approximately 90% of patients with symptomatic AHP are women and attacks are rare before onset of menses or after menopause in these patients. Among symptomatic patients with AHP, > 90% experience only 1 or a few acute attacks in their lifetimes. Attacks are often precipitated by inducing factors that increase heme production in the liver. An estimated 3%–5% of patients with symptomatic AHP experience frequent recurrent attacks, typically defined as 4 or more attacks per year. These attacks are often not associated with identifiable triggers, although some attacks during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycles are believed to be triggered by progesterone. In addition to the acute attack symptoms described, > 50% of patients who experience recurrent attacks report chronic neurologic symptoms, and 35% have received a diagnosis of neuropathy. These patients have a markedly impaired quality of life, and are at higher risk of long-term complications of AHP, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)and chronic renal failure. ALA and PBG levels in patients experiencing recurrent attacks may be elevated at baseline between attacks. It remains unclear whether chronic symptoms are due to persistently elevated ALA or incomplete recovery from neurologic injury sustained during acute attacks.

Some individuals who cany an AHP pathogenic variant have elevated ALA and PBG but have never experienced acute attacks. This group of asymptomatic high excretors may be at increased risk for an induced acute attack, chronic renal or hepatic injuiy, and/or HCC relative to mutation carriers with normal ALA. Diagnosis of AHPs is frequently delayed, with an average of 15 years from onset of symptomatic AHP to diagnosis in the United States and Europe. Accordingly, AHP should be considered in any patient, especially any woman of childbearing age, who presents with unexplained recurrent, severe abdominal pain.

### A case report on variegate porphyria after etonogestrel placement [^4c903269]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

VP is a rare autosomal dominant disorder of the seventh step of heme synthesis caused by a mutation in the PPOX gene. Heme precursors build up in the liver, causing hepatic porphyria. There are 2 manifestations of disease: Acute neurovisceral attacks and cutaneous photosensitivity. Acute symptoms are characterized by behavioral changes, neuropathy, and abdominal pain. Skin symptoms often occur independently of neurovisceral attacks and are caused by a buildup of the PPOX substrate — protoporphyrinogen — in the skin, causing fragility and blistering in sun-exposed areas. It is diagnosed by plasma fluorescence with an emission peak at 626 nm. Patients have elevated fecal protoporphyrins and coproporphyrins, as well as elevated urine delta-aminolevulinic acid, porphobilinogen, and coproporphyrins and uroporphyrins.

It has been shown that stress, infection, fasting, and drugs that induce cytochrome P-450 enzymes trigger VP exacerbations. Additionally, sex steroids — particularly progesterone — are inducers of heme synthesis and can provoke porphyria symptoms in women. Cyclical acute porphyria attacks have been reported during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, when progesterone is particularly elevated. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of cutaneous VP triggered by progesterone-only Nexplanon implantation.

### AAV8-mediated gene therapy prevents induced biochemical attacks of acute intermittent porphyria and improves neuromotor function [^ee5f8bc3]. Molecular Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), an autosomal dominant hepatic porphyria due to half-normal hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMB-synthase) activity, is manifested by life-threatening acute neurological attacks that are precipitated by factors that induce heme biosynthesis. The acute attacks are currently treated with intravenous hemin, but a more continuous therapy is needed, particularly for patients experiencing frequent attacks. Thus, a recombinant AAV8-based serotype vector expressing murine HMB-synthase driven by liver-specific regulatory elements was generated and its effectiveness to prevent the biochemical induction of an acute attack was evaluated in an AIP mouse model. Intraperitoneal administration of the adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector resulted in a rapid and dose-dependent increase of HMB-synthase activity that was restricted to the liver. Stable expression of hepatic HMB-synthase was achieved and wild-type or greater levels were sustained for 36 weeks. When heme synthesis was periodically induced by a series of phenobarbital injections, the treated mice did not accumulate urinary delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) or porphobilinogen (PBG), indicating that the expressed enzyme was functional in vivo and prevented induction of the acute attack. Further, rotarod performance and footprint analyses improved significantly. Thus, liver-directed gene therapy provided successful long-term correction of the hepatic metabolic abnormalities and improved neuromotor function in the murine model of human AIP.

### EXPLORE: a prospective, multinational, natural history study of patients with acute hepatic porphyria with recurrent attacks [^9bb46039]. Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

An association between elevated ALA and PBG levels and disease activity in patients with AIP has been reported in the literature. 31 Similarly, therapeutics that lower elevated ALA and PBG levels transiently (hemin), in a more prolonged manner (givosiran), and permanently (liver transplantation) have been shown to reduce disease activity. 30, 46, 47 In EXPLORE, hemin treatment led ALA, PBG, and ALAS1 mRNA levels to decrease to near or below nonattack levels. ALAS1 mRNA up‐regulation and increased ALAS1 enzyme activity have been demonstrated in animal models of AIP and in liver tissue from patients with refractory AIP. However, longitudinal data on changes in hepatic ALAS1 mRNA or ALAS1 protein levels have not been previously available because of the requirement for repeated invasive liver biopsies. 43 By measuring circulating ALAS1 mRNA from exosomes isolated from urine (methodology used in this study), the study confirmed the central importance of hepatic ALAS1 induction in AHP pathophysiology and provided a noninvasive way to measure dynamic changes in hepatic ALAS1, which potentially could serve as a marker of disease activity and therapeutic response in these patients.

### Pilot study of mitochondrial bioenergetics in subjects with acute porphyrias [^2c850ded]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The acute porphyrias are characterized by defects in heme synthesis, particularly in the liver. In some affected patients, there occurs a critical deficiency in a regulatory heme pool within hepatocytes that leads to up-regulation of 5-aminolevulinic acid [ALA] synthase-1, which is the first and normally rate-controlling enzyme in the pathway. In earlier work, we described defects in mitochondrial functions in cultured skin fibroblasts from patients with acute intermittent porphyria [AIP]. Others described defects in livers of murine models of AIP. Here, we explored mitochondrial energetics in peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs] and platelets in persons with AIP and hereditary coproporphyria [HCP]. Our hypotheses were that there are deficits in bioenergetic capacity in acute porphyrias and that subjects with more severe acute porphyria have more pronounced reductions in mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates [OCR].

Methods

We studied 17 subjects with acute hepatic porphyrias, 14 with classical AIP, one with severe AIP due to homozygous deficiency of hydroxymethylbilane synthase [HMBS], 2 with HCP, and 5 non-porphyric controls. We collected peripheral blood, isolated PBMCs, which we assayed either immediately or after frozen storage [80C] for up to 14 days. Using Seahorse XF-24-3, we measured OCR in the presence of glucose + pyruvate under basal condition, and after additions of oligomycin, carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone [FCCP], and antimycin+rotenone.

Results

Most subjects [13/17, 76%] were female. Subjects with moderate/severe symptoms associated with acute porphyria had significantly lower basal and maximal-OCR than those with no/mild symptoms who were the same as controls. We observed significant inverse correlation between urinary porphobilinogen [PBG] excretion and OCR. The subject with homozygous AIP had a much lower-OCR than his asymptomatic parents.

Summary/Conclusions

Results support the hypothesis that active acute hepatic porphyria is characterized by a deficiency in mitochondrial function that is detectable in PBMCs, suggesting that limitations in electron transport and ATP production exist in such individuals.

Acute hepatic porphyrias — end-stage renal disease management — Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage renal disease secondary to AHP, and ALA and PBG levels can increase significantly between dialysis sessions. Immunosuppressive therapy post transplant is generally well tolerated, and studies of kidney transplant recipients with AIP confirmed a significant improvement in clinical AIP symptoms, which is attributed to increased ALA and PBG clearance after transplantation.

### Photodynamic diagnosis of shed prostate cancer cells in voided urine treated with 5-aminolevulinic acid [^9063a0bc]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of PPIX in urine sediments treated with 5-ALA for detection of PCa in a noninvasive yet highly sensitive manner. The incidence of PPIX–PDD positivity increased with increasing Gleason score though a non-siginificant trend (p = 0.11) was noted. Further studies are warranted to determine the role of PPIX–PPD for PCa detection.

### Low-grade metabolic acidosis as a driver of chronic disease: a 21st century public health crisis [^c6c9b210]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Box 1
Ways to test for low-grade metabolic acidosis

Suboptimal fasting serum bicarbonate: < 27 mEq/L.
Optimal bicarbonate level: 27–32 mEq/L.
Optimal level prior to exercise: 31–38 mEq/L.
Suboptimal blood pH: < 7.42.
Optimal blood pH 7.42–7.45.
Optimal blood pH prior to exercise: 7.45–7.50.

High urinary ammonium (NH4+): Normal range is 15–45 ug/dL. Optimal < 40 mmol/day. Urinary ammonium starts to fall when glomerular filtration rate (GFR) drops below 40 mL/min. Thus, 24-hour urinary ammonium levels are not an appropriate way to look for low-grade metabolic acidosis once the GFR is < 40 mL/min.
High 24-hour urinary calcium (compared with calcium intake) ~16.67% of dietary calcium gets excreted in the urine, so for a dietary calcium intake of 900 mg, 150 mg will typically come out in the urine. If more than 16.67% of dietary calcium is coming out in the urine this suggests calcium loss, which may be due to metabolic acidosis.
Low 24-hour urinary citrate < 320 mg/24 hours. Optimal urinary citrate level: 600–800 mg/24 hours.
Low urinary pH A urinary pH of < 6.0 is formed from a diet that produces a net acid excretion of 70 mEq/day or higher, which for most people will lead to acid retention. Optimal urinary pH (net acid excretion of zero): ~6.8–7.5. Urine pH should not be taken first thing in the morning or less than 4 hours from eating. Spot urinary pH should be taken 4 hours or longer after eating but not first thing in the morning. The best time to take a urinary spot pH would be before dinner (at least 4 hours after eating lunch).

### Clinical features and outcomes of acute intermittent porphyria presenting with acute quadriparesis: a case series and follow-up study [^bdebce2f]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

First line testing for suspected AIP is through measuring PBG, ALA, and total porphyrins (with or without fractionation) from a random urine sample of ~10 mL normalized to creatinine. Timing of analysis should coincide with an acute attack, although persistent elevations of metabolites have been reported months to years following an acute episode of AIP. Urine PBG levels during an attack are in orders of 2–10 times above normal, in association with elevated urine total porphyrins. Hereditary coproporphyria and variegate porphyria will have similar biochemical results and can only be differentiated from AIP through testing of fecal porphyrins or by genetic testing. Accurate differentiation of various porphyrias is essential for appropriate family counseling on avoidance of triggers.

Definitive diagnosis of AIP is through identification of pathogenic variants in the HMBS gene, located on chromosome 11q24.1–q24.2 with over 500 identified mutations. Prevalence in European populations ranges from 1:1600 to 1:2000 with low disease penetrance, reported at less than 1% in the general population but can be as high as 52% in specific Spanish populations. Up to 90% of subjects with HMBS gene mutations are clinically asymptomatic, highlighting the role of other genes and environmental factors (diet or medications) in precipitating episodes of acute intermittent porphyria. Therefore, the diagnosis of AIP requires a combination of clinical and biochemical laboratory findings rather than reliance on the presence of HMBS gene mutations alone.

Three patients in the present study harbored splice site mutations ([c.826‐2A > T] in two patients and [c.706‐2A > T] in one patient). A missense mutation (c.275T > C) and nonsense mutation (c.874C > T) were detected in one patient each. All mutations are classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in ClinVar with the exception of patient three, who carries a deletion that results in a premature stop codon, previously reported in a patient originally from Saudi Arabia and presenting with severe abdominal pain, seizures, psychiatric symptoms, and lower limb weakness. Further studies are needed to understand the genetic susceptibility factors underlying penetrance of AIP in Arab populations.

Despite the consistent report of abdominal pain and presence of electrolyte disturbances in all patients, there were substantial delays in diagnoses, with all but one patient misdiagnosed as GBS. CSF analysis was within normal limits in three patients tested, although cyto‐albuminologic dissociation has been reported in AIP and adds further to the diagnostic overlap with GBS.

14	CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of GIVLAARI in patients with acute hepatic porphyria was evaluated in the ENVISION trial (NCT03338816), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study.

ENVISION enrolled 94 patients with acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) (89 patients with AIP, 2 patients with variegate porphyria [VP], 1 patient with hereditary coproporphyria [HCP], and 2 patients with no identified mutation). Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive once monthly subcutaneous injections of GIVLAARI 2.5 mg/kg or placebo during the 6-month double-blind period. In this study, inclusion criteria specified a minimum of 2 porphyria attacks requiring hospitalization, urgent healthcare visit, or intravenous hemin administration at home in the 6 months prior to study entry. After the 6 month treatment period patients were enrolled in an open label extension period for up to 30 months. Ninety-three patients were enrolled in the open label extension period. Hemin use during the study was permitted for the treatment of acute porphyria attacks.

The median age of patients studied was 37.5 years (range 19 to 65 years), 89% of patients were female, and 78% were white. GIVLAARI and placebo arms were balanced with respect to historical porphyria attack rate, hemin prophylaxis prior to study entry, use of opioid medications, and patient-reported measures of pain symptoms between attacks.

Efficacy in the 6-month double-blind period was measured by the rate of porphyria attacks that required hospitalizations, urgent healthcare visit, or intravenous hemin administration at home.

Efficacy results for GIVLAARI are provided in Table 3. On average, AHP patients on GIVLAARI experienced 70% (95% CI: 60%, 80%) fewer porphyria attacks compared to placebo.

GIVLAARI also resulted in a reduction in hemin use, urinary ALA, and urinary PBG.

Study Assessments

Full details of study assessments are in Supporting Table S1. In brief, at clinic visits (baseline, Month 6, and optional Month 12), patients completed questionnaires detailing AHP symptoms and treatment, QoL (using EuroQoL 5‐dimensions questionnaire 5‐levels [EQ‐5D‐5L], a QoL measure used in multiple diseases and population groups 33), and health status. Physical examinations and laboratory assessments (including urinary porphyrin precursor analysis, liver function tests, hematology, and serum chemistry) were also performed, with all samples being shipped on dry ice (for sample collection at sites) or freezer packs (for home sample collection) to a central laboratory for analysis. Spot urine ALA and PBG were assessed by a validated assay at a central laboratory (Covance Laboratory, Utah) using liquid chromatography‐tandem mass spectrometry (LC‐MS/MS) 34 and results normalized to urine creatinine. The upper reference limit for urinary ALA and PBG was established by assessing urinary ALA and PBG levels in 150 normal healthy subjects. 35 Circulating hepatic ALAS1 mRNA levels (hereafter called ALAS1 mRNA) were measured in exosomes isolated from spot urine samples using the circulating extracellular RNA detection assay (as described 36). ALAS1 mRNA levels are expressed relative to normal healthy levels. 36 For remote assessments, performed at Months 2 and 4 and optional Months 8 and 10, patients completed questionnaires detailing AHP symptoms and treatment and mailed a spot urine sample to assess PBG and ALA levels. Any adverse medical occurrence in a patient that was judged by the investigator as not related to a study procedure was recorded as a change in health status.

Claims of non-inferiority

The published trial protocolspecifies that the study is a superiority rather than non-inferiority trial. The Background states the aim was "to know whether [the experimental ORS] will be superior or not to WHO-ORS" and the Aims (twice) and Study Design sections state that the study is a "superiority trial". The authors report multiple outcomes in the trial as not significantly different (p < .05 was the stated level of significance) between participants who received the experimental ORS vs. the WHO-ORS, including duration of diarrhea, stool output, urine output, body weight, and several biochemical outcomes. Neither the published protocol nor the clinical trials listing refers to non-inferiority margins or the justification, but the trial report introduces the concept of non-inferiority in the Methods section ("non-inferiority was likewise considered using a predefined non-inferiority delta of 20% of the reference product"). This distinction is important as non-inferiority trials require substantially different approaches in design, analysis, and interpretation compared with superiority trials and as has been noted, "Noninferiority cannot be established on the basis of the absence of a significant difference between treatments in a superiority study".

### Pathogenesis and clinical features of the acute hepatic porphyrias (AHPs) [^cfdb8b09]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

The acute hepatic porphyrias include four disorders: acute intermittent porphyria [AIP], hereditary coproporphyria [HCP], variegate porphyria [VP], and the rare porphyria due to severe deficiency of ALA dehydratase [ADP]. In the USA, AIP is the most severe and most often symptomatic. AIP, HCP, and VP are due to autosomal dominant genetic abnormalities, in which missense, nonsense, or other mutations of genes of normal hepatic heme biosynthesis, in concert with other environmental, nutritional, hormonal and genetic factors, may lead to a critical deficiency of heme, the end-product of the pathway, in a small but critical 'regulatory pool' within hepatocytes. This deficiency leads to de-repression of the first and normally rate-controlling enzyme of the heme synthetic pathway, delta- or 5-aminolevulinic acid [ALA] synthase-1, and thus to marked up-regulation of this key enzyme and to marked hepatic overproduction of ALA. In addition, except for ADP, there is marked overproduction as well of porphobilinogen [PBG], the intermediate immediately downstream of ALA in the synthetic chain, and, especially in HCP and VP, also porphyrinogens and porphyrins farther down the pathway. The major clinical features of the acute porphyrias are attacks of severe neuropathic-type pain. Pain is felt first and foremost in the abdomen but may also occur in the back, chest, and extremities. Attacks are more common in women than in men [ratio of about 4:1], often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, constipation, tachycardia, and arterial hypertension. Hyponatremia may also occur. Some patients also describe chronic symptoms of pain, anxiety, insomnia, and others.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — metabolic abnormalities and mitochondrial evaluation: During vomiting episodes, mild mitochondrial dysfunction is suggested by anion gap metabolic acidosis that "is often 15–20 mg/dL", lactic acidosis, urinary ketosis early in the episode, and/or hypoglycemia, and these findings "by themselves do not necessitate a comprehensive metabolic workup". When present, early testing with quantitative urine organic acids and plasma amino acids "can confirm mild mitochondrial dysfunction" by elevated urine ketones, Krebs cycle intermediates, and/or dicarboxylic acids, while "urine organic acids are typically normal" when asymptomatic or after several hours of intravenous dextrose. In some cases, episodes may reflect mitochondrial disease with severe anion gap metabolic acidosis " > 20 mg/dL", insulin resistance, and/or multisystem failure such as cardiomyopathy or seizures.
