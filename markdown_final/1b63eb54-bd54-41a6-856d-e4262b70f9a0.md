## Question

20 year old female presents with shortness of breath, visual disturbance since 2 hours, she has no nausea, no vomiting, no abdominal pain, she eat cheese at evening before 3 hours, her father also comes to emergency department with same symptoms, what are differential diagnosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis for a 20-year-old woman and her father who both developed shortness of breath and visual disturbances within a few hours of eating cheese, without nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the key clinical features and what they imply for timing and mechanism. Then, I should verify which foodborne entities fit a rapid-onset neurotoxic syndrome with respiratory and ocular involvement. Next, I will prioritize the differential, especially botulism, and consider alternatives like alpha-gal anaphylaxis, histamine fish poisoning, and non-foodborne causes. Finally, I will outline immediate diagnostic steps and management, including when to give antitoxin and how to coordinate public health reporting [^507781da] [^6816f4c5].

> Let me first confirm the salient features: simultaneous illness in two people after a shared meal, abrupt onset of dyspnea and visual symptoms within 2–3 hours, and absence of gastrointestinal complaints. This pattern strongly suggests a preformed toxin rather than an invasive infection, and the visual and respiratory findings point toward a neurotoxin affecting cranial nerves and respiratory muscles, which fits foodborne botulism physiology and epidemiology [^6816f4c5] [^507781da].

> Wait, let me verify the timing and mechanism. Preformed toxins act within minutes to hours, often without fever, and can produce neurologic deficits such as blurred or double vision and descending paralysis; botulinum neurotoxin blocks acetylcholine release at neuromuscular junctions, explaining the early cranial nerve and respiratory muscle involvement seen in foodborne botulism, which aligns with this presentation and timeline [^6816f4c5] [^507781da].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the differential. Botulism is the leading concern given the rapid onset, visual disturbance, dyspnea, and shared exposure, with classic early features including diplopia, ptosis, dysarthria, dysphagia, dry mouth, and progressive descending flaccid paralysis; respiratory failure can follow bulbar weakness, and gastrointestinal symptoms may be absent or mild early on, which matches this case [^507781da] [^78e8e900].

> I need to check for other foodborne neurotoxins that could mimic this. Histamine fish poisoning (scombroid) can cause flushing, headache, palpitations, and sometimes visual symptoms, but the incubation is typically within minutes to an hour and is classically associated with fish, not cheese, making it less likely here; still, I should confirm the exact meal contents and timing before excluding it entirely [^6adf52e1].

> Let me consider alpha-gal syndrome. Reactions to mammalian products can occur 2–6 hours after exposure and may include dyspnea and visual changes in the context of anaphylaxis; however, the absence of urticaria, angioedema, or gastrointestinal symptoms makes this less likely, though I should still ask about prior tolerance to dairy and any tick exposures before ruling it out [^8c8e307a].

> But wait, what if this is non-foodborne? Carbon monoxide exposure can cause dyspnea and visual disturbances with a shared exposure, yet the lack of headache, confusion, or cherry-red skin and the specificity of visual deficits to diplopia and ptosis argue against CO here; nonetheless, I should confirm environmental exposures and consider CO if symptoms are atypical or if others in the household are affected beyond the two diners [^6779c039] [^a26b65f9].

> I should double-check for other neurotoxic food poisonings. Ciguatera and tetrodotoxin can cause neurologic symptoms but have different food vectors and timelines; given the cheese exposure and the rapid onset of cranial nerve and respiratory findings, these are less consistent than botulism in this scenario, though I must keep an open mind if new history emerges [^441c4de6].

> Next, I should review immediate diagnostics. I need to check for evolving cranial nerve deficits, assess respiratory effort and vital capacity, and obtain a detailed meal history including the cheese source, packaging, and whether it was homemade or commercially prepared; early botulism can have subtle neurologic signs, so serial exams are critical to detect progression [^507781da]. I should confirm that stool, serum, and any leftover food are sent for testing, recognizing that food isolation is challenging and results may be delayed, so clinical diagnosis guides urgent therapy [^4ce626dc].

> I will now examine management priorities. If botulism is suspected, I should not wait for lab confirmation; I need to contact CDC immediately for equine heptavalent botulinum antitoxin and arrange ICU-level care for potential respiratory failure, because early antitoxin reduces morbidity even though it does not reverse established paralysis; supportive care including intubation and ventilation is essential as respiratory muscles weaken [^507781da] [^69985900]. Hold on, I should verify that local public health is notified concurrently to coordinate source investigation and prevent additional cases [^e2cc1e2f].

> Let me reconsider the cheese as the vehicle. Cheese, especially if improperly processed or contaminated, can harbor Clostridium botulinum spores that germinate in anaerobic conditions; while outbreaks are less common with cheese than with home-canned foods, the epidemiology and timing here remain biologically plausible for foodborne botulism, reinforcing the need for antitoxin and public health action rather than reassurance [^507781da] [^6816f4c5].

> In summary, I should confirm that botulism is the most likely diagnosis given the rapid-onset neurotoxic syndrome with visual and respiratory involvement after a shared meal, proceed with urgent antitoxin and supportive care, and simultaneously investigate alternative explanations such as alpha-gal anaphylaxis, histamine poisoning, and environmental exposures if the clinical course or history contradicts botulism; the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms does not exclude botulism early in its course, so I must not delay definitive therapy [^507781da] [^6816f4c5].

The most likely diagnosis is **botulism** from contaminated cheese, given the rapid onset of dyspnea and visual disturbances in two people after a shared exposure, with a classic incubation of 12–36 hours and early cranial nerve involvement [^507781da] [^78e8e900]. Other considerations include **histamine (scombroid) poisoning** if the cheese contained histamine-rich or spoiled components, and **alpha-gal allergy** if the cheese contained mammalian products and there is a history of tick bites; however, the absence of GI symptoms and the presence of visual changes favor botulism [^6adf52e1] [^8c8e307a]. Immediate actions include notifying public health, securing leftover cheese for testing, and arranging urgent evaluation for antitoxin and supportive care, as respiratory failure can develop rapidly [^507781da] [^e2cc1e2f].

## Differential diagnosis

| **Category** | **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Relevance to presentation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Foodborne toxin-mediated illness | Botulism | - Rapid onset <br/> - Cranial nerve palsies (diplopia, blurred vision, ptosis) <br/> - Dyspnea <br/> - Descending flaccid paralysis <br/> - Minimal GI symptoms | Highly consistent with the presentation; incubation 12–36 hours, shared exposure, and early respiratory/visual involvement are classic [^507781da] [^78e8e900] |
| Foodborne toxin-mediated illness | Histamine (scombroid) poisoning | - Flushing <br/> - Headache <br/> - Palpitations <br/> - Dyspnea <br/> - Abdominal cramps <br/> - Diarrhea | Possible if cheese contained histamine-rich or spoiled components; GI symptoms are common, which are absent here, making it less likely [^6adf52e1] |
| Allergic reaction | Alpha-gal allergy | - Delayed anaphylaxis 2–6 hours after mammalian products <br/> - Dyspnea <br/> - Urticaria <br/> - Angioedema <br/> - GI symptoms | Less likely without GI symptoms or clear mammalian exposure; history of tick bites would support [^8c8e307a] |
| Environmental exposure | Carbon monoxide poisoning | - Headache <br/> - Dyspnea <br/> - Visual disturbances <br/> - Confusion <br/> - Nausea | Less likely without headache or confusion; no mention of exposure source [^6779c039] [^a26b65f9] |
| Infectious etiologies | Viral or bacterial infections (e.g. COVID-19, influenza) | - Fever <br/> - Cough <br/> - Fatigue <br/> - GI symptoms | Less likely given the rapid onset, lack of fever, and specific visual symptoms [^fad9e4f4] |

## Most likely diagnosis: botulism

Botulism is the **most likely diagnosis** because of the rapid onset of dyspnea and visual disturbances after a shared exposure, with minimal GI symptoms and early cranial nerve involvement, which is characteristic of foodborne botulism [^507781da] [^78e8e900]. The incubation period of 12–36 hours fits the timeline, and the absence of fever is typical for toxin-mediated illness [^6816f4c5].

---

## Immediate actions and management

- **Public health notification**: Report to local health authorities immediately due to potential outbreak and public health risk [^e2cc1e2f].
- **Sample collection**: Secure leftover cheese for laboratory testing to confirm the presence of botulinum toxin [^4ce626dc].
- **Medical evaluation**: Arrange urgent evaluation for botulism antitoxin administration and supportive care, including respiratory support if indicated [^507781da].
- **Monitoring**: Monitor both patients closely for progression of neurological symptoms and respiratory compromise [^69985900].

---

## Conclusion

The most likely diagnosis is **botulism** from contaminated cheese, given the rapid onset of dyspnea and visual disturbances in two people after a shared exposure, with minimal GI symptoms and early cranial nerve involvement. Immediate actions include notifying public health, securing leftover cheese for testing, and arranging urgent evaluation for antitoxin and supportive care, as respiratory failure can develop rapidly [^507781da] [^e2cc1e2f].

### Evaluation and treatment of nausea and vomiting in adults [^bf3d1737]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms that can reduce quality of life and indicate life-threatening illness. Acute nausea and vomiting last up to 7 days. In the absence of alarm symptoms, they are typically treated symptomatically and without an extensive evaluation. Typical causes include gastroenteritis or other viral syndromes, foodborne illness, acute migraine headaches, vestibular disturbances, early pregnancy, and adverse effects of medication. Chronic nausea and vomiting last 4 weeks or longer and have a broad differential diagnosis. Causes can be gastrointestinal, infectious, metabolic, neurologic, psychiatric, or related to medications and toxins. A careful history of related factors is essential to guide the initial evaluation and narrow the differential diagnosis. These factors include associated symptoms, timing of onset and duration of symptoms, exacerbating or relieving factors, alarm symptoms, medication and substance use, relationship with recent food ingestion, and comorbidities. Nonpharmacologic management options include fluid and electrolyte replacement; small, frequent meals; and avoidance of trigger foods. Antiemetic drugs effectively reduce symptoms of acute nausea and vomiting, but chronic symptoms are often more challenging to treat. When a specific etiology is not identified, a serotonin antagonist or dopamine antagonist can be used. However, medications may also target the suspected cause of symptoms and the neurotransmitters involved in central and peripheral pathways of nausea and vomiting. Pharmacologic therapy should be used for the shortest time necessary to control symptoms.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^6816f4c5]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Etiologic agents associated with foodborne diseases—preformed toxins versus infections explains that preformed toxins most often result from bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Clostridium botulinum, that release toxins into food during growth in the food; the preformed toxin is ingested and live bacteria do not need to be consumed, illness manifests more rapidly, and the incubation period is often minutes or hours, with signs and symptoms that commonly include vomiting and other symptoms ranging from nausea and diarrhea to interference with sensory and motor functions (e.g., double vision, weakness, respiratory failure, numbness, tingling of the face, disorientation), and fever is rarely present. In contrast, infections result from growth of a microorganism in the body via two mechanisms—organisms invade tissues and directly damage them, or organisms invade and multiply and then release toxins (enterotoxins)—so the incubation periods for infections are relatively long, often days, compared with minutes or hours as with preformed toxins; symptoms of infection usually include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps, fever and an elevated white blood cell count can also occur, and if spread to the bloodstream occurs, organs such as the liver, spleen, gallbladder, bones, and meninges can be affected with longer duration and increased severity.

Key points
- Symptoms of alpha-gal syndrome may be mild or severe.
- They usually appear 2–6 hours after eating meat or dairy products.
- If you are having a severe allergic reaction, seek immediate emergency care. What to look out for AGS reactions can be different from person to person. They can range from mild to severe, and some may be life-threatening. People may not have the same allergic reaction after every exposure to products containing alpha-gal. Symptoms usually appear 2–6 hours after eating meat or dairy products. They also may appear after exposure to products containing alpha-gal. When to seek emergency care Seek immediate emergency careif you are having a severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction involving multiple organ systems. AGS reactions can include:
- Hives or itchy rash
- Nausea or vomiting
- Severe stomach pain
- Heartburn or indigestion
- Diarrhea
- Cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing
- Drop in blood pressure
- Swelling of the lips, throat, tongue, or eye lids
- Dizziness or faintness
- A combination of symptoms referred to as anaphylaxis.

In this series, a clinician extemporaneously discusses the diagnostic approach (regular text) to sequentially presented clinical information (bold). Additional commentary on the diagnostic reasoning process (italics) is integrated throughout the discussion.

Clinical Information: A 43-year-old Mexican woman presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain. Her illness had begun 1 week earlier with fevers to 38.9°F and intermittent frontal headache without photophobia or other neurological symptoms. Two days prior to presentation, she began having left upper quadrant (LUQ) abdominal pain described as sharp, unremitting and radiating to the midepigastrium, right upper quadrant and left flank. The pain did not change with eating, but she did report episodic nausea and vomiting. She denied hematemesis, dysuria or diarrhea. Her last menstrual period had begun 3 weeks earlier, and she denied recent sexual activity. One day prior she had been diagnosed with gallstones at another emergency department and treated with oral metoclopramide and hydrocodone-acetaminophen.

Dr. Patrick Lowe: Our case today is that of a 47-year-old woman who was referred to our emergency department (ED) due to bloody urine, dark tarry stools, red spots on her skin, and bruising throughout her body. Fourteen days prior to presentation, she began exhibiting intermittent fevers, headache, shortness of breath, and a dry cough, and she tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19 pneumonia). Over the 3 days prior to her ED presentation, she experienced a headache that was more intense than the headaches she had been having in the preceding 2 weeks. She reported episodes of both dark urine as well as bright red blood in her urine. In addition, she had multiple dark stools described as tar-like when asked. On the day of her ED presentation, the patient noted a red rash throughout her body. In addition, earlier in the day, she had atraumatic self-limited epistaxis. She denied any falls or head strikes, vision changes, focal weakness or numbness, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, or peripheral swelling.

### Clinical guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of botulism, 2021 [^507781da]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on botulism: 
- Definition: Botulism is a rare, life-threatening disease caused by the neurotoxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum.
- Pathophysiology: Botulism is caused by the anaerobic, Gram-positive bacterium Clostridium botulinum and, rarely, by related species (Clostridium baratii and Clostridium butyricum). The botulinum neurotoxin inhibits acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle paralysis.
- Epidemiology: In 2019, the CDC has reported 219 cases of botulism in the US.
- Risk factors: Risk factors for botulism include ingestion of contaminated food, bacterial colonization of a wound, or the intestines (as in infant botulism and adult intestinal colonization botulism). High-concentration cosmetic or therapeutic injections of toxin can also lead to botulism (iatrogenic botulism).
- Disease course: Botulism progresses over hours to several days following toxin exposure. Neurologic symptoms typically begin within 12-36 hours but can be delayed up to several days depending on toxin dose and route of exposure. Early signs include blurred vision, diplopia, ptosis, dysarthria, dysphagia, and dry mouth, reflecting cranial nerve involvement. These are followed by progressive, symmetric, descending flaccid paralysis involving the respiratory, axial, and limb muscles. In foodborne botulism, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort often precede neurologic deficits by several hours. Vomiting occurs in up to 50% of cases. Infants may present with constipation, hypotonia, weak cry, and poor feeding within 3-30 days of ingesting contaminated food. Proximal muscles are typically affected before distal ones, though exceptions occur. Asymmetric neurologic findings are reported in 6-15% of cases. Respiratory failure typically develops several days after symptom onset and is preceded by bulbar weakness. Rarely, respiratory failure is the initial manifestation. Recovery, often over weeks to months, occurs in reverse order of symptom appearance. Atypical or nonspecific initial presentations, such as gastrointestinal complaints or nonspecific weakness, may delay diagnosis.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The prognosis of botulism is generally good with appropriate medical care, which includes supportive care, intubation, mechanical ventilation when necessary, and administration of botulinum antitoxin.

Somatic symptom and related disorders—overview and pediatric clinical features are outlined, with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition recognizing 7 distinct somatic symptom and related disorders. Presentations are myriad, most often involving neurologic, pain, autonomic, or gastrointestinal tract symptoms, and children and adolescents often have multiple visits in primary care and other settings; vague, poorly described complaints, stress-linked fluctuations, and lack of physical or laboratory findings are common. Common symptoms include pseudoneurologic complaints (amnesia, difficulty with swallowing or voice, vision or hearing impairment, syncope, seizure, paralysis or paresis), pain symptoms (headache, back pain, extremity pain, dysuria), gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, bloating, diarrhea, multiple food intolerances), and cardiopulmonary symptoms (chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, dizziness). Epidemiology notes that in adult primary care populations, between 10% and 15% of patients have a diagnosis of 1 of these disorders; among children and adolescents, recurrent abdominal pain and headaches account for 5% and between 20% and 55% of pediatric office visits, respectively; 10% of adolescents report frequent headaches, chest pain, nausea, and fatigue. Health-care utilization is high: patients use all types of medical services more frequently, are more likely to “doctor shop,” and in 2005 were estimated to have incrementally added $265 billion to the cost of health care in the United States.

The incidence of new onset visual disturbances in emergency departments across the country is frequent. A detailed history of events and thoughtful physical examination may produce a diagnosis; however, atypical cases may require further diagnostic testing to explain symptoms. We present a case of presumed increased intracranial pressure with atypical findings on diagnostic testing, which allowed our team to explore a broader differential diagnosis. This clinical reasoning article will benefit students, residents, and attendings alike to continue to uncover etiologies for symptoms of increased intracranial pressure and review differential diagnoses in similar presentations.

Early primary assessment and abdominal examination can often be enough to triage the patient with abdominal pain into those with less severe underlying pathologic condition from those with more acute findings. A focused history of the patient can then allow the clinician to develop their differential diagnosis. Once the differential diagnoses are determined, diagnostic imaging and laboratory findings can help confirm the diagnosis and allow for expeditious treatment and intervention.

### An allergist's approach to food poisoning [^6adf52e1]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Foodborne illnesses represent a significant global health concern. These preventable diseases lead to substantial mortality and morbidity worldwide. Substantial overlap with food allergy exists with similar clinical presentations and symptom onset. Knowledge of the typically implicated microorganisms and toxins can help properly identify these diseases. A thorough history is essential to differentiate between these 2 disorders. The types of food implicated may be similar including milk, egg, fish, and shellfish. The timing of symptom onset may overlap and lead to misdiagnosis of disorders such as food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome. Classically, histamine-related food poisoning is also typically confused with true food allergy and may be seen as related to fish and cheese. Knowledge of epidemiology, patterns, and etiology of allergic conditions and foodborne illness may help the allergist differentiate among these common diseases.

Case presentation

A 13-year-old previously healthy girl presented to the emergency department (ED) for evaluation of fever, bilateral foot pain, and rash. Her symptoms began 6 months prior to presentation, occurring 1–2 times per month, lasting for 2–3 days, and improving with ibuprofen. A few weeks prior to ED presentation, she noted onset of fatigue, pain in her hip and calf, which she attributed to her competitive soccer playing, and acute abdominal pain with diarrhea and emesis.

Patient denied fever, headaches, visual changes, oral ulcers, muscle pain, or changes in bowel and bladder functions. She had no other medication use or recent travel. Her family history was negative for autoimmune diseases.

Her vital signs upon presentation showed a temperature of 39.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 114/62 mmHg, and 97% oxygen saturation on room air. She had a blanchable, retiform, violaceous patches with few areas of true purpura on her bilateral lower extremities and duskiness of her right second toe (Fig. 1). The remainder of her physical exam was unremarkable: a regular heart rate and rhythm with normal S1, S2 and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops; 2+ symmetric peripheral pulses; and joints with full range of motion without effusion or warmth. Her neurological exam was normal with no focal deficits. Her inflammatory markers were elevated (Table 1) and she was admitted for further evaluation.

### Clinical guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of botulism, 2021 [^78e8e900]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Signs and Symptoms

In reviews and analyses conducted while gathering evidence for these guidelines, the most commonly reported symptoms among patients with botulism were dysphagia; blurred vision; slurred speech, difficulty speaking, and hoarse voice; gastrointestinal symptoms; dry mouth; shortness of breath; and diplopia. The most common signs were descending paralysis, ptosis, and ophthalmoplegia.

Signs and symptoms of botulism evolve over a period of hours to a few days. Initially, subjective symptoms of minor visual changes or (in patients with foodborne botulism) abdominal discomfort might occur, followed by progressive cranial palsies, which might then be followed by descending flaccid bilateral paralysis. In different patients, the maximum extent of neurologic signs might range from only ptosis or mild cranial nerve findings to descending bilateral flaccid paralysis, encompassing cranial nerve–innervated respiratory, extremity, and axial muscles. Early gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea and vomiting) are more common among persons with foodborne botulism than with other types of botulism. For example, vomiting was reported by 172 (50%) patients with foodborne botulism compared with three (5%) with wound botulism. Whether gastrointestinal signs and symptoms are caused by botulinum neurotoxin, other clostridial products, or nonclostridial substances related to food spoilage is unknown. Whether foodborne botulism from intentional contamination of food with purified botulinum toxin would cause gastrointestinal signs and symptoms is unknown. Constipation is often reported as an early symptom among children. Infants and young children might not be able to describe symptoms such as double vision; signs were more commonly reported than symptoms among children. The terminology used to describe the neurologic manifestations of botulism in infants differs from that used for children and adolescents; for example, in one analysis, hypotonia, weak cry, and poor feeding were reported among the three infants with foodborne botulism but not in other children.

Case Report

A 10-year-old previously healthy female patient presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with 4 days of severe abdominal pain, primarily in the umbilical region. Pain was intermittent with a few episodes per hour, each lasting roughly 10 minutes. She had associated nausea and nonbilious, nonbloody emesis when pain was most intense. She was unable to tolerate any oral intake. She presented to her pediatrician on day 3 of illness; blood work was obtained and was reportedly normal. She was prescribed ondansetron by her pediatrician, which did not improve her symptoms.

One month prior to the onset of her acute abdominal pain, she began having watery, nonbloody stools at least 3 to 4 times a day. Diarrheal episodes would result in fecal incontinence. Stools occurred around-the-clock, sometimes waking her from sleep. She denied fevers, chills, myalgias, headaches, rhinorrhea, sore throat, loss of taste or smell, chest pain, joint pains, rashes or petechiae, oral ulcers, significant weight changes, dysuria, hematuria, hematochezia, melena, and vaginal discharge. Remainder of review of systems was negative.

Her past medical and surgical histories were insignificant. Vaccination record was up-to-date. No family history of autoimmune or chronic gastrointestinal (GI) conditions was found.

From a social perspective, she lived on a farm with her parents and brother. She reported a pet turtle. She had also been caring for Holstein calves for 6 weeks prior to admission. She denied consuming unpasteurized milk. Although she had recently gone camping and fishing, she denied drinking water from rivers or streams. Her only recent sick contact was her mother, who had a recent episode of colitis of unclear cause that improved with antibiotics. Regarding COVID-19 risk factors, her family had been following recommended measures such as hand washing, mask wearing, and social distancing. There was no known direct contact with individuals who tested positive for COVID-19.

### A 56-year-old, otherwise healthy woman presenting with light-headedness and progressive shortness of breath [^03d9dc1b]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

A 56-year-old white woman was referred to the pulmonary clinic for evaluation of unexplained shortness of breath. She enjoyed good health until 3 months prior to this visit when she reported experiencing recurrent episodes of shortness of breath and oppressive retrosternal chest discomfort with radiation to the neck. Episodes lasting 5 to 10 min often occurred at rest and were inconsistently related to physical activity. These symptoms became progressively worse and were often associated with light-headedness and presyncope. Her past medical history was uneventful apart from a prior diagnosis of breast cysts and suspected prolactinoma. Her symptoms escalated to such a level that she was forced to seek urgent medical attention at our institutional ED on two separate occasions in the preceding weeks. These visits precipitated a number of investigations and, eventually, a referral to the pulmonary clinic.

Case presentation

A 70 years-old Indonesian man presented at the emergency room (ER) with epigastric discomfort that was felt since one month prior and worsened in the last five days followed by nausea and vomiting. Twelve hours prior to his admission to the ER, the epigastric pain became very intense. The patient described the pain as sharp, constant and non-radiating pain. Four hours later, the pain became dull and spread to the whole abdomen, followed with additional symptoms of fever, lethargy, abdominal fullness, constipation and inability to pass wind. The patient did not have any chest pain, palpitation or shortness of breath and no modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease was found. The patient had a history of surgery due to gastric perforation 2 years ago and was later diagnosed with gastric ulcer due to habitual self-medication with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and frequent consumption of spicy food even after the surgery.

### Food poisoning [^fad5396a]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Food poisoning is encountered throughout the world. Many of the toxins responsible for specific food poisoning syndromes are no longer limited to isolated geographic locations. With increased travel and the ease of transporting food products, it is likely that a patient may present to any emergency department with the clinical effects of food poisoning. Recognizing specific food poisoning syndromes allows emergency health care providers not only to initiate appropriate treatment rapidly but also to notify health departments early and thereby prevent further poisoning cases. This article reviews several potential food-borne poisons and describes each agent's mechanism of toxicity, expected clinical presentation, and currently accepted treatment.

### Severe hypercalcemia as a harbinger of acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^d8ce3998]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Case

An 8-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with a history of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, and weight loss of 18 lb over 3 weeks. The only significant examination finding was moderate dehydration. She was found to have severe hypercalcemia (serum calcium, 20 mg/dL). The complete blood count was normal. She was treated successfully for hypercalcemia with hyperhydration, furosemide, calcitonin, and pamidronate. A few days later, she developed pancytopenia when her bone marrow biopsy specimen established the diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Conclusions

Hypercalcemia presents with nonspecific symptoms of nausea, vomiting, pain in the abdomen, constipation, and tiredness. It can be a harbinger of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Normal complete blood cell count at presentation does not exclude the diagnosis of leukemia.

### Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency presenting as recurrent abdominal pain in childhood [^07e09c13]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Recurrent abdominal pain remains one of the most common symptoms in pediatrics. We present the case of a 3-year-old girl who had recurrent episodes of abdominal pain requiring more than 13 visits to the emergency department. A diagnosis of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency was eventually made. Urea cycle disorders often present beyond the neonatal period with frequent vomiting episodes; however, recurrent abdominal pain as a presenting symptom is unusual. Unnecessary invasive investigations of recurrent abdominal pain in childhood can be avoided by considering inborn errors of metabolism earlier in the differential diagnosis.

### A 44-year-old woman with chest pain and dyspnea [^6b14ea0d]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 44-year-old woman with a medical history of anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome complicated by recurrent pulmonary emboli with subsequent chronic hypoxic respiratory failure (3 L/min oxygen baseline) presented to the ED with 2 to 3 weeks of shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain that radiated to the center of her back. These symptoms were accompanied by an increase in her oxygen requirement from 3 L/min to 6 L/min. She also reported nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, and dizziness for the same period. The patient had two prior pulmonary emboli in the same year, which prompted a hypercoagulable workup, ultimately revealing a diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. The second pulmonary embolus occurred while the patient was on coumadin, though achieving a therapeutic international normalized ratio was challenging. At the recommendation of the Hematology Department, she was transitioned to systemic anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg twice daily, which was her regimen at the time of admission. The patient confirmed total compliance with her anticoagulation therapy, and she denied any recent travel or long periods of being sedentary. She was up to date on her age-appropriate cancer screening, without any evidence of active malignancy.

### Abdominal migraine in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain [^996626d2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Although traditionally regarded as a specific pediatric disease, abdominal migraine may also be observed in adults. Unfortunately, however, this condition is frequently overlooked in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain in the emergency department (ED). A 30-year-old woman presented to our ED complaining of abdominal pain and vomiting, lasting for 12 hours. The pain was periumbilical, continuous, and not associated with fever or diarrhea. The physical examination and the results of conventional blood tests were normal. The patient was treated with intravenous ketoprofen, metoclopramide, and ranitidine, obtaining a prompt relief of symptoms. She had a history of similar episodes in the last 15 years, with several ED visits, blood test examinations, ultrasonography of the abdomen, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopies. Celiac disease, porphyry, sickle cell disease, and inflammatory bowel disease were all excluded. In July 2012, she became pregnant, and she delivered a healthy baby on April 2013. Until November 2014, she has remained asymptomatic. Based on the clinical characteristics of the abdominal pain episodes, the exclusion of any alternative diagnosis, and the relief of symptoms during and after pregnancy, a final diagnosis of abdominal migraine could be established. A skilled emergency physician should always consider abdominal migraine in the differential diagnosis of patients admitted to the ED with abdominal pain, especially when the attacks are recurrent and no alternative diagnosis can be clearly established.

Case presentation

An 82 year old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and end stage renal disease presented with a 4 day history of generalized weakness, malaise and anorexia. Her symptoms were associated with low grade fever, nausea and vomiting. She denied abdominal pain, chest pain, cough, or shortness of breath. She had recently been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile colitis and had been treated with a 2 week course of metronidazole and probiotics containing lactobacilli. Her past surgical history was significant for a cholecystectomy which was complicated by bleeding in the gallbladder fossa and required laparoscopic surgery 4 months prior to this presentation.

On physical examination, she was febrile with a temperature of 100.6 °F (38.1 °C). Cardiopulmonary examination revealed decreased breath sounds in the base of right lung. Abdominal examination demonstrated mildly tender hepatomegaly 3 cm below the costal margin, active bowel sounds, no distension and no guarding or rebound tenderness.

### Proper counseling for diagnosis and management of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome: a case report [^ca9ba340]. Family Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is an increasingly recognized condition linked to chronic cannabis use, yet it remains frequently overlooked in clinical practice. The syndrome is characterized by cyclic episodes of severe nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, often relieved temporarily by hot showers or baths. With the rising prevalence of cannabis use following its legalization, the incidence of CHS has surged, presenting a significant challenge in both diagnosis and management within primary healthcare settings. Understanding the epidemiology, risk factors, and potential long-term sequelae of CHS is crucial for timely identification and intervention. This case report highlights the challenge of diagnosis and management of CHS in primary healthcare.

Objective(S)

To emphasize the importance of proper counseling and the use of Rome IV criteria in diagnosing CHS. To illustrate how this may reduce patient suffering and unnecessary investigation.

Case

A 22-year-old female with chronic, daily cannabis use presented with recurrent episodes of intense nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain over a 2-year period. Extensive diagnostic evaluations were inconclusive. A tentative diagnosis of CHS was made by a medical student and family doctor based on published criteria. The Rome IV criteria were then applied for confirmation of diagnosis and management. In so doing, the patient was advised to cease cannabis use for a minimum of 3 months. Initially, symptom improvement was reported with cannabis cessation. However, symptoms recurred following a relapse in cannabis use.

Conclusion

To confirm the diagnosis of CHS, counseling should specify the need for a minimum of 3 months of cannabis cessation to achieve symptom relief. Increased physician and patient awareness of this minimal time period for drug cessation can help to avoid unnecessary investigations, and prolonged patient suffering. This case emphasizes the need for vigilance in recognizing CHS and consideration of cannabis as a potential cause of cyclic vomiting.

### A rare presentation of acute suppurative thyroiditis [^5c4c0457]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

A previously healthy 17-year-old female patient initially presented with symptoms of anterior neck pain. After multiple emergency department visits, she was found to have unilateral enlargement of her thyroid gland. Laboratory studies were consistent with hyperthyroidism. Symptoms were initially attributed to subacute thyroiditis, and she was discharged with steroids and propranolol. She presented again 1 week later with complaints of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and shortness of breath. She was readmitted and developed sepsis with multiorgan system infection and Lemierre syndrome. Further imaging revealed acute suppurative thyroiditis as the likely source. Direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy revealed ulceration of the anterior esophageal wall, a fistulous tract to the thyroid, and copious purulent drainage. Esophageal biopsies with immunostaining established a diagnosis of herpes simplex virus esophagitis as the likely cause of esophageal perforation, fistula development, and acute suppurative thyroiditis.

This patient was diagnosed with mild COVID-19 illness, sore throat and loss of sense of smell as well as positive COVID-19 PCR, 0n 26 October 2020. Following full recovery by resolution of symptoms and reverting to negative PCR, he received the first dose of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine on November 6. Following the first dose of vaccine, he remained asymptomatic and well. He received the second dose on 6 December 2020. A few hours later the patient started to experience headache and fatigue. The day after, he started to develop fever, sore throat and abdominal pain. The illness progressed over the following 4 days when he presented to the emergency department with high-grade fever, myalgia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, and a faint erythematous non-itchy rash over his torso that he noticed earlier that day. The patient reported a dry irritant cough but no shortness of breath or chest discomfort. He had no urinary symptoms and no pain or swelling of his joints.

The patient had no history of recent travel, no sick contacts, no animal exposure and no consumption of raw dairy products. He was not on any chronic medications and had no known allergies. He reported taking ibuprofen and one dose of an antibiotic over the prior few days for symptomatic relief. He was a non-smoker and did not use recreational drugs.

In the emergency department the patient was noted to have a temperature of 39°C, systolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg and tachycardia, 140 beats per minute. Physical examination revealed dry mucous membranes with congested throat. Bilateral conjunctival injection and left conjunctival haemorrhage. There was a generalised erythematous maculopapular rash, mostly over the chest and back. His peripheral lymph nodes were not enlarged. There were no audible cardiac murmurs, his chest was clear to auscultation, abdomen examination was unremarkable.

### Case report: COVID-19 masquerading as an acute surgical abdomen [^ec09d7fe]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract.

SARS-CoV-2 infection can present with various clinical features, among which gastrointestinal manifestations such as nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and mild abdominal pain have been reported. Recognition of rare presentations of SARS-CoV-2 infection has increased over time. These atypical and rare presentations may lead to difficulties in establishing the diagnosis in a timely manner; furthermore, they may lead to unnecessary investigations, extended hospital stays, adverse outcomes, and more strain on healthcare resources. We present three cases admitted to our hospital with a picture that mimicked an acute abdomen, necessitating surgical assessment and evaluation. All cases turned out to be SARS-CoV-2 positive and did not require surgical management. We discuss the management course, highlight the importance of abdominal symptoms in the setting of COVID-19, and discuss the implications of this association for medical practice amid the current pandemic in both resource-rich and resource-limited settings.

### Acute glaucoma presentations in the elderly [^5e9673bf]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Acute glaucoma classically presents with severe pain, redness, and reduced vision in the affected eye, and severe cases can also have systemic symptoms. We report three cases of acute glaucoma in elderly patients. The diagnosis of acute glaucoma in a patient who presents with sudden onset of a painful, red eye with reduced visual acuity, a hazy cornea, and a fixed, semi-dilated pupil is comparatively straightforward. However, any patient with headache, malaise, or gastrointestinal disturbance, especially with clinical signs of an acute red eye and reduced vision, should alert doctors to the possibility of acute glaucoma. This is especially important in elderly people, who may not volunteer any specific ocular symptoms.

### Visual diagnosis: an 11-month-old with nausea, vomiting, and an abdominal mass [^4ec6977a]. Pediatrics in Review (2013). Low credibility.

Children with intussusception can present with a wide variety of symptoms, including vomiting, fever,lethargy, and abdominal pain. The classic triad of abdominal pain, hematochezia, and palpable abdominal mass is seen in a few patients.• Early diagnosis of intussusception depends on a high level of clinical suspicion in any child with non specific abdominal findings followed by appropriate radiographic or ultrasonographic evaluation and confirmation with a contrast enema.• Abdominal radiography, although an appropriate component of the initial workup for gastrointestinal symptoms, lacks the sensitivity to reliably exclude the presence of intussusception.• Because ultrasonography is a safe, sensitive, and specific test for the diagnosis of intussusceptions, it should be performed early whenever there is clinical suspicion of intussusception.• Contrast enema is the gold standard for diagnosis and first-line treatment of intussusception. There is an increasing trend for pneumatic reduction of intussusception compared with hydrostatic reduction.Intravenous placement, fluid resuscitation, and notification of the pediatric surgeon should be completed before contrast enema.

Food safety

Food poisoning

Some foods more commonly cause food poisoning than others, including raw or undercooked meat and poultry, raw seafood, raw or undercooked eggs, raw (unpasteurized) milk and soft cheeses made from raw milk, raw flour, and uncooked or unwashed fruits and vegetables. A variety of germs can contaminate these foods and cause illness, such as norovirus and bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella. CDC estimates that 48 million people in the US become ill due to foodborne infections every year. These infections can spread directly from person-to-person and through contaminated foods.

Depending on the germ causing the illness, symptoms may appear within 30 minutes to up to 7 days after ingestion. Typical symptoms of food poisoning include nausea, vomiting, cramps or abdominal pain, diarrhea, and may also include fever. In mild cases, symptoms last for 24–72 hours. In more severe cases, vomiting and diarrhea may be prolonged, people may become dehydrated due to a lack of adequate fluid intake, diarrhea may be bloody, and fever may be higher than 39 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit).

Anyone can get food poisoning. Most people who do have mild cases. However, some people are at higher risk of more severe disease. These higher risk individuals are those whose immune systems are not functioning normally. Individuals in this category include children under 5 years old, individuals who are pregnant, adults aged 65 years or older, anyone who may be receiving immunosuppressive treatments, such as cancer or transplant patients, and patients with HIV/AIDS, diabetes, or liver or kidney disease.

### Digoxin [^1836830e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Among the extra-cardiac manifestations, gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, anorexia) are very common (up to 80% incidence) and precede cardiac manifestations in approximately half of the patients in most literature reports. Neurologic manifestations (e.g., dizziness, various CNS disturbances), fatigue, and malaise are very common. Visual manifestations may also occur with aberration in color vision (predominance of yellow green) the most frequent. Neurological and visual symptoms may persist after other signs of toxicity have resolved. In chronic toxicity, non-specific extra-cardiac symptoms, such as malaise and weakness, may predominate.

Children: In pediatric patients, signs and symptoms of toxicity can occur during or shortly after the dose of digoxin. Frequent non-cardiac effects are similar to those observed in adults although nausea and vomiting are not seen frequently in infants and small pediatric patients. Other reported manifestations of overdose are weight loss in older age groups, failure to thrive in infants, abdominal pain caused by mesenteric artery ischemia, drowsiness, and behavioral disturbances including psychotic episodes. Arrhythmias and combinations of arrhythmias that occur in adult patients can also occur in pediatric patients although sinus tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and rapid atrial fibrillation are seen less frequently in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients are more likely to develop A-V conduction disturbances, or sinus bradycardia. Any arrhythmia in a child treated with digoxin should be considered related to digoxin until otherwise ruled out. In pediatric patients aged 1 to 3 years without heart disease, clinical observations suggest that an overdose of digoxin of 6 to 10 mg would result in death of half of the patients. In the same population, a dose above 10 mg resulted in death if no Digoxin Immune Fab were administered.

### Acute nausea and vomiting (...) [^b9ff1b55]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND Chronic nausea and vomiting is defined by symptoms that persist for at least one month. A history and physical examination can help determine the most likely cause. A food and nausea diary may help determine patterns of symptoms and triggers. Diagnostic testing, including imaging and laboratory evaluation, may be indicated based on history and physical examination findings. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy may be necessary depending on the course and the results of diagnostic testing. DIAGNOSTIC STRATEGY Diabetes-associated gastroparesis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastritis, and gastric ulcer are common causes of chronic nausea and vomiting. Initial testing should be guided by findings from the history and physical examination. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is recommended in patients with risk factors or alarm signs. 38 For this patient, the chronic nature of her symptoms and the waxing and waning course suggest that the most likely cause is diabetes-associated gastroparesis. In this patient and in others with suspected gastroparesis, a gastric emptying study should be performed.
3. In patients with recurrent or chronic nausea and vomiting who also have abdominal pain with no definable physiologic cause, physicians should consider major depressive disorders, schizophrenia, somatoform and somatization disorders, hypochondriasis, factitious disorder, pain disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. The Carnett sign can also support or exclude a diagnosis of psychogenic abdominal pain.
39. Gastritis is suggested by the presence of dyspepsia symptoms, including postprandial fullness, early satiety, epigastric pain, or burning. Helicobacter pylori testing should be performed, 41 and, if negative, a gastric emptying study and esophagogastroduodenoscopy can be conducted, particularly if nausea and vomiting persists. Patients with dyspepsia who are not taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and who have negative H. pylori serology are unlikely to have a gastric ulcer. 42.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^f9d7d94f]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Syncope—definition and core features within transient loss of consciousness (T-LOC)—is defined as a T-LOC due to transient global cerebral hypoperfusion characterized by rapid onset, short duration, and spontaneous complete recovery. This definition differs from others by including the cause of unconsciousness, and without that addition the definition becomes wide enough to include disorders such as epileptic seizures and concussion. T-LOC is a term meant to encompass all disorders characterized by self-limited loss of consciousness irrespective of mechanism, and distinguishing both T-LOC and syncope minimizes conceptual and diagnostic confusion. Syncope can include a prodromal period with symptoms such as lightheadedness, nausea, sweating, weakness, and visual disturbances warning that syncope is imminent, although loss of consciousness often occurs without warning. Recovery is usually accompanied by almost immediate restoration of appropriate behaviour and orientation, retrograde amnesia may be more frequent than previously thought particularly in older individuals, and the post-recovery period may be marked by fatigue.

### Clinical issues in the prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of anthrax [^85082905]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of inhalational anthrax versus influenzalike illness is challenging. Respiratory viruses, including influenza, are common causes of influenzalike illness and tend to circulate in winter. These viruses are readily communicable, in contrast to anthrax, which is not spread from person to person. A history of influenza vaccination is not helpful in evaluating the likelihood of anthrax. Influenzalike illnesses have many causes besides influenza viruses, and influenza vaccine is not 100% effective. Unlike patients with inhalational anthrax, adults with influenza or other viral respiratory illnesses do not usually have shortness of breath and vomiting but often have sore throat or rhinorrhea. Rapid identification tests for influenza are available but vary widely in sensitivity.

In the current climate, emergency department and primary-care physicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for inhalational anthrax. Complicating diagnosis is the fact that patients initially may not appear very ill. A careful history with assessment of epidemiologic risk factors for anthrax (e.g. working for the postal service) should be obtained. Communication between clinicians and health authorities is critical for obtaining up-to-date assistance with diagnosis and management.

### Digoxin (Lanoxin) [^3681bc41]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Among the extra-cardiac manifestations, gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, anorexia) are very common (up to 80% incidence) and precede cardiac manifestations in approximately half of the patients in most literature reports. Neurologic manifestations (e.g., dizziness, various CNS disturbances), fatigue, and malaise are very common. Visual manifestations may also occur with aberration in color vision (predominance of yellow green) the most frequent. Neurological and visual symptoms may persist after other signs of toxicity have resolved. In chronic toxicity, nonspecific extra-cardiac symptoms, such as malaise and weakness, may predominate.

Children: In pediatric patients, signs and symptoms of toxicity can occur during or shortly after the dose of digoxin. Frequent non-cardiac effects are similar to those observed in adults although nausea and vomiting are not seen frequently in infants and small pediatric patients. Other reported manifestations of overdose are weight loss in older age groups, failure to thrive in infants, abdominal pain caused by mesenteric artery ischemia, drowsiness, and behavioral disturbances including psychotic episodes. Arrhythmias and combinations of arrhythmias that occur in adult patients can also occur in pediatric patients although sinus tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and rapid atrial fibrillation are seen less frequently in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients are more likely to develop A-V conduction disturbances, or sinus bradycardia. Any arrhythmia in a child treated with digoxin should be considered related to digoxin until otherwise ruled out. In pediatric patients aged 1-3 years without heart disease, clinical observations suggest that an overdose of digoxin of 6-10 mg would result in death of half of the patients. In the same population, a dose above 10 mg resulted in death if no Digoxin Immune Fab were administered.

### Diagnostic challenge of rapidly progressing sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^b5277c15]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Background

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is an invariably fatal but rare infectious spongiform encephalopathy secondary to infectious prion protein. The annual incidence rate is known to be approximately 1–2 per million worldwide.CJD is classified according to its aetiology into four subtypes of sporadic, familial, iatrogenic and variant forms.Sporadic CJD (sCJD) occurs when normal prion protein PrPc spontaneously convert into infectious form PrPSc through an unknown process. It consists of up to 85%–90% of all the CJD cases, and its mean age of onset is known to be at 65 year.Most patients will pass away due to infection or cardiorespiratory failure within 12 months of disease onset, and both genders seem to be equally affected.Familial CJD is autosomal dominant, and this form is secondary to the mutation of the prion protein gene (PRNP, also known as CD230) on the short arm of chromosome 20.It consists of 5%–10% of the total CJD cases and is known to be correlated with a relatively early onset of age (40–50 years). Its disease duration can be up to 24 months, which is relatively longer than those of other subtypes.Variant CJD (<1%), which is reported since the middle of the 90s and associated with ingestion of meat products infected with prion, leads to cerebral prion plaques rather than spongiform alteration in the brain.Iatrogenic CJD (<1%) is an acquired form of CJD secondary to transmission from an established source; previous human pituitary hormone injection, use of contaminated neurosurgical instruments, dural graft transplant or corneal transplant have been attributed.sCJD can present with rapid cognitive and functional decline, memory deficit, myoclonus, pyramidal/extrapyramidal signs and visual deficits.These typical clinical features are well summarised in the WHO and MRI-CJD Consortium diagnostic criteria, which provide an invaluable diagnostic guideline to any physicians unfamiliar with the disease.However, even those clinical signs mentioned on the guidelines are non-specific and can also manifest in other neurological differential diagnoses of rapidly progressive dementia. Given the rare incidence and non-specific clinical features of CJD, it is not uncommon for it to be missed as a potential diagnosis. Furthermore, sCJD can present with atypical clinical features outside the guidelines, thereby posing a significant diagnostic dilemma.Hence, in addition to a detailed clinical history and examination, early use of appropriate investigations involving MRI, EEG, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is crucial in excluding other differentials and at the same time, confirming probable sCJD. Here, we discuss a highly unusual case of a rapidly progressing sCJD characterised by an extremely short duration of disease of <5 weeks. Despite the initial presenting clinical features of rapid cognitive decline, aphasia, ataxia and visual disturbances, which are typical of sCJD, the patient was initially worked up for stroke given the acuteness of his disease onset. Nevertheless, additional investigations with MRI, EEG and CSF study allowed for prompt diagnosis of probable CJD, with postmortem brain autopsy confirming definitive sCJD.

### Undiagnosed maternal diaphragmatic hernia-a management dilemma [^a8497bb5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 30-year-old gravida 2 para 0 presented at 31 + 3 weeks gestation with sudden onset, unprovoked, epigastric and left sided pleuritic chest pain. This was associated with nausea, vomiting and shortness of breath. Her bowels had opened that day and she was passing flatus. She denied any uterine tightenings, urinary symptoms or vaginal loss and reported normal foetal movements.

The patient was an otherwise well South Asian woman with good social supports and no significant medical, surgical or family history. She did however, have a similar presentation at 13 weeks gestation and was diagnosed with left lower lobe pneumonia and a possible empyema on chest x-ray. (Fig. 1) Bronchoscopy and washings at this time were negative and she was managed conservatively with intravenous antibiotics. Her pregnancy then progressed uneventfully.

Fig. 1 
Chest Xray from first presentation at 13 weeks showing left lower lobe opacification. While initially thought to be left lower lobe pneumonia this is likely to represent the diaphragmatic hernia even at this early gestation

On presentation, her observations were unremarkable with oxygen saturations at 100% on room air, a respiratory rate of 20 and a normal cardiotocograph (CTG). She was, however, in significant distress secondary to pain, despite opiate analgesia. Respiratory examination revealed decreased breath sounds on the left hand side and abdominal palpation showed left upper quadrant and epigastric tenderness with normal bowel sounds and no signs of peritonism. Routine biochemical investigations including a full blood count, biochemistry and lactate were unremarkable. A chest x-ray, however, revealed evidence of a raised or ruptured left hemi-diaphragm with bowel visible in the chest. (Fig. 2) A subsequent CT chest confirmed the diagnosis of a large left diaphragmatic defect with stomach, small and large bowel, and spleen in the chest cavity. (Fig. 3) There was no evidence of a gastric volvulus or bowel ischemia. On retrospective review of her previous chest x-ray at 13 weeks gestation, what was originally presumed to be an empyema likely represented a small diaphragmatic hernia. (Fig. 1) On further questioning, the patient reported that she was asymptomatic prior to pregnancy and had no prior chest or abdominal imaging for comparison.

### An unusual cause of postpartum abdominal pain: case report [^486b4c8f]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common presenting complaint in the Emergency Department. It extends to all populations regardless of age, sex, or socioeconomic status. After gathering a history and examining the patient, most Emergency Physicians form a differential diagnosis and initiate an appropriate work-up. However, in the postpartum woman, additional causes must be considered and treated accordingly, knowing that there are consequences for both mother and child. We present a case of a postpartum woman presenting with right-sided abdominal pain, the cause of which, although atypical, has potential for significant morbidity and mortality if it goes undiscovered.

Complaint, cluster, and outbreak investigation procedures—after illnesses are detected through complaints or case clusters through pathogen-specific surveillance, a preliminary investigation should be undertaken to determine whether the reported illnesses may be part of an outbreak. For complaints of group illness attributed to a particular event or establishment, multiple cases with similar symptoms and an incubation period consistent with the timing of the reported exposure are suggestive of an outbreak. For case clusters identified through pathogen-specific surveillance, cases defined by subtype characteristics clearly in excess of the expected number and demographic features or known exposures of cases suggestive of a common source are clues that the cluster might represent an outbreak.

Case presentation

A patient in his mid-40s presented to the emergency department, where he complained of a 48-hour history of nausea and uncontrollable bilious vomiting with no blood. The patient also reported burning abdominal pain but no diarrhoea or fever. There was a history of similar episodes, the most recent being a year ago, when extensive tests were done with no specific positive findings. The patient was admitted, treated symptomatically, and discharged with a diagnosis of non-specific abdominal pain. The patient had an over 10-year history of smoking cannabis and cigarettes and alcohol consumption of 4–5 units a week. The patient had stopped drinking and smoking cigarettes 2 years earlier because of the suspicion that these might be the cause of the symptoms, but continued to smoke cannabis.

Examination revealed an ill-looking patient who also appeared to be anxious. His temperature, heart rate and blood pressure were 36.6°C, 60 beats per minute and 139/82 mmHg, respectively. His respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute. Abdominal examination revealed mild epigastric tenderness and normal bowel sounds with no succussion splash and no masses. Examination of other systems was unremarkable. Several differential diagnoses were considered. Pancreatitis was one possibility because of the history of chronic alcohol use; however, his presentation and the reported character of pain were not typical of pancreatitis. Peptic ulcer disease, because of alcohol intake and smoking, was also considered; however, he had been treated for this condition previously without any improvement in symptoms. Lastly, acute hepatitis was considered unlikely as there was no jaundice and no typical right upper quadrant pain.

Eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EG) is a rare entity, part of eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders, characterized by the symptoms caused from eosinophilic infiltration in the digestive tract. The clinical presentation is influenced by the layer of the gut involved; often the diagnosis is difficult especially in the serosal form. The etiology is unclear, possibly multifactorial.

We present a case of a young female with a background of EG, admitted with severe clinical picture from both the respiratory and the GI tract. The severity of symptoms and the recent steroid use (for EG) broadened the differential diagnosis including acute pulmonary embolism (PE), community-acquired pneumonias, and “eosinophilic pneumonias”.

### What came first: malnutrition or severe disease? [^fcde3675]. publications.aap.org (2023). Medium credibility.

A 20-year-old female with depression presented to the emergency department with chronic weight loss, weakness, fatigue, hair loss, rash, palpitations, and 2 weeks of cough. Initial history revealed that she had disordered eating habits with dietary restriction, experienced a 50-pound unintentional weight loss over 2 years despite reported adherence to nutritional supplementation, and had a normal gastrointestinal workup. On examination, she was markedly cachectic with a BMI of 10. 3kg/m. 2 and hypotensive. Her cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm without a murmur. Her breath sounds were diminished in the upper lobes bilaterally. A skin examination showed diffuse hair loss, skin breakdown, and peeling with a tender, erythematous, papular rash over the bilateral ankles, and nonpitting edema.

Though she began improving with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, levofloxacin, azithromycin, and nutritional rehabilitation, her clinical course was complicated by an acute worsening nearly 1 month into her hospitalization with persistent high fevers, worsening cough, development of a murmur, and worsening consolidation on chest computed tomography. Adolescent Medicine, Infectious Diseases, Gastroenterology, and Allergy and Immunology were consulted to guide the diagnostic evaluation and management of this patient’s complex clinical course. Dr Carey After evaluation in the ED, she was admitted to Pediatric Hospital Medicine and placed in a negative pressure room. PHM delayed beginning antibiotics and consulted the Infectious Disease team. Adolescent Medicine was consulted for the management of her severe malnutrition. An electrocardiogram showed low voltage QRS complexes.

Radiologic evaluation requires anterior or posterior and lateral CXR, which may be followed by computed tomography scan of the chest with contrast as in this patient. Dr Cameron NTM do not typically cause severe disease in immunocompetent individuals, thus it would be unexpected to result in such severe malnutrition. Based on her cough beginning 2 weeks before presentation, her negative workup for other conditions leading to increased risk of severe mycobacterial infection, and her subtle restrictive eating behaviors, I think the patient’s severe malnutrition put her at risk for a severe M. kansasii infection. Our patient had disseminated NTM infection with pulmonary, osseous, and lymph node involvement, which is unexpected in immunocompetent hosts.

### Combining clinical and epidemiologic features for early recognition of SARS [^70e3b814]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical Description of SARS

Clinical Signs and Symptoms

The median incubation period for SARS appears to be approximately 4–6 days; most patients become ill within 2 to 10 days after exposure. Some evidence suggests that the incubation period may be as long as 14 days in some persons.

The most common initial symptom is fever, often accompanied by headache, myalgia, malaise, chills, and rigor (,,–). In some patients, headache, myalgia, and malaise precede the onset of fever by up to 1 day, and fever may have resolved by the time respiratory symptoms appear. Respiratory symptoms typically do not begin until 2–7 days after illness onset, although they are among the initial symptoms in up to 30% of patients (,–). The most common respiratory complaints are lower respiratory tract symptoms, including nonproductive cough and dyspnea; productive cough is reported in up to 25% of patients (,,–). In some series, <10% of patients reported upper respiratory complaints, but in others the reported prevalence of rhinorrhea or sore throat is as high as 25% among patients with SARS. The prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms has varied by report, but nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or a combination of these symptoms has been reported in up to 25% of patients with SARS at the time of initial evaluation (,,–,). In one series, diarrhea developed in 73% of patients at some point in the course of illness. Fever and diarrhea have been the dominant initial symptoms in some patients. Asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV appears to be uncommon.

Elderly patients and those with underlying chronic illnesses such as renal failure may not have typical symptoms of SARS. For patients in this group who have strong epidemiologic risk factors for SARS, the diagnosis should be considered in almost any change in health status, even if the patients do not exhibit typical clinical features.

Physical Findings

Tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypoxemia have been reported in 40% to 75% of patients upon admission to the hospital (,–) but may be less common in patients who are evaluated earlier in the course of illness as outpatients. Upon auscultation of the lungs, rales or rhonchi have been detectable in most patients in some series, and less commonly in others. Some researchers have observed a lack of lung sounds despite marked infiltration on chest radiography. As many as 15%–44% of patients may have a normal measured body temperature when first evaluated.

Determining the etiologic agent in an outbreak—clinical specimens and food testing: Laboratory testing of clinical specimens from patients is critical in determining the etiology of a foodborne disease outbreak; for most foodborne diseases, stool is the specimen of choice, and in an outbreak specimens are collected as soon as possible after onset of symptoms; ideally, specimens from 5-10 persons are collected and tested. Isolation of the etiologic agent from food is challenging, food samples collected during the investigation might not reflect foods eaten at the time of the outbreak, and food testing results should be interpreted with caution. Predominant signs and symptoms and the average incubation period can provide insights into the etiologic agent before laboratory test results are available.

We describe a 17-year-old girl presenting with recurrent episodes of flushing, pruritus, and respiratory symptoms, without consistent allergen exposure or cofactor involvement. Evaluation revealed elevated acute tryptase levels with a normal baseline, negative skin testing, and negative alpha-gal and KIT mutation analysis. The patient improved on daily cetirizine with no further reactions. IA remains a diagnosis of exclusion, requiring careful consideration of IgE-mediated allergies, cofactor-dependent anaphylaxis, clonal mast cell disorders, and systemic mimics such as neuroendocrine tumors or vasovagal syncope. We summarize current evidence on IA pathogenesis, epidemiology, differential diagnosis, and management. While antihistamines and corticosteroids are commonly used prophylactically, emerging data suggest anti-IgE therapy with omalizumab may offer benefit in refractory cases. Diagnostic workup should include serum tryptase measurement, trigger identification, and consideration of underlying mast cell disorders. Future research is needed to clarify the natural history, standardize diagnostic pathways, and evaluate long-term treatment strategies for this heterogeneous condition. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 17-year-old girl presented to the emergency department (ED) with a two-hour history of flushing, pruritus, and wheezing. The symptoms began after eating dinner, which included shepherd's pie and macadamia nuts, foods she had previously tolerated. There were no preceding exposures to medications, alcohol, or insect stings, and she did not engage in exercise prior to symptom onset. She reported three additional similar episodes. These were not consistently associated with eating, and there were no common foods or additives identified between episodes. There was no history of tick bite. There was no correlation between reactions and stage of her menstrual cycle. She did not have a personal or family history of atopy (atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, asthma, IgE-mediated food allergy) or anaphylaxis. There was no history of spontaneous or inducible urticaria. She did not have a history of spontaneous flushing, pruritus, abdominal pain, diarrhea, presyncopal or syncopal episodes. She did not have a history of bony pain or fractures. At the time of the medical assessment in the ED, the patient's examination was notable for facial erythema and diffuse hives. Respiratory symptoms had resolved by the time of assessment. There were no cutaneous lesions suggestive of cutaneous mastocytosis. (Figure 1) The examination was otherwise unremarkable. She was given 2 nd generation antihistamines, and symptoms gradually resolved over several hours. The serum tryptase drawn two hours following symptom initiation was 17.2 mcg/L. A repeat level five days later was 3.2 mcg/L. During a follow up visit three months after ED presentation, skin prick testing (SPT) was negative to a variety of food and inhalant allergens including macadamia nut, wheat and beef. Serum IgE testing to galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal) was negative, and qPCR analysis for the KIT D816V mutation in peripheral blood was negative. The patient was prescribed prophylactic cetirizine (20 mg daily) for three months, during which she experienced no further reactions. Given the clinical presentation, absence of identifiable triggers and the tryptase levels obtained at the ED and five days later, the patient was diagnosed with idiopathic anaphylaxis (IA).

Case presentation

History of present illness and review of systems

A 7-year-old female with a history of seizures and headaches presented to the pediatric emergency room (ER) with acute onset of blurry vision. The morning of presentation, she awoke with blurry vision. She presented to her pediatrician, who referred her to an optometrist, where she was refracted to a visual acuity (VA) of 20/20 with a myopic refraction. Visual acuity had been 20/20 at distance previously. Acute myopia is not an altogether unusual presentation to an optometrist and generally a new myopia patient does not cause alarm. She continued to experience worsening vision accompanied with red eyes, swollen eyelids, excessive tearing and photophobia. She denied pain, burning, itching, mucus discharge, or pain with extraocular movements. She denied systemic symptoms including dizziness, nausea, vomiting, malaise, neck stiffness, fever, or any focal neurological complaints. Her last dose of topiramate was 25 mg, 20 hours prior to presentation.

Past medical, surgical, ocular, medication, social and allergic history

She had had 3 focal seizures from age 3–4, and had been treated with levetiracetam until 3 months prior to presentation, having been seizure free for three years. Her headaches returned, and she had one seizure while in school, which consisted of dysconjugate eye movements and brief unresponsiveness. After consultation with her primary pediatrician and her neurologist, topiramate 25 mg at bedtime was started 2 weeks prior to presentation. Her only other medication was cyproheptadine 5 ml at bedtime, as needed. She had no other medical or surgical history. Social, allergic and family history was noncontributory. She was developing normally.
