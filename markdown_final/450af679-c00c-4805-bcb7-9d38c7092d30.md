## Question

How to manage subclinical hyperthyroidism

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage subclinical hyperthyroidism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the biochemical diagnosis and excluding transient causes. Then, I should verify the etiology using targeted testing. Next, I will stratify risk by TSH severity, age, comorbidities, and symptoms. After that, I will map treatment options to etiology and risk, including when to observe versus treat. Finally, I will outline monitoring, special populations, and a practical algorithm, while double-checking areas where evidence is limited and where guidelines differ.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical diagnosis and ensure persistence before labeling subclinical hyperthyroidism, because transient TSH suppression from nonthyroidal illness, drugs, or thyroiditis can mislead us; I should repeat TSH with free T4 and free T3 in 3 to 6 months to document persistence, and I need to check for exogenous thyroid hormone, amiodarone, glucocorticoids, dopamine, or recent illness that could explain a low TSH without true hyperthyroidism [^117EwFyN] [^115eGybG] [^113C7Ax4].

> Wait, let me verify the etiology next, because management hinges on cause; I should obtain thyroid uptake and scan to distinguish Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, toxic adenoma, and destructive thyroiditis, and I should measure TSH receptor antibodies to support Graves' disease when suspected, while remembering that destructive thyroiditis typically shows low uptake and often resolves spontaneously, so I should not jump to definitive therapy in that scenario [^113vLPEX].

> I need to stratify risk by severity and patient factors; severe subclinical hyperthyroidism with TSH less than 0.1 mIU/L carries higher risks of atrial fibrillation, cardiovascular events, and bone loss, whereas mild suppression between 0.1 and 0.4 mIU/L has smaller but still nontrivial risks, particularly in older adults or those with cardiac or skeletal comorbidity, so age, comorbidities, and symptoms must guide urgency and intensity of therapy [^115XH3rG] [^113dZPzQ] [^117KaLMs].

> Hold on, I should verify the treatment thresholds from guidelines; the ATA recommends treating when TSH is persistently less than 0.1 mIU/L in all patients aged 65 years or older, in patients with cardiac disease or osteoporosis, in postmenopausal women not on estrogen or bisphosphonates, and in those with hyperthyroid symptoms, and it suggests considering treatment in asymptomatic individuals under 65 with TSH less than 0.1 mIU/L, while for TSH 0.1 to 0.4 mIU/L, treatment should be considered in those 65 or older or with cardiac disease or symptoms, with observation reasonable in younger, asymptomatic patients without risk factors [^112mMkjF] [^1111b4h5] [^114Zketr] [^117McmWv].

> Let me think about etiology-specific therapy; for nodular autonomy such as toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma, radioactive iodine is generally preferred, especially in older adults, whereas for Graves' disease, antithyroid drugs are reasonable first-line, with the caveat that some mild Graves' subclinical cases remit spontaneously, so observation can be appropriate in selected younger patients; surgery is reserved for large goiters with compressive symptoms or concern for malignancy, and beta-blockers can palliate adrenergic symptoms while we decide on definitive therapy [^112SS3Re] [^112PqCVC] [^111SjHiZ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought antithyroid drugs were contraindicated in older adults with nodular disease, but I should correct that; the concern is more about limited durability and relapse after withdrawal in autonomous nodules, not an absolute contraindication, so while radioactive iodine is usually favored in older patients with TMNG, methimazole can still be used for short-term control or when RAI is not feasible, with careful monitoring for relapse [^112SS3Re] [^112PqCVC].

> I should double-check the role of beta-blockers; they do not treat the cause but can mitigate palpitations, tremor, and tachycardia and may be particularly helpful in symptomatic patients or those with cardiovascular risk while definitive therapy is planned or as a bridge, and they are reasonable even in milder cases where we are observing rather than immediately treating [^1165m5vZ] [^112PqCVC].

> Next, I should review monitoring and endpoints; if I choose observation, I will recheck TSH, free T4, and free T3 every 6 to 12 months, and if I treat, I will reassess every 3 to 6 months until stable euthyroidism is achieved, aiming for a normal TSH as the biochemical endpoint while also tracking symptoms, bone health, and cardiovascular status, especially in older adults or those with comorbidities [^114Zketr] [^112PqCVC].

> But wait, what about special populations; in pregnancy, I need to distinguish gestational thyrotoxicosis from Graves' disease and avoid antithyroid drugs for hCG-mediated disease, whereas true Graves' hyperthyroidism warrants therapy with careful agent selection and timing adjustments in early gestation, and in pediatrics, observation is often reasonable given higher remission rates and the paucity of pediatric-specific data, with treatment reserved for persistent TSH suppression with symptoms or high risk [^113UnqHF] [^113zA7qX] [^112Hx6Qi].

> I will now examine the evidence gaps so I do not overstate benefits; high-quality randomized trials demonstrating improved hard outcomes with treating subclinical hyperthyroidism are limited, and while observational data link severe suppression to atrial fibrillation, fractures, and mortality, the USPSTF found insufficient evidence to assess benefits of treatment on clinical outcomes, so shared decision-making is essential, particularly in younger, asymptomatic patients with mild TSH suppression [^112Q79n9] [^111kErfz] [^117KaLMs].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm; first confirm persistence on repeat testing and exclude transient causes, then determine etiology with uptake scan and TRAb as indicated, then stratify by TSH severity, age, comorbidities, and symptoms, then treat if TSH is less than 0.1 mIU/L in older adults or those with cardiac or skeletal risk or symptoms, consider treatment in younger patients with TSH less than 0.1 mIU/L on a case-by-case basis, and observe with periodic testing if TSH is 0.1 to 0.4 mIU/L in younger, asymptomatic patients without risk factors, tailoring definitive therapy to etiology and patient preference [^117EwFyN] [^112mMkjF] [^114Zketr].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have addressed bone and cardiovascular risks explicitly; endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with increased fracture risk, particularly in postmenopausal women, and with higher atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular mortality, especially when TSH is less than 0.1 mIU/L, which strengthens the case for treatment in older adults and those with relevant comorbidities even if symptoms are minimal or absent [^113dZPzQ] [^112dTyB1] [^115XH3rG].

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by a **low TSH with normal free T4 and T3** [^115nFvNi]. Management is guided by TSH level, age, and comorbidities: treat when TSH is **< 0.1 mIU/L** [^112MTEEc] or when patients are ≥ 65 years, have cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, or symptoms [^112mMkjF]; consider treatment for TSH 0.1–0.4 mIU/L if high risk or symptomatic [^117McmWv]. Observation is reasonable for **TSH 0.1–0.4 mIU/L** in younger, asymptomatic patients without risk factors [^114Zketr]. Treat based on etiology: antithyroid drugs for Graves' disease [^111SjHiZ], radioactive iodine for toxic nodular disease [^112SS3Re], and surgery for large goiters or suspicion of malignancy [^112PqCVC]. Monitor TSH every 6–12 months if untreated; if treated, monitor every 3–6 months until stable, then annually. Address exogenous causes and avoid overtreatment [^113Ak8pJ].

---

## Definition and diagnosis

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a **low or undetectable TSH** with normal free T4 and T3 [^115nFvNi]. Confirm persistence by repeating TSH, free T4, and T3 in 3–6 months [^117EwFyN] before diagnosing or treating [^115EuM3S].

---

## Etiology

Common causes include:

- **Graves' disease**: Autoimmune stimulation of the thyroid [^113TYi4r].
- **Toxic nodular disease**: Multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma [^113TYi4r].
- **Exogenous thyroid hormone**: Overtreatment or inappropriate use [^116xmsiu].
- **Transient thyroiditis**: Subacute or painless thyroiditis [^1141dvkY].

---

## Clinical significance and risks

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with:

- **Cardiovascular effects**: Increased risk of atrial fibrillation [^115YVijG], heart failure, and cardiovascular mortality, especially in older adults [^115XH3rG].
- **Bone health**: Accelerated bone loss [^113dZPzQ] and increased fracture risk in postmenopausal women [^112DJd5K].
- **Progression**: Risk of progression to overt hyperthyroidism, particularly when TSH is < 0.1 mIU/L [^111kErfz].

---

## Management strategy

Management depends on TSH level, age, comorbidities, and symptoms [^112mMkjF]. The **ATA 2016 guidelines** provide clear recommendations:

| **Tsh level** | **Patient characteristics** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|-|
| < 0.1 mIU/L | - ≥ 65 years <br/> - Cardiovascular disease <br/> - Osteoporosis <br/> - Postmenopausal women not on estrogen/bisphosphonates <br/> - Symptomatic patients | Treat (strong recommendation) [^112mMkjF] |
| < 0.1 mIU/L | Asymptomatic patients < 65 years without risk factors | Consider treatment (weak recommendation) [^1111b4h5] |
| 0.1–0.4 mIU/L | - ≥ 65 years <br/> - Cardiovascular disease <br/> - Osteoporosis <br/> - Symptomatic patients | Consider treatment (weak recommendation) [^117McmWv] |
| 0.1–0.4 mIU/L | Asymptomatic patients < 65 years without risk factors | Observation (weak recommendation) [^114Zketr] |

---

## Treatment options

Treatment should be tailored to the **underlying etiology**:

- **Graves' disease**: Antithyroid drugs (methimazole) are first-line [^notfound]; radioactive iodine or surgery are alternatives [^112USUzp].
- **Toxic nodular disease**: Radioactive iodine is preferred [^notfound]; surgery for large goiters or suspicion of malignancy [^112PqCVC].
- **Exogenous thyroid hormone**: Adjust or discontinue thyroid hormone therapy [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Untreated patients should have **TSH monitored every 6–12 months** [^114Zketr], while treated patients should be monitored every 3–6 months until stable, then annually. The goal is to restore and maintain a **euthyroid state** (normal TSH) [^112PqCVC].

---

## Special considerations

In pregnancy, **distinguish gestational thyrotoxicosis from Graves' disease**; avoid antithyroid drugs unless clearly indicated [^113UnqHF]. In older adults, treat more aggressively given higher cardiovascular and skeletal risks [^112oPhzR]. In children and adolescents, observe unless symptomatic or persistent [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is a biochemical diagnosis with potential cardiovascular and skeletal risks [^117EwFyN]. Management is individualized: treat high-risk patients — especially when TSH is **< 0.1 mIU/L** — and observe low-risk patients with regular monitoring [^112mMkjF].

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^112uyPJK]. Thyroid (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Thyrotoxicosis has multiple etiologies, manifestations, and potential therapies. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions and patient preference. This document describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that would be useful to generalist and subspecialty physicians and others providing care for patients with this condition.

Methods

The American Thyroid Association (ATA) previously cosponsored guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that were published in 2011. Considerable new literature has been published since then, and the ATA felt updated evidence-based guidelines were needed. The association assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this report. They examined relevant literature using a systematic PubMed search supplemented with additional published materials. An evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated the knowledge and experience of the panel was used to update the 2011 text and recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting them were rated according to the approach recommended by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Group.

Results

Clinical topics addressed include the initial evaluation and management of thyrotoxicosis; management of Graves' hyperthyroidism using radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs, or surgery; management of toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma using radioactive iodine or surgery; Graves' disease in children, adolescents, or pregnant patients; subclinical hyperthyroidism; hyperthyroidism in patients with Graves' orbitopathy; and management of other miscellaneous causes of thyrotoxicosis. New paradigms since publication of the 2011 guidelines are presented for the evaluation of the etiology of thyrotoxicosis, the management of Graves' hyperthyroidism with antithyroid drugs, the management of pregnant hyperthyroid patients, and the preparation of patients for thyroid surgery. The sections on less common causes of thyrotoxicosis have been expanded.

Conclusions

One hundred twenty-four evidence-based recommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with thyrotoxicosis and to share what the task force believes is current, rational, and optimal medical practice.

### A stepwise approach to the evaluation and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism [^115eGybG]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review a stepwise approach to the evaluation and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism.

Methods

English-language articles regarding clinical management of subclinical hyperthyroidism published between 2007 and 2012 were reviewed.

Results

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is encountered on a daily basis in clinical practice. When evaluating patients with a suppressed serum thyrotropin value, it is important to exclude other potential etiologies such as overt triiodothyronine toxicosis, drug effect, nonthyroidal illness, and central hypothyroidism. In younger patients with mild thyrotropin suppression, it is acceptable to perform testing again in 3 to 6 months to assess for persistence before performing further diagnostic testing. In older patients or patients with thyrotropin values less than 0.1 mIU/L, diagnostic testing should proceed without delay. Persistence of thyrotropin suppression is more typical of nodular thyroid autonomy, whereas thyroiditis and mild Graves disease frequently resolve spontaneously. The clinical consequences of subclinical hyperthyroidism, such as atrial dysrhythmia, accelerated bone loss, increased fracture rate, and higher rates of cardiovascular mortality, are dependent on age and severity. The decision to treat subclinical hyperthyroidism is directly tied to an assessment of the potential for clinical consequences in untreated disease. Definitive therapy is generally selected for patients with nodular autonomous function, whereas antithyroid drug therapy is more appropriate for mild, persistent Graves disease.

Conclusion

The presented stepwise approach to the care of patients presenting with an isolated suppression of serum thyrotropin focuses on the differential diagnosis, a prediction of the likelihood of persistence, an assessment of potential risks posed to the patient, and, finally, a personalized choice of therapy.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: a review of the clinical literature [^117EwFyN]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SCHyper) is a biochemical diagnosis characterized by a decreased serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and normal serum thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations. Because SCHyper can be resolved, it is recommended to repeat serum TSH, T3, and T4 concentrations in 3 to 6 months before confirming a diagnosis of SCHyper to consider treatment. Proposed grading systems distinguish between mild (TSH, 0.1–0.4 mIU/L) and severe SCHyper (TSH, < 0.1 mIU/L) and are used alongside patients' age and the presence of risk factors and symptoms to guide treatment. Appropriate evaluation includes an investigation of the underlying cause and assessment of an individual's risk factors to determine the necessity and type of treatment that may be recommended. SCHyper may be associated with increased risks of cardiovascular-related adverse outcomes, bone loss, and in some studies, cognitive decline. Treatment may include observation without therapy, initiation of antithyroid medications, or pursuit of radioiodine therapy or thyroid surgery. Considerations for treatment include the SCHyper etiology, anticipated long-term natural history of the condition, potential benefits of correcting the thyroid dysfunction, and risks and benefits of each treatment option. The purpose of this overview is to provide a guide for clinicians in evaluating and managing SCHyper in the routine clinical practice.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^117KaLMs]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases — subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism — are common clinical entities that encompass mild degrees of thyroid dysfunction. The clinical significance of mild thyroid overactivity and underactivity is uncertain, which has led to controversy over the appropriateness of diagnostic testing and possible treatment. In this Seminar, we discuss the definition, epidemiology, differential diagnoses, risks of progression to overt thyroid disease, potential effects on various health outcomes, and management of subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism. Treatment recommendations are based on the degree to which thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations have deviated from normal and underlying comorbidities. Large-scale randomised trials are urgently needed to inform how to best care for individuals with subclinical thyroid disease.

### The management of subclinical hyperthyroidism by thyroid specialists [^1126fhy5]. Thyroid (2003). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is a relatively common condition for which prospectively derived evidenced-based management guidelines do not exist. We have conducted a case-based mail survey to solicit opinions from members of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) about various issues that arise in the management of patients with this disorder. The survey was completed and returned by 185 of 300 (62%) of the original survey recipients. Four hypothetical cases varying in age, thyrotropin (TSH) level and underlying etiology were presented. The majority of respondents recommended further evaluation of all cases, most commonly choosing a radioactive iodine uptake (42%-71%), thyroid scan (39%-68%) and antithyroid (TPO/Tg) antibodies (49%-55%) as the additional tests to be ordered. The large majority (84%) recommended observation rather than active treatment for a young patient with a low but detectable serum TSH level. A small majority also recommended observation alone for a young woman with an undetectable serum TSH level (58%) and for an older woman with a low but detectable serum TSH value (63%). However, the majority (66%) favored treating an older woman with an undetectable serum TSH. When treatment was advised in the patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism, the respondents strongly favored anti-thyroid drugs when the etiology was Graves' disease and radioactive iodine when the etiology was toxic nodular thyroid disease. In the absence of adequate evidence-based guidelines, it is hoped that this survey of expert opinions may provide useful guidance for physicians providing care for patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists medical guidelines for clinical practice for the evaluation and treatment of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism [^116BQ3o2]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency. Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^111trvZ4]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: controversies in management [^113MXEky]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is an increasingly recognized entity that is defined as a normal serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level suppressed below the normal range and usually undetectable. The thyroid-stimulating hormone value is typically measured in a third-generation assay capable of detecting approximately 0.01 microU per mL (0.01 mU per L). Subclinical hyperthyroidism may be a distinct clinical entity, related only in part to Graves' disease or multinodular goiter. Persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism usually do not present with the specific signs or symptoms associated with overt hyperthyroidism. A detailed clinical history should be obtained, a physical examination performed and thyroid function tests conducted as part of an assessment of patients for subclinical hyperthyroidism and to evaluate the possible deleterious effects of excess thyroid hormone on end organs (e.g., heart, bone). A reasonable treatment option for many patients is a therapeutic trial of low-dose antithyroid agents for approximately six to 12 months in an effort to induce a remission. Further research regarding the etiology, natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism is warranted.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^1158KfRZ]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) — treatment thresholds and candidate groups: When TSH is persistently < 0.1 mU/L, treatment of SH should be strongly considered in all individuals ≥ 65 years of age, in postmenopausal women who are not on estrogens or bisphosphonates, in patients with cardiac risk factors, heart disease or osteoporosis, and in individuals with hyperthyroid symptoms; when TSH is persistently below the lower limit of normal but > 0.1 mU/L, treatment of SH should be considered in individuals ≥ 65 years of age and in patients with cardiac disease or symptoms of hyperthyroidism; if SH is to be treated, treatment should be based on etiology and follow the same principles as for overt hyperthyroidism.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^114Zketr]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism with TSH persistently below the lower limit of normal but ≥ 0.1 mU/L — observation is acceptable for asymptomatic patients under age 65 without cardiac disease or osteoporosis, who can be observed without further investigation of the etiology of the subnormal TSH or treatment (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). In this range, treatment should be considered for older subjects, but it is not recommended for subjects < 65 years of age; younger subjects should be monitored at regular 6- to 12-month intervals, and treatment should be considered if the TSH persistently decreases to < 0.1 mU/L. In patients with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, a trial of β-adrenergic blocking agents may be useful to determine whether symptomatic therapy might suffice.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^112PqCVC]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism — management options, monitoring, and goals: The treatment of SH is similar to the treatment of overt hyperthyroidism, with radioactive iodine appropriate for most patients, especially in older patients when TMNG is a frequent cause of SH, while long-term antithyroid drug (ATD) therapy is a reasonable alternative in patients with GD and SH, especially in younger patients. Some patients with SH due to GD may remit spontaneously so observation without therapy is reasonable for younger patients; a small subset of elderly patients with persistently low TSH and no evidence of true thyroid dysfunction can be followed without intervention, particularly when serum FT4 estimate and T3 are in the lower half of normal. Treatment with beta-adrenergic blockade may be sufficient to control cardiovascular-related morbidity, especially atrial fibrillation. Technical remarks state that some patients with SH due to mild GD may be followed without therapy with frequent (every 3 months) monitoring of thyroid function; in select SH due to TMNG with compressive symptoms or concern for malignancy, surgery is also an option; and the goal of therapy for SH is to render the patient euthyroid with a normal TSH. Data cited note stabilization or improvement in bone mineral density in postmenopausal women with SH treated, and reports of improvement in hyperthyroid symptoms with antithyroid drug therapy and after beta-adrenergic blockade.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: scientific review and guidelines for diagnosis and management [^111yYVBa]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Patients with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels outside the reference range and levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (T3) within the reference range are common in clinical practice. The necessity for further evaluation, possible treatment, and the urgency of treatment have not been clearly established.

Objectives

To define subclinical thyroid disease, review its epidemiology, recommend an appropriate evaluation, explore the risks and benefits of treatment and consequences of nontreatment, and determine whether population-based screening is warranted.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Guideline Clearing House, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Controlled Trials Register, and several National Health Services (UK) databases were searched for articles on subclinical thyroid disease published between 1995 and 2002. Articles published before 1995 were recommended by expert consultants.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

A total of 195 English-language or translated papers were reviewed. Editorials, individual case studies, studies enrolling fewer than 10 patients, and nonsystematic reviews were excluded. Information related to authorship, year of publication, number of subjects, study design, and results were extracted and formed the basis for an evidence report, consisting of tables and summaries of each subject area.

Data Synthesis

The strength of the evidence that untreated subclinical thyroid disease is associated with clinical symptoms and adverse clinical outcomes was assessed and recommendations for clinical practice developed. Data relating the progression of subclinical to overt hypothyroidism were rated as good, but data relating treatment to prevention of progression were inadequate to determine a treatment benefit. Data relating a serum TSH level higher than 10 mIU/L to elevations in serum cholesterol were rated as fair but data relating to benefits of treatment were rated as insufficient. All other associations of symptoms and benefit of treatment were rated as insufficient or absent. Data relating a serum TSH concentration lower than 0.1 mIU/L to the presence of atrial fibrillation and progression to overt hyperthyroidism were rated as good, but no data supported treatment to prevent these outcomes. Data relating restoration of the TSH level to within the reference range with improvements in bone mineral density were rated as fair. Data addressing all other associations of subclinical hyperthyroid disease and adverse clinical outcomes or treatment benefits were rated as insufficient or absent. Subclinical hypothyroid disease in pregnancy is a special case and aggressive case finding and treatment in pregnant women can be justified.

Conclusions

Data supporting associations of subclinical thyroid disease with symptoms or adverse clinical outcomes or benefits of treatment are few. The consequences of subclinical thyroid disease (serum TSH 0.1–0.45 mIU/L or 4.5–10.0 mIU/L) are minimal and we recommend against routine treatment of patients with TSH levels in these ranges. There is insufficient evidence to support population-based screening. Aggressive case finding is appropriate in pregnant women, women older than 60 years, and others at high risk for thyroid dysfunction.

Subclinical Hyperthyroidism

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SCH) is defined with TSH levels below normal range with normal FT4 and FT3. Prevalence of SCH globally is 0.7% to 1.4%. SCH can progress to overt hyperthyroidism in 8% of patients by 1 year and 26% of patients by 5 year. In populations with sufficient iodine intake, GD is the cause of 40% of cases of SCH. Baseline serum level of TSH, not cause of disease, is the best predictor of progression of subclinical hyperthyroidism to overt hyperthyroidism.

Treatment of SCH is recommended when serum thyrotropin levels are < 0.1 mU/L, in persons aged > 65 years and postmenopausal women due to association with adverse outcomes including cardiovascular disease, bone loss, fractures, and dementia.MMI remains an effective and safe choice for SCH due to GD. For asymptomatic individuals aged < 65 years and a TSH level between 0.1 mIU/L and the lower limit of normal, observation is generally appropriate.

Thyroid Storm

Thyroid storm is an acute, life-threatening complication of hyperthyroidism that presents with multisystem involvement and is associated with a significant mortality rate of 8% to 25%. Goals of treatment are to control increased adrenergic tone, achieve euthyroidism quickly and safely by reducing thyroid hormone synthesis, block thyroid hormone release, inhibit peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, and reduce enterohepatic recycling of thyroid hormone (Table 4).–

Although all ATDs decrease thyroid hormone synthesis, the current ATA guidelines recommend initiating PTU in patients with thyroid storm as it blocks T4 to T3 conversion. However, recent data suggest no difference in cost, mortality, and adverse events for those treated with PTU versus MMI.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American college of endocrinology position statement on thyroid dysfunction case finding [^113SKFsA]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can be readily diagnosed and can be treated in a safe, cost-effective manner. Professional organizations have given guidance on how and when to employ thyroid-stimulating hormone testing for the detection of thyroid dysfunction. Most recently, the United States Preventive Services Task Force did not endorse screening for thyroid dysfunction based on a lack of proven benefit and potential harm of treating those with thyroid dysfunction, which is mostly subclinical disease. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) is concerned that this may discourage physicians from testing for thyroid dysfunction when clinically appropriate. Given the lack of specificity of thyroid-associated symptoms, the appropriate diagnosis of thyroid disease requires biochemical confirmation. The Thyroid Scientific Committee of the AACE has produced this White Paper to highlight the important difference between screening and case-based testing in the practice of clinical medicine. We recommend that thyroid dysfunction should be frequently considered as a potential etiology for many of the nonspecific complaints that physicians face daily. The application and success of safe and effective interventions are dependent on an accurate diagnosis. We, therefore, advocate for an aggressive case-finding approach, based on identifying those persons most likely to have thyroid disease that will benefit from its treatment.

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations? [^116SUZCg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). However, it is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l), and we suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively. Together, these patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys. There are a number of causes for this picture, which include endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects and concomitant nonthyroidal illness. Treatments commonly employed in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH but have not been shown to improve clinical outcome or symptoms. There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance about whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) with TSH persistently below the lower limit of normal but ≥ 0.1 mU/L — treatment of SH should be considered in individuals ≥ 65 years of age and in patients with cardiac disease or symptoms of hyperthyroidism (2/+00). Persistence in this range is defined as a TSH level between 0.1 and 0.5 mU/L on repeated measurement over a 3–6-month period; the thyroid disorder underlying SH should be diagnosed to avoid treating transient, functional disorders related to acute illness, drugs, and other causes of low TSH. In symptomatic patients, a trial of beta-adrenergic blockers may be useful to determine whether symptomatic therapy might suffice.

### Approach to the patient with a suppressed TSH [^113C7Ax4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SCH) is a laboratory diagnosis defined by a serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration below the reference range (< 0.4 mU/L in most assays), and a free thyroxine (FT4) and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine levels (FT3) in the reference range. Many patients diagnosed with SCH will be clinically euthyroid while others may present with manifestations characteristic of thyroid hormone excess, such as tachycardia, tremor, intolerance to heat, bone density loss, or weight loss. In addition to the laboratory abnormalities, patient factors such as age, symptoms, and underlying heart and bone disease are used to stratify patients for the risk of adverse outcomes and determine the appropriate treatment. Evaluation should include repeat thyroid function tests to document persistent TSH suppression, investigation of the underlying cause, as well as evaluation of the patient's risk of adverse outcomes in the setting of a subnormal TSH. Persistent SCH has been associated with an increased risk of a range of adverse events, including cardiovascular events such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure, bone loss and fracture, and in some studies, cognitive decline. Despite the consistent association of these adverse events with SCH, prospective studies showing improved outcomes with treatment remain limited. Management options include observation without active therapy, radioactive iodine ablation of the thyroid, antithyroid medication, thyroid surgery, or radiofrequency ablation, as appropriate for the patient and clinical setting. The choice of therapy should be guided by the underlying etiology of disease, patient factors, and the risks and benefits of each treatment option.

In the largest individual study, the hazard rate for all major osteoporotic fractures was 1.13 (confidence intervals 1.014–1.26), with risk increasing over time such that after a median follow-up of 7.5 years, 13.5% with low TSH had at least one major osteoporotic fracture versus 6.9% with normal TSH. A participant-level meta-analysis found hazard ratios of 1.36 for hip fractures (4.9 fractures per 1000 person-years) and 1.28 for any fractures (14.4 vs. 11.2 per 1000 person-years), with risks further increased when TSH was < 0.1 mIU/L compared to 0.1–0.44 mIU/L and for endogenous SH.

### Considerations in the diagnosis and management of thyroid dysfunction in older adults [^112oPhzR]. Thyroid (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: Thyroid dysfunction is common in older adults and poses diagnostic and management challenges for clinicians. In this narrative review, we present published data focusing on special considerations in the diagnosis and management of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism in older adults. Methods: A comprehensive literature search of the PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE databases was conducted from January 2000 to December 2024 to identify pertinent articles in English for this narrative review. Results: Due to significant cardiovascular risk if untreated, both overt hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism should be treated in older adults. Findings from observational studies do not support treating older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism with a thyrotropin (TSH) < 7 mIU/L. However, observational data have demonstrated an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality and stroke in older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism with TSH 7.0–9.9 mIU/L and of coronary heart disease, cardiovascular mortality, and heart failure in those with TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L, suggesting levothyroxine treatment in these individuals should be considered. Data from clinical trials failed to show improvement with levothyroxine in hypothyroidism symptoms or fatigue in older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism compared with placebo. Over- and under-replacement with thyroid hormone is common and should be avoided, as population-based studies have shown associations with adverse cardiovascular and skeletal events. Subclinical hyperthyroidism with a TSH < 0.1 mIU/L should be treated in older individuals as it has been associated with increased cardiovascular risk and bone density loss based on observational data. Randomized controlled trials have shown that long-term low-dose methimazole is a viable alternative to radioactive iodine in older adults with hyperthyroidism. Conclusions: A personalized approach should be undertaken in the diagnosis and management of thyroid dysfunction in older adults. Multiple factors should be considered, including physiological age-related changes in thyroid function, comorbidities, and polypharmacy. Care should be taken to maintain euthyroidism in order to avoid adverse events.

Introduction — thyrotoxicosis definitions, treatment scope, and U.S. epidemiology: Thyrotoxicosis refers to a clinical state that results from inappropriately high thyroid hormone action in tissues generally due to inappropriately high tissue thyroid hormone levels, and hyperthyroidism is a form of thyrotoxicosis due to inappropriately high synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormone(s) by the thyroid. β-blockers may be used in almost all forms of thyrotoxicosis, whereas antithyroid drugs (ATDs) are useful only in some. In the United States, the prevalence of hyperthyroidism is approximately 1.2% (0.5% overt and 0.7% subclinical); the most common causes include Graves' disease (GD), toxic multinodular goiter (TMNG), and toxic adenoma (TA).

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: current concepts and scintigraphic imaging [^113vLPEX]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as normal serum free thyroxine and a free triiodothyronine level, with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level suppressed below the normal range and is usually undetectable. Although patients with this diagnosis have no or few signs and symptoms of overt thyrotoxicosis, there is sufficient evidence that it is associated with a relatively higher risk of supraventricular arrhythmias as well as the acceleration or the development of osteoporosis. Consequently, the approach to the patient with subclinical hyperthyroidism is controversial, that is, therapeutic intervention versus watchful waiting. Regardless, it is imperative for the referring physician to identify the causative thyroid disorder. This is optimally accomplished by a functional study, namely scintigraphy. Recognition of the scan findings of the various causes of subclinical hyperthyroidism enables the imaging specialist to help in diagnosing the underlying condition causing thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression thereby facilitating the workup and management of this thyroid disorder.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism — mortality and cardiovascular outcomes show increased risks associated with SH. An individual-level meta-analysis concluded that SH confers a 24% increased risk of overall mortality. Cardiovascular mortality is increased, with hazard ratios of 1.52 and 1.29 from two meta-analyses, and the risk was greater with TSH < 0.1 mU/L compared with 0.1–0.4 mU/L. A large cohort of 26,707 people followed for 12 years also reported increased cardiovascular mortality with SH, and SH subjects appear to be at particular risk for heart failure, especially older subjects and those with lower TSH levels.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^112s547R]. Thyroid (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hypothyroidism has multiple etiologies and manifestations. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions. This paper describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the clinical management of hypothyroidism in ambulatory patients.

Methods

The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) in association with American Thyroid Association (ATA). AACE and the ATA assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this article. The authors examined relevant literature and took an evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated their knowledge and experience to develop a series of specific recommendations and the rationale for these recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach outlined in the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Protocol for Standardized Production of Clinical Guidelines-2010 update.

Results

Topics addressed include the etiology, epidemiology, clinical and laboratory evaluation, management, and consequences of hypothyroidism. Screening, treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and areas for future research are also covered.

Conclusions

Fifty-two evidence-based recommendations and subrecommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with hypothyroidism and to share what the authors believe is current, rational, and optimal medical practice for the diagnosis and care of hypothyroidism. A serum thyrotropin is the single best screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction for the vast majority of outpatient clinical situations. The standard treatment is replacement with L-thyroxine. The decision to treat subclinical hypothyroidism when the serum thyrotropin is less than 10 mIU/L should be tailored to the individual patient.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: when to consider treatment [^112DJd5K]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by a low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level, with normal free thyroxine and total or free triiodothyronine levels. It can be caused by increased endogenous production of thyroid hormone (e.g., in Graves disease, toxic nodular goiter, or transient thyroiditis), by administration of thyroid hormone to treat malignant thyroid disease, or by unintentional excessive replacement therapy. The prevalence of subclinical hyperthyroidism in the general population is about 1% to 2%; however, it may be higher in iodinedeficient areas. The rate of progression to overt hyperthyroidism is higher in persons with thyroid-stimulating hormone levels less than 0.1 mIU per L than in persons with low but detectable thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and heart failure in older adults, increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, and decreased bone mineral density and increased bone fracture risk in postmenopausal women. However, the effectiveness of treatment in preventing these conditions is unclear. A possible association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and quality-of-life parameters and cognition is controversial. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in asymptomatic persons. The American Thyroid Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommend treating patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone levels less than 0.1 mIU per L if they are older than 65 years or have comorbidities such as heart disease or osteoporosis.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111w8THM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease, a term applied to patients with no or minimal thyroid-related symptoms with abnormal laboratory values, is diagnosed more frequently with the use of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening and newer high-sensitivity assays. These are laboratory diagnoses, with subclinical hypothyroidism defined as an elevated TSH with a normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentration, and subclinical hyperthyroidism as a subnormal TSH with normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. Although studies defining which patients require treatment are few, decisions should be individualized based upon laboratory values and symptoms. This article reviews the etiologies, diagnoses, treatments and indications, and monitoring of patients with subclinical thyroid disease.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^117Kumyp]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypothyroidism has multiple etiologies and manifestations. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions. This paper describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the clinical management of hypothyroidism in ambulatory patients.

Methods

The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) in association with American Thyroid Association (ATA). AACE and the ATA assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this article. The authors examined relevant literature and took an evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated their knowledge and experience to develop a series of specific recommendations and the rationale for these recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach outlined in the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Protocol for Standardized Production of Clinical Guidelines-2010 update.

Results

Topics addressed include the etiology, epidemiology, clinical and laboratory evaluation, management, and consequences of hypothyroidism. Screening, treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and areas for future research are also covered.

Conclusions

Fifty-two evidence-based recommendations and subrecommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with hypothyroidism and to share what the authors believe is current, rational, and optimal medical practice for the diagnosis and care of hypothyroidism. A serum thyrotropin is the single best screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction for the vast majority of outpatient clinical situations. The standard treatment is replacement with L-thyroxine. The decision to treat subclinical hypothyroidism when the serum thyrotropin is less than 10 mIU/L should be tailored to the individual patient.

### Association between subclinical thyroid dysfunction and fracture risk [^112dTyB1]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the association between endogenous subclinical thyroid dysfunction and fracture risk?

Findings

In this cohort study of 10 946 adults, 93% had euthyroidism, 2.6% had subclinical hyperthyroidism, and 4.4% had subclinical hypothyroidism. Those with subclinical hyperthyroidism had a 34% higher risk of fracture compared with individuals with euthyroidism.

Meaning

This study suggests that subclinical hyperthyroidism was an independent risk factor associated with fracture, highlighting a potential role for more aggressive screening and monitoring of these patients to prevent bone mineral disease.

Thyrotoxicosis background and etiologies — In general, thyrotoxicosis can occur if (i) the thyroid is inappropriately stimulated by trophic factors; (ii) there is constitutive activation of thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion leading to autonomous release of excess thyroid hormone; (iii) thyroid stores of preformed hormone are passively released in excessive amounts owing to autoimmune, infectious, chemical, or mechanical insult; or (iv) there is exposure to extra-thyroidal sources of thyroid hormone, which may be either endogenous (struma ovarii, metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer) or exogenous (factitious thyrotoxicosis). Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined as a low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with values within the normal reference range for both triiodothyronine (T3) and free thyroxine (T4) estimates and is most often caused by release of excess thyroid hormone by the gland. GD is an autoimmune disorder in which thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAbs) stimulate the TSH receptor, increasing thyroid hormone production. The natural history of nodular thyroid disease includes growth of established nodules, new nodule formation, and development of autonomy over time, and in TAs autonomous hormone production can be caused by somatic activating mutations of genes regulating thyroid hormone synthesis; germline mutations in the gene encoding the TSH receptor can cause sporadic or familial nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) frequency and causes — SH has a prevalence of about 1% in the general population; in older persons TMNG is probably the most common cause, with other etiologies including GD, solitary autonomously functioning nodules, and various forms of thyroiditis. Other causes of a suppressed TSH with normal estimated free T4 and T3 include corticosteroid therapy, central hypothyroidism, and nonthyroidal illness. Once SH has been detected, it is important to document persistence by repeating the serum TSH at 3 or 6 months, and scintigraphic studies suggesting autonomous thyroid function would favor SH.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism in children [^112Hx6Qi]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined as serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) below the lower limit of the reference range in the presence of normal free T4 and free T3 levels. Depending on the degree of TSH suppression, SH could be defined as mild (TSH, 0.1–0.45 mU/L) or severe (TSH < 0.1 mU/L). Patients with SH are often asymptomatic when symptoms are present, they are similar to the symptoms in patients with overt hyperthyroidism, although they are usually milder. The management of the SH is uncertain and should be individualized. We present this review after an extensive literature search and long-standing clinical experience. This review provides the prevalence, causes, clinical presentation, investigation, and therapeutic approach of SH in children.

### Screening for subclinical thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant adults: a summary of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^113M5vsW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is a risk factor for developing symptomatic thyroid disease. Advocates of screening argue that early treatment can prevent serious morbidity in individuals who are found to have laboratory evidence of subclinical thyroid dysfunction.

Purpose

This article focuses on whether it is useful to order a thyroid function test for patients who have no history of thyroid disease and have few or no signs or symptoms of thyroid dysfunction.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search, supplemented by searches of EMBASE and the Cochrane Library, reference lists, and a local database of thyroid-related articles.

Study Selection

Controlled treatment studies that used thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels as an inclusion criterion and reported quality of life, symptoms, or lipid level outcomes were selected. Observational studies of the prevalence, progression, and consequences of subclinical thyroid dysfunction were also reviewed.

Data Extraction

The quality of each trial was assessed by using preset criteria, and information about setting, patients, interventions, and outcomes was abstracted.

Data Synthesis

The prevalence of unsuspected thyroid disease is lowest in men and highest in older women. Evidence regarding the efficacy of treatment in patients found by screening to have subclinical thyroid dysfunction is inconclusive. No trials of treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism have been done. Several small, randomized trials of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism have been done, but the results are inconclusive except in patients who have a history of treatment of Graves disease, a subgroup that is not a target of screening in the general population. Data on the adverse effects of broader use of L-thyroxine are sparse.

Conclusion

It is uncertain whether treatment will improve quality of life in otherwise healthy patients who have abnormal TSH levels and normal free thyroxine levels.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111CgtxG]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is defined as an abnormal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level (reference range: 0.45 to 4.50 microU per mL) and free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels within their reference ranges. The management of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is controversial. The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism is about 4 to 8.5 percent, and may be as high as 20 percent in women older than 60 years. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is found in approximately 2 percent of the population. Most national organizations recommend against routine screening of asymptomatic patients, but screening is recommended for high-risk populations. There is good evidence that subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with progression to overt disease. Patients with a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level greater than 10 microU per mL have a higher incidence of elevated serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations; however, evidence is lacking for other associations. There is insufficient evidence that treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is beneficial. A serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level of less than 0.1 microU per mL is associated with progression to overt hyperthyroidism, atrial fibrillation, reduced bone mineral density, and cardiac dysfunction. There is little evidence that early treatment alters the clinical course.

### Approach to the patient with subclinical hyperthyroidism [^116z1K3j]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, defined by normal circulating levels of free T4 and T3 and low levels of TSH, is a common clinical entity and is typically caused by the same conditions that account for the majority of cases of overt hyperthyroidism: Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and solitary autonomously functioning thyroid nodules. Subclinical hyperthyroidism has been associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and mortality, decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, and mild hyperthyroid symptoms. Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism remains controversial, given the lack of prospective randomized controlled trials showing clinical benefit with restoration of the euthyroid state. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to treat older individuals whose serum TSH levels are less than 0.1 mU/liter and certain high-risk patients, even when the serum TSH is between 0.1 and the lower limit of the normal range.

### Subclinical thyroid disorders: significance and clinical impact [^115tf2US]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases are defined by abnormal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels associated with normal thyroid hormone concentrations. The diagnosis of these conditions depends on defining the 'normal' euthyroid TSH range; in this review, arguments for and against lowering the upper limit of TSH are summarised. Although, subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism are frequently encountered, their long-term consequences are debated due to conflicting results from many observational studies. The causes, effects and outcomes of treatment of both subclinical diseases are described, and the direction of future research in these conditions is outlined.

### Update on subclinical hyperthyroidism [^114Xo7vx]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, with normal free thyroxine and total or free triiodothyronine levels. It can be caused by increased endogenous production of thyroid hormone (as in Graves disease or toxic nodular goiter), administration of thyroid hormone for treatment of malignant thyroid disease, or unintentional excessive thyroid hormone therapy. The rate of progression to overt hyperthyroidism is higher in persons who have suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone levels compared with those who have low but detectable levels. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation in older adults, and with decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women; however, the effectiveness of treatment in preventing these conditions is unknown. There is lesser-quality evidence suggesting an association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and other cardiovascular effects, including increased heart rate and left ventricular mass, and increased bone turnover markers. Possible associations between subclinical hyperthyroidism and quality of life parameters, cognition, and increased mortality rates are controversial. Prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to address the effects of early treatment on potential morbidities to help determine whether screening should be recommended in the asymptomatic general population.

Hyperthyroidism is a diagnosis existing along a spectrum of severity. Patients present with a variety of signs and symptoms: tachycardia, elevated heart rate, anxiety, changes in mental status, gastrointestinal disturbances, and hyperthermia. Management of subclinical hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis without thyroid storm is heavily dependent on outpatient evaluation. Thyroid storm is the most severe form of hyperthyroidism with the highest mortality. Management of thyroid storm follows a stepwise approach, with resuscitation and detection of the precipitating cause being paramount. Special attention should be paid to cardiac function in patients with thyroid storm before treatment, as these patients may develop cardiac collapse.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction before or during pregnancy: Whether to universally screen for thyroid disease either before or during pregnancy remains controversial. Untreated overt hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are associated with adverse obstetrical and fetal outcomes. However, overt thyroid dysfunction is less common than subclinical dysfunction and is frequently identified by clinical assessment at the time of presentation. Thus, the most notable impact of a universal screening mandate for thyroid dysfunction would be the identification of the large proportion of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (mild elevations in serum TSH with normal thyroid hormone levels).

The clinical spectrum of hyperthyroidism varies from asymptomatic, subclinical hyperthyroidism to the life-threatening "thyroid storm". Hyperthyroidism is a common form of thyroid disease that mimics many of the common complaints in the emergency department. The diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is often challenging due to the multitude of physical and even psychiatric complaints. Recognition and treatment by emergency physicians of severe hyperthyroidism is critical and can be life saving.

AACE/ACE/AME thyroid nodule management — medical therapy for FNA-benign nodules: Routine LT4 suppressive therapy for an FNA-benign nodule is not recommended. A clinically significant (> 50%) decrease in nodule volume is reported with LT4 therapy only in a minority of patients, and in iodine-deficient regions this favorable effect appears more convincing with the concomitant administration of iodine supplements. Although long-term thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression may prevent an increase in nodule or thyroid size, nodule regrowth occurs after cessation and long-term therapy seems inevitable, and TSH-suppressive therapy with LT4 is reported as not useful for prevention of goiter recurrence after lobectomy in patients with normal TSH levels by most. Safety signals include a decrease in bone density in postmenopausal females and an increase in major osteoporotic fractures with sustained subclinical hyperthyroidism, a higher risk of atrial fibrillation in elderly patients with suppressed TSH levels, and overall mortality appears increased.

### The evidence for a narrower thyrotropin reference range is compelling [^112t6NpZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Debate and controversy currently surround the recommendations of a recent consensus conference that considered issues related to the management of early, mild, or so-called subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Intimately related to the controversy is the definition of the normal reference range for TSH. It has become clear that previously accepted reference ranges are no longer valid as a result of both the development of more highly sensitive TSH assays and the appreciation that reference populations previously considered normal were contaminated with individuals with various degrees of thyroid dysfunction that served to increase mean TSH levels for the group. Recent laboratory guidelines from the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry indicate that more than 95% of normal individuals have TSH levels below 2.5 mU/liter. The remainder with higher values are outliers, most of whom are likely to have underlying Hashimoto thyroiditis or other causes of elevated TSH. Importantly, data indicating that African-Americans with very low incidence of Hashimoto thyroiditis have a mean TSH level of 1.18 mU/liter strongly suggest that this value is the true normal mean for a normal population. Recognition and establishment of a more precise and true normal range for TSH have important implications for both screening and treatment of thyroid disease in general and subclinical thyroid disease in particular.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^1141dvkY]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis — definitions, causes, and selected epidemiology — are detailed as follows: Overt hyperthyroidism is defined as a subnormal (usually undetectable) serum thyrotropin (TSH) with elevated free thyroxine (T4) and/or free triiodothyronine (T3), and subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a low or undetectable TSH with T3 and free T4 within normal ranges. Thyrotoxicosis can result from four pathways: excessive trophic stimulation, constitutive activation of synthesis/secretion with autonomous release, passive release of preformed hormone from thyroid injury, or exposure to extrathyroidal sources. Endogenous hyperthyroidism is most commonly due to Graves' disease (GD) or nodular thyroid disease, and GD is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States; toxic nodular goiter may actually be more common than GD in older patients in regions of iodine deficiency, and remission of mild GD has been reported in up to 30% of patients without treatment. Less common causes include painless and subacute thyroiditis; population frequencies for painless thyroiditis vary, accounting for 0.5% of thyrotoxic patients in Denmark, 6% in Toronto, and 22% in Wisconsin. Painless thyroiditis may occur during lithium, cytokine (e.g., interferon-α), or tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy and is termed postpartum thyroiditis in the postpartum period; a painless destructive thyroiditis occurs in 5%–10% of amiodarone-treated patients, and subacute thyroiditis is thought to be caused by viral infection and is characterized by fever and thyroid pain.

Another study found increased stroke risk in subjects over age 50 years with a hazard ratio of 3.39.

### Benefits of thyrotropin suppression versus the risks of adverse effects in differentiated thyroid cancer [^116XReNf]. Thyroid (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Despite clinical practice guidelines for the management of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), there are no recommendations on the optimal serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration to reduce tumor recurrences and improve survival, while ensuring an optimal quality of life with minimal adverse effects. The aim of this review was to provide a risk-adapted management scheme for levothyroxine (L-T4) therapy in patients with DTC. The objective was to establish which patients require complete suppression of serum TSH levels, given their risk of recurrent or metastatic DTC, and how potential adverse effects on the heart and skeleton, induced by subclinical hyperthyroidism, in concert with advanced age and comorbidities, may influence the degree of TSH suppression.

Summary

A risk-stratified approach to predict the rate of recurrence and death from thyroid cancer was based on the recently revised American Thyroid Association guidelines. A stratified approach to predict the risk from the adverse effects of L-T4 was devised, taking into account the age of the patient, as well as the presence of preexisting cardiovascular and skeletal risk factors that might predispose to the development of long-term adverse cardiovascular or skeletal outcomes, particularly increased heart rate and left ventricular mass, atrial fibrillation, and osteoporosis. Nine potential patient categories can be defined, with differing TSH targets for both initial and long-term L-T4 therapy.

Conclusion

Before deciding on the degree of TSH suppression during initial and long-term L-T4 treatment in patients with DTC, it is necessary to consider the aggressiveness of DTC, as well as the potential for adverse effects induced by iatrogenic subclinical hyperthyroidism. More aggressive TSH suppression is indicated in patients with high-risk disease or recurrent tumor, whereas less aggressive TSH suppression is reasonable in low-risk patients. In patients with high-risk DTC and an equally high risk of adverse effects, long-term treatment with L-T4 therapy should be individualized and balanced against the potential for adverse effects. In patients with an intermediate risk for thyroid cancer recurrence and a high risk of adverse effects of therapy, the degree of TSH suppression should be reevaluated during the follow-up period. Normalization of serum TSH is advisable for long-term treatment of disease-free elderly patients with DTC and significant comorbidities.

### Management of thyrotoxicosis: preconception, pregnancy, and the postpartum period [^113UnqHF]. Endocrine Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the diagnosis and management of thyrotoxicosis in women who are preconception, pregnant, and in the postpartum period.

Methods

Literature review of English-language papers published between 1980 and 2018.

Results

Overt thyrotoxicosis occurs in 0.2% of pregnancies and subclinical thyrotoxicosis in 2.5%. Hyperthyroidism in women of childbearing age most frequently is caused by Graves disease (GD). Gestational thyrotoxicosis, transient human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-mediated hyperthyroidism, may develop in the first trimester. In the first year following delivery, postpartum thyroiditis, which frequently includes a thyrotoxic phase, occurs in 5% of women. Hyperthyroidism from nodular autonomy is uncommon in women of childbearing age. It is essential to understand the underlying etiology for thyrotoxicosis in order to recommend appropriate treatment. Gestational thyrotoxicosis requires supportive care, without antithyroid drug therapy. GD may be treated with antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, or thyroidectomy. Pregnancy, plans for pregnancy, and lactation have important implications for the choice of GD treatment. When thyrotoxicosis presents following delivery, postpartum thyroiditis must be differentiated from GD.

Conclusion

The diagnosis and management of thyrotoxicosis in the peripregnancy period present specific challenges. In making management decisions, it is essential to weigh the risks and benefits of treatments not just for the mother but also for the fetus and for breastfed infants. A team approach to management is critical, with close collaboration among endocrinologists, maternal-fetal medicine specialists, and neonatologists.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112MTEEc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening for thyroid dysfunction — population is nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults; recommendation is "No recommendation. Grade: I statement (insufficient evidence)". Risk factors for an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level include female sex, advancing age, white race, type 1 diabetes, Down syndrome, family history of thyroid disease, goiter, previous hyperthyroidism, and external-beam radiation in the head and neck area; risk factors for a low TSH level include female sex; advancing age; black race; low iodine intake; personal or family history of thyroid disease; and ingestion of iodine-containing drugs, such as amiodarone. The primary screening test is serum TSH testing, and multiple tests over 3 to 6 months should be performed to confirm or rule out abnormal findings; follow-up testing of serum thyroxine (T4) levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 level) and overt (abnormal T4 level) thyroid dysfunction. Hypothyroidism is treated with oral T4 monotherapy (levothyroxine sodium); consensus is lacking on the appropriate point for clinical intervention, especially for TSH levels < 10.0 mIU/L. Hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid medications (e.g., methimazole) or nonreversible thyroid ablation therapy (e.g., radioactive iodine or surgery), and treatment is generally recommended for patients with a TSH level that is undetectable or < 0.1 mIU/L, particularly those with overt Graves disease or nodular thyroid disease. The current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults.

### A clinical and therapeutic approach to thyrotoxicosis with thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression only [^116xmsiu]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as normal serum free thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations and persistently suppressed thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations. The most common cause of subclinical hyperthyroidism is the use of suppressive doses of L-thyroxine for treatment of hypothyroidism or, less commonly, diffuse nontoxic goiter or thyroid carcinoma (exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism). Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism may be caused by a variety of thyroid disorders that result in overproduction and release of thyroid hormones from the gland with normal/high 24-hour thyroid radioiodine uptake or by inflammation in the thyroid resulting in release of excess thyroid hormones and low 24-hour thyroid radioiodine uptake. Several groups have investigated whether persistent endogenous or exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, like overt hyperthyroidism, causes symptoms, adverse effects on the cardiovascular and the skeletal systems, and increased mortality, whether endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism evolves to overt thyrotoxicosis, and whether or not it should be treated. The present report reviews the most important and recent studies of subclinical hyperthyroidism and attempts to draw conclusions based upon the literature and the authors' experience.

### Subclinical thyroid dysfunction and cardiovascular consequences: an alarming wake-up call? [^1123325Y]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction (STD), presenting as subclinical hypothyroidism (SHypo) or subclinical hyperthyroidism (SHyper), defined as abnormal serum thyrotropin (TSH) and normal free thyroid hormones, is associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) risk and mortality. Depending on the degree of such dysfunction, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias, predominantly atrial fibrillation, characterize both disorders and increase CV and total mortality compared to euthyroid persons. There are some differences in the mechanisms involved in the increased CV risk incurred by each type of STD, with more traditional CV risk factors clustered in SHypo than in SHyper, while the role of the TSH or its absence thereof, together with the respective, even subtle, changes incurred in thyroid hormone concentrations, seem to adversely influence the CV system in both types of STD. There is evidence that treatment of STD confers potential benefits by reducing CV events, however, no consensus has been reached due to lack of randomized controlled studies. Nevertheless, due to accumulating evidence from observational studies, many authorities agree that individuals with severe SHypo (TSH > 10 mIU/L) or grade 2 SHyper (TSH < 0.1 mIU/L) should receive treatment, mostly for the increased risk of CV morbidity and mortality. The evidence reviewed herein should alert and help the clinician to wake up to these two potentially alarming conditions of STD as they may confer serious CV complications, while their treatment appears quite beneficial.

### Assessment and treatment of thyroid disorders in pregnancy and the postpartum period [^111Wytoy]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Thyroid disorders are prevalent in pregnant women. Furthermore, thyroid hormone has a critical role in fetal development and thyroid dysfunction can adversely affect obstetric outcomes. Thus, the appropriate management of hyperthyroidism, most commonly caused by Graves disease, and hypothyroidism, which in iodine sufficient regions is most commonly caused by Hashimoto thyroiditis, in pregnancy is important for the health of both pregnant women and their offspring. Gestational transient thyrotoxicosis can also occur during pregnancy and should be differentiated from Graves disease. Effects of thyroid autoimmunity and subclinical hypothyroidism in pregnancy remain controversial. Iodine deficiency is the leading cause of hypothyroidism worldwide. Despite global efforts to eradicate iodine deficiency disorders, pregnant women remain at risk of iodine deficiency due to increased iodine requirements during gestation. The incidence of thyroid cancer is increasing worldwide, including in young adults. As such, the diagnosis of thyroid nodules or thyroid cancer during pregnancy is becoming more frequent. The evaluation and management of thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer in pregnancy pose a particular challenge. Postpartum thyroiditis can occur up to 1 year after delivery and must be differentiated from other forms of thyroid dysfunction, as treatment differs. This Review provides current evidence and recommendations for the evaluation and management of thyroid disorders in pregnancy and in the postpartum period.
