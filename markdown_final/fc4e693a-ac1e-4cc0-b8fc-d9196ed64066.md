## Question

generalized itching that occurs durring menstrual cycles

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about generalized pruritus that occurs cyclically with the menstrual cycle and how to evaluate and manage it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the cyclical pattern and excluding primary skin disease. Then, I should verify the key hormonal etiologies, especially autoimmune progesterone dermatitis and estrogen dermatitis, and weigh their likelihood. Next, I will review other important differentials, including atopic dermatitis flares, iron deficiency anemia, drug-induced itch, and systemic or neuropathic causes. After that, I need to outline a staged diagnostic workup, including when and how to perform hormone testing and what labs to order. Finally, I will construct a treatment algorithm, from first-line anovulatory strategies to escalation options, and close with counseling and follow-up considerations, ensuring each step is supported by guidelines and case-based evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and timing, because I need to ensure we are truly dealing with generalized pruritus without a primary rash and that the symptoms track with the luteal phase and resolve with menses; this pattern strongly suggests a hormonally mediated process rather than a static dermatosis, and I should explicitly document the premenstrual onset and postmenstrual resolution to anchor the diagnosis before moving forward [^1116QfuT] [^1166tPd3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the distribution and morphology on exam to exclude a primary pruritic dermatosis that could be coincidentally cyclical, and I need to check for secondary excoriations or lichenification that might mislead us into thinking there is a primary rash, since generalized pruritus without observable inflammation is a distinct entity that changes the diagnostic and therapeutic approach [^1116QfuT] [^113Maf2z].

> Now, considering hormonal etiologies, autoimmune progesterone dermatitis (progestogen hypersensitivity) rises to the top of the list; symptoms typically begin 3–10 days before menses and resolve within 1–2 days of flow, and presentations are heterogeneous, including urticaria, eczematous plaques, erythema multiforme–like lesions, angioedema, and even anaphylaxis, so I should ask about systemic symptoms and prior exogenous progestin exposure, including contraceptives or fertility treatments, because both endogenous and exogenous progestogens can trigger reactions [^1166tPd3] [^117NJkv2] [^113GSNih].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic testing strategy before I commit; intradermal progesterone testing has been used historically, but I should double-check its validity because healthy controls can show positive reactions, which undermines specificity, so a clinical diagnosis supported by cycle timing and response to anovulatory therapy may be more reliable than relying solely on skin testing, and I should document this limitation when counseling the patient [^113mpFH8] [^1166tPd3] [^113GSNih].

> I will now examine estrogen dermatitis as a less common but plausible alternative; estrogen dermatitis can present with recurrent pruritic eruptions around ovulation and premenstrually, and case reports describe positive intradermal estrogen testing with supportive histology, though again, testing is not standardized and clinical correlation is paramount, so I should keep this in the differential if the timing fits and progesterone-directed testing is unrevealing [^115nj9GH] [^1167m8M6].

> But wait, what if this is a premenstrual exacerbation of atopic dermatitis rather than a primary hormonal hypersensitivity; I need to check for a history of eczema and whether there is visible inflammation, because multiple studies document premenstrual worsening of atopic dermatitis in the week before menses, and that would shift management toward optimized anti-inflammatory skin care and systemic atopic therapies rather than hormonal suppression [^114BQnBM].

> Next, I should review for iron deficiency anemia as a contributor; heavy menstrual bleeding can drive iron deficiency, which itself causes generalized pruritus, and importantly, iron repletion can rapidly attenuate itch, so I need to check a CBC, ferritin, and iron studies, and if ferritin is low, treat the deficiency and reassess symptom cyclicity to avoid anchoring on hormones prematurely [^116r5aQ4].

> I need to ensure I am not missing drug-induced pruritus; I should carefully reconcile medications, including NSAIDs like naproxen, which can cause generalized pruritus, and I should remember that exogenous progesterone products list generalized pruritus among adverse reactions, so temporal correlation with medication changes must be scrutinized before labeling this as endocrine-mediated itch [^111ZEFMH] [^111p3iNZ] [^115X77by].

> Let me consider systemic and neuropathic causes as well; although the cyclical pattern argues against many systemic etiologies, I should still screen for red flags suggesting malignancy, cholestasis, thyroid disease, renal or hepatic dysfunction, and small fiber neuropathy if the story deviates from a clear hormonal cadence, because generalized pruritus without rash can herald systemic disease and warrants a targeted laboratory evaluation when indicated [^1137S2So] [^114hhvWG] [^116r5aQ4].

> For the diagnostic workup, I should confirm the cycle timing with a symptom diary and baseline labs including CBC, ferritin, TSH, liver enzymes, bilirubin, creatinine/eGFR, and fasting glucose or HbA1c, reserving specialized testing for when the clinical picture supports it; if autoimmune progesterone dermatitis is suspected, I can consider intradermal progesterone testing while counseling about its limitations, and if estrogen dermatitis is suspected, consider intradermal estrogen testing in select cases, recognizing the lack of standardized protocols and the risk of false positives [^1166tPd3] [^113GSNih].

> Now, treatment; first-line for presumed autoimmune progesterone dermatitis is suppression of ovulation to blunt the luteal progesterone surge, and I should start with combined oral contraceptives, which have robust case-level evidence of benefit and are endorsed by guidelines, while monitoring for contraceptive contraindications and patient preferences; if OCPs are inadequate, I can escalate to GnRH agonists for short-term use, and in refractory cases, consider tamoxifen or even definitive surgical options like bilateral oophorectomy after multidisciplinary discussion, balancing risks and reproductive goals [^1166tPd3] [^113nrW4f] [^113GSNih].

> For estrogen dermatitis, let me think about options; case-based evidence supports tamoxifen as an antiestrogenic strategy, and bilateral oophorectomy has been reported in severe refractory cases, but I should confirm the diagnosis carefully and coordinate with gynecology and allergy/immunology before pursuing irreversible interventions, given the paucity of high-quality data [^115nj9GH] [^113GSNih].

> If atopic dermatitis is the driver, I should optimize barrier-directed care and consider systemic anti-inflammatory therapy such as dupilumab or other biologics for moderate-to-severe disease, recognizing that premenstrual flares are common and that targeted atopic therapy may outperform antihistamines, which are often insufficient for this itch phenotype [^114BQnBM] [^111Hgazb].

> For symptomatic relief while the underlying cause is addressed, I should double-check that I am not overpromising antihistamine efficacy; many patients with generalized pruritus without rash do not respond to H1 antihistamines, so I can trial sedating antihistamines at night for sleep, consider ondansetron in selected cases, and use topical anesthetics like pramoxine or polidocanol for focal itch, alongside emollients and trigger avoidance, tailoring to distribution and severity [^1116QfuT] [^112AsW14] [^1134jvEy].

> I should confirm iron repletion if deficiency is found, because correcting anemia can promptly improve itch and may clarify the contribution of menstrual blood loss to symptom burden, allowing us to focus hormonal therapy only on residual cyclical symptoms if they persist after iron normalization [^116r5aQ4].

> Next, I should review patient education and follow-up; I need to ensure the patient tracks symptoms across at least three cycles, avoids exogenous progestin triggers when possible, and understands that diagnostic certainty may rely on response to anovulatory therapy as much as on skin testing, with reassessment at 3–6 months to adjust the plan and consider escalation if partial response occurs [^1166tPd3] [^113GSNih].

> In summary, I should prioritize autoimmune progesterone dermatitis as the leading diagnosis for generalized pruritus tightly linked to the luteal phase, while keeping estrogen dermatitis, premenstrual atopic flares, iron deficiency, drug-induced itch, and systemic or neuropathic causes in view; a staged diagnostic approach anchored by cycle tracking and selective testing, followed by first-line anovulatory therapy and targeted symptomatic care, provides the most efficient and evidence-aligned pathway to relief and clarity [^1166tPd3] [^1116QfuT] [^114BQnBM] [^116r5aQ4].

Generalized itching during menstruation is most often due to **hormonal fluctuations** (especially progesterone) [^1166tPd3] that trigger immune responses, causing pruritus, urticaria, or eczema-like eruptions [^1166tPd3]. Other causes include **iron deficiency** from menstrual blood loss [^116r5aQ4], atopic dermatitis flares [^114BQnBM], and reactions to menstrual products or medications [^113FzSk9] [^115X77by]. Evaluation should include a detailed menstrual history, skin exam, and targeted labs (CBC, ferritin, TSH, LFTs, renal function); consider progesterone skin testing if autoimmune progesterone dermatitis is suspected [^113GSNih]. Management is **cause-specific**: antihistamines, topical corticosteroids, and emollients for symptomatic relief [^114NRcTQ] [^117TcjVp]; iron replacement if deficient [^116r5aQ4]; and hormonal suppression (OCPs, GnRH analogs) or progesterone desensitization for progestogen hypersensitivity [^1166tPd3] [^113nrW4f]. Persistent or severe cases warrant dermatology or allergy referral [^notfound].

## Hormonal influences on pruritus

Hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle — particularly **progesterone** — can trigger immune responses that cause generalized pruritus [^111p3iNZ].

- **Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis (APD)**: A rare, cyclical hypersensitivity to endogenous progesterone, presenting with pruritus, urticaria, eczema-like eruptions, or angioedema that flare in the luteal phase and resolve with menstruation [^117NJkv2] [^113GSNih].

- **Estrogen dermatitis**: Less common, with pruritic eruptions linked to estrogen peaks, often around ovulation or premenstrually [^115nj9GH].

- **Mechanisms**: Hormonal changes alter immune function and skin barrier integrity, increasing susceptibility to pruritus and dermatoses [^116pnRtK] [^117BVkRn].

---

## Common clinical presentations

Generalized pruritus during menstruation may present with:

| **Clinical presentation** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Urticaria | - Hives <br/> - Often cyclical and linked to progesterone [^1166tPd3] |
| Eczema-like eruptions | - Erythematous <br/> - Scaly patches <br/> - Often autoimmune progesterone dermatitis [^116hiz35] |
| Angioedema | - Non-pitting edema <br/> - Often cyclical [^115gMvhi] |
| Generalized pruritus without rash | - Often due to systemic factors (e.g. iron deficiency) [^116r5aQ4] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A thorough evaluation should include:

- **History**: Detailed menstrual history, symptom timing, medication use, and personal/family history of atopy or autoimmune disease [^113FzSk9].

- **Physical examination**: Skin findings, secondary excoriations, and signs of systemic disease [^114NGdFK].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, ferritin, thyroid function, liver function, renal function, and autoimmune screening as indicated [^notfound].

- **Progesterone skin testing**: Consider intradermal progesterone testing if autoimmune progesterone dermatitis is suspected, though sensitivity and specificity are limited [^113mpFH8] [^113GSNih].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis**: Antihistamines, topical corticosteroids, hormonal suppression (oral contraceptives, GnRH analogs), or progesterone desensitization [^1166tPd3] [^113nrW4f].

- **Iron deficiency anemia**: Iron supplementation and addressing menstrual blood loss [^116r5aQ4].

- **Atopic dermatitis flares**: Topical corticosteroids, emollients, and antihistamines [^notfound].

- **Generalized pruritus**: Symptomatic treatment with antihistamines, topical corticosteroids, and emollients [^117TcjVp] [^114NRcTQ].

---

## When to refer to a specialist

Referral to a dermatologist or allergist is indicated for **persistent or severe pruritus** unresponsive to initial therapy, suspected autoimmune progesterone dermatitis or estrogen dermatitis, or when specialized testing or advanced therapies are needed [^113GSNih].

---

Generalized itching during menstruation is most often due to **hormonal fluctuations**, particularly progesterone, but iron deficiency, atopic dermatitis, and medication or product reactions also contribute. A **targeted evaluation** and cause-specific management — including antihistamines, topical corticosteroids, emollients, iron replacement, and hormonal suppression — are key to symptom control [^1134jvEy] [^116r5aQ4] [^1166tPd3].

### 2020 guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cutaneous pruritus [^1116QfuT]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

The mechanisms underlying itch are not fully understood. Physicians usually encounter difficulty controlling itch in generalized pruritus. Since only a small percentage of patients with generalized pruritus respond to antihistamines (H 1 receptor antagonists), a variety of itch mediators and mechanisms other than histaminergic signals are considered to be involved in itch for these non-responsive patients. In 2012, we created guidelines for generalized pruritus. Those guidelines have been updated and revised to make some of the definitions, diagnostic terms, and classifications more applicable to daily clinical practice. Cutaneous pruritus as designated in these guidelines is a disease characterized by itch without an observable rash. Generalized pruritus (without skin inflammation) is defined as the presence of itch over a wide area, and not localized to a specific part of the body. This entity includes idiopathic pruritus, pruritus in the elderly, symptomatic pruritus, pregnancy-associated pruritus, drug-induced pruritus, and psychogenic pruritus. Localized pruritus (without skin inflammation) represents fixed itch localized to a specific part of the body, and includes anogenital pruritus, scalp pruritus, notalgia paresthetica, and brachioradial pruritus. These guidelines outline the current concepts and specify the diagnostic methods/treatments for cutaneous pruritus.

7.1.6 Small fiber neuropathy

Small fiber neuropathy (SFN) is a not uncommon disorder that affects the thinly myelinated A‐δ and unmyelinated C fibers, both of which are involved in itch conduction in the skin. SFNs are often idiopathic yet may result from a multitude of underlying conditions, including diabetes, chronic kidney disease, infectious diseases (e.g. HIV, hepatitis C infection, and Chagas disease), autoimmune diseases (e.g. Sjögren syndrome), paraneoplastic syndromes, and genetic diseases (e.g. Fabry disease and familial amyloid polyneuropathy). The symptoms of SFN encompass autonomic symptoms (e.g. dry eyes/mouses, constipation, bladder incontinence, and dizziness), as well as sensory symptoms (e.g. pain, itch burning, tingling, or numbness). This dysesthesia typically starts distally, affecting the limbs in a distal to proximal gradient, and may generalize. The diagnostic workup includes quantitative sensory testing and skin biopsy for the examination of intraepidermal nerve fiber densities, which are reduced in SFN.

7.1.7 Others

Neuropathic itch may develop in association with syndrome(s) affecting the central nervous system, including poststroke pruritus, brain/spinal tumors, Creutzfeldt‐Jakob disease, trigeminal trophic syndrome, multiple sclerosis, and postsurgical.

7.2 Cutaneous pruritus with underlying systemic disease(s)

A variety of systemic diseases are associated with cutaneous pruritus.

7.2.1 Disorders of iron metabolism

Both iron deficiency and iron overload can be associated with generalized pruritus, but, in some cases, they may also cause localized itch rather than generalized itch. For example, localized vulvar itch may be indicative of iron deficiency. The precise mechanism underlying itch associated with abnormal iron metabolism remains unclear.

Iron deficiency is frequently attributable to particular diet habits (e.g. vegetarian and vegan), gastrointestinal bleeding, menstrual blood loss, pregnancy, and blood loss from hemorrhoids. In patients with iron deficiency–associated generalized pruritus, the itching sensation can be attenuated or, in some cases, completely diminished, shortly after the commencement of iron replacement therapy. Iron overload such as hemochromatosis also elicit pruritus, and treatment for iron overload with venesection or iron chelation can result in attenuation of itching sensation.

### Female-specific pruritus from childhood to postmenopause: clinical features, hormonal factors, and treatment considerations [^117BVkRn]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

There have been considerable advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of pruritus in recent years. The purpose of this review was to highlight itch entities in women, and in particular pruritic vulvar dermatoses that women experience among different age groups. Unique temporal shifts may contribute to the etiology of many of these conditions. These changes lead to cyclical changes in the skin's basic composition. Specifically, estrogen receptors have been detected on keratinocytes that respond to rising and falling levels of estrogen. These receptors lead to changes in skin hydration, collagen content, and in the concentration of glycosaminoglycans that form the skin barrier. In addition, hormonal pH changes associated with the menstrual cycle may be an important factor in the aggravation of itch as increasing pH is known to activate the proteinase-activated receptor-2, a well-known itch mediator. Common pruritic conditions in women that will be discussed include atopic and irritant dermatitis, psoriasis, lichen sclerosus, infectious vulvovaginitis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, atrophic vulvovaginitis, squamous cell carcinoma, lichen simplex chronicus, and neuropathic itch. We also examine pruritic conditions associated with pregnancy including pemphigoid gestationis, polymorphic eruption of pregnancy, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and atopic eruption of pregnancy. Finally, acceptable and contraindicated antipruritic agents in pregnancy are examined.

Vulvovaginal itching, a commonly reported symptom in postmenopausal women, may be because of the genitourinary syndrome of menopause but has a broad differential including dermatologic, infectious, and autoimmune causes. Comprehensive evaluation is important to avoid inappropriate treatments that may delay the correct diagnosis. In many cases, no clear cause can be identified, and the goal of management is simply to control symptoms.

### Practice gaps in pruritus [^112dGSgR]. Dermatologic Clinics (2016). Low credibility.

There are several practice gaps in the evaluation and management of itch. These gaps include a dearth of objective measures of itch, infrequent use of validated patient-reported outcomes for itch, non-evidence-based treatment, and lack of consensus about the ideal workup for generalized itch. The present article reviews these gaps and presents potential solutions.

### Impact of the menstrual cycle on exacerbations of atopic dermatitis: a systematic review [^114BQnBM]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic pruritic inflammatory skin condition. Patients often report experiencing cutaneous deterioration associated with certain points of their menstrual cycle. Despite this, the literature surrounding this topic remains sparse. This review aims to summarise and compare recent publications surrounding the association between the different stages of the menstrual cycle and exacerbations of atopic dermatitis.

Methods

A literature review was conducted as per PRISMA guidelines using Ovid Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, PubMed and Web of Science. Search terms and variations on these terms included: menstruation, eczema and atopic dermatitis. A minimum of 2 authors independently screened each abstract and reviewed the full-texts for inclusion.

Results

A total of 16 studies were included. All articles consistently acknowledged premenstrual deterioration in control of atopic dermatitis, typically occurring in the week prior to menstruation.

Conclusion

Our results highlight that the premenstrual exacerbation of AD is a well-recognised phenomenon, typically occurring in the week prior to menstruation. Existing studies are of a low quality and we identified minimal evidence on treatment strategies for premenstrual AD exacerbations. Further large-scale studies are needed to explore treatment options for these patients, such as hormonal therapies.

### The possible relevance of sex hormones on irritant and allergic responses: their importance for skin testing [^114oeMC8]. Contact Dermatitis (2010). Low credibility.

Dermatological responses are affected by the menstrual cycle phase in female patients, an unsurprising observation as oestrogen and progesterone affect the skin and immunological function, with oestrogen suppression of cellular immunity in particular. Exacerbation of dermatological symptoms is typically observed in either the latter phase of the menstrual cycle or during menstruation. The allergic response is diminished in the ovulatory phase and heightened in the progestinic phase. Definitive conclusions with regard to the effect of reproductive hormones on skin disorders have been somewhat hampered by a body of research that has employed diverse research parameters, such as dosage, testing sites, concentration, vehicle of irritant delivery, and method of assessment, however, individual patient sensitivity varies widely. Standardization of measurement techniques is necessary to provide reproducible results as much as individual patient variation and technique will allow.

General Evaluation of Vulvovaginal Pruritus

The evaluation of patients presenting with vulvovaginal itching begins with a thorough history and physical examination. Important aspects of the history include the onset, duration, severity, and timing of symptoms; aggravating and relieving factors; and associated symptoms. The location of itch should be well defined and confirmed by the provider. Questions such as "is the itching on the inside, outside, or both?" may help characterize the itch as vaginal, vulvar, or vulvovaginal. An extensive survey of potential environmental exposures, such as sea, lake, pool, or hot tub water or plants may be undertaken. Irritant contacts with potential allergens, such as scented products, soaps, douches, noncotton or dyed fabrics, or absorbent products such as diapers or menstrual products, should be screened. Pubic hair management practices should be inquired about. Sexual contacts, particularly recent or new sexual partners, and STI history should be collected. If symptoms are associated with recurrent onset after female−male sexual intercourse, an allergy to latex or human seminal plasma could be considered. Nonsexual contact history should also be assessed — the physician may inquire if close contacts have recently had similar symptoms. Hygiene practices and history of bowel and bladder control should be assessed, particularly in children, the elderly, and patients with disabilities. Medications that can affect hormonal levels, such as contraceptives or estrogen modulators, and are associated with pruritus should also be considered. The patient's medical history should be taken, with close attention paid to potential dermatologic, endocrine, rheumatologic, and infectious risk factors.

### Scratching the surface: a comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^117KoDJx]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The accurate diagnosis and effective management of vulvovaginal itching are crucial for improving patient outcomes. Many patients seek care from dermatologists, gynecologists, and other primary care providers when these symptoms begin. Given the wide range of potential causes, a thorough diagnostic approach is essential. Misdiagnosis or delayed treatment can exacerbate symptoms and significantly impact a patient's quality of life.

The management of vulvovaginal pruritus requires a comprehensive approach that considers both the physical and psychological burdens of the condition. Women with chronic pruritus often experience distress, embarrassment, and negative impacts on sexual health, necessitating a patient-centered strategy that integrates dermatologic and gynecologic care with psychological support when needed. Future research should further explore gender-specific management strategies to optimize treatment outcomes and improve quality of life for affected individuals.

Tailoring management plans to the specific causes and patient needs, while considering multimodal treatment approaches, can lead to more successful long-term outcomes. Educating patients about their condition and involving them in the management process is also vital to prevent recurrence and ensure adherence to treatment plans. Despite these advancements, much research remains to be done on the specific characteristics of vulvovaginal itching and how it affects quality of life across different patient populations, highlighting the need for ongoing studies to better understand and address this complex issue.

### Progesterone hypersensitivity: a cyclical history [^117Kuhuq]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Hypersensitivity reaction to progesterone is rare, with less than 200 cases reported. It occurs mainly in women in their third decade of life and can have a heterogeneous presentation (cutaneous and/or systemic), with temporal relation to serum levels of progesterone. Diagnosis is based on history and physical examination, supported by skin tests. We describe the case of a woman in her late 20s with pruritic erythema on the chest that manifested in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, with spontaneous resolution in less than 5days, without secondary scarring. The histological diagnosis was non-specific, with evidence of interface dermatitis, but positive skin tests supported the diagnosis of autoimmune progesterone dermatitis. It is intended to alert to the manifestations of a pathology that is rare and difficult to diagnose but with a great impact on daily life.

### Catamenial dermatoses: has anyone ever considered prostaglandins? [^112oCF3e]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Catamenial dermatoses are unusual, cyclic, perimenstrual reactions to hormones produced during the menstrual cycle. They occur in a variety of clinical presentations, including urticaria, eczema, fixed drug eruptions, erythema multiforme and anaphylaxis. Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis is the most common, and is caused by an autoimmune response to endogenous progesterone in women of reproductive age. We report a case of catamenial dermatosis in a 42-year-old Jamaican woman with a 10-year history of cyclic blistering and ulcerative eruptions of her mouth and limbs. Her symptoms were fully in keeping with a Stevens-Johnson-type reaction, and were associated with production of prostaglandins occurring during her menstrual cycle.

### The menstrual cycle and the skin [^116pnRtK]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Perimenstrual exacerbations of dermatoses are commonly recognized, yet our knowledge of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remains imperfect. Research into the effects of oestrogen on the skin has provided evidence to suggest that oestrogen is associated with increases in skin thickness and dermal water content, improved barrier function, and enhanced wound healing. Research into the effects of progesterone suggests that the presence of various dermatoses correlates with peak levels of progesterone. Dermatoses that are exacerbated perimenstrually include acne, psoriasis, atopic eczema and irritant dermatitis, and possibly also erythema multiforme. Exacerbations occur at the peak levels of progesterone in the menstrual cycle. Underlying mechanisms include reduced immune and barrier functions as a result of cyclical fluctuations in oestrogen and/or progesterone. Autoimmune progesterone and oestrogen dermatitis are the best-characterized examples of perimenstrual cutaneous reactions to hormones produced during the menstrual cycle. In this review, we describe the current understanding of the menstrual cycle, and its effect on the skin and cutaneous disorders.

### Progestogen hypersensitivity [^1166tPd3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Progestogen hypersensitivity (PH) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by diverse cutaneous manifestations, bronchospasm, and/or anaphylaxis. Possible triggers include ovarian progesterone and exogenous progestogens. The timing of symptoms is critical to diagnose PH: during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle for the endogenous form and after exposure to progestins for exogenous PH. Diagnostic modalities such as progesterone skin testing have low sensitivity and specificity for PH. When exogenous PH is suspected, the allergist should consider a progestogen challenge. Treatment strategies should be tailored for each patient, including symptom-directed therapies, ovulation suppression, and progesterone desensitization. Future studies should explore the mechanisms of PH, validation of diagnostic criteria, and standardization of treatment strategies.

1 INTRODUCTION

Itch, also known as pruritus, is defined as an uncomfortable sensation that provokes an urge to scratch. It impairs the quality of life (QOL) of those experiencing itch and can be debilitating and even lethal when it becomes severe and/or chronic. Therefore, dermatologists and physicians who see patients with itch must be knowledgeable about it. This review will provide an overview of the pathophysiology and treatment strategies for itch, with a particular focus on itch with no underlying primary pruritic skin disease.

### Female genital itch [^117Rd2Fe]. Dermatologic Clinics (2018). Low credibility.

Vulvar pruritus is a common complaint among young girls and women presenting to primary care physicians, gynecologists, and dermatologists. Female genital itch is especially disruptive because of its interference with sexual function and intimacy. Causes of vulvar itch are vast and may be inflammatory, environmental, neoplastic, or infectious, often with several causes coexisting simultaneously. Diagnosis may be difficult because of the unique anatomy and inherent properties of genital and perianal skin. Treatment is aimed at eliminating outside irritants, restoring epidermal barrier function, and suppressing inflammation.

### Sex hormones and urticaria [^116zzoRg]. Journal of Dermatological Science (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic urticaria is characterized by mast cells/basophils activation which initiate the inflammatory response. Pathogenetically, the disease may in many cases represent an autoimmune phenomenon. Altered function of the neuro-endocrine-immune system due to stress and other factors has also been implicated its pathogenesis. Sex hormones modulate immune and inflammatory cell functions, including mast cell secretion, and are regarded as responsible for gender and menstrual cycle phase-associated differential susceptibility and severity of some autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Chronic urticaria is approximately twice more frequent in women than in men. In addition, urticaria may be associated with some diseases and conditions characterized by hormonal changes, including endocrinopathy, menstrual cycle, pregnancy, menopause and hormonal contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy. Hypersensitivity reactions to endogenous or exogenous female sex hormones have been implicated in the pathogenesis of urticarial lesions associated with estrogen and autoimmune progesterone dermatitis. We observed lower serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) concentration in patients with chronic urticaria with positive and negative response to autologous serum skin test. Thus, the influence of fluctuations in the hormonal milieu and altered sex hormone expression on the triggering-off, maintenance or aggravation of urticaria should be taken into account. In addition, the possible impact of estrogen mimetics, in the environment and in food, on the development of disease associated with mast cell activation must be considered. This review endeavours to outline what is known about the possible influence of sex hormones in the expression of urticaria.

### Progestogen hypersensitivity: heterogeneous manifestations with a common trigger [^1172shvQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Hypersensitivity to progestogen, previously known as autoimmune progesterone dermatitis, is an increasingly recognized clinical entity that presents specific diagnostic and treatment challenges. Clinical presentations are heterogeneous, but can consist of hypersensitivity symptoms associated with the progesterone surge during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle or after exposure to exogenous progestins. With the increasing use of exogenous progesterone for contraception and fertility, more cases of hypersensitivity to exogenous progestins have been described. Here we will review proposed pathomechanisms for progestogen hypersensitivity (PH) as well as the clinical presentation of PH, testing strategies to aid in diagnosis, and treatment options for patients with hypersensitivity to progestogens.

### Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis: a diagnosis easily missed [^1114R71U]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis (AIPD) is a rare, poorly characterized dermatosis, with about 60 previously reported cases. It typically undergoes cyclical flares relating to the menstrual cycle, especially the luteal phase, when levels of progesterone are at their highest. We report the case of a 34-year-old woman with an 8-year history of a profoundly pruritic eruption, associated with her menstrual cycle, in whom the diagnosis had proved elusive. Buserelin nasal spray resulted in complete clearance. AIPD is a diagnosis to consider in intractable eruptions in women, particularly if there is cyclical variation.

Pruritus in pregnancy is a common and burdensome symptom that may be a first sign of a pregnancy-specific pruritic disease (atopic eruption of pregnancy, polymorphic eruption of pregnancy, pemphigoid gestationis, and intrahepatic cholestasis in pregnancy) or a dermatosis coinciding with pregnancy by chance. Despite its high prevalence, pruritus is often underrated by physicians, and data regarding the safety profiles of drugs for pruritus are very limited. In this review, we illustrate the epidemiology, possible pathophysiology, clinical characteristics, and diagnostic workup of various pregnancy-related diseases and discuss antipruritic treatments. The prevalence of pruritus in pregnancy demonstrates the importance of symptom recognition and the need for an holistic approach, taking into account both the potential benefits for the patient and the potential risks to the fetus.

### Scratching the surface: a comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^116XxDM8]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vulvovaginal itching is a common complaint addressed by gynecologists and dermatologists alike. Despite this, many dermatologists receive little exposure to vulvar disease during their training. Viewing vulvovaginal issues through a dermatological or multidisciplinary lens can aid in long-term symptom management.

Diagnosing vulvovaginal itching can be complex due to the numerous potential causes. Many patients self-treat with over-the-counter medications for personal and socioeconomic reasons. Misuse of these treatments can exacerbate symptoms and delay or complicate diagnosis, highlighting the importance of appropriate evaluation. Without proper treatment, chronic symptoms may worsen.

Management of vulvovaginal conditions can span days to weeks or months, depending on symptom severity and etiology. Recent advances suggest that multimodal approaches may be most effective for complex etiologies requiring long-term pruritus management. However, there remains a research gap concerning characterization of female-specific vulvovaginal itch, as most studies focus on specific symptom causes. Understanding the specific nature of a patient's itch can aid in the formation of an appropriate differential diagnosis and a management plan.

### Scratching the surface: a comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^113QNZwR]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Psychogenic itch, also called somatoform itch, functional itch, or pruriplastic itch, refers to chronic pruritus in which a psychological condition is both central to and either an incited, aggravating, or mitigating factor. The itch may be purely psychological in origin without a known dermatologic, neurogenic, or systemic cause, or may present as an aggravation of an existing pruritic state in association with psychological factors. Pruritus ani and vulvar pruritus may be attributed to this somatic disorder. While many psychiatric conditions have been associated with psychogenic itch, depression, obsessive–compulsive disorder, anxiety, and substance use disorder are commonly associated conditions. An itch–scratch cycle may result from psychogenic itch, causing dermatologic changes that perpetuate and worsen the condition. The diagnosis should be considered after a complete dermatologic examination, and investigation of other etiologies has not been found or does not fully explain symptom severity, and a psychiatric condition is present. A complete discussion of the pathophysiology of psychogenic itch is beyond the scope of this review, as it requires complex dissection of the nature of somatic disorders. Figure 1 illustrates several common causes of vulvovaginal pruritus.

### Scratching the surface: a comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^114JPp9b]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Vulvovaginal itching is a common yet often under-recognized condition affecting women across all age groups. Despite its prevalence, many dermatologists receive minimal training in vulvar diseases, leading to delayed diagnoses and prolonged discomfort for patients. This review explores the broad spectrum of causes, including infections, inflammatory conditions, neuropathic disorders, and systemic illnesses. The complexity of vulvovaginal pruritus often requires a multidisciplinary approach to accurately diagnose and treat. Contributing factors such as hormonal changes, personal hygiene practices, and environmental exposures must also be considered. Treatment strategies typically begin with lifestyle modifications and topical therapies, such as corticosteroids and antifungals, but can extend to systemic medications and biologics for resistant cases. Additionally, nonpharmaceutical options such as sitz baths and psychological interventions can be crucial for managing chronic symptoms. However, there remains a significant gap in research, particularly regarding the characterization of female-specific pruritus and its long-term impact on quality of life. Despite some advances, the available studies largely focus on isolated causes rather than the holistic nature of the condition. Further research is urgently needed to develop comprehensive, evidence-based guidelines for diagnosing and treating vulvovaginal itching, a condition that has a profound effect on both physical and emotional well-being.

Epidemiology

The exact prevalence of vulvovaginal pruritus is difficult to determine due to the broad range of conditions that can cause it, but it is a common condition and affects most women at some point in their lives. Vulvar pruritus may affect women of all ages, and there is a notable correlation between age and the prevalence of many specific causal conditions. For instance, in one study vulvovaginitis was reported in 61.8% of gynecological issues in childhood and adolescence, with a high frequency of dermatitis in prepubertal populations. Infectious causes such as vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) and trichomoniasis affect adolescent and adult women more frequently than children.

Age-related hormonal changes affect the vulvar anatomy, resulting in unique risk factors for vulvar pruritus for different age groups. Vaginal discomfort and pruritus in children aged 2–7 years may stem from early physiological and floral changes. Prepubertal girls are susceptible to conditions such as atopic and irritant dermatitis due to lack of estrogenization of the vagina. Additionally, proximity of the anus to the vagina and poor hygiene predisposes to the risk of inoculation with digestive bacteria and vaginal dysbiosis. Absence of labial fat pads and pubic hair as protective barriers are risk factors for dermatoses and pruritus-inducing infections in this age group. In contrast, estrogen loss occurring in the postpartum or postmenopausal state or from medications results in thinning of the vaginal epithelium and reduced elasticity, increasing vulnerability to irritation and infection.

Three primary vulvar dermatoses — lichen sclerosus, lichen planus, and lichen simplex chronicus — affect various age groups. At a vulvar specialty clinic in Oxford, UK, 20–25% of new patients presented with these conditions. Lichen sclerosus can impact prepubertal and postmenopausal women, lichen planus typically affects women aged 30–60 years, and lichen simplex chronicus is prevalent across all age groups.

Disease-specific risk factors include a family history of allergies, asthma, or eczema for lichen simplex chronicus; pregnancy, coitus frequency, conditions and medications associated with hyperglycemia and glucosuria, antibiotic use, and immunosuppressive conditions for vulvovaginal candidiasis; sexual activity for trichomoniasis; hereditary and environmental factors for atopic dermatitis; and ingestion of specific triggers for irritant contact dermatitis. Other multifactorial risk factors for vulvovaginitis include obesity and inflammatory bowel disease. Understanding these risk factors is crucial for assessing the clinical likelihood of the various causes and management strategies of vulvar and vaginal pruritus.

### Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis: update and insights [^116hiz35]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis (APD) is rare autoimmune hypersensitivity reaction to the fluctuations of endogenous progesterone during a woman's menstrual cycle. It has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations including urticaria, eczema and vesiculobullous eruptions. The disease course depends on treatment modality. The pathogenic mechanisms of APD remain to be elucidated.

Objective

We aim to review the literature on APD and evaluate the different theories of pathogenesis and treatments for this condition.

Methods

A review of the English literature on APD was performed using PubMed, EMBASE and MEDLINE.

Results

89 patients are included in this review. Initial symptom development in association with the menstrual cycle was reported in 65 (73%) patients. In some patients, it occurred shortly after hormone therapy (8.9%) or in relation to a pregnancy (14.6%). Associated factors were not defined in three patients (3.4%). Nearly 45% had a history of exposure to exogenous progesterone. Diagnosis of APD was usually confirmed with an intradermal progesterone sensitivity test. The goal of treatment was to suppress progesterone secretion through anovulation. Some cases were controlled with oral contraceptives or conjugated estrogen, while some patients had complete resolution post-hysterectomy.

Conclusion

The wide spectrum of clinical presentations, histology, and response to therapy would suggest that there are multiple subsets in APD. The increase in the levels of progesterone may also influence the clinical profile and the corresponding immunological response. Further research on the pathogenesis of APD is required to provide a satisfactory treatment modality.

Autoimmune progesterone-induced dermatitis in cyclical urticaria — Summary Statement 62: Women who present with cyclical urticaria can have autoimmune progesterone-induced dermatitis (C). Typical eruptions are papular to plaque-like urticaria or angioedema developing 3 to 10 days before menses. Diagnosis is by skin testing with 1 mg/mL aqueous progesterone administered intradermally (0.1 ml), with a positive response defined as a greater than 2-mm increase in wheal size compared with the negative control. Provocative challenges with progesterone can be performed if skin test results are negative, and diagnosis is confirmed by prevention of skin eruptions by inhibiting ovulation; thirty micrograms of ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg of levonorgestrel worked for one patient.

### Pruritus in pregnancy [^117CHwha]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pruritus (CP), defined as an unpleasant sensation resulting in a need to scratch that lasts more than 6 weeks, is one of the major dermatological complaints during pregnancy. According to recent studies, 18–40% of pregnant patients experience pruritus. In addition to being associated with pregnancy-specific conditions (atopic eruption of pregnancy [AEP], polymorphic eruption of pregnancy [PEP], pemphigoid gestationis [PG], and intrahepatic cholestasis in pregnancy [ICP]), pruritus may arise from dermatoses that coincidently develop during pregnancy, exacerbation of preexisting dermatoses, and physiological skin changes in pregnancy. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of dermatological and nondermatological conditions leading to CP in pregnancy. Clinical characteristics, diagnostic workup, and treatment options are discussed. When possible, we provide the US FDA letter label indicating pregnancy risk category (Table 1). The FDA letter grading system was retired and the Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling rule was instituted in 2015 to provide more qualitative information about medications in pregnancy. Therefore, drugs introduced after 2015 do not have letter labeling.

### Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis: a diagnosis to consider in a patient with cyclical cutaneous eruptions [^117NJkv2]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis (APD) is a cyclical cutaneous reaction to progesterone, with symptoms that typically begin 3–10 days before the onset of menstrual flow and end 1–2 days into menses. The symptoms vary in severity from barely visible to anaphylaxis, but most often include an eczematous eruption, erythema multiforme, urticaria, folliculitis, and angioedema. This is a rare disorder with only a handful of documented cases. The pathogenesis of this condition remains unknown and significant variations in the presentation and severity of symptoms complicates its diagnosis. Treatment seeks to inhibit progesterone secretion through suppression of ovulation, but it may be unsuccessful. We present a case of autoimmune progesterone dermatitis that eluded diagnosis for several years, and subsequently the patient was completely controlled with oral contraceptive pills. J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(10):1040–1042.

6 CUTANEOUS PRURITUS: ITCH WITH NO PRIMARY PRURITIC DERMATOSIS

Itch typically arises from inflamed skin, which may be the result of allergic inflammation or infectious skin (e.g. fungal, parasitic, and viral infections). On the other hand, a certain population of patients with itch present with uninflamed or normal‐appearing skin. These skin conditions may or may not result in secondary skin changes due to scratching. This itch condition is coined "cutaneous pruritus" in the Japanese Dermatological Association's guideline", pruritus with no underlying dermatosis", or "generalized pruritus without rash" if itch is generalized, in the British Association of Dermatologists' guidelines for the investigation and management of generalized pruritus in adults without an underlying dermatosis, 2018, and "pruritus on non‐diseased skin" in a position paper of the International Forum for the Study of Itch. The Japanese guideline further categorizes cutaneous pruritus into two phenotypes: generalized cutaneous pruritus and localized cutaneous pruritus. Generalized pruritus refers to presence of itch on a wide area of the body, while localized pruritus is defined as itch fixed and localized to a specific part of the body.

Hereinafter, the term cutaneous pruritus is used to describe itch without primary pruritic dermatosis and observable primary rash.

### Chronic urticaria due to autoreactivity to progesterone [^117NEF1K]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

A 23-year-old, regularly menstruating woman presented with recurrent urticarial eruptions, which occurred premenstrually. A skin prick test was positive for progesterone, but the urticaria was unresponsive to standard treatments. The patient was treated with goserelin (Zoladex), which suppressed her menstrual cycle, leading to the resolution of her symptoms. Subsequent flares were controlled by further goserelin injections, and the urticaria is currently in remission. However, the risks of inducing menopause artificially are significant, and alternative long-term solutions may need to be considered in the event of a relapse.

### Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis mimicking facial erythromelalgia successfully treated with hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy [^115vXzZe]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis (APD) is a rare skin disease thought to be caused by an autoimmune response to endogenous or exogenous progesterone. APD can present with a variety of skin manifestations, including pruritus, urticaria, annular erythema, and eczematous, vesiculobullous, or erythema multiforme-like lesions. It often occurs in women in a cyclical pattern that corresponds to their menstrual cycle, with flares at the height of progesterone levels 3 to 10 days prior to menses. In the case of exogenous progesterone, flares can be a daily occurrence. Here we describe an unusual case of APD presenting as painful erythema on the bilateral malar cheeks that completely resolved after total hysterectomy. This rare case, in terms of location, symptoms, and treatment, adds to our understanding of the variety of potential clinical presentations of APD.

7.5 Unknown origin

In instances where patients present with chronic itch and no underlying origin for pruritus can be determined despite a comprehensive and careful diagnostic workup, a diagnosis of chronic pruritus of unknown origin (CPUO) can be assigned.CPUO often features "generalized" itch, but the extent to which this condition is generalized varies. It is estimated that approximately 6% of patients with chronic pruritus can be diagnosed as having CPUO. This itch may occur at any age. The pathogenesis of CPUO remains naturally uncertain. Some CPUO patients show immunologic profile skewed toward type 2 immunity, evidenced by peripheral eosinophiliaand type 2–related lesional gene expressions. Treatment agents targeting type 2 inflammation have been shown to improve itch in CPUO, including JAK inhibitorsand dupilumab. A recent study has reported that downregulation of metabolic pathways related to catecholamine biosynthesis and tryptophan biosynthesis is observed in patients with CPUO. Further studies are required to elucidate this issue.

Discussion

Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis is a rare cyclic reaction to progesterone that occurs during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The most common cutaneous manifestations are urticaria, eczematous eruptions, and erythema multiformelike lesions, although morbilliform, vesiculobullous, and oral lesions have also been reported. There are no distinguishing histologic features of autoimmune progesterone dermatitis.

The earliest cases of autoimmune progesterone dermatitis appear at menarche, and some patients have autoimmune progesterone dermatitis that appears to be triggered by hormonal therapy or pregnancy. Although pregnancy can trigger the eruption or exacerbate the dermatosis, a subset of patients with autoimmune progesterone dermatitis improves during pregnancy, possibly because of desensitization resulting from persistently elevated progesterone levels.

Although the diagnosis can be made clinically, an intradermal progesterone test can confirm the diagnosis. With regard to the intradermal injection, progesterone in an aqueous suspension is the preferred modality, as the oil suspension can irritate the skin and lead to a false-positive result.

Various treatments are used for autoimmune progesterone dermatitis, and most are aimed at suppressing ovulation. OCPs are the most commonly used therapy. This case report suggests that even a short course of OCPs can provide long-lasting clearance of lesions, possibly because of the desensitization to progesterone. Although this patient remains clear of lesions 8 months after discontinuing OCPs, we will continue to monitor her to determine if clearance is lasting. Danazol (prophylactic monthly dosing) has also been reported to be effective in some patients. Although gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs have been used to treat autoimmune progesterone dermatitis, as administration inhibits ovulation and decreases sex hormone production, they should not be used for longer than 6 months because of negative effects on bone metabolism and the cardiovascular system. In refractory cases, bilateral oophorectomy has been used as a last resort and provides a definitive treatment.

### Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis presenting as fixed drug eruption [^115tKsZ1]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis (APD) is a rare disorder that presents as recurrent cyclical cutaneous eruptions during the premenstrual period when progesterone level is elevated. It does not have a specific cutaneous manifestation of its own and presents with a multitude of common cutaneous conditions, thus making it a diagnostic challenge. We describe the case of a young woman who presented with a hyperpigmented patch on her left thigh, over which she developed recurrent erythema, pain and itching, starting 2days before her menstrual cycle and resolving within 2days after menstruation. Intradermal progesterone sensitivity test was positive. Histopathology of hyperpigmented patch showed features of fixed drug eruption. A diagnosis of APD presenting as fixed drug eruption was made. She was treated with oral contraceptive pills with significant improvement. This case has been reported because of its rarity and to highlight the clinical implications this condition can pose if diagnosis is not sought timely.

### Intradermal testing for autoimmune progesterone dermatitis: should we be basing the diagnosis on it? [^113mpFH8]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis (APD) is a rare skin disorder with varying presentations, resulting from hypersensitivity to endogenous progesterone during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The diagnosis has been traditionally confirmed with intradermal progesterone testing (IPT) or intramuscular challenge with progesterone or its derivatives. We present a case of a 31-year-old woman with suspected APD who underwent IPT to progesterone. The patient's cyclical symptoms, positive skin reaction and symptoms following IPT were sufficient to make a diagnosis of APD. However, we also tested 10 healthy female controls without symptoms of APD, and found that 9 of these also developed positive skin reactions to intradermal progesterone at 15 min, 24 and 48 h, albeit to a lesser extent. Therefore, these results raise doubts about the validity of using IPT to make a diagnosis of APD. Further research on appropriate testing is needed.

### Menstrual cycle hormone changes associated with reproductive aging and how they may relate to symptoms [^114wkXoy]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Key cycle changes occur as women transition from reproductive life to menopause, and they can be roughly linked to menopausal staging. It is important to understand the types of studies that inform the current knowledge. Patterns of symptoms within menstrual cycles (sleep, headache) generally favor worsening in association with the perimenstrual phase of the cycle, and patterns of chronic symptoms, such as hot flashes and adverse mood, appear to be worse when hormones are more variable.

### Innovative management of pruritus [^112K3ULj]. Dermatologic Clinics (2010). Low credibility.

Pruritus remains a significant problem facing dermatologists and can be associated with various dermatoses and systemic derangements. At times, one can treat the underlying cutaneous or systemic process to alleviate itch. However, it is frequently challenging to identify the cause of a patient's itch and, in this situation, even more difficult to manage the symptom effectively. In this article, the authors discuss the approach to a patient with generalized pruritus without clinically obvious dermatoses. They also addresses mechanisms and management modalities of itch in common systemic diseases, including cholestasis, uremia, and neuropathic dysfunction.

### Scratching the surface: a comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^111GzTY2]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

For fungal and parasitic infections, medications tend to reduce itch quite rapidly. Metronidazole is commonly used for bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis while fungal infections are often treated with oral fluconazole. For bacterial vulvar infections, antibiotics are prescribed on the basis of the identified pathogen.

Very rarely, long-term management of vulvar itching in postmenopausal women may involve low-dose estradiol, administered orally or via transdermal application, following the failure of localized topical treatments. This therapy is not preferred or used often because the safety of long-term low-dose hormone therapy is inferior to that of localized treatments.

In rare cases, botox injections and spinal blocks have been used as treatment options for neuropathic itch, including vulvovaginal pruritus, by modulating nerve activity and reducing hypersensitization. Additionally, dorsal root ganglion (DRG) stimulation, a neuromodulation technique commonly used for chronic pain, has shown potential for managing intractable neuropathic itch. This approach targets the DRG, which plays a critical role in transmitting itch signals, and can be applied as a treatment for localized vulvovaginal itch.

Nonpharmaceutical Therapies

Nonpharmaceutical methods can also mitigate symptoms of vulvovaginal pruritus. Tub and sitz baths can soothe symptoms by hydrating the vulvar area, but water should not be too hot. In inflammatory conditions, applying bland emollients such as petroleum jelly can help retain moisture and protect the skin. Cold compresses may alleviate severe itching. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and acupuncture offer potential benefits; TENS reduces itch through nerve stimulation, while acupuncture may address skin barrier imbalances. Physical therapy may help with neuromuscular-related discomfort. Homeopathic remedies, however, lack significant efficacy for itching.

### Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis mistaken for Stevens-Johnson syndrome [^11631ncR]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis is an uncommon disease presenting with cyclical skin eruptions corresponding with the menstrual cycle luteal phase. Because symptoms are precipitated by rising progesterone levels, treatment relies on hormone suppression.

Case

A 22-year-old nulligravid woman presented with symptoms mistaken for Stevens-Johnson syndrome. A cyclic recurrence of symptoms occurred, and the diagnosis of autoimmune progesterone dermatitis was made by an intradermal progesterone challenge. After 48 months, her disease remained refractory to medical management, and definitive surgical treatment with bilateral oophorectomy was performed.

Conclusions

Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis is a challenging diagnosis as a result of its rarity and variety of clinical presentations. Treatment centers on suppression of endogenous progesterone and avoidance of exogenous triggers. When these modalities fail, surgical management must be undertaken.

### Practical guide for the diagnosis and treatment of localized and generalized cutaneous pruritus (chronic itch with no underlying pruritic dermatosis) [^1137S2So]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Itch, also known as pruritus, is one of the most prevalent symptoms observed in dermatological practices. Itch frequently arises from primary pruritic dermatoses, although it may also manifest in the absence of a primary pruritic skin rash. The latter itchy condition is referred to as "cutaneous pruritus" in the Japanese guidelines published in 2020. Cutaneous pruritus can be classified into two categories based on its distribution: localized cutaneous pruritus and generalized cutaneous pruritus. Localized cutaneous pruritus is indicative of a neuropathic cause, whereas generalized cutaneous pruritus suggests underlying systemic disease(s), drug‐induced itch, psychogenic itch (also known as functional itch disorder), or chronic pruritus of unknown origin (CPUO). Systemic diseases associated with cutaneous pruritus include disorders of iron metabolism, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease (especially cholestasis), endocrine/metabolic diseases, hematological disorders, and malignant solid tumors. CPUO is a term used to describe chronic itch that is often generalized and for which no underlying cause can be identified despite a comprehensive and careful diagnostic workup. A variety of treatment approaches are available for cutaneous pruritus, including device‐based physical therapies (such as phototherapy) and medications that act on the itch‐perception processing pathway from the skin, peripheral sensory nerves, the spinal cord, to the brain. This review presents an overview of the current knowledge regarding cutaneous pruritus, from its underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms to the diagnostic procedures and treatment approaches that are currently available.

### Estrogen dermatitis that appeared twice in each menstrual period [^115nj9GH]. The Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

A 23-year-old woman presented with millet-sized red papules that were scattered over her chest and abdomen. She stated that since the age of 20, she had recurrently suffered from pruritic eruptions that coincided with ovulation and the time prior to menstruation, and that they persisted for a few days before vanishing spontaneously leaving some pigmentation. A skin biopsy specimen revealed spongiotic bullae in the epidermis and marked infiltration of lymphocytes accompanied by some histiocytes and eosinophils in the upper dermis. An intradermal test for conjugated estrogen showed an urticarial reaction that faded in about four hours. Although the test did not strictly meet the criterion (erythema to remain for more than 24 hours for papulovesicular eruptions), it was concluded that the timing of the episodes along with the result of the test suggested that a diagnosis of estrogen dermatitis was highly probable. There have been several reports of this condition since it was first reported as a distinct entity in 1995; but whatever the reasons, the flares were observed only before menstruation in these cases, despite the fact that the serum estrogen levels showed a double-peaked pattern during each menstrual period. This is considered to be a rare case of estrogen dermatitis that flared twice in each menstrual period. Limited improvement was noted in the symptoms even without treatment.

7.2.5 Hematological disorders

Generalized itch is one of the presenting symptoms associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), especially polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis, and primary myelofibrosis. It is noteworthy that patients with myeloma do not typically present with generalized pruritus. Patients with PV and other forms of MPNs frequently report a characteristic and distinct form of pruritus, known as aquagenic pruritus. Aquagenic pruritus is defined as an intense itching sensation within a few minutes of the exposure to water (particularly hot water rather than cold water), without any apparent skin changes. The frequent itching sites of aquagenic pruritus are the upper and lower extremities. It is estimated that up to 70% of patients with PV experience aquagenic pruritus, and the onset of aquagenic pruritus often precedes the diagnosis of MPNs. The precise pathogenesis of MPN‐associated itch and aquagenic pruritus remains unclear, but a genetic mutation, basophils, and mast cells may contribute to these phenomena. The JAK2 gain‐of‐function mutation (JAK2V617F) is present in up to 97% of patients with PV and in more than 50% of patients with other forms of MPNs. This mutation is closely associated with itch in MPNs, since the mutation burden is reportedly correlated with the occurrence of aquagenic pruritus. The JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib has been demonstrated to rapidly improve itch in MPNs. Treatment approaches for itch in PV include antidepressantsand phototherapy. Antihistamines are shown to be ineffective in improving itch in MPNs. Itch in PV may persist even after the normalization of blood cell counts with venesection.

Lymphoma (both Hodgkin and non–Hodgkin lymphoma) is also associated with generalized pruritus, with a prevalence of approximately 15% and 25%, respectively. In patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, itch severity is reported to be correlated with advanced disease stage and may serve as an indicator of poor diagnosis. The pathogenesis of lymphoma‐associated itch remains unclear. IL‐31 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin, which are possibly secreted by tumor cells and infiltrating immune cells, are reported to be involved in itch in Hodgkin lymphoma. The curative treatment of lymphoma has been shown to resolve lymphoma‐associated itch. The available literature reports various treatment options including oral corticosteroids, cimetidine, GABAergic drugs, antidepressants, and phototherapy.

Sodium and glycerol phenylbutyrate may also cause a range of side effects, but are usually limited to gastrointestinal distress with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. These symptoms are often dose‐dependent and may occur if high doses are required for treatment. Some patients may experience tiredness, fatigue, or drowsiness, as well as loss of appetite, which may lead to unintended weight loss, possibly even leading to a vicious circle perpetuating hyperammonemia. There may also be effects on blood cells, including leukocytopenia and thrombocytopenia, although these are less common and typically occur in patients younger than 2 years. Allergic responses, including skin rashes, itching, or more severe hypersensitivity reactions, can occur but are rare.

Besides these aforementioned adverse events, it has been observed that phenylbutyrate, particularly when used over long periods, may have an impact on ovarian function. Approximately one quarter of fertile female patients reported irregular periods or a complete abstinence of their menstruation. The exact mechanisms by which this could occur are not fully understood. As a HDAC inhibitor, sodium phenylbutyrate has the ability to alter gene expression, which could theoretically affect reproductive hormones and ovarian function. More research into understanding the pathogenesis of this adverse effect is needed, also to evaluate long term risks on reproductive health and the endocrine system.

Hypersensitivity to estrogens and progestogens is often undiagnosed. The condition has many manifestations, including premenstrual syndrome, dysmenorrhea, and impaired fertility. Diagnosis is confirmed by skin testing for inflammatory responses to small doses of the hormone, and desensitization with small doses of the hormone is the most appropriate form of management.

### Practical guide for the diagnosis and treatment of localized and generalized cutaneous pruritus (chronic itch with no underlying pruritic dermatosis) [^115E9U5X]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Itch, also known as pruritus, is one of the most prevalent symptoms observed in dermatological practices. Itch frequently arises from primary pruritic dermatoses, although it may also manifest in the absence of a primary pruritic skin rash. The latter itchy condition is referred to as "cutaneous pruritus" in the Japanese guidelines published in 2020. Cutaneous pruritus can be classified into two categories based on its distribution: localized cutaneous pruritus and generalized cutaneous pruritus. Localized cutaneous pruritus is indicative of a neuropathic cause, whereas generalized cutaneous pruritus suggests underlying systemic disease(s), drug-induced itch, psychogenic itch (also known as functional itch disorder), or chronic pruritus of unknown origin (CPUO). Systemic diseases associated with cutaneous pruritus include disorders of iron metabolism, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease (especially cholestasis), endocrine/metabolic diseases, hematological disorders, and malignant solid tumors. CPUO is a term used to describe chronic itch that is often generalized and for which no underlying cause can be identified despite a comprehensive and careful diagnostic workup. A variety of treatment approaches are available for cutaneous pruritus, including device-based physical therapies (such as phototherapy) and medications that act on the itch-perception processing pathway from the skin, peripheral sensory nerves, the spinal cord, to the brain. This review presents an overview of the current knowledge regarding cutaneous pruritus, from its underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms to the diagnostic procedures and treatment approaches that are currently available.

7 CAUSES AND CHARACTERISTICS OF CUTANEOUS PRURITUS

The causes of cutaneous pruritus are diverse, with some patients exhibiting a single cause, while others present with mixed causes (Figure 8).

FIGURE 8
Causes of cutaneous pruritus. Cutaneous pruritus can be classified into two categories based on its distribution: Localized cutaneous pruritus and generalized cutaneous pruritus. Localized cutaneous pruritus is indicative of neuropathic cause, whereas generalized cutaneous pruritus suggests underlying systemic disease(s), drug‐induced itch, psychogenic itch (also known as functional itch disorder), or chronic pruritus of unknown origin (CPUO).

7.1 Neuropathic itch

Neuropathic itch, also called "neurologic itch", is primarily initiated, triggered, and/or caused by a lesion or disease to the somatosensory nervous system. There are many subtypes of neuropathic itch.

Neuropathic itch favors a localized or dermatomal distribution. Consequently, it is classified as localized cutaneous pruritus. However, in some cases, neuropathic itch can be generalized resulting from neural sensitization, in which limited nerve damage contributes to the increase in neurotransmitter release and hyperexcitable spinal neurons. Given that neuropathic itch has its origin in nerve damage, it could be characterized by a predominance of nociceptive symptoms (e.g. stinging burning, sunburn‐like sensation, pain, and hurting). However, a recent study has indicated that these nociceptive symptoms are more evident in inflammatory itch rather than neuropathic itch.

The initial treatment approach for neuropathic itch is the removal of the underlying neuropathic cause (e.g. surgery for cervical hernia), if it is treatable. Other treatment approaches include the use of antidepressants and GABAergic drugs. Opioid receptor modulators are reported to alleviate itch in some subsets of neuropathic itch. Antihistamines are typically ineffective.

### Case of autoimmune progesterone dermatitis presenting as fixed drug eruption [^113D1Qdb]. The Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis is a rare disorder that presents as a cyclical cutaneous eruption during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. It typically occurs in women due to an autoimmune phenomenon to endogenous progesterone production. We describe a 34-year-old woman with an erythematous round plaque with blistering, which recurred a few days before her menstrual cycle, at the identical site on the left arm. The diagnosis of autoimmune progesterone dermatitis is made with i.d. skin testing on the affected lesion with progesterone. After the beginning of oral prednisolone (40 mg daily) therapy during menstruation, although slight recurrence appeared, the severity was significantly improved.

7.2.6 Malignant solid tumors

Cutaneous pruritus in patients with solid malignant tumors, which is sometimes referred to as paraneoplastic pruritus, is a relatively rare phenomenon whose pathogenesis remains unclear. Some substances from tumor cells such as IL‐31, paraneoplastic neuropathy, and cancer treatments including radiotherapy may cause itching. When no neuropathic and systemic underlying diseases other than malignant tumors are detected, paraneoplastic pruritus should be considered as a potential diagnosis. Treatments for this itch include antidepressants and removal of tumors.

7.3 Cutaneous pruritus as an adverse drug reaction (drug‐induced pruritus)

Itching has been reported as an adverse drug reaction of various drugs, including opioids and antibiotics (Table 4). This itch is usually generalized and infrequently localized. The precise mechanism underlying drug‐induced pruritus remains unclear but may vary depending on a drug/medication a patient is taking. Some drugs (e.g. chloroquine) act as pruritogens, directly activating sensory nerve fibers, while others (e.g. opiates and dipeptidyl peptidase 4‐inhibitors) involve opioid systems. The diagnosis of drug‐induced pruritus is difficult. When the itching is relieved by the cessation of the culprit drug(s) and recurs upon readministration of these drug(s), the diagnosis of drug‐induced pruritus can be made.

TABLE 4
Medications that may cause drug‐induced pruritus.

7.4 Psychogenic cause

It is estimated that at least 32% of patients with a psychiatric diagnosis complain of itch. Psychiatric disorders associated with cutaneous pruritus include depression, anxiety disorder, obsessive‐compulsive disorder, substance abuse, and delusional infestation. In the absence of a discernible somatic cause even after meticulous examinations for cutaneous pruritus, and when the itching sensation is attributed to a psychiatric disorder (and alleviated by psychotropic drugs and/or psychotherapies when psychiatric approaches are pursued), this itch can be diagnosed as psychogenic itch (also coined functional itch disorder). However, it is imperative that physicians refrain from mislabeling patients with cutaneous pruritus as having "psychogenic" itch.

### Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis and its manifestation as anaphylaxis: a case report and literature review [^115zmiBs]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis is a rare cyclic premenstrual reaction to progesterone produced during the luteal phase of a woman's menstrual cycle with a variety of presentations including erythema multiforme, eczema, urticaria, angioedema, and progesterone-induced anaphylaxis. We present a case of progesterone-induced anaphylaxis and a review of literature focusing on its diagnosis and therapy.

Data Sources

We surveyed all the literature in English back to 1921 when the first case was published. First, we researched the terms progesterone anaphylaxis, autoimmune progesterone dermatitis, cyclic urticaria, using the PubMed resource. Then we included articles found within these publications' reference sections.

Study Selection

We selected articles based on whether the cases described appeared to fit the description of the entity autoimmune progesterone dermatitis. All cases included had dermatologic reactions occurring during the luteal phase of the menstrual period, positive skin or intramuscular reactions to progesterone, and treatment amenable to anovulatory agents and/or hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.

Results

We found approximately 50 published cases of autoimmune progesterone dermatitis, and only nine known cases of its manifestation as anaphylaxis. These cases, including the case described by us, are summarized, and successful diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in the literature are reviewed.

Conclusions

Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis is a rare entity associated with progesterone production of the luteal phase of a woman's menstrual cycle. It can be diagnosed using intradermal or intramuscular progesterone tests and can be treated by disrupting the ovulation cycle using specific medications or by oopherectomy.

### Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis presenting as Stevens-Johnson syndrome [^115oRXBR]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis is an uncommon disease presenting with cyclical skin eruptions corresponding with the menstrual cycle luteal phase. Because symptoms are precipitated by rising progesterone levels, treatment relies on hormone suppression.

Case

A 22-year-old nulligravid woman presented with symptoms mistaken for Stevens-Johnson syndrome. A cyclic recurrence of her symptoms was noted, and the diagnosis of autoimmune progesterone dermatitis was made by an intradermal progesterone challenge. After 48 months, she remained refractory to medical management and definitive surgical treatment with bilateral oophorectomy was performed.

Conclusion

Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis is a challenging diagnosis owing to its rarity and variety of clinical presentations. Treatment centers on suppression of endogenous progesterone and avoidance of exogenous triggers. When these modalities fail, surgical management must be undertaken.

### Progestogen hypersensitivity: an evidence-based approach to diagnosis and management in clinical practice [^116bkMQi]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Heterogeneous presentations of disease pose particular diagnostic and management challenges to the clinician. Progestogen hypersensitivity (PH) classically consists of hypersensitivity symptoms to endogenous progesterone during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. However, with the rise of assisted fertility and the exponential growth in the use of exogenous progestins for contraception, PH's prevalence and symptom heterogeneity have increased. In this article, we focus on the clinical approach to PH diagnosis with an emphasis on key elements of the history, physical, and testing modalities. We also review the current evidence for successful management and treatment across a broad range of patients.

Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis is a rare cyclical disease associated with the luteal phase and can manifest with urticaria, angioedema, and even anaphylaxis; diagnosis can be confirmed through intradermal progesterone testing, although the positive predictive value is not optimal, and serologic testing or intramuscular or oral progesterone challenge might also be used. Case reports suggest successful treatment with conjugated estrogen, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, tamoxifen, and bilateral oophorectomy; estrogen dermatitis with premenstrual flares may be diagnosed by intradermal skin tests to estrogen, and treatment with tamoxifen, bilateral oophorectomy, and progestin has been efficacious in some cases. Skin testing to progesterone preparations can be challenging, and currently there is no consensus on the optimal preparation or concentration for skin testing.

3 ITCH ASSESSMENT TOOLS

Itch is a subjective and multidimensional experience, rendering it challenging to quantify. Moreover, there is currently a dearth of reliable biomarkers or objective tools for evaluating the severity of itch. Consequently, itch should be assessed based primarily on verbal expressions provided by patients. There are several major assessment tools for itch (Table 3).

TABLE 3
Itch assessment tools.

3.1 Numerical rating scale

Patients are asked to rate their itch on an 11‐point Likert score from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating no itch and 10 the worst itch imaginable. The score for itch intensity is provided out of 10, e.g. 7 of 10, or just 7/10. The peak pruritus numerical rating scale (PP‐NRS), also known as the worst itch numerical rating scale (WI‐NRS), represents the individual's worst itch in the past 24 h.

Generally, itch intensity measured with the numerical rating scale (NRS) can be categorized into no itch (NRS, 0), mild itch (NRS, 1–2), moderate itch (NRS, 3–6), severe itch (NRS, 7–8), and very severe itch (NRS, 9–10). Another category is also widely used as: no itch (NRS, 0), mild itch (NRS, 1–3), moderate itch (NRS, 4–6), and severe itch (NRS, 7–10). The PP‐NRS is a widely utilized instrument used in routine dermatological practices and clinical trials. The most appropriate threshold for defining a clinically relevant, within‐person response is reported to be a ≥ 2‐ to 4‐point change in the PP‐NRS.

3.2 Visual analogue scale

The visual analogue scale (VAS) consists of a horizontal 10‐cm line with two end points of 0 (zero, no itch) at the left and 10 (the worst itch imaginable) at the right. Patients are instructed to rate their itch severity from zero to 10 by placing a mark on the line. The score is provided out of 10 (cm) or 100 (mm), e.g. 7.2 out of 10 (cm), or just 7.2/10, as provided in the NRS.

### Progesterone autoimmune dermatitis with positive autologous serum skin test result [^1146QVa2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Progesterone autoimmune dermatitis is a rare disease attributable to hypersensitivity to endogenous progesterone and characterized by cyclic dermatologic manifestations at the end of the luteal phase that disappear some days after menses.

Case

A 35-year-old woman experienced cyclic premenstrual urticaria and angioedema occurring from 4 days before to 5 days after menses. The diagnosis of progesterone autoimmune dermatitis was made by a progesterone-positive skin test. Autologous serum skin test, using sera from estrogenic and luteal phases, also elicited a positive response. The patient became pregnant with near-clearance of the urticaria.

Conclusion

Skin tests with progesterone and autologous serum, which are easy to perform, convenient, and inexpensive, are highly useful for establishing the diagnosis of progesterone autoimmune dermatitis and ruling out other skin disorders.

Treatment

The natural course of PG includes remissions and exacerbations during pregnancy, with characteristic flares during delivery or immediately postpartum resolving spontaneously within 4 weeks. The disease may also flare after abortion. Rarely, the disease recurs during menstruation or with use of oral contraceptives. As the disease may cause fetal complications (such as preterm labor and intrauterine growth retardation), patients should undergo strict dermatological and gynecological follow-up during the entire pregnancy.

Treatment of PG mainly focuses on reducing pruritus and preventing the formation of new blisters. The treatment of choice is high-potency topical glucocorticosteroids and antihistamines. In patients with blistering disorders, non-fluorinated topical glucocorticosteroids are preferable, as the disrupted skin barrier may induce systemic absorption, and non-fluorinated topical glucocorticosteroids are known to cause fewer side effects. If topical glucocorticosteroids are contraindicated or the patient refuses treatment, therapy with calcineurin inhibitors may be introduced on small areas with caution (no more than 5 g/day for 2–3 weeks). As a second-line treatment, short courses of prednisolone up to 0.5 mg/kg/day (preferably < 20 mg/day) should be introduced. If response to treatment is adequate (no new blister formation for 2 weeks), topical and systemic glucocorticosteroids should be slowly tapered to prevent fetus-related side effects. If PG remains refractory to treatment, or prolonged courses of steroids are required, other agents such as intravenous immunoglobulins, dapsone, and azathioprine < 2 mg/kg/day should be considered as steroid-sparing agents. Intravenous immunoglobulins (FDA pregnancy category C) have a good safety profile for the patient and fetus and should be used either in monotherapy or as adjuvant treatment. Dapsone (FDA pregnancy category C) is also considered safe during gestation. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase levels should be measured before initiation. Close blood monitoring with a special emphasis on methemoglobin because of the risk of maternal or neonatal anemia is of utmost significance. Vitamin E 800 U/daily and C 1 g/daily should be supplemented to decrease the risk of potential side effects. More information about the use of azathioprine and its safety profile may be found in Sect. 5.2.4.

Rituximab administered before conception may help to prevent the recurrence of PG in subsequent pregnancies, but rituximab has a long half-life, and patients are advised to avoid pregnancy 12 months after the last infusion. After delivery or abortion, the full spectrum of immunosuppressive agents should be considered.

### The future: critical knowledge about anti-itch therapy [^1114qEmJ]. Dermatologic Therapy (2005). Low credibility.

Itch is an extremely frequent and enervating symptom of many diseases. Current anti-itch therapy, which is based almost exclusively on an "immunocentric" viewpoint, is often unsatisfactory. Recent studies show that this symptom is in fact the result of a complex interplay among skin, nervous system, endocrine system, and immune system. This explains the frequent failure of therapeutic strategies focused only on a single factor and suggests the usefulness of a polypharmacologic symptomatic treatment, designed on a case-by-case basis as a result of a multidisciplinary approach. We discuss the perspectives of anti-itch therapy in light of the new pathogenetic and pharmacologic acquisitions.

### A new era with the development of cytokine-based therapy for pruritus [^111Hgazb]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Pruritus is a common dermatological condition and negatively impacts QOL. Persistent pruritus and excessive scratching behavior can lead to the itch-scratch cycle that exacerbates inflammatory skin diseases. Conventional antipruritic drugs, such as antihistamines, corticosteroids, or anticonvulsants, are sometimes insufficient. Recently, however, molecularly targeted drugs, such as IL-31 or IL-4 receptor-targeting antibodies, have become available or are under clinical trials, dramatically changing the clinical situation. In fact, some of these drugs can improve pruritus without the need for topical steroids. Taken together, these observations point to the importance of cytokine-mediated pruritus, further understanding of which may guide improved therapies.

### Topical anti-itch therapy [^114NRcTQ]. Dermatologic Therapy (2005). Low credibility.

Topical anti-itch therapy could be causative (antiviral, antimycotic, and/or antiparasitic preparations) or symptomatic.

In addition to drugs, the patient should be taught to use emollients and to avoid skin dryness and vasodilatation by contact with irritants. Topical anti-itch preparations can be recommended not only for treatment of localized pruritus, but also for therapy of generalized pruritus when general measures are not effective, systemic drugs are contraindicated, and/or as addition to causative or systemic therapy. Topical anti-itch preparations should be prescribed after the diagnosis is made and used as the first-choice treatment together with general measures.

Introduction

Definition of Neuropathic Itch from Spinal Impingement

Neuropathic itch from spinal impingement is itch without a primary rash caused by spinal impingement, as in brachioradial pruritus (BRP), notalgia paresthetica (NP), and anogenital itch, which are forms of neuropathic itch — defined as the sensation of pruritus that is caused by neural dysfunction at any point along the afferent pathway. This non-dermatological itch is typically chronic in nature and may be accompanied by other abnormal sensory symptoms in a dermatomal distribution, such as paresthesia, hyperesthesia, or hypoesthesia. This sensory combination may lead to feelings more characteristic of pain, such as burning, stinging, or tingling. Another distinguishing feature of neuropathic itch is the potential presence of other forms of neural damage, including motor or autonomic damage. The pruritus may be localized due to compression of a single nerve fiber or generalized due to broader nerve degeneration. Of note, neuropathic pruritus tends to be moderate to severe, with an average itch severity of 6.5–7.8 on a mean numeric rating scale (NRS). This likely contributes to a host of comorbid features that negatively impact quality of life in patients with chronic pruritus, especially depressed mood, disrupted sleep, and strained social relationships.

Epidemiology

Neuropathic itch is a common origin of chronic pruritus, accounting for an estimated 8% of cases in the general population, according to a German database. Epidemiological studies exploring the prevalence and incidence of neuropathic itch are notably lacking in the existing literature. The most common forms of neuropathic itch are BRP, NP, and anogenital itch, albeit there are no detailed epidemiologic data.

Identifying the cause of neuropathic itch can be a convoluted process, and recognizing key epidemiological factors may be a helpful tool in narrowing the potential contributing mechanisms. BRP, for instance, is 2–3 times more commonly seen in white women in the fifth to sixth decades of life. The prevalence of BRP in the general population is unknown, although it is considered to be rare. BRP also appears to be more common in the tropics or subtropics compared with moderate climates or may present with disease flares during the warmer months with remission during cooler periods. The increased prevalence of BRP in regions with high ultraviolet (UV) exposure may relate to sun damage of itch -inhibitory nerve fibers in skin.

### Opioid-induced pruritus: an update [^117QxAyS]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Pruritus is an unpleasant sensation leading to scratching. It can be a feature of numerous skin or systemic diseases, and may also be a side-effect of various drugs. Opioids are one of the best-known medicines evoking pruritus. The pathogenesis of opioid-induced pruritus is still not fully known, but two different mechanisms have been proposed: peripheral and central. Several treatment options have been tested for opioid-induced pruritus, but none has been completely satisfactory. Opioid antagonists seem to be the most potent antipruritic drugs, but they also decrease analgesia, which limits their usage. Many other treatments have been tried, but to date, the data are conflicting or only limited studies have been performed to confirm their efficacy. Further studies are still needed to better elucidate the mechanism of opioid-induced pruritus and to develop more effective treatment options.

Prognosis and Fetal Risks

Fetal prognosis is relatively good. The risks include preterm labor and intrauterine growth retardation and are most probably linked to the severity of the disease itself rather than the treatment. PG is associated with an increased risk of other autoimmune disorders in the pregnant patient, especially Graves disease, which may be explained by the presence of HLA-DR3 and DR4. The disease tends to recur in subsequent pregnancies.

Intrahepatic Cholestasis in Pregnancy

Definition and Epidemiology

ICP is a liver disorder unique to pregnancy and has a reported incidence of 0.3–5.6% and ethnic, geographic, and seasonal variations (clinical case 2). A striking geographic variation is noted, with an incidence as high as 28% especially in patients with overt Araucanian Indian descent. Mutations of ABCB4 (MDR3) involved in the biliary secretion of phospholipids have been studied in ICP and may play an important role, at least in some patients. Diseases associated with ICP include gallstones, hepatitis C infection, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes. ICP is characterized by an inability to excrete bile salts from the liver, which increases serum bile acid concentration, causing pruritus (possibly because of the increased availability of brain opiate receptors) and negatively influences the fetal prognosis. It is a reversible cholestasis that occurs in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (> 30th week). Earlier onset has been sporadically reported.

Pathophysiology and Clinical Characteristics

Potential etiopathogenetic factors include genetic (altered expression of hepatobiliary transport proteins), hormonal (especially estrogen levels), and environmental factors such as seasonal variability and diet. Recent studies have explored the role of alterations in gut microbiota and long-term therapy with vaginal progesterone preparations as potential risk factors for ICP.

Clinical triad characteristics for this disease include severe pruritus, jaundice starting 2–4 weeks after the onset of pruritus, and elevated bile acids. The disease is characterized by elevated serum bile acids in maternal blood (> 10 μmol/l) and abnormal liver function results (mainly serum transaminases). Although the disease is historically linked to jaundice, more recent data have indicated that yellowish or greenish pigmentation of the skin and whites of the eyes is reported in only about 10% of patients. Pruritus classically begins on the palms and soles but may become generalized. Patients present without skin alterations apart from secondary scratch lesions. Pruritus might worsen with the development of the pregnancy. Other symptoms include steatorrhea and dark urine.

### Estrogen dermatitis: case report and examination of estrogen receptor-β in the skin [^1167m8M6]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Many women experience some skin reaction or trouble in their monthly menstrual cycle, including the exacerbation of pre-existing diseases and skin eruptions directly associated with sex hormones. We herein report a Japanese woman who experienced repeated systemic urticaria in her premenstrual period, and was diagnosed as having estrogen dermatitis based on a positive result of intradermal estrogen skin test. Of note, the expression of estrogen receptor-β was increased in small dermal vessels of this case as well as in those of patients with other inflammatory skin diseases. These results suggest that inflammation may induce estrogen receptor-β expression in small dermal vessels, which potentially modifies the pathological skin inflammation during the menstrual period, leading to the development of estrogen dermatitis.

### Clinical aspects and management of chronic itch [^111WKGoK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic pruritus (CP) (ie, itch that persists for more than 6 weeks) poses significant challenges to patients' health and quality of life. It is a common reason for visits to dermatologists and general practitioners and can be caused by a range of conditions, including systemic diseases such as chronic kidney disease or liver diseases, malignancies, neuropathic conditions, and dermatoses such as atopic dermatitis. CP often does not develop in parallel with the course of the disease and can become an entity of its own, which must be treated with antipruritic drugs, even if the underlying cause is already under therapy. Depending on the etiology of CP, different pathways in the pathogenesis have been analyzed recently, following which new treatments have been developed and tested in randomized controlled trials. This article discusses the recent results of these studies and highlights how best to manage health care for patients with CP.

Conclusions

Regardless of the cause, patients with CP will benefit from the continuously increasing armamentarium of novel therapies. To a large extent, the expected progress is based on the flourishing data on CP pathophysiology, but, in the era of evidence-based medicine, another crucial factor (conscientious planning and execution of clinical trials) has to be taken into account. Thereby, therapeutic success, safety and economic issues will be maintained in real-life settings.

Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy — clinical presentation and diagnosis include generalized pruritus most severe in the palms and soles without an accompanying rash with typical onset in the second or third trimester; 80% of women present after 30 weeks of gestation; AST and ALT levels may be elevated, varying from 2-fold to 30-fold higher; because pruritus can precede laboratory abnormalities, if initial testing of total bile acids is normal, repeat testing is indicated, and symptoms and laboratory tests are sufficient to make the diagnosis, with ultrasound (US) used to exclude biliary causes in select cases; because most women without ICP have total bile acids less than 10 μmol, this threshold is frequently considered the upper limit of normal, and there is no consensus on fasting versus postprandial measurement, but in women with ICP, higher levels are detected postprandially.

Itch is propagated by complex mechanisms located both peripherally and within the central nervous system. For decades, novel treatments of itch have been slow to emerge, with the majority of focus on antagonism of histamine. Recently, with a new understanding of the pathophysiology of itch transmission, new treatment strategies have been elucidated. Opiate receptor antagonists, antidepressants, antiepileptics, and thalidomide are currently available therapeutic options that have benefited many patients with variegated sources of itch. In addition, research focused on the neuromediators of itch transmission has led to the development of novel targets for itch reduction and great potential for future therapies.

### Pruritus in pregnancy and its management [^1121GCjN]. Dermatologic Clinics (2018). Low credibility.

Pruritus in pregnancy can be a source of significant discomfort in the pregnant patient. Some cases are associated with pregnancy-specific dermatoses, although some patients experience a flare of a preexisting dermatosis. Severe pruritus may be a manifestation of a pregnancy-specific dermatosis associated with increased fetal risks and complications. Early accurate diagnosis and appropriate management are important. Examination often reveals important clinical findings, aiding accurate diagnosis. Pemphigoid gestationis often presents with periumbilical involvement, whereas polymorphic eruption of pregnancy spares the umbilicus and presents in the striae distensae. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is associated with intense pruritus of the palms.

Management of drug reactions — overview in gynecologic oncology: Virtually all drugs used in oncology can cause adverse drug reactions while being infused and these are classified as infusion or allergic reactions. Infusion reactions are often milder (eg, hot flushing, rash), whereas hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions are often more severe (eg, shortness of breath, generalized hives/itching, changes in blood pressure). Most adverse drug reactions that occur are mild, but severe reactions including anaphylaxis can occur; anaphylaxis is a rare type of very severe allergic reaction that can occur with platinum and taxane agents, can cause cardiovascular collapse, and can be life-threatening. Drug reactions can occur during infusion or after completion, and can even occur days later. In gynecologic oncology, drugs more commonly associated with reactions include carboplatin, cisplatin, docetaxel, liposomal doxorubicin, oxaliplatin, and paclitaxel. Reactions with biotherapeutic agents and taxanes (docetaxel, paclitaxel) tend to be infusion-related and, for taxanes, are often attributed to the excipient (Cremophor EL in paclitaxel, polysorbate 80 in docetaxel) and tend to occur during the first few cycles of treatment, although they can be seen during any infusion. Platinum drug reactions (carboplatin, cisplatin), a true allergy, tend to occur following re-exposure or less commonly at the completion of initial chemotherapy (ie, cycle 6 of a planned 6 treatments).

8 DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES FOR CUTANEOUS PRURITUS

The diagnostic procedures for cutaneous pruritus are shown in Figure 9. The initial step is to ascertain that the presence of primary rash is apparent on the skin. In the absence of pruritic rash, a diagnosis of cutaneous pruritus can be made. In cases where a primary pruritic dermatosis is evident but the appropriate treatment for it does not alleviate the itch, then the possibility of a coexistence of a pruritic dermatosis with cutaneous pruritus should be considered.

FIGURE 9

In the absence of pruritic rash, a diagnosis of cutaneous pruritus can be made, and further examination determines which type of cutaneous pruritus the patient has. CKD‐aP, chronic kidney disease–associated pruritus.

Localized itch is favorably indicative of a neuropathic origin, whereas generalized itch is suggestive of alternative forms of cutaneous pruritus, including cutaneous pruritus with underlying systemic disease(s), drug‐induced itch, psychogenic itch (functional itch disorder), and CPUO. A comprehensive examination for underlying systemic disease(s) is essential for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

Menopause

NICE states that diagnosis of menopause can be made without laboratory investigations in women aged > 45 years who have not menstruated for at least 12 months, excluding women using hormonal contraception or who do not have a uterus. Perimenopause, which can precede menopause by several years, is defined as irregularity of ovulation cycles and menstruation, associated with vasomotor symptoms such as night sweats and hot flushes.

The mean age of menopause is 51.5 years and occurs secondary to depletion of ovarian follicles. Initially, follicle‐stimulating hormone (FSH) levels begin to rise, followed by an increase in the concentration of luteinizing hormone (LH). Progesterone and oestrogen levels then fall, with the latter being associated with irregular menstruation, vasomotor symptoms, vaginal dryness and breast atrophy.

Premature menopause is diagnosed in women aged < 40 years with menopausal symptoms and laboratory tests demonstrating elevated FSH on two occasions 4–6 weeks apart. Most frequently, premature menopause is secondary to ovarian failure, the cause of which is often unknown but can be autoimmune or genetic. Oophorectomy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy can also be associated with premature menopause.

Oestrogen is synthesized from the ovaries and peripheral tissue, including the skin (Fig. 1). In premenopausal women, ovarian synthesis predominates, contrasting with the predominant synthesis from adipose tissue in postmenopausal women. The enzyme aromatase is key in oestrogen synthesis, and is present in many organs, including the skin. Oestrogen acts via two receptors, ER‐α and ER‐β; the latter is seen predominately within the skin, mucosa and hair follicles.

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) refers to the oral, transdermal or vaginal administration of oestrogen, progesterone and/or testosterone to alleviate symptoms and improve bone density. Although generally well tolerated, an increased risk of venous thromboembolism and breast cancer has been associated with HRT.

Drug reactions with gynecologic oncology agents — infusion and allergic reactions can occur during infusion or after completion and with intravenous (IV) or intraperitoneal (IP) administration, and commonly implicated drugs include carboplatin, cisplatin, docetaxel, liposomal doxorubicin, oxaliplatin, and paclitaxel. Mild infusion reactions are common with paclitaxel (27% of patients), whereas allergic reactions are more common with platinum agents such as carboplatin (16% of patients) and tend to occur following re-exposure or less commonly at the completion of initial chemotherapy (ie, cycle 6 of a planned 6 treatments). Symptoms of allergic reactions include rash, edema, shortness of breath (bronchospasm), syncope or pre-syncope, chest pain, tachycardia, generalized hives/itching, changes in blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, chills, changes in bowel function, and occasionally feeling of impending doom, and symptoms may continue to persist after stopping infusion and/or after treatment interventions. Patients at higher risk include those undergoing re-introduction after a period of no exposure and following multiple cycles; those receiving IV rather than oral or IP administration; those with allergies to other drugs; and those who have previously had a reaction. Anaphylaxis is a rare, very severe allergic reaction that can occur with platinum and taxane agents, can cause cardiovascular collapse, can be life-threatening, and life-threatening allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis are distinguished by acute onset, generalized hives, respiratory compromise, and severe hypotension.
