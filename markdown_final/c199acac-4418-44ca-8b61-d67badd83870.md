## Question

Megestrol for acute epiglottitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether megestrol acetate has an appropriate role in the acute management of epiglottitis, and if so, how it compares to corticosteroids and what the evidence and risks are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and standard-of-care priorities in acute epiglottitis as a life-threatening airway emergency. Then, I should verify exactly what megestrol acetate is pharmacologically and what its labeled indications and endocrine effects are. Next, I will review the evidence for systemic corticosteroids in epiglottitis and related upper airway inflammatory syndromes. After that, I should check whether any guideline, trial, or case report supports megestrol for epiglottitis. Finally, I will weigh potential harms of megestrol in this setting and synthesize a clear clinical recommendation with safer, evidence-aligned alternatives [^114wCYm5] [^1167yn4V] [^111oHNpY].

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and priorities. Acute epiglottitis (supraglottitis) is a rapidly progressive, potentially fatal airway emergency characterized by edema and inflammation of the epiglottis and adjacent supraglottic tissues, presenting with severe dysphagia, odynophagia, drooling, muffled voice, and possible respiratory distress; the immediate priority is airway assessment with a low threshold to secure the airway (often with experienced anesthesia/ENT), prompt broad-spectrum IV antibiotics, and ICU-level monitoring, while adjunctive systemic corticosteroids are variably used and remain somewhat controversial in practice [^114wCYm5] [^117Fo9KR] [^1139pgks].

> Wait, let me verify what megestrol acetate actually is before drawing conclusions. Megestrol is a synthetic progestational agent (a progestin), approved for palliative treatment of advanced breast or endometrial carcinoma and for AIDS-related cachexia; it is not a glucocorticoid and does not have reliable anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid activity, though it can unpredictably suppress the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and has been associated with hyperglycemia, Cushingoid features, adrenal insufficiency, and thromboembolic events with chronic use [^1167yn4V] [^114rtFDB] [^1149coJy] [^113LJ88W] [^113Z3BdR]. Hold on, I should verify a common misconception: at first glance one might think "megestrol is a steroid, so it might help", but that would conflate "steroid nucleus" with "corticosteroid function"; megestrol lacks the potent glucocorticoid receptor agonism needed for rapid anti-edema effects in epiglottitis, so the mechanistic rationale is absent [^114rtFDB].

> Next, I should review evidence for systemic corticosteroids in epiglottitis specifically. I need to check high-quality data: a large retrospective cohort of 3,757 patients with epiglottitis requiring airway management found that early systemic corticosteroids at doses equivalent to methylprednisolone ≥ 40 mg within 2 days of admission were associated with significantly lower 30-day in-hospital mortality (0.9% vs 3.1%; weighted OR 0.28), with no difference in 7-day mortality or length of stay and with lower total medical costs, supporting potential benefit in severe cases under careful airway and antimicrobial management [^111oHNpY]. Let me consider indirect evidence as well: for acute sore throat/upper airway mucosal inflammation, multiple systematic reviews and guidelines demonstrate symptomatic benefits from single low-dose corticosteroids, consistent with anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid effects, though these data are not epiglottitis-specific and do not imply substitutability by non-glucocorticoid "steroids" like megestrol [^115rpVFB] [^113GTnrG].

> I will now examine whether any direct evidence supports megestrol in epiglottitis. I should double-check guidelines, reviews, and case series on epiglottitis management: standard discussions consistently emphasize airway control, antibiotics, and sometimes corticosteroids; I can find no guideline, cohort, RCT, or case report recommending or even describing megestrol for epiglottitis — its use is simply absent from epiglottitis management literature, which aligns with the lack of mechanistic plausibility for rapid supraglottic anti-edema effects [^114wCYm5] [^117Fo9KR] [^113ab7Ru]. Hmm, wait a minute — let me reconsider if any atypical reports (e.g., thermal, autoimmune, or EBV-associated epiglottitis) mention progestins; again, the management centers on airway, antimicrobials when indicated, and sometimes glucocorticoids, without any role for megestrol [^113eN26F] [^114exiZG].

> But wait, what if someone argued for megestrol's "steroid-like" effects off-label? Hold on, I should verify the risk profile in an acutely ill patient. Megestrol can suppress the HPA axis unpredictably (risking adrenal insufficiency during critical illness), worsen hyperglycemia in infection, and increase thromboembolic risk — harms that are particularly undesirable in the setting of sepsis or airway compromise, with no credible benefit for reducing acute laryngeal edema; using it could delay definitive care (airway control, antibiotics, and — if chosen — true glucocorticoids) and expose the patient to avoidable risks [^114rtFDB] [^1149coJy] [^113Z3BdR]. I need to ensure we avoid substituting a progestin for a corticosteroid in an airway emergency, given these safety concerns and the absence of efficacy signals [^114wCYm5].

> Synthesis and recommendation: I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Megestrol acetate is not appropriate for acute epiglottitis — wrong drug class, no mechanistic or clinical evidence of benefit, and a meaningful potential for harm; care should focus on airway protection, prompt IV antibiotics (covering typical bacterial etiologies), and consideration of systemic corticosteroids with true glucocorticoid activity in severe cases, as suggested by observational mortality data in epiglottitis [^117Fo9KR] [^114wCYm5] [^111oHNpY]. If corticosteroids are selected, agents such as dexamethasone (e.g., 10 mg IV, with clinical reassessment) or methylprednisolone at anti-inflammatory doses have precedent in practice and align with the available epiglottitis data signal, recognizing that the strongest evidence is retrospective and that airway and antimicrobials remain primary [^111oHNpY] [^117Fo9KR].

> Let me conclude and double-check for any residual ambiguity. The apparent confusion stems from the word "steroid": only corticosteroids with potent glucocorticoid receptor agonism have a plausible and — at least in severe, airway-managed cohorts — observationally supported role in epiglottitis, whereas megestrol is a progestin with endocrine and thromboembolic risks and no role in this acute airway emergency; using megestrol here would be inappropriate and potentially harmful [^114rtFDB] [^111oHNpY] [^114wCYm5].

Megestrol acetate is **not indicated** for acute epiglottitis and should not be used [^116z3xLv] [^1167yn4V]. There is no evidence of benefit for airway edema or inflammation in epiglottitis [^117Fo9KR], and its delayed onset [^11236LF4], oral administration, and risks of thromboembolism, adrenal suppression, and hyperglycemia make it unsafe in an airway emergency [^114rtFDB] [^1149coJy]. Standard care is **airway protection, empiric antibiotics, and corticosteroids** [^113s5yXU] [^111oHNpY]; megestrol acetate is neither recommended nor supported by any guideline or study for epiglottitis [^114wCYm5].

---

## Pharmacological properties of megestrol acetate

Megestrol acetate is a **synthetic progestin** with glucocorticoid activity [^114rtFDB], used to treat cachexia/anorexia in AIDS and cancer [^111CXS3D] and for palliative treatment of advanced breast or endometrial cancer [^116z3xLv] [^11236LF4]. It increases appetite and weight [^111CXS3D] but has a delayed onset (days to weeks) [^117U2LPp] [^113JmpJm], and its oral administration limits its utility in acute settings [^114bc92B].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines for acute epiglottitis management

Acute epiglottitis is a **life-threatening airway emergency** requiring rapid intervention [^117Fo9KR]. Standard management includes:

- **Airway management**: Early assessment [^117Fo9KR] and protection (intubation or tracheostomy) to prevent obstruction [^114wCYm5].

- **Antibiotic therapy**: Empiric IV antibiotics targeting likely pathogens (e.g. ceftriaxone plus vancomycin) [^113s5yXU] [^11113djU].

- **Corticosteroids**: Adjunctive corticosteroids (e.g. dexamethasone) to reduce airway inflammation and edema [^113s5yXU] [^111oHNpY].

No guideline or study supports **megestrol acetate** for acute epiglottitis; its use is not recommended [^117Fo9KR].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of megestrol acetate in acute epiglottitis

Megestrol acetate carries **significant risks** that outweigh any theoretical benefit in acute epiglottitis:

- **Thromboembolic events**: Increased risk of thrombophlebitis and pulmonary embolism, including fatal events [^114rtFDB].

- **Adrenal suppression**: Risk of adrenal insufficiency, especially with chronic use or withdrawal [^117U2LPp].

- **Hyperglycemia**: Exacerbation of diabetes and increased insulin requirements [^1149coJy] [^113Z3BdR].

- **Delayed onset**: Slow onset (days to weeks) unsuitable for acute airway compromise [^11236LF4].

- **Oral administration**: Oral route is impractical in patients with severe dysphagia or airway obstruction risk [^114bc92B].

---

## Comparison with standard corticosteroid therapy

Corticosteroids (e.g. dexamethasone) **are standard adjuncts** in acute epiglottitis [^111oHNpY] due to their rapid anti-inflammatory effects and established safety in acute airway inflammation [^115rpVFB]. In contrast, megestrol acetate has a delayed onset, higher risk profile, and no evidence of efficacy in this context [^111CXS3D] [^114rtFDB].

---

## Clinical scenarios where megestrol acetate might be considered

There are **no clinical scenarios** in which megestrol acetate is appropriate for acute epiglottitis [^117Fo9KR]. Its use is limited to cachexia/anorexia in AIDS or cancer [^111CXS3D] and for palliative treatment of advanced breast or endometrial cancer [^1167yn4V] [^114rtFDB].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

**Megestrol acetate is not indicated for acute epiglottitis** and should not be used [^116z3xLv]. There is no evidence of benefit for airway edema or inflammation, and its delayed onset, oral administration, and significant risks make it inappropriate in an airway emergency [^114rtFDB]. Standard care remains **airway protection, empiric antibiotics, and corticosteroids** [^113s5yXU] [^111oHNpY]; megestrol acetate is not supported by any guideline or study for epiglottitis [^114wCYm5].

### Megestrol acetate [^114rtFDB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Megestrol acetate may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Fertility and reproduction studies with high doses of megestrol acetate have shown a reversible feminizing effect on some male rat fetuses. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant.

Use of megestrol acetate in other types of neoplastic disease is not recommended.

(See also PRECautions, Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility section.)

The glucocorticoid activity of megestrol acetate tablets has not been fully evaluated. Clinical cases of new onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbation of preexisting diabetes mellitus, and overt Cushing's syndrome have been reported in association with the chronic use of megestrol acetate. In addition, clinical cases of adrenal insufficiency have been observed in patients receiving or being withdrawn from chronic megestrol acetate therapy in both stressed and non-stressed states. Furthermore, adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) stimulation testing has revealed the frequent occurrence of asymptomatic pituitary-adrenal suppression in patients treated with chronic megestrol acetate therapy. Therefore, the possibility of adrenal insufficiency should be considered in any patient receiving or being withdrawn from chronic megestrol acetate therapy who presents with symptoms of adrenal insufficiency.

### Corticosteroids for sore throat: A clinical practice guideline [^114oaUZa]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

The linked systematic review reports the effects of corticosteroids when added to standard care in patients with acute sore throat. Figure 1 provides an overview of the number and types of patients included, the study funding, and patient involvement, as well as a summary of the benefits and harms of corticosteroids for treating acute sore throat.

The panel identified eight patient-important outcomes needed to inform the recommendation: complete resolution of pain, time to onset of pain relief, pain severity, need for antibiotics, days missed from school or work, recurrence of symptoms, duration of bad or non-tolerable symptoms, and adverse effects. The included studies reported on all patient-important outcomes, except for the duration of bad or non-tolerable symptoms. Regarding pain, the panel appraised the likelihood of complete resolution of pain at 24 hours and 48 hours, as well as the mean time to complete resolution of pain and the mean time to onset of pain relief.

Although most of the studies (80%) were conducted in emergency departments, they accounted for 54% of all patients enrolled across studies. The remaining 46% were enrolled in studies conducted in primary care settings, and the panel was therefore confident that the evidence was applicable to them as well. Most of the studies focused on adults only (60%). The studies that focused only on children (three studies, 2% of all the patients enrolled in the studies) did not include…

### Phase III, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study of letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, for advanced breast cancer versus megestrol acetate [^111GPX9o]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to compare two doses of letrozole (0.5 mg and 2.5 mg daily) and megestrol acetate (40 mg four times a day) as endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer previously treated with antiestrogens.

This double-blind, randomized, multicenter, multinational study enrolled 602 patients, all of whom were included in the primary analysis. Patients had advanced or metastatic breast cancer with evidence of disease progression while receiving continuous adjuvant antiestrogen therapy, had experienced relapse within 12 months of stopping adjuvant antiestrogen therapy given for at least 6 months, or had experienced disease progression while receiving antiestrogen therapy for advanced disease. Tumors were required to be estrogen receptor- and/or progesterone receptor-positive or of unknown status. The confirmed objective response rate was the primary efficacy variable. Karnofsky Performance Status and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality-of-life assessments were collected for 1 year.

There were no statistically significant differences among the three treatment groups for overall objective tumor response. Patients treated with letrozole 0.5 mg showed improvements in disease progression (P = 0.044) and a decreased risk of treatment failure (P = 0.018) compared to patients treated with megestrol acetate. Letrozole 0.5 mg indicated a trend (P = 0.053) for survival benefit when compared with megestrol acetate. Megestrol acetate was more likely to produce weight gain, dyspnea, and vaginal bleeding.

### Cannabis induced thermal epiglottitis in a pediatric patient [^113eN26F]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Acute epiglottitis is an airway emergency characterized by edema and inflammation of the epiglottis and aryepiglottic folds. Infectious and non-infectious etiologies can cause significant airway injury, presenting with similar clinical symptoms and radiographic findings. While various causes of thermal epiglottitis have been described in pediatric and young adult populations, this report discusses an unusual case involving an adolescent with cannabis-induced thermal epiglottitis.

A 17-year-old, previously healthy, vaccinated male presented to the pediatric emergency department with symptoms of dysphagia, odynophagia, drooling, and a muffled voice, along with fever, tachypnea, and leukocytosis. Lateral plain film imaging and computed tomography (CT) scan revealed significant edema of the epiglottis. A urinary drug screen conducted in the emergency department returned positive results for benzodiazepine, opiates, and cannabinoids. Transnasal flexible laryngoscopy and direct laryngoscopy showed significant erythema, edema, and copious secretions. Cultures of the epiglottis revealed normal oropharyngeal flora. The patient was diagnosed with thermal-induced epiglottitis secondary to cannabinoid use based on the positive substance use history, urinary drug screen, and negative bacterial cultures.

Clinicians must consider thermal injury of the epiglottis due to substance use, specifically marijuana, in vaccinated adolescent patients who present with a positive substance use history, progressive dysphagia, odynophagia, drooling, and a muffled voice. It is imperative to obtain a thorough history and physical examination in such cases.

### Recurrent acute epiglottitis in adults: Defective antibody response [^111Pv8kx]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Recurrent acute epiglottitis is uncommon in adults, and very little is known about the immune status of this population in the medical literature.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the immune system of a group of four adult patients with recurrent acute epiglottitis, representing the largest series ever reported.

- **Methods**: The clinical course of these episodes was carefully evaluated, and a basic immune deficiency work-up was carried out for each patient.

- **Results**: All four patients displayed clinical and laboratory evidence of impaired humoral immunity. One patient was splenectomized, and another patient had a below-normal immunoglobulin G level. At the time of their first evaluation, none of the patients had specific antibodies against Haemophilus influenzae, and one had a subnormal Streptococcus pneumoniae immunoglobulin G level for a majority of serotypes. After specific vaccination, two patients had persistent abnormalities in their response to one or more polysaccharide or conjugate-polysaccharide antigens. In the other two, the transient abnormalities were corrected by immunization.

- **Conclusions**: When recurrent acute epiglottitis occurs in adults, it is important to investigate the immune system because a quantitative or specific antibody deficiency could be found. It also follows that these patients will be successfully treated either by immunization or antibody replacement.

### Epiglottitis as a presentation of leukemia in an adolescent [^1123m7hg]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2014). Low credibility.

Epiglottitis is a life-threatening condition that can occur in both children and adults. Despite a decline in incidence following the introduction of the Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine in 1985, cases continue to emerge among high-risk populations. Notably, in pediatric oncology patients, epiglottitis has been documented after the commencement of chemotherapy. This report highlights the first documented case of epiglottitis as the initial presentation of leukemia in a pediatric patient.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^117TWuXQ]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: The guideline panel and patient involvement followed the BMJ Rapid Recommendations process, where a guideline panel provided critical oversight to the review. They identified populations, subgroups, and outcomes of interest. This panel included clinicians, methodologists, and patients with sore throat experience. Patients received personal training and support to optimize their contributions throughout the guideline development process. They led the interpretation of the results, considering typical patient values, preferences, and variations among patients. Five patient representatives were full members of the guideline panel, contributing to selecting and prioritizing outcomes, values, preferences assessments, and providing critical feedback to the protocol for the systematic review and the BMJ Rapid Recommendations manuscript.

- **Search strategy**: We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for relevant published randomized controlled trials based on the strategy reported in the most recent Cochrane systematic review, which was modified under the guidance of a research librarian. The search was limited from 1 January 2010, including a two-month overlap with the previous Cochrane review search, to 1 May 2017. There were no language restrictions. We reviewed reference lists from eligible new trials and related reviews for additional eligible trials.

Other outcomes

The authors of one study reported a possible decrease in the likelihood of receipt of antibiotics in patients treated with corticosteroids (relative risk 0.83, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 1.13; moderate quality). Three studies suggested a possible lower risk of recurrence/relapse of the symptoms (0.52, 0.16 to 1.73; I² = 23%; moderate quality, Table D in Appendix 3, Table 2).

Kiderman and colleagues reported that 22/40 (55%) patients treated with corticosteroids and 27/39 (69%) taking placebo took time off work because of a sore throat (relative risk 0.8, 95% confidence interval 0.6 to 1.1). Marvez-Valls and colleagues reported that adult patients treated with corticosteroids missed an average of 0.4 (SD 1.4) days, whereas patients in the placebo arm missed an average of 0.7 (SD 1.4) days (mean difference −0.3 days, 95% confidence interval −0.87 to 0.27). None of the trials reported the duration of bad/non-tolerable symptoms.

All studies except one sought information on adverse effects using different methods, including a standardized questionnaire (two studies), open-ended questions or diaries to capture self-reported adverse events (five studies), or a checklist of complications (two studies). Six studies reported no adverse effects, and three studies reported adverse events in both steroid and comparator arms, which were mostly complications related to the disease and occurred with similar frequency in the intervention and control groups.

### Megestrol acetate for treatment of anorexia-cachexia syndrome [^111CXS3D]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). High credibility.

This is an updated version of a previously published review in The Cochrane Library (2005, Issue 2) on 'Megestrol acetate for the treatment of anorexia-cachexia syndrome'. Megestrol acetate (MA) is currently used to improve appetite and to increase weight in cancer-associated anorexia. In 1993, MA was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of anorexia, cachexia, or unexplained weight loss in patients with AIDS. The mechanism by which MA increases appetite is unknown, and its effectiveness for anorexia and cachexia in neoplastic and AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) patients is under investigation.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of MA in palliating anorexia-cachexia syndrome in patients with cancer, AIDS, and other underlying pathologies.

- **Search methods**: We sought studies through an extensive search of electronic databases, journals, reference lists, contact with investigators, and other search strategies outlined in the methods. The most recent search for this update was carried out in May 2012.

- **Selection criteria**: Studies were included in the review if they assessed MA compared to placebo or other drug treatments in randomised controlled trials of patients with a clinical diagnosis of anorexia-cachexia syndrome related to cancer, AIDS, or any other underlying pathology.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two independent review authors conducted data extraction and evaluated methodological quality. We performed quantitative analyses using appetite and quality of life as a dichotomous variable.

### Exemestane [^1157AeFd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In the treatment of advanced breast cancer, the most common adverse reactions included hot flushes (13% vs. 5%), nausea (9% vs. 5%), fatigue (8% vs. 10%), increased sweating (4% vs. 8%), and increased appetite (3% vs. 6%) for exemestane and megestrol acetate, respectively.

Adverse reactions of any cause (from 2% to 5%) reported in the comparative study for patients receiving exemestane tablets 25 mg once daily were fever, generalized weakness, paresthesia, pathological fracture, bronchitis, sinusitis, rash, itching, urinary tract infection, and lymphedema.

Additional adverse reactions of any cause observed in the overall clinical trials program (N = 1,058) in 5% or greater of patients treated with exemestane 25 mg once daily but not in the comparative study included pain at tumor sites (8%), asthenia (6%), and fever (5%). Adverse reactions of any cause reported in 2% to 5% of all patients treated with exemestane 25 mg in the overall clinical trials program but not in the comparative study included chest pain, hypoesthesia, confusion, dyspepsia, arthralgia, back pain, skeletal pain, infection, upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, rhinitis, and alopecia.

- **Post-marketing experience**: The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of exemestane. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to establish a reliable frequency of occurrence or a causal relationship to drug exposure.

### Case report of a 5-year-old with epiglottitis: An atypical presentation of an uncommon disease [^115NaFdV]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Epiglottitis is a rarely encountered infection in pediatrics since the advent of the conjugate Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine first introduced in the United States in 1985. However, the disease remains a much-feared infection in pediatrics. The literature reiterates the importance of early recognition, avoiding agitating the patient, and the need for securing the airway in the operating room as key and essential features for a good outcome. With only 1 case per 200,000 children reported in the United States in 2006, most practitioners have never encountered this infection. This case involves a previously healthy and immunized child who presented to our emergency department and whose condition was ultimately diagnosed as epiglottitis.

### Corticosteroids as standalone or add-on treatment for sore throat [^113GTnrG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Sore throat is a common condition associated with a high rate of antibiotic prescriptions, despite limited evidence for the effectiveness of antibiotics. Corticosteroids may improve symptoms of sore throat by reducing inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. This review is an update to our review published in 2012.

- **Objectives**: To assess the clinical benefit and safety of corticosteroids in reducing the symptoms of sore throat in adults and children.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (Issue 4, 2019), MEDLINE (1966 to 14 May 2019), Embase (1974 to 14 May 2019), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE, 2002 to 2015), and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (inception to 2015). We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared steroids to either placebo or standard care in adults and children (aged over three years) with sore throat. We excluded studies of hospitalised participants, those with infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever), sore throat following tonsillectomy or intubation, or peritonsillar abscess.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: We included one new RCT in this update, for a total of nine trials involving 1319 participants (369 children and 950 adults). In eight trials, participants in both corticosteroid and placebo groups received antibiotics; one trial offered delayed prescription of antibiotics.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^114dQPo6]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to estimate the benefits and harms of using corticosteroids as an adjunct treatment for sore throat. It involved a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Data was sourced from Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), trial registries up to May 2017, and reference lists of eligible trials and related reviews.

Randomized controlled trials were selected that added corticosteroids to standard clinical care for patients aged 5 or older in emergency department and primary care settings, presenting clinical signs of acute tonsillitis, pharyngitis, or the clinical syndrome of sore throat. Inclusion was irrespective of language or publication status.

- **Review methods**: Reviewers independently and in duplicate identified studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of evidence. A parallel guideline committee (BMJ Rapid Recommendation) provided input on the design and interpretation of the systematic review, including selecting outcomes important to patients. A random effects model was used for meta-analyses. The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.

- **Results**: Ten eligible trials enrolled 1,426 individuals. Patients who received a single low dose of corticosteroids, most commonly oral dexamethasone with a maximum dose of 10 mg, were twice as likely to experience pain relief after 24 hours (relative risk 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 4.3; risk difference 12.4%, moderate quality evidence) and 1.5 times more likely to have no pain at 48 hours (1.5, 1.3 to 1.8; risk difference 18.3%).

### Acute epiglottitis as the initial presentation of pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus [^1164dbzf]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2009). Low credibility.

This case study explores a rare instance where acute epiglottitis presented as the initial symptom of pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Acute epiglottitis is primarily an inflammation of the epiglottis, which can lead to life-threatening airway obstruction if not addressed promptly.

In this particular case, the patient exhibited severe symptoms that prompted investigation into underlying causes, eventually leading to a diagnosis of pediatric SLE, a complex autoimmune disease. This paper emphasizes the importance of considering a broad differential diagnosis in cases of acute epiglottitis, particularly when common causes are ruled out, to ensure prompt and appropriate management of underlying conditions such as SLE.

### Sepsis in a patient with acute epiglottitis and respiratory failure [^111QhZue]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

After returning from the CT scan, the patient's condition deteriorated within minutes. The oxygen saturation dropped to about 70% and did not recover even with 10 L of O2 administered via a reservoir mask. Respiratory exhaustion was imminent. While intravenous Solu-Medrol and Co-Amoxicillin were administered, intubation was initiated, which proved to be extremely difficult due to the swelling of the supraglottic soft tissue, although the video-guided GlideScope was used. Consequently, the patient went into hypoxaemia and eventually into cardiac arrest. Reanimation protocol was immediately initiated. Even after direct tracheal airway access failed, another attempt was made to orally intubate the patient, this time with success. After around 5 minutes of mechanical reanimation and a total of 2 mg of intravenous adrenalin, ROSC was achieved. During the course of hospitalization, the initially sampled blood cultures revealed N. meningitidis bacteraemia. The antibiotic regimen was changed from Co-Amoxicillin 2.2 g every 8 hours to ceftriaxone 2 g every 12 hours. Intravenous steroid application was continued.

### Effects of megestrol acetate on weight gain, body composition, and pulmonary function in patients with cystic fibrosis [^1122ouuz]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Malnutrition is a negative prognostic indicator in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and may accentuate pulmonary decline. We tested whether megestrol acetate would have beneficial effects on growth in patients with CF and pancreatic insufficiency.

- **Study design**: We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. All patients were taking replacement enzymes to compensate for pancreatic insufficiency. Patients (n = 17) were randomly assigned to receive either megestrol acetate or placebo.

- **Results**: The treatment group had a significant increase in weight-for-age z scores compared with placebo and reached 100% of their ideal body weight within 3 months of initiating therapy. Weight gain included both fat and fat-free mass. Improved pulmonary function (forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 second) was noted in the treatment group compared with placebo (P < 0.04). Reversible adrenal suppression was observed in the majority of patients who received megestrol acetate.

Short-term use of megestrol acetate results in significant weight gain and improved pulmonary function in malnourished subjects with CF. Our study provides a controlled basis for this intervention, identifies important side effects, and provides the foundation for multiyear, longitudinal trials in a larger number of patients with CF.

### Megestrol acetate stimulates weight gain and ventilation in underweight COPD patients [^1177PkhN]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

To assess the effect of megestrol acetate (MA), a progestational appetite stimulant commonly used in patients with AIDS and cancer, on body weight and composition, respiratory muscle strength, arterial blood gas levels, and subjective perceptions in COPD patients, a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted. This outpatient study took place at 18 different sites.

- **Patients**: The study involved underweight patients who were 40 years or older.

- **Interventions**: Participants were given either an 800 mg/day oral suspension of MA or a placebo, assigned in a 1:1 ratio for a duration of 8 weeks.

The trial randomized 145 patients, of which 63% were men, and 128 participants completed the trial. The results showed that body weight increased by 3.2 kg in the MA group compared to 0.7 kg in the placebo group (p < 0.001). Anthropometric and dual-energy radiograph absorptiometry assessments confirmed that the weight gain was primarily due to increased fat.

Spirometry and maximal voluntary ventilation exhibited no significant changes from baseline in either group, and the difference in the change in maximum inspiratory pressure between groups was not significant. Although the 6-minute walk distances did not statistically differ between groups at week 2 and week 4, the distances were greater in the placebo group at week 8 (p = 0.012). Consistent with the known ability of MA to stimulate ventilation, PaCO(2) levels decreased (4.6 mm Hg, p < 0.001) and PaO(2) levels increased (2.8 mm Hg, p < 0.04) in the MA group.

Questionnaires highlighted an improvement in body image and appetite in the MA group, improvements which were not observed in the placebo group. The frequency and type of adverse events were similar across both groups, though cortisol and testosterone levels were affected.

### Adult epiglottitis: an under-recognized, life-threatening condition [^114wCYm5]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2000). Low credibility.

Epiglottitis in the adult can be fatal and should be treated with the same degree of concern and suspicion regarding airway patency as in children. We present three cases of adult epiglottitis in which the airway was lost prior to or during the intervention of an anaesthetist. We suggest that an emphasis on conservative management is distracting and belies the serious nature of this disease.

### Ebv associated epiglottitis in an immunocompetent child [^113Ff4jq]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Epiglottitis is characterized by the inflammation of the epiglottis and nearby supraglottic tissues, primarily due to infections. Following the introduction of HiB vaccines, a rise in cases caused by new pathogens — including bacteria, viruses, and fungi — has led to a predominance of subacute forms of the condition. Bacterial pathogens remain the most frequently identified cause of epiglottitis. Viral infections may rarely cause epiglottitis or enable bacterial superinfection. Fungal infections are uncommon and typically occur in immunocompromised individuals. In our case, the patient presented with subacute epiglottitis caused by Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection.

Subacute epiglottitis is characterized by progressively worsening sore throat, mild fever, a muffled or hoarse voice, difficulty swallowing, and drooling. Stridor is present in only a few patients, and sudden airway obstruction is less frequent than in acute epiglottitis but still possible. Our patient with EBV-related subacute epiglottitis exhibited many typical signs and symptoms, such as fever, a hoarse voice, difficulty swallowing, and stridor, but did not experience drooling. Unlike acute epiglottitis, where a child might assume the tripod position to improve airway diameter, our patient showed only mild neck extension and did not require intubation. In addition, he had neck lymphadenopathy associated with EBV infection.

### Phase ii trial of alternating courses of megestrol acetate and tamoxifen in advanced endometrial carcinoma: a Gynecologic Oncology Group study [^114B38Uu]. Gynecologic Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to estimate the objective response rate and toxicity associated with alternating megestrol acetate (MA) and tamoxifen citrate (T) in women with endometrial carcinoma. Consenting patients with measurable advanced endometrial carcinoma were eligible if they had not received prior cytotoxic or hormonal treatment. MA 80 mg BID for three weeks alternating with T 20 mg BID for three weeks was administered orally.

Of the 61 patients entered, 56 eligible patients were evaluable for toxicity and response. Fifteen patients responded (12 complete, 3 partial) for an overall response rate of 27% (90% Confidence Interval: 17–38%). In 8 of 15 responders (53%), the response duration exceeded 20 months. The response rate was 38% in patients with histologic grade 1 tumors (n = 16), 24% in those with grade 2 disease (n = 17), and 22% among patients with grade 3 disease (n = 23). Women less than or equal to 60 years old (n = 16) appeared to have a better response rate than those over 60 years (n = 40), 44% versus 20%. The response rate in patients with extra pelvic disease (n = 42) was 31% compared to 14% in those with strictly pelvic and/or vaginal disease (n = 14). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.7 months, and median overall survival was 14.0 months. Two patients experienced a grade 4 thromboembolic event, and additional toxicities included one instance each of grade 3 gastrointestinal, grade 3 neurologic, and grade 3 genitourinary effects.

A regimen of alternating megestrol acetate and tamoxifen is active in treating endometrial cancer and may result in a prolonged response.

### The rising incidence of adult acute epiglottitis and epiglottic abscess [^1133HHch]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine preliminary observations that the incidence of adult acute epiglottitis rose between 1986 and 2000.

- **Materials and methods**: Demographics, annual and seasonal occurrences, clinical presentation, diagnostic procedures, treatment, airway management, and complications of 116 consecutive adult patients with laryngoscopically confirmed acute epiglottitis are presented.

- **Results**: The mean annual incidence of acute epiglottitis per 100,000 adults significantly increased from 0.88 (from 1986–1990) to 2.1 (from 1991–1995) and to 3.1 (from 1996–2000) (P < 0.001). This rise seems to be unrelated to Haemophilus influenzae type b infection but related to miscellaneous pathogenic bacteria. During these periods, the number of epiglottic abscesses increased concomitantly with the rise in the incidence of acute epiglottitis (from 4/14 episodes [29%], to 8/38 [21%], and to 16/66 [24%], respectively), showing a relatively constant ratio between both phenomena (P = 0.843). Twenty-five patients (21%) underwent airway intervention, 16 because of objective respiratory distress and 9 because of imminent respiratory obstruction. Stepwise logistic regression showed that drooling, diabetes mellitus, rapid onset of symptoms, and abscess formation were associated with airway obstruction. Diverse origins for the epiglottic abscess, either from coalescent epiglottic infection or from mucopyocele of the tongue base, are suggested.

- **Conclusions**: A rise in the incidence of acute epiglottitis and a concomitant rise in the number of epiglottic abscesses were established.

### Epiglottitis in the United States: national trends, variances, prognosis, and management [^113ab7Ru]. The Laryngoscope (2010). Low credibility.

To study national trends, variances, and outcomes in patients admitted with epiglottitis in the United States, we hypothesize that the incidence and mortality of epiglottitis have decreased, with a shift toward older patients being admitted.

- **Study design**: Retrospective review of a dataset for the years 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2006.

- **Methods**: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was searched using ICD-9 CM codes for epiglottitis with obstruction (464.30) and without obstruction (464.31). Characteristics studied included patient demographics, hospital information, and admission variables. Weighted admissions were analyzed to facilitate national estimates.

- **Results**: A trend toward decreasing admissions over the study period was observed, from 4,587.17 cases in 1998 to 3,772.49 cases in 2006, with a mean of 4,062.52 cases per year. The mean age of patients with epiglottitis has remained relatively constant at 44.94 years. Admissions are less frequent in the 18 years and younger age cohort, with an increase in patients aged 45 to 64 years and those over 85 years old. The mean length of stay is 4.15 days. The mean total charges for an admission of epiglottitis were $17,204.02 (standard deviation, $5,894), with an increasing trend from $10,738.60 in 1998 to $25,071.62 in 2006. The South had a predominantly higher proportion of epiglottitis admissions. The gender distribution remained consistent.

### An uncommon shape of epiglottis misleading as acute epiglottitis [^115Fb2zy]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

We report a case of a 31-year-old Japanese woman with an uncommon shape of the epiglottis that was misleading as acute epiglottitis. She presented with high fever, arthralgia, general fatigue, and severe throat pain. Laryngeal fiberoscopy showed a markedly swollen epiglottis suggestive of acute epiglottitis, although she displayed no signs of asphyxia. Careful observation and a detailed medical history ruled out acute epiglottitis; however, without clinical discretion, it might have been misinterpreted. She was later diagnosed with Behçet's disease, which is noted to present pharyngeal stenosis. Two years later, a repeat laryngeal fiberoscopy showed the exact same appearance of the epiglottis, suggesting its shape to be permanent. The cause of this misleading shape of the epiglottis in this patient remains unknown. In similar cases, the possibility of this kind of epiglottis should be considered before diagnosing it as acute epiglottitis.

### Factors associated with severe epiglottitis in adults: Analysis of a Japanese inpatient database [^1115QGMw]. The Laryngoscope (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the factors associated with the development of severe epiglottitis in adults to provide information for physicians to make early decisions on airway management.

The research followed a retrospective cohort study design. Adult patients admitted to acute care hospitals with a diagnosis of acute epiglottitis between January 2011 and December 2012 were identified in the Diagnosis Procedure Combination database of Japan. The main outcome measures were: 1) severe epiglottitis requiring airway intervention or resulting in early death within 2 days after admission, and 2) 2-day mortality. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the association between patient characteristics and the development of severe epiglottitis.

A total of 6,072 epiglottitis patients from 599 hospitals were identified. The proportion of patients developing severe epiglottitis was 9.4%, and the 2-day mortality rate was 0.4%. Factors significantly associated with severe epiglottitis included older age, male sex (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.28–2.00; p < 0.05), obesity (body mass index > 25.0 kg/m²; OR 1.31; 95% CI, 1.05–1.63; p = 0.018), diabetes mellitus (OR 1.41; 95% CI, 1.06–1.86; p = 0.017), presence of an epiglottic cyst (OR 2.90; 95% CI, 1.46–5.78; p = 0.002), pneumonia (OR 2.90; 95% CI, 1.73–4.86; p < 0.001), and admission to academic hospitals (OR 1.56; 95% CI, 1.21–2.00; p = 0.001). While epiglottitis-related admissions were more common in summer, seasonality was not significantly associated with severe epiglottitis.

### Randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III surgical adjuvant clinical trial of megestrol acetate (Megace) in selected patients with malignant melanoma [^1159ho9q]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial was performed to assess megestrol acetate (Megace) as a postsurgical adjuvant therapy for patients with locally advanced malignant melanoma. Patients whose tumors were greater than 1.7 mm thick and had no regional lymph node involvement, along with patients with regional lymph node involvement, were randomized to receive either 160 mg twice per day oral suspension of megestrol acetate or placebo. Treatment was administered for a maximum of 2 years or until disease progression.

The study accrued 262 eligible patients. All but two patients were followed until death or a minimum of 4.5 years. Disease progression was documented in 156 patients. Neither progression-free survival (PFS) nor overall survival (OS) was found to differ between the treatments. The median PFS was 2.4 years in the megestrol acetate arm and 2.3 years in the placebo arm. Multivariate analysis revealed a significantly decreased PFS for patients with four or more positive regional lymph nodes and metachronous nodal disease.

Median OS was 5.3 years in the megestrol acetate arm and 3.9 years in the placebo arm. Multivariate analysis revealed that OS was significantly decreased for patients 70 years of age or older with four or more positive lymph nodes. Adjuvant therapy with megestrol acetate oral suspension administered at a dose of 160 mg twice a day for 2 years was not found to be effective in prolonging PFS or OS in patients with surgically resected, locally advanced melanoma.

### Antiemetic activity of megestrol acetate in patients receiving chemotherapy [^115CQqPg]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antiemetic ability of megestrol acetate in patients receiving chemotherapy. Several trials had independently noted that patients receiving megestrol acetate experienced less nausea and vomiting, but this antiemetic activity had not been reported separately in the literature.

Patients receiving chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive either 320 mg of megestrol acetate orally or a placebo before the first day of chemotherapy. On days 1–4, patients received either 320 mg of megestrol acetate orally combined with 3 mg of granisetron intravenously and 20 mg of metoclopramide intramuscularly, or only 3 mg of granisetron intravenously combined with 20 mg of metoclopramide intramuscularly, in a crossover manner during two consecutive cycles. The primary endpoint was the rate of complete protection against both vomiting and moderate-to-severe nausea.

One hundred patients were enrolled in the study. The antiemetic regimen containing megestrol acetate was superior in providing complete protection from nausea and vomiting (45% for the megestrol acetate regimen vs. 17% for the regimen without megestrol acetate). The complete response rate during the acute phase differed between the regimens (85% for the megestrol acetate regimen vs. 72% for the regimen without megestrol acetate). The complete response rate for delayed emesis also differed (49% for the megestrol acetate regimen vs. 18% for the regimen without megestrol acetate). Adverse events were mostly mild to moderate, with no serious drug-related adverse events reported between the two antiemetic regimens.

Megestrol acetate was shown to be an effective antiemetic agent.

### Randomized double-blind clinical trial of combined treatment with megestrol acetate plus celecoxib versus megestrol acetate alone in cachexia-anorexia syndrome induced by GI cancers [^115dujZP]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). High credibility.

Previous studies reported promising efficacy for celecoxib in the treatment of cancer cachexia. We designed this study to test the hypothesis that combination therapy with megestrol acetate (MA) plus celecoxib is superior to MA alone.

- **Methods**: Ninety eligible gastrointestinal cancer patients randomly received either MA 320 mg/day plus placebo (arm 1) or MA 320 mg/day plus celecoxib 200 mg/day (arm 2). Patients were evaluated at baseline, then 1 and 2 months after starting interventions. The primary outcome was body weight. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, grip strength, appetite score, performance status, plasma albumin, CRP, IL-6, and Glasgow Prognostic Score.

- **Results**: Patients were comparable at baseline. Sixty patients were assessable for the first month and 33 patients for the second month. After 2 months, patients in arm 1 (MA + placebo) and arm 2 (MA + celecoxib) experienced 4.0 ± 3.4 and 2.2 ± 3.6 kg of weight gain respectively (P = 0.163). Changes relative to baseline were statistically significant in both arms of the study (P = 0.001). Regarding secondary outcomes, comparisons between groups did not show any statistically significant difference, but within-group changes were significant in both arms of the study.

- **Conclusion**: Since both MA alone and MA plus celecoxib are associated with improvement of cachexia in GI cancer patients, this study failed to show that adding celecoxib (200 mg/day) to megestrol (320 mg/day) could enhance the anti-cachexic effects of megestrol.

### Beware of thermal epiglottitis! A case report describing 'teapot syndrome' [^114exiZG]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Epiglottitis is characterized by inflammation and edema of the epiglottis and adjacent tissue, which can rapidly develop into life-threatening upper airway obstruction. It requires quick diagnosis and medical intervention to protect a patent airway. Clinically, swelling of the epiglottis results in drooling, inspiratory stridor, and signs of respiratory distress. Additional symptomatology can be related to etiology. Traditionally, epiglottitis in children is caused by an infection with *Haemophilus influenzae*. As a result of widespread Hib vaccination, the incidence of epiglottitis in children has fallen. Reported non-infectious causes of epiglottitis include thermal injury, corrosive agents, and foreign body ingestion.

Incidents of burns after ingestion of hot beverages, food, or objects resulting in injury to the respiratory tract have been reported. It is unusual for scald burns to be accompanied by upper airway damage and obstruction, but it has been emphasized in case reports as a complication in the presence of intra-oral damage. We report a case of unexpected thermal epiglottitis following a scald burn with boiling milk resulting in deep burns on the face, neck, chest, arm, and foot, because there was no history of hot milk ingestion or intra-oral damage. The absence of intra-oral damage in our case makes this a unique case report. Written informed consent was obtained from a parent. The case report was written following the CARE guidelines.

### Epiglottic abscess as a complication of acute epiglottitis [^11113djU]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2013). Low credibility.

An epiglottic abscess is considered a life-threatening medical situation that can cause death by obstructing the upper airways. We describe a 58-year-old man who presented to our hospital with a sore throat, dysphagia, and dysphonia.

- **Materials and methods**: A fiberoptic laryngoscope (FOL) demonstrated a beefy red edematous epiglottis with edema extending from the base of the tongue to the aryepiglottic folds and arytenoids. A CT scan showed multiple air bubbles inside the swollen epiglottis, consistent with the diagnosis of a necrotizing epiglottic abscess.

- **Results**: Under local anesthesia, we performed puncture of the abscess at the tip of the epiglottis. He was dismissed 5 days after his admission to the hospital after an improvement was noticed in his condition.

- **Conclusion**: Treatment consists of airway management if needed under anesthesia and drainage of the abscess. IV antibiotics plus corticosteroids should be administered the moment suspicion of epiglottitis is present.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^115rpVFB]. BMJ (2017). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to estimate the benefits and harms of using corticosteroids as an adjunct treatment for sore throat. The design involved a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized control trials. Data sources included Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), trial registries up to May 2017, and reference lists of eligible trials and related reviews.

The study selection focused on randomized controlled trials that examined the addition of corticosteroids to standard clinical care for patients aged 5 or older in emergency department and primary care settings with clinical signs of acute tonsillitis, pharyngitis, or the clinical syndrome of sore throat. Trials were included irrespective of language or publication status.

Review methods involved reviewers identifying studies, extracting data, and assessing the quality of the evidence independently and in duplicate. A parallel guideline committee (BMJ Rapid Recommendation) provided input on the design and interpretation of the systematic review, including the selection of outcomes important to patients. A random effects model was used for meta-analyses, and the quality of evidence was assessed with the GRADE approach.

The results indicated that 10 eligible trials enrolled 1426 individuals. Patients who received a single low dose of corticosteroids (the most common intervention was oral dexamethasone with a maximum dose of 10 mg) were twice as likely to experience pain relief after 24 hours (relative risk 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 4.3; risk difference 12.4%; moderate quality evidence) and 1.5 times more likely to have no pain at 48 hours (1.5, 1.3 to 1.8; risk difference 18.3%; high quality evidence).

### Airway management in pediatric epiglottitis: A national perspective [^111CPZba]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to describe demographics and resource utilization in the treatment of pediatric epiglottitis. This case series was derived from a national database, specifically utilizing the Kids' Inpatient Database to systematically extract data on patients under 19 years old admitted with a diagnosis of epiglottitis and undergoing an airway intervention.

Three hundred forty-two sampled admissions were for epiglottitis; 40 of these patients were under the age of 19 and had an airway intervention, such as intubation or tracheotomy. On average, patients were 4.3 years old (SD = 6.0 years). The average length of stay was 15.6 days (SD = 33.9, range = 0–199) with average total charges of $74,931 (SD = $163,387, range = $3342-$938,512). Multivariate analysis revealed that admission to a children's facility, admission other than via the emergency room, and nonemergent admission were associated with increased total charges. Twenty-two states reported an admission for pediatric epiglottitis that required airway intervention.

In our sample, only 40 patients were identified who were under the age of 19 years and required an airway intervention for the treatment of epiglottitis. Epiglottitis is a rare, expensive, and protracted disease to treat in the post-vaccine era. The unique nature of this disease has implications for training future surgeons on proper management of this potentially fatal disease.

### Sepsis in a patient with acute epiglottitis and respiratory failure [^1139pgks]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Whenever evidence for swelling of the upper airway exists, clinicians should be aware of possibly rapid clinical deterioration. Intubation should be evaluated early, aiming at avoiding complications such as severe hypoxemia. Neisseria meningitidis is a rare cause of epiglottitis/supraglottitis, usually responsive to most recommended antibiotic regimens. Steroid treatment is controversially discussed in the treatment of epiglottitis, but it can be taken into consideration for the clinical presentation of bacterial sepsis as part of sepsis bundle treatment.

### Megestrol acetate [^1175i3xC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

While the precise mechanism by which megestrol acetate produces its antineoplastic effects against endometrial carcinoma is currently unknown, inhibition of pituitary gonadotrophin production and the resultant decrease in estrogen secretion may be contributing factors. There is evidence to suggest a local effect due to the marked changes brought about by directly instilling progestational agents into the endometrial cavity. The antineoplastic action of megestrol acetate on carcinoma of the breast is achieved by modifying the action of other steroid hormones and exerting a direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells.

In metastatic cancer, hormone receptors may be present in some tissues but not others. The receptor mechanism is a cyclic process whereby estrogen produced by the ovaries enters the target cell, forms a complex with the cytoplasmic receptor, and is transported into the cell nucleus. There it induces gene transcription and leads to the alteration of normal cell functions. Pharmacologic doses of megestrol acetate not only decrease the number of hormone-dependent human breast cancer cells but are also capable of modifying and abolishing the stimulatory effects of estrogen on these cells. It has been suggested that progestins may inhibit through one of two ways: by interfering with either the stability, availability, or turnover of the estrogen receptor complex in its interaction with genes; or, in conjunction with the progestin receptor complex, by interacting directly with the genome to turn off specific estrogen-responsive genes.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^116TQneZ]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

- **Considerable heterogeneity**: I² = 69%. Not rated down because clinical inconsistency was deemed not important as all results of included studies have similar clinical implications.

- **Confidence intervals**: Limits of confidence interval suggest a small benefit in one extreme and a benefit important to patients in the other. Because imprecision is linked to inconsistency, certainty of evidence was rated down by only one level.
	- Publication bias was not tested because of the small number of studies.
	- Not rated down for risk of bias as one of three trials was judged to be at high risk of bias from missing participant data.
	- Confidence interval suggests that corticosteroids increase the chance of recurrence of symptoms in one extreme but decrease this chance in the other extreme.
	- Confidence interval suggests that corticosteroids could largely reduce the chance of taking antibiotics in one extreme but could slightly increase the chance in the other extreme.
	- Not rated down for risk of bias as an equal number of trials were judged to be at high and low risk of bias, but the P value for the test of interaction showed no difference between two estimates.

- **Clinical and statistical inconsistency**: Large unexplained clinical and statistical inconsistency. Confidence interval suggests a small benefit in one extreme and a benefit that some patients might consider important in the other extreme. As this imprecision was a result of inconsistency, certainty of evidence was rated down by only one level. Confidence interval suggests a trivial benefit in one extreme and a benefit that would be considered important by most patients in the other extreme.

Megestrol acetate (MA) is currently used to improve appetite and increase weight in cancer-associated anorexia. In 1993, MA was approved by the United States's Federal Drug Administration for the treatment of anorexia, cachexia, or unexplained weight loss in patients with AIDS. The mechanism by which MA increases appetite is unknown, and its effectiveness for anorexia and cachexia in neoplastic and AIDS patients is under investigation.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of MA in palliating anorexia-cachexia syndrome in patients with cancer, AIDS, and other underlying pathologies.

- **Search strategy**: Studies were sought through an extensive search of electronic databases, journals, reference lists, contact with investigators, and other search strategies outlined in the methods. The most recent search was carried out in October 2002.

- **Selection criteria**: Studies were included in the review if they assessed megestrol acetate compared to placebo or other drug treatments in randomized controlled trials of patients with a clinical diagnosis of anorexia-cachexia related to cancer, AIDS, or another underlying pathology.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data extraction was conducted by two independent authors, and methodological quality was evaluated. Quantitative analyses were performed using appetite and quality of life as dichotomous variables, and weight gain was analyzed as continuous and dichotomous variables. Studies with more than 50% of patients lost to follow-up were excluded from the analysis.

- **Main results**: Thirty trials met the inclusion criteria.

### Ebv associated epiglottitis in an immunocompetent child [^116k3FfH]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

The patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit due to respiratory distress. He was started on maintenance intravenous fluids and oxygen therapy via nasal cannula. Ceftriaxone and vancomycin were also initiated for empiric antimicrobial coverage. However, after 48 hours, these medications were discontinued based on the CT report, which indicated the absence of abscess formation, alongside a negative blood culture and positive serology for EBV infection. He was under continuous surveillance, and fortunately, he did not need intubation. His respiratory distress improved with supportive care.

On hospital day two, the patient's vital signs had improved, and he defervesced. He was discharged on hospital day four in stable condition.

Contrast-enhanced CT images revealed at the level of the epiglottis an edematous and thickened epiglottis (red arrow), with no evidence of retropharyngeal or peritonsillar abscess formation.

### Prophylactic treatment for delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting after non-AC based moderately emetogenic chemotherapy: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^112eFecB]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

The antiemetic potential of megestrol acetate was assessed in one trial in a small population receiving chemotherapy with mixed emetogenicity. The authors reported highly significant complete response (CR) rates for non-AC, moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC)-treated patients when megestrol acetate was compared to placebo. All patients received granisetron and metoclopramide, but corticosteroids were not allowed. Subgroup analysis for MEC contained both AC and non-AC regimens, which could influence the results. Megestrol acetate should be compared in future trials with standard antiemetics.

There are some limitations of this review. Data of the included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) could not be synthesized because of the heterogeneity of antiemetic regimens, patient populations, and variance of primary outcomes. AC and non-AC MEC were often combined in subgroup analyses, making it hard to draw firm conclusions for non-AC MEC regimens.

We conclude that high-level evidence for optimal prophylaxis of delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) after non-AC MEC is lacking. We believe that further research is essential to improve antiemetic treatment efficacy and outcome while minimizing and accepting treatment (dexamethasone)-related toxicities.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^115SB7kD]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

Reviewers independently and in duplicate screened the titles and abstracts of all identified studies using a priori selection criteria. Subsequently, the same reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of the full texts of potentially eligible studies. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion or, if needed, by adjudication from a third reviewer.

We included randomized controlled trials that compared corticosteroids with the standard of care or placebo and enrolled adults and/or children aged 5 and over in emergency departments and primary care settings with a clinical syndrome of sore throat (painful throat, odynophagia, or pharyngitis).

Studies of participants admitted to the hospital, those who were immunocompromised, and those with infectious mononucleosis, sore throat after any surgery or intubation (postoperative sore throat), gastroesophageal reflux disease, croup, or peritonsillar abscess were excluded. We also excluded studies enrolling children aged under 5 because they would not be able to provide trustworthy outcome measurements, especially for self-reported pain.

Our outcomes of interest were:

- **Complete resolution of pain at 24 and 48 hours**
- **Mean time to onset of pain relief**
- **Mean time to complete resolution of pain**
- **Absolute reduction of pain at 24 hours**
- **Duration of bad/non-tolerable symptoms**: Such as problems eating, drinking, or swallowing
- **Recurrence/relapse of symptoms**
- **Days missed from school or work**
- **Need for antibiotics**
- **Rate of adverse events related to treatment**: We included any adverse events reported by the studies.

### Association between systemic corticosteroid use and mortality in patients with epiglottitis [^111oHNpY]. The Laryngoscope (2023). High credibility.

The study aimed to determine if treatment with systemic corticosteroids at a specific dose improves outcomes in patients with epiglottitis requiring airway management, such as tracheotomy or airway intubation.

- **Methods**: This retrospective cohort study utilized a nationwide inpatient database, examining patients hospitalized for epiglottitis requiring airway management between July 2010 and March 2019. Patients treated with systemic corticosteroids equivalent to methylprednisolone ≥ 40mg within two days of admission were compared to those not treated with corticosteroids in the same timeframe. The comparison was adjusted using inverse probability of treatment weighting with a covariate balancing propensity score. Primary outcome measures focused on all-cause 30-day in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included all-cause 7-day in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay, and total medical cost.

- **Results**: Of the total 3757 patients, 1986 were in the corticosteroid group, and 1771 were in the control group. There were 72 deaths (1.9%) within 30 days of admission: 17 among the corticosteroid group (0.9%) and 55 from the control group (3.1%) [weighted odds ratio, 0.28; 95% confidence interval, 0.11–0.70; weighted risk difference, -2.2%; -3.2% to -1.3%]. Corticosteroid treatment was associated with lower total medical costs [weighted median, $6,187 vs. $6,587; weighted difference, $-1,123; -2,238 to -8], but not with differences in all-cause 7-day in-hospital mortality [weighted odds ratio, 0.63; 0.22–1.82; weighted risk difference, -0.3%; -0.9 to 0.2] or length of hospital stay.

### The effects of megestrol acetate suspension for elderly patients with reduced appetite after hospitalization: a phase II randomized clinical trial [^117U2LPp]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2005). High credibility.

To provide preliminary evidence on the effectiveness and optimal dosage of megestrol acetate for older persons with impaired appetite after hospitalization, a randomized clinical trial was conducted.

- **Setting**: The study took place in an acute care hospital.

- **Participants**: Forty-seven older persons (mean age 83) who were recently discharged from an acute care hospital and had fair or poor appetite were included.

- **Intervention**: Participants were randomized to receive either a placebo or megestrol acetate suspension at doses of 200 mg, 400 mg, or 800 mg daily for 9 weeks.

- **Measurements**: Appetite, health-related quality of life, and adverse effects were measured at baseline and at 20, 42, and 63 days. Serum nutritional markers were measured at baseline, and then again at 20 and 63 days.

- **Results**: During the study, there were no significant differences between treatment groups on any of the appetite questions. However, participants in the 400-mg and 800-mg groups showed significant improvement from baseline on some questions. At 20 days, prealbumin levels increased in a dose-response relationship across the four groups (by 0.4, 5.1, 7.5, and 9.0 mg/dL, respectively). Participants in the 400-mg and 800-mg groups demonstrated greater improvement in prealbumin levels at 20 days than those receiving placebo (P = 0.009 and P = 0.004, respectively). Additionally, those in the 400-mg group showed improvement at 63 days (P = 0.02). At 20 days, no participant taking placebo had a morning serum cortisol level less than 8 ng/mL (the lower limit of normal). In contrast, 33%, 70%, and 78% of those taking 200 mg, 400 mg, and 800 mg, respectively, had values below this level.

### Role of steroids in acute phonotrauma: A basic science investigation [^112Yx87h]. The Laryngoscope (2014). High credibility.

Steroids are used for the treatment of laryngitis in vocal performers and other individuals despite the absence of evidence demonstrating their impact on vocal fold inflammation. Our objective was to examine laryngeal secretion cytokine inflammatory profile changes associated with corticosteroid treatment in a human phonotrauma model.

- **Study design**: Prospective, individual, randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial.

- **Methods**: Participants included 10 healthy females who were randomized to either treatment with oral hydrocortisone or placebo, each given in three doses over 20 hours after the experimental induction of acute phonotrauma. Cytokines associated with inflammation and healing (interleukin [IL]-1β, IL-6, IL-10) were measured in laryngeal secretions before and after vocal loading and at 4 and 20 hours after treatment.

- **Results**: Proinflammatory mediators IL-1β and IL-6 were doubled in the controls versus the steroid treatment group at 21 hours following induction of acute vocal fold inflammation. Anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 showed a 6.3-fold increase in the steroid treatment group versus the controls, indicating anti-inflammatory modulation by steroid treatment.

- **Conclusions**: This study provides biologic evidence supporting the use of steroids for acute vocal fold inflammation associated with phonotrauma.

- **Level of evidence**: 1b.

### Entocortec [^1166x23g]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2009). Low credibility.

Reports of acute toxicity and/or death following overdosage of glucocorticosteroids are rare. Treatment consists of immediate gastric lavage or emesis, followed by supportive and symptomatic therapy.

If glucocorticosteroids are used at excessive doses for prolonged periods, systemic effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may occur. In cases of chronic overdosage, where severe disease requires continuous steroid therapy, the dosage may be reduced temporarily.

Single oral doses of 200 mg/kg in female mice and 400 mg/kg in male mice were lethal. The signs of acute toxicity included decreased motor activity, piloerection, and generalized edema.

### Is megestrol acetate a suitable option for treatment of hot flashes in women with breast cancer [^111r7DMh]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Chemotherapy for breast cancer is associated with the development of hot flashes, which can cause the patient considerable discomfort. Estrogen replacement therapy alleviates the number and severity of hot flashes but is contraindicated in such cases. Therefore, alternative methods to treat hot flashes are urgently needed. Goodwin et al. conducted a 6-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of megestrol acetate in 286 women with breast cancer. After 3 months, 65% of the patients receiving 20 mg of megestrol acetate daily achieved an appreciable reduction in the number of hot flashes (≥ 75% from baseline), compared with 48% in the 40 mg megestrol acetate group and 14% in the placebo group. The positive effects of megestrol acetate on hot flash frequency were maintained at 6 months. In this practice point commentary, I discuss the key findings of Goodwin et al. and place them into clinical context, highlighting the need for additional studies of hormonal therapies in women with breast cancer.

### Megestrol and tamoxifen in patients with advanced endometrial cancer: An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study (E4882) [^115ichY3]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of adding tamoxifen to megestrol in hormonal therapy for advanced endometrial cancer. A total of 66 patients were initially enrolled. From October 1982 to October 1984, 41 patients were randomized to receive either standard progestin therapy with megestrol or a combination of megestrol and tamoxifen. Due to poor accrual, the megestrol arm was terminated, and 25 patients were directly assigned to the combination arm.

Among the 20 eligible cases in the megestrol arm, the response rate was 20%, consisting of 1 complete response and 3 partial responses. In the megestrol plus tamoxifen arm, the response rate was 19%, with 1 (2%) complete response and 7 (17%) partial responses among 42 eligible cases. The median survival times were 12.0 months for the megestrol arm and 8.6 months for the combination arm.

- **Toxicity**: Only mild and moderate toxicities were observed in the megestrol arm, whereas more severe complications, including a life-threatening case of pulmonary embolism, were noted in the combination arm.

The study concluded that the combination of megestrol and tamoxifen offers no clinical advantage over megestrol alone in the treatment of advanced endometrial carcinoma, as it could not perform the intended comparative evaluation.

### Supportive use of megestrol acetate (Megace) with head/neck and lung cancer patients receiving radiation therapy [^114znxbJ]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to measure the effect of megestrol acetate (MA) on weight loss and quality of life (QOL) in patients with cancer of the lung or head and neck undergoing curative radiation therapy.

- **Methods and materials**: This was a Phase III, placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized study. Patients received either 800 mg/day of MA (20 milliliters po qAM) or placebo over a 12-week period. Patients received radiation of the head and neck or thorax using a dose of at least 50 Gy, either alone or with chemotherapy. Weight was assessed weekly, whereas QOL was assessed at baseline and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks.

- **Results**: Patient characteristics on the MA arm (16 lung, 12 head/neck; mean age: 60 years) were similar to those on the placebo arm (17 lung, 11 head/neck; mean age: 65.8 years). Patients in the MA group had a mean weight loss over 12 weeks of 2.7 pounds, whereas the placebo group had a mean weight loss of 10.6 pounds. There was a significant time by treatment interaction (p = 0.001), with the difference in weight between treatment groups being most pronounced after 6 weeks. Although overall QOL was similar in both arms of the study, several QOL subscale items did differ significantly. Compared to the placebo-treated patients, head-and-neck cancer patients in the MA arm reported the ability to eat as much as they liked (p = 0.02 at 12 weeks), and lung cancer patients in the MA arm reported significantly better appetite at 4 weeks (p = 0.03) and 8 weeks (p = 0.001).

- **Conclusion**: MA used prophylactically is useful as an appetite stimulant; it can help.

### An update on inflammatory disorders of the pediatric airway: epiglottitis, croup, and tracheitis [^111sKL4o]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2001). Low credibility.

Acute infections of the respiratory tract are common in pediatric patients. Respiratory disease is the leading cause of hospitalization in children less than 4 years of age and is responsible for many physicians' office and emergency department visits. The severity of upper respiratory tract infection ranges from mild, self-limited disease to potentially life-threatening airway obstruction. The prepared clinician can often make a diagnosis based solely on the history and physical examination, using radiographs and laboratory examinations to aid in diagnosis when the clinical picture is unclear. At times, airway collapse is imminent, and the clinician must proceed directly to endoscopy for definitive diagnosis and airway protection. This article will discuss the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and management of epiglottitis, croup, and bacterial tracheitis in the pediatric population.

### EBV associated epiglottitis in an immunocompetent child [^1122pVxn]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Since the introduction of HiB vaccines in 1985, the yearly occurrence of epiglottitis in children has significantly decreased. Other organisms, such as various bacterial pathogens found in the oropharynx and nasopharynx, have been involved. Moreover, there are rare instances of epiglottitis caused by viruses and fungi. EBV infection has been reported as the cause of acute epiglottitis in an immunocompetent pediatric patient in only one case report.

In this case report, we describe the first case of subacute epiglottitis caused by EBV in a healthy pediatric patient, which is a very rare cause of this condition.

### Comparing megestrol acetate therapy with oxandrolone therapy for HIV-related weight loss: similar results in 2 months [^113JmpJm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Weight loss is known to impact survival among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) even in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In a randomized trial, we compared the effects of 2 months of treatment with either megestrol acetate (800 mg every day) or oxandrolone (10 mg twice per day) on body weight and composition in patients with weight loss of ≥ 5 kg who were receiving HAART. The mean weight was 66 kg, and the mean body mass index was 21.

- **Mean weight gain**: In the megestrol acetate and the oxandrolone arms, the weight gains were 2.8 kg (4.6% of the baseline value) and 2.5 kg (3.9% of the baseline value), respectively. The P-value was .80. Lean body mass accounted for 39% of weight gain in the megestrol acetate arm and 56% in the oxandrolone arm (P = 0.38). Seven patients in the megestrol acetate arm and 5 patients in the oxandrolone arm reported minor adverse events (P = 0.74).

In conclusion, megestrol acetate therapy and oxandrolone therapy have similar effects on body weight and composition and are safe and well-tolerated during HAART.

### What is the role of the larynx in adult obstructive sleep apnea [^111v9QB4]. The Laryngoscope (2014). Low credibility.

To examine the body of literature supporting the role of the larynx in adult obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a PubMed search was conducted using medical subject headings "larynx" and "obstructive sleep apnea". Original articles in English related to adult patients were initially included, and the bibliographies of pertinent articles were hand-searched for additional articles.

A total of 17 articles were included in the review in the following subgroups: neuromuscular role of the larynx (n = 3), anatomic contribution of the larynx to OSA (n = 7), and special populations (n = 7). The sensory component of the superior laryngeal nerve plays a critical role in airway patency during sleep, and patients with OSA have increased endolaryngeal sensory thresholds compared to controls. Primary epiglottic obstruction in the hypopharynx represents 15% of patients with OSA unable to tolerate continuous positive airway pressure. Head and neck cancer and multiple system atrophy are two entities with high rates of OSA due in part to laryngeal abnormalities.

The endolarynx warrants consideration in the pathophysiology of OSA, particularly as it relates to sensory dysfunction and epiglottic obstruction. Patients with head and neck cancer of the laryngopharynx are at significant risk of OSA. Further research is needed to better understand and heighten awareness of the intimate role that the larynx may play in OSA.

### Tenderness over the hyoid bone can indicate epiglottitis in adults [^114cwHKr]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Adult acute epiglottitis is a rare but life-threatening disease caused by obstruction of the airway. The symptoms and signs of this disease may be nonspecific without apparent airway compromise. We encountered three consecutive cases of adult patients with this disease in a single five-month period in one physician's office. In all cases, physical examination revealed tenderness of the anterior neck over the hyoid bone. These observations assisted us in identifying this rare disease quickly. We suggest that tenderness over the hyoid bone should raise suspicion of adult acute epiglottitis.

### Does megestrol acetate down-regulate interleukin-6 in patients with cancer-associated anorexia and weight loss? A North Central Cancer Treatment Group investigation [^111XHCZE]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Megestrol acetate improves appetite and mitigates weight loss in some patients with advanced cancer. Preliminary studies suggest that progestational agents may down-regulate interleukin-6 (IL-6), an inflammatory cytokine implicated in cancer-associated anorexia and weight loss. The present investigation examined the effects of megestrol acetate on IL-6 to confirm these early findings.

This study, a translational component of a large multi-institutional trial, examined 85 patients with advanced cancer experiencing weight loss. Patients were randomly assigned to receive megestrol acetate liquid suspension (800 mg/day) with placebo tablets, oral dronabinol tablets (2.5 mg b.i.d.) with liquid placebo, or both agents. Other evaluations included serial physician-reported weight and patient-reported appetite and global quality of life.

We found no significant differences in one-month changes in serum IL-6 based on treatment with megestrol acetate, dronabinol, or their combination, with mean differences ± standard deviation of -1.52 ± 4.7 pg/ml, -0.62 ± 3.5 pg/ml, and -0.2 ± 3.1 pg/ml, respectively (P = 0.40, by one-way ANOVA). Among patients reporting appetite alterations over one month, no significant changes in IL-6 were noted. Finally, changes in serum IL-6 were not associated with shifts in weight or global quality of life. Our investigation provides no evidence that megestrol acetate down-regulates IL-6 in patients with cancer-associated anorexia and weight loss.

### Emergency evaluation and management of the sore throat [^113s5yXU]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Although a sore throat is a very common complaint in the emergency department and is often associated with benign conditions, such as pharyngitis, it can indicate the early onset of something much more serious and even life-threatening. A thorough history and examination are vital for the correct diagnosis, but a high index of suspicion must be maintained to diagnose less common yet serious pathologies, such as epiglottitis and retropharyngeal abscess. Airway management is paramount to survival, and aggressive measures should be undertaken early when considering epiglottitis.

### High risk and low prevalence diseases: Adult epiglottitis [^117Fo9KR]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Adult epiglottitis is a serious condition that carries a high rate of morbidity and even mortality due to airway occlusion. This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of epiglottitis in adult patients, including diagnosis, initial resuscitation, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on evidence.

Epiglottitis is a life-threatening emergency that occurs more commonly in adults in the medical era with vaccinations. Children present more commonly with acute respiratory distress and fever, while adults most commonly present with severe dysphagia in a subacute manner. Other symptoms may include drooling, muffled voice, and dyspnea. Streptococcus and Staphylococcus bacteria are the most common etiologies, but others include viral, fungal, caustic, thermal injuries, and autoimmune. Lateral neck radiographs assist in diagnosis, but they may be falsely negative. Visualization of the epiglottis is the key to diagnosis.

- **Airway assessment and management**: This has transitioned from direct laryngoscopy to flexible intubating endoscopy and video laryngoscopy with assistance from anesthesia and/or otolaryngology if available. Along with airway assessment, antibiotics should be administered. Corticosteroids and nebulized epinephrine are controversial but should be considered. Patients should be admitted to the intensive care setting for close airway observation or ventilatory management if intubated.

An understanding of epiglottitis can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this critical condition effectively.
