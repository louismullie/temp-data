## Question

Atrial fibrillation secondary to infection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about atrial fibrillation secondary to infection, including mechanisms, epidemiology, outcomes, and management with anticoagulation, rate/rhythm control, and follow-up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining infection-related AF and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify incidence across infection contexts and patient populations. Next, I will examine short- and long-term outcomes, including recurrence, stroke, heart failure, and mortality. After that, I need to appraise the evidence for anticoagulation and reconcile conflicting data. Then, I will review acute management principles for rate versus rhythm control and special situations like COVID-19. Finally, I should synthesize guideline-aligned recommendations and a practical follow-up plan, while double-checking areas of uncertainty and noting knowledge gaps.

> Let me first confirm the definition and mechanisms. Infection-related AF is new-onset AF occurring in the setting of an acute infection such as pneumonia, sepsis, or COVID-19, and it is classically attributed to systemic inflammation, autonomic dysregulation, hypoxia, electrolyte disturbances, and direct myocardial effects, which together create a proarrhythmic milieu and may unmask an underlying AF substrate rather than represent a purely transient phenomenon [^111NiXF7] [^114JsNzq] [^114TTtUk].

> I need to check the epidemiology carefully. In pneumonia cohorts, new-onset AF occurs in roughly 4.7% to 9.5% of hospitalized patients, and in sepsis the incidence ranges from about 5% to 25%, with higher rates in ICU and septic shock. COVID-19 cohorts show AF/AFL in approximately 10% overall and about 4% new-onset, with markedly higher rates in ICU populations, consistent with systemic inflammatory stress as a driver [^115psChH] [^111Axbg9] [^113Ea91G] [^112mbXj4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about prognosis. I should confirm recurrence and long-term risks. Large registry data show that about one-third of patients with infection-related AF have recurrent AF within 3 years, and 5-year recurrence approximates 41% to 62% depending on cohort and precipitant, indicating substantial long-term AF burden despite initial resolution of infection [^112M6s3P] [^114JsNzq] [^115jHrx5].

> Next, I should review thromboembolic risk. In pneumonia-related AF not receiving anticoagulation, the 1-year absolute stroke risk is about 2.1% overall, 1.4% in intermediate CHA2DS2-VASc strata, and 2.8% in high-risk strata, with 3-year risks of 3.5% and 5.3% respectively. These figures exceed commonly cited thresholds for net clinical benefit of oral anticoagulation, and infection-related AF confers higher thromboembolic risk than AF without concurrent infection in matched analyses [^112M6s3P] [^115wZyXs] [^114zLtvL].

> I will now examine heart failure and mortality signals. New-onset AF during infection is associated with higher in-hospital mortality and longer length of stay, and in longer-term follow-up, sepsis-associated new-onset AF predicts increased risks of heart failure hospitalization, ischemic stroke, and death compared with sepsis without AF. Similar adverse associations are seen in COVID-19 cohorts with AF, reinforcing that AF during infection is a marker of severity and a contributor to poor outcomes [^113xZoCQ] [^115QGBPA] [^111RWvFZ].

> Wait, let me verify the anticoagulation evidence because this is contentious. Observational data suggest that among patients with infection-related AF, oral anticoagulation reduces thromboembolic events to a similar relative extent as in non–infection-related AF, and absolute risk estimates in higher-risk strata cross conventional benefit thresholds; however, during active sepsis, parenteral anticoagulation has not reduced stroke and increased bleeding in a large retrospective cohort, and guidelines rate the benefit of anticoagulation during critical illness as uncertain, so timing and patient selection are crucial [^114zLtvL] [^115wZyXs] [^112D1vyn] [^111QusLS].

> Let me consider practical anticoagulation decisions. I should confirm that contemporary guidance advises counseling on high recurrence risk after acute illness, outpatient thromboembolic risk stratification with CHA₂DS₂-VASc, and consideration of oral anticoagulation in those with elevated scores; for COVID-19 specifically, expert guidance suggests considering therapeutic anticoagulation for hospitalized patients with new-onset AF irrespective of CHA₂DS₂-VASc, with transition to long-term OAC if the score is at least 1 in men or 2 in women, balancing bleeding risk and clinical context [^111QusLS] [^115vebH5].

> I need to ensure acute management principles are sound. In hemodynamically unstable patients, urgent electrical cardioversion is appropriate; in stable patients, prioritize rate control with beta-blockers as first-line when tolerated, consider calcium channel blockers if beta-blockers are contraindicated, and reserve amiodarone for refractory cases or when rhythm control is specifically indicated; in sepsis, beta-blockers may achieve rate control more rapidly than amiodarone or digoxin in some cohorts, though selection should be individualized to hemodynamics and comorbidities [^115TCGPH] [^113DtqfB] [^112LTDvz].

> But wait, what about COVID-19-specific drug interactions. I should double-check that anticoagulants and antiarrhythmics interact with COVID-19 therapies via CYP and P-gp pathways, so dose adjustments, QT monitoring, and avoidance of harmful combinations are essential; practical guidance emphasizes vigilance for bradyarrhythmias, QT prolongation, and bleeding when combining therapies like azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, or protease inhibitors with OACs or class III agents [^1165k1Xh] [^112y23UD].

> Next, I should review follow-up and surveillance. Guidelines recommend structured outpatient follow-up to reassess stroke risk and rhythm status, with consideration of intermittent or ambulatory ECG monitoring given high recurrence rates. Integrated AF care pathways that address risk factors, stroke prevention, rate/rhythm strategies, and patient education improve longitudinal outcomes and are particularly relevant after infection-related AF [^111QusLS] [^116LDSyr] [^111xAZtD].

> Let me synthesize the clinical implications. Infection-related AF is common, frequently recurrent, and associated with increased risks of stroke, heart failure, and mortality. It should not be dismissed as merely transient, and management should align with general AF principles: treat the infection and reversible triggers, assess and modify risk factors, use CHA₂DS₂-VASc to guide anticoagulation decisions after stabilization, and maintain vigilance for recurrence with appropriate surveillance and patient counseling [^114JsNzq] [^1161NRXM] [^114TTtUk].

> I should confirm key uncertainties and research gaps. High-quality randomized trials are lacking to define the optimal timing and duration of anticoagulation after infection-related AF, to determine whether early rhythm control improves hard outcomes in this population, and to refine risk stratification tools that integrate infection severity and atrial substrate. Until such data emerge, individualized decisions and shared decision-making are prudent [^111QusLS] [^114TTtUk].

> Finally, I need to ensure the practical plan is coherent. For a patient recovering from infection-related AF, I would stabilize hemodynamics with rate control, complete infection treatment, calculate CHA₂DS₂-VASc, defer anticoagulation if bleeding risk is high or sepsis is active, initiate OAC before discharge if stroke risk is elevated and bleeding risk acceptable, arrange ECG follow-up at 1 to 3 months and consider ambulatory monitoring, and continue longitudinal AF care with risk factor modification and rhythm surveillance, documenting recurrence and reassessing anticoagulation at each visit [^111QusLS] [^116LDSyr] [^111xAZtD].

---

Atrial fibrillation secondary to infection is common in critically ill patients, especially with pneumonia or sepsis, and is driven by inflammation, hypoxia, and autonomic imbalance [^114JsNzq] [^111NiXF7]. It is not benign: recurrence is high (about 33% at 3 years), and stroke risk is increased even after infection resolves, so **anticoagulation should follow standard CHA₂DS₂-VASc risk assessment** once bleeding risk is acceptable [^112M6s3P] [^111QusLS]. Acute management focuses on rate control (beta-blockers preferred), correction of reversible causes, and anticoagulation when indicated; rhythm control is reserved for instability or persistent symptoms. Long-term, **monitor for recurrence and reassess anticoagulation** at follow-up [^116LDSyr].

---

## Epidemiology and clinical significance

- **Incidence**: New-onset AF occurs in ~5–25% of sepsis cases and ~5–10% of pneumonia cases, with higher rates in ICU settings [^114JsNzq] [^115psChH] [^115fr6fT].

- **Clinical impact**: AF during infection is associated with longer ICU stay, higher in-hospital mortality, and increased long-term risks of stroke, heart failure, and death [^113xZoCQ] [^111Axbg9].

- **Recurrence**: AF recurrence is common (~33% at 3 years), indicating persistent substrate beyond the acute infection [^112M6s3P].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

AF during infection arises from **multiple interacting mechanisms**:

| **Mechanism** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Systemic inflammation | Elevated cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α) promote atrial electrical instability and fibrosis [^117S8tyw] [^111NiXF7] [^112BvKdu] |
| Hypoxia | Respiratory infections cause atrial ischemia and electrophysiological changes [^114YZFDc] |
| Autonomic dysregulation | Sympathetic surge from sepsis/pneumonia triggers arrhythmogenesis [^111f9c8q] |
| Electrolyte disturbances | Sepsis-related shifts (K⁺, Mg²⁺) increase AF risk [^115AQrPo] |
| Direct myocardial injury | Pathogens (e.g. SARS-CoV-2) can injure atrial tissue [^114YZFDc] |

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Clinical presentation includes **palpitations, dyspnea, chest discomfort, or hemodynamic instability**; some cases are asymptomatic and detected on monitoring. Diagnosis relies on **12-lead ECG or continuous monitoring**, with echocardiography to assess structural heart disease and thromboembolic risk [^115TCGPH].

---

## Management strategies

### Acute management

- **Hemodynamic stabilization**: Immediate rate control (beta-blockers preferred; calcium channel blockers or amiodarone if needed) [^113DtqfB].

- **Treat underlying infection**: Source control, antibiotics, and correction of hypoxia/electrolytes [^11697Tdv].

- **Anticoagulation**: Use CHA₂DS₂-VASc; anticoagulate if score ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women, balancing bleeding risk [^notfound].

- **Rhythm control**: Consider cardioversion or antiarrhythmics (e.g. amiodarone) for instability or persistent symptoms [^115TCGPH].

---

### Long-term management

Long-term management emphasizes **surveillance for recurrence** with regular follow-up and ECG monitoring [^116LDSyr]. Anticoagulation should be continued or initiated according to CHA₂DS₂-VASc, reassessed at each visit [^115TCGPH]. Lifestyle and risk-factor modification — including blood pressure control, weight management, alcohol moderation, and management of comorbidities — is essential [^1161NRXM].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

AF secondary to infection carries a **guarded prognosis**: recurrence is common (~33% at 3 years), and stroke and mortality risks remain elevated long term [^112M6s3P]. Persistent AF or failure to restore sinus rhythm further worsens outcomes, underscoring the need for structured follow-up and risk stratification [^116hRv3i].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **identifying and treating reversible causes**, with ongoing surveillance for recurrence and thromboembolic risk stratification using CHA₂DS₂-VASc [^11697Tdv] [^111QusLS]. Anticoagulation decisions should be individualized, balancing stroke and bleeding risks [^115psChH].

---

## Knowledge gaps and future research

Key gaps include the **optimal timing and duration of anticoagulation** after infection-related AF and the role of early rhythm control or ablation. There is also a need for robust risk stratification tools to identify patients at highest risk of recurrence and thromboembolism, and for prospective trials to define best practices and outcomes [^114TTtUk].

---

Atrial fibrillation secondary to infection is common and clinically significant, with high recurrence and adverse outcomes. Management should follow **standard AF principles**: stabilize, treat the infection, control rate, and anticoagulate based on CHA₂DS₂-VASc, with vigilant long-term follow-up [^114JsNzq].

Atrial fibrillation with sepsis — anticoagulation effects in observational data indicate no stroke reduction and increased bleeding. In a retrospective cohort of 38 582 patients with AF and sepsis, 13 611 (35.3%) received parenteral anticoagulation; the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score was a poor predictor of acute stroke risk, parenteral anticoagulation did not reduce stroke risk (1.3% versus 1.4%; RR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.77–1.15]) and was associated with an increased risk of clinically significant bleeding (8.6% versus 7.2%; RR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.10–1.32]); and risk of stroke did not differ between preexisting and new onset AF.

### Secondary precipitants of atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation therapy [^1127gUTx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) commonly occurs in the setting of acute conditions. We aimed to identify the acute conditions associated with secondary AF (AF precipitants) including pneumonia/sepsis, pneumothorax, respiratory failure, myocarditis, pericarditis, alcohol intoxication, thyrotoxicosis, cardiothoracic surgery, other surgery in patients with newly diagnosed AF and determine their association with subsequent oral anticoagulant use. Methods and Results We assembled a cohort of patients in the UMass Memorial Healthcare system with a new diagnosis of AF with and without AF precipitants. We used combinations of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes, Current Procedural Terminology codes, laboratory values, imaging reports, and physician notes including discharge summary texts to identify AF precipitants. We then manually reviewed the individual charts to validate presence of AF precipitants. The study sample consisted of 185 patients with and 172 patients without AF precipitants. Pneumonia/sepsis, myocardial infarction, respiratory failure, and cardiothoracic surgery were the most common precipitants identified. In multivariable analyses adjusting for age, sex, patient comorbidities, left atrial enlargement, left ventricular ejection fraction, and antiplatelet use, patients with AF precipitants were less likely to receive subsequent anticoagulation therapy at 30 days after the initial AF diagnosis (odds ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.19–0.52). The association was persistent after excluding men with CHA₂DS₂-VASc score < 2 and women with CHA₂DS₂-VASc score < 3. Conclusions Our study highlights lower usage of oral anticoagulant in secondary AF in contemporary clinical practice.

### Anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation during sepsis… [^114bCUDi]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

We allowed for oral anticoagulants later during hospitalization among patients who received an intravenous or subcutaneous anticoagulant initially, but excluded patients who received oral anticoagulants as their initial anticoagulant in the primary analysis. Given the clinical importance of understanding the risks and benefits of continuing oral anticoagulation among patients with preexisting AF and sepsis, we performed exploratory analysis evaluating oral anticoagulants as the initial anticoagulant during hospitalization among patients with preexisting AF. We included year of hospitalization, patient demographics, comorbid conditions, acute organ failure present on admission, organ-supportive therapies, source of sepsis, health care professional, and hospital characteristics as covariates.

We performed subgroup analysis and explored interactions between outcomes and anticoagulation status based on whether AF was newly diagnosed vs preexisting. The risk of bleeding was higher among patients with newly diagnosed AF than patients with preexisting AF, but the RR of bleeding associated with parenteral anticoagulation was lower among patients with newly diagnosed AF than patients with preexisting AF. Exploratory analyses demonstrated that patients receiving oral anticoagulants as the initial anticoagulant during hospitalization were more likely to have a history of preexisting AF than newly diagnosed AF, as well as more frequent cardiovascular comorbidity and lower incidence of acute organ failures.

Parenteral anticoagulation for AF during hospitalization for sepsis may be considered analogous to using intravenous anticoagulants to bridge to oral anticoagulation for AF during a perioperative period. Further study is necessary to evaluate the optimal timing of reinitiating oral anticoagulants for patients receiving chronic therapy and the risk-to-benefit ratio of longer-term anticoagulation after sepsis among patients with newly diagnosed AF during a sepsis-related hospitalization.

### Atrial fibrillation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19: incidence, predictors, outcomes, and comparison to influenza [^113Ea91G]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The goal of this study is to determine the incidence, predictors, and outcomes of atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (AFL) in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).

Background

COVID-19 results in increased inflammatory markers previously associated with atrial arrhythmias. However, little is known about their incidence or specificity in COVID-19 or their association with outcomes.

Methods

This is a retrospective analysis of 3,970 patients admitted with polymerase chain reaction-positive COVID-19 between February 4 and April 22, 2020, with manual review performed of 1,110. The comparator arm included 1,420 patients with influenza hospitalized between January 1, 2017, and January 1, 2020.

Results

Among 3,970 inpatients with COVID-19, the incidence of AF/AFL was 10% (n = 375) and in patients without a history of atrial arrhythmias it was 4% (n = 146). Patients with new-onset AF/AFL were older with increased inflammatory markers including interleukin 6 (93 vs. 68 pg/ml; p < 0.01), and more myocardial injury (troponin-I: 0.2 vs. 0.06 ng/ml; p < 0.01). AF and AFL were associated with increased mortality (46% vs. 26%; p < 0.01). Manual review captured a somewhat higher incidence of AF/AFL (13%, n = 140). Compared to inpatients with COVID-19, patients with influenza (n = 1,420) had similar rates of AF/AFL (12%, n = 163) but lower mortality. The presence of AF/AFL correlated with similarly increased mortality in both COVID-19 (relative risk: 1.77) and influenza (relative risk: 1.78).

Conclusions

AF/AFL occurs in a subset of patients hospitalized with either COVID-19 or influenza and is associated with inflammation and disease severity in both infections. The incidence and associated increase in mortality in both cohorts suggests that AF/AFL is not specific to COVID-19, but is rather a generalized response to the systemic inflammation of severe viral illnesses.

### Exacerbating the problem: COPD and atrial fibrillation [^117L2EKJ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

This study gives an important insight into the time course of AF during exacerbations and shows that the mean 7-day burden of AF peaks at Day 11 after exacerbation onset. This suggests that there is a delay between the period of maximal systemic inflammation and AF onset. Serum inflammatory markers in community-treated AECOPDs decrease from their peak at exacerbation onset and return to baseline levels within 14 days, likely as a result of treatment with steroids and/or antibiotic therapy. Similarly, respiratory symptoms and peak expiratory flow rate return to baseline within approximately 1 week (median, 7 and 6 days, respectively) following community-treated AECOPDs. Interestingly, the picture is different for cardiac biomarkers, which tend to remain increased for as long as 5 weeks after an exacerbation. Linking arrhythmia data with blood inflammatory markers and cardiac biomarkers may help in understanding the mechanistic pathway of AF development during the exacerbation period, and future studies are needed.

The authors importantly show that, in 75% of those who experienced AF during an AECOPD, AF subsequently recurs. Historically, secondary AF has been considered a separate entity, but this finding is in keeping with evidence suggesting that secondary AF, and specifically AF related to infection, is not transient and self-limiting and often returns. AF recurrence in the context of infection-driven AF is associated with increased stroke risk, and these patients may benefit from anticoagulation. This study underlines the value of continuous monitoring to identify these cases. Although this is not practical or feasible for all patients, further studies should explore those at greatest risk to identify the population of patients who would benefit most from prolonged monitoring. Furthermore, examining the covariates and potential confounders such as tobacco smoking may help future study design.

The authors acknowledge that the group studied is not representative of the wider COPD population. Half of the exacerbations during the study period (and involving 22 of the 30 participants who had an exacerbation) required hospitalization. The hospitalization rate for COPD exacerbations has been estimated at between 0.09% and 2.4% per patient per year. In addition, those requiring hospitalization may have additional risk factors for AF such as pneumonia, sepsis, or respiratory failure.

By using continuous cardiac monitoring, MacDonald and colleagues have shown that periods of AF are common in patients with COPD and may be related to exacerbation. This novel approach provides a firm foundation for further exploration into the mechanistic pathways between COPD and AF, the risk of stroke in COPD, and how changes to current practice may lead to improved long-term outcomes.

### Outcomes of atrial fibrillation in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111RWvFZ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Recently, emerging evidence has suggested that atrial fibrillation (AF) has an epidemiological correlation with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the clinical outcomes of AF in COVID-19 remain inconsistent and inconclusive. The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive description of the impact of AF on the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

Methods

Three electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science) were searched for eligible studies as of March 1, 2021. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the associations between AF (preexisting and new-onset) and in-hospital mortality, post-discharge mortality, and ventilator use.

Results

A total of 36 individual studies were incorporated into our meta-analysis. The combined results revealed that preexisting AF was associated with increased in-hospital mortality (pooled OR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.60–2.67; p < 0.001), post-discharge mortality (pooled OR: 2.69; 95% CI: 1.24–5.83; p < 0.05), and ventilator utilization (pooled OR: 4.53; 95% CI: 1.33–15.38; p < 0.05) in patients with COVID-19. In addition, our data demonstrated that new-onset AF during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was significantly correlated with increased mortality (pooled OR: 2.38; 95% CI: 2.04–2.77; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

The presence of AF is correlated with adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, which deserves increased attention and should be managed appropriately to prevent adverse outcomes.

2 Comparison With AF Alone

The comparison between patients hospitalized primarily for COVID‐19 with AF and those with AF as the primary condition presents intriguing possibilities for understanding the interplay between AF and COVID‐19. However, our study design and data source posed significant challenges for such a comparison. The NIS database categorizes conditions based on primary and secondary diagnoses without distinguishing between new onset and pre‐existing AF. This limitation complicates the differentiation between patients hospitalized due to the severity of AF itself and those for whom AF is a comorbid condition alongside COVID‐19.

Moreover, conceptualizing a comparison group of "AF alone" encounters methodological hurdles. The group could potentially consist of patients hospitalized with AF as the primary diagnosis, which often indicates acute episodes requiring immediate intervention, or patients with AF as a secondary diagnosis hospitalized for various other reasons. The clinical scenarios and patient profiles in these groups are markedly diverse, making direct comparisons with our COVID‐19 and AF cohort challenging. The acute presentation of AF in the former contrasts with the broader spectrum of AF severity in COVID‐19 patients, while the latter's diverse hospitalization reasons introduce confounding variables that hinder a clean comparison.

Given these considerations, our analysis focused on elucidating the association between AF and COVID‐19 outcomes within the limitations of available data. While we acknowledge the potential value that such a comparison might offer, technical and methodological constraints led us to focus our study scope on patients hospitalized with COVID‐19, with and without AF as a comorbid condition.

### Atrial fibrillation (chronic) [^116sy5TE]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, which is characterised by the presence of fast and uncoordinated atrial activation leading to reduced atrial mechanical function. Risk factors for atrial fibrillation include increasing age, coexisting cardiac and thyroid disease, pyrexial illness, electrolyte imbalance, cancer, and coexisting infection.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of oral medical treatments to control heart rate in people with chronic (defined as longer than 1 week for this review) non-valvular atrial fibrillation? What is the effect of different treatment strategies (rate vs. rhythm) for people with persistent non-valvular atrial fibrillation? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to August 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 18 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: beta-blockers (with or without digoxin), calcium channel blockers (with or without digoxin), calcium channel blockers (rate limiting), digoxin, and rate versus rhythm control strategies.

### Early cardiovascular events in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [^114bn2rr]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We investigated the incidence and risk factors of early cardiac events and their impact on the nonrelapse mortality and overall survival of patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT. To our knowledge, although there have been recent reportsof CV events in patients after allogeneic HSCT within 100 days, no other study has explored cardiac and transplant-related outcomes together in recipients of allogeneic HSCT and studied the effect of CV events on the 100-day transplant-related and all-cause mortality.

The incidence of CV events immediately after transplant and during 100 days after HSCT was 5%. The most common CV event was atrial fibrillation or flutter (3.9%), followed by heart failure (2%). CV death occurred in only 4 patients. Therefore, the incidence of CV events in this contemporary cohort of patients after transplant was not high. These event rates were primarily driven by atrial arrhythmia. Our results are compatible with the results of a recent multicenter study, which showed that event rates are not high and atrial arrhythmia is common. Our recent systematic review also showed the same incidence of CV events in patients after allogeneic HSCT.

Although the incidence of events was not high, these events were associated with an increased risk of nonrelapse mortality and all-cause mortality. This is an important finding, considering the reassuring recent reports of a low incidence of CV events in the contemporary cohort of patients postallogeneic HSCT. We showed that even a small number of events translated to poor survival in 100 days. In fact, the risk of nonrelapse mortality was 6-fold in patients who developed CV events.

Atrial arrhythmia was common, and the occurrence of atrial fibrillation or flutter was associated with a 6-fold increased hazard of death (both nonrelapse and all-cause mortality). The majority of deaths after atrial arrhythmias were due to infection, suggesting that even though atrial arrhythmias are not usually life-threatening and can be managed effectively, they are most likely happening in patients who are sicker due to concomitant medical issues. In the general population, sepsis and infections that are complicated by atrial fibrillation are associated with a more extended hospital stay and an increase in the risk of mortality. The exact mechanisms might apply to patients post-HSCT. Our findings are consistent with a recent study that showed atrial fibrillation after allogeneic HSCT is associated with poor survival and increased risk of nonrelapse and overall mortality.

### Usefulness of new-onset atrial fibrillation, as a strong predictor of heart failure and death in patients with native left-sided infective endocarditis [^114r4LNH]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in adults and has been independently related to increased morbidity and mortality. AF is a frequent arrhythmia in infective endocarditis (IE). Nevertheless, there are no data on how AF affects the clinical outcome of patients with endocarditis. Our purpose was to investigate patient characteristics, microbiology, echocardiographic findings, in-hospital course, and prognosis of patients with IE who develop new-onset AF (NAF) and compare them with those who remained in sinus rhythm (SR) or had previous AF (PAF). From 1997 to 2014, 507 consecutive patients with native left-sided IE were prospectively recruited at 3 tertiary care centers. We distinguished 3 groups according to the type of baseline heart rhythm during hospitalization and previous history of AF: NAF group (n = 52), patients with no previous history of AF and who were diagnosed as having NAF during hospitalization; SR group (n = 380), patients who remained in SR; and PAF group (n = 75), patients with PAF. Patients with NAF were older than those who remained in SR (68.3 vs 59.6 years, p < 0.001). At admission, heart failure was more common in NAF group (53% vs 34.3%, p < 0.001), whereas stroke (p = 0.427) was equally frequent in all groups. During hospitalization, embolic events occurred similarly (p = 0.411). In the multivariate analysis, NAF was independently associated with heart failure (odds ratio 3.56, p < 0.01) and mortality (odds ratio 1.91, p = 0.04). In conclusion, the occurrence of NAF in patients with IE was strongly associated with heart failure and higher in-hospital mortality independently from other relevant clinical variables.

### A systematic review of the incidence of and risk factors for postoperative atrial fibrillation following general surgery [^111sDQRP]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a common cardiac arrhythmia and can occur de novo following a surgical procedure. It is associated with increased inpatient and long-term mortality. There is limited evidence concerning new-onset atrial fibrillation following abdominal surgery. This study aimed to identify the prevalence of and risk factors for postoperative atrial fibrillation in the general surgical population. A systematic search of the Embase, MEDLINE and Cochrane (CENTRAL) databases was conducted. Studies were included in the review if they reported cases of new-onset atrial fibrillation within 30 days of the index operation. Results were evaluated qualitatively due to substantial clinical heterogeneity. Incidence rates were pooled using a weighted random-effects meta-analysis model. A total of 835 records were initially identified, from which 32 full texts were retrieved. Following review, 13 studies were included that involved 52,959 patients, of whom 10.94% (95%CI 7.22–15.33) developed atrial fibrillation. Five studies of patients undergoing oesophagectomy (n = 376/1923) had a weighted average rate of 17.66% (95%CI 12.16–21.47), compared with 7.63% (95%CI 4.39–11.98) from eight studies of non-oesophageal surgery (n = 2927/51,036). Identified risk factors included: increasing age; history of cardiac disease; postoperative complications, particularly, sepsis, pneumonia and pleural effusions. New-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation is common, and is more frequent after surgery involving the thorax. Future work should focus on stratifying risk to allow targeted prophylaxis of atrial fibrillation and other peri-operative complications.

### Risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation among Asian chronic hepatitis C virus carriers: a nationwide population-based cohort study [^111SXXXQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Schematic diagram of the conjectured common pathological mechanisms between atrial fibrillation (and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, as well as their relevant comorbidities and clinical presentations. The conceptual illustration is based on present findings and literature reviews. 32, 33 IV indicates intravenous.

In this study, we calculated CHA₂DS₂‐VASc scores before and after NOAF, mainly according to recent studies showing that CHA₂DS₂‐VASc score is not only a risk score to estimate risk of ischemic stroke in an AF population but also could be used to assess severity of arterial and venous thromboembolic events such as myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism. 34, 35, 36 In addition, this scoring system could also be applied reversely to predict NOAF in special populations. 22 Higher prevalence of comorbid diseases in the HCV group resulted in higher baseline CHA₂DS₂‐VASc score and subsequently more incidental AF. To clarify the impact of HCV on NOAF, we performed sensitivity analysis by using the main model with additional adjustment for each of the covariates and baseline CHA₂DS₂-VASc score to test whether the risk of HCV infection for NOAF varied with every relevant comorbidity. We found that the results were highly consistent by utilizing either multivariate analysis or competing risk model, confirming that the disease process of HCV or hepatitis virus per se could be associated with an increased risk of NOAF. Furthermore, the present study implied that the patients with chronic HCV infection had more concomitant extrahepatic diseases, linked to high CHA₂DS₂-VASc score (around 2.5 at baseline and 4.0 at the diagnosis of AF), which led to a high rate of stroke or systemic embolic events and consequently resulted in a high all‐cause mortality rate. The strong association between HCV and AF reminded clinicians of the importance of routine follow‐up of ECG to identify NOAF early for HCV carriers who always express higher disease severity and mortality risk.

### Risk factors and prognosis of new-onset atrial fibrillation in sepsis: a nationwide electronic health record study [^1178hUq7]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent sustained cardiac arrhythmia and is a significant cause of vascular-related disease and mortality. Although the focus of AF management has been on cardiovascular risk factors and complications such as hypertension, stroke, and heart failure, recent evidence suggests that noncardiovascular comorbidities are also common, with international guidelines recommending holistic or integrated care management as part of the Atrial fibrillation Better Care pathway for the management of these patients.

Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening condition of organ failure resulting from an imbalanced response of the host to infectionand occurs in nearly 49 million people annually worldwide. For example, An et alreported that sepsis was among the 3 main causes of AF-related mortality (ie, malignancy, sepsis, and heart failure). New-onset AF has been observed in 5% to 25% of patients with sepsis, and is associated with higher risk of hemodynamic instability, more prolonged intensive care unit stay, and subsequently having further AF episodes, or AF-related complications.,

Although studies have previously documented the association between sepsis and AF, the specific underlying risk factors for new-onset AF during sepsis and the long-term prognosis postdischarge remain unclear. Given that sepsis and AF are both highly prevalent medical conditions with high clinical risk, it is critical to understand their inter-relationships and prognostic implications. No European nationwide studies have as yet investigated this matter. Furthermore, the European Society of Cardiology, American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association AF guidelines, and Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock all fail to provide specific management recommendations for patients with sepsis and new-onset AF, showing that raising awareness of the medical community to this particular group of patients is required.

Using a UK nationwide data set, we aimed to: 1) identify risk factors that contribute to the development of new-onset AF in patients with sepsis; and 2) assess the impact of new-onset AF on in-hospital and postdischarge prognosis of patients with sepsis, providing a basis for risk assessment and patient management strategies in sepsis care.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^111hsycM]. Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Post–AF ablation evaluation — early symptoms and thresholds — states that a complete blood count should be performed to exclude bleeding or infection, infectious sources should be excluded if fever occurs early, fever might be the first marker of an impending atrial esophageal fistula (AEF), and chest imaging should be considered if fever persists without another source. Neurological symptoms shortly after ablation should be taken seriously with brain imaging to exclude embolic events, and AEF must be considered in the differential of postablation neurological presentations. Symptoms of pericarditis typically persist up to a week after ablation; if symptoms persist for > 1 week or are associated with lightheadedness or shortness of breath, further evaluation is warranted. Groin pain that persists past 7 days or is getting worse should prompt a physical exam and vascular ultrasound to exclude femoral access complications. A persistent nagging dry cough might be observed for up to 6 weeks after ablation and is more common with CB than with RF ablation.

### Long-term outcomes of secondary atrial fibrillation in the community: the framingham heart study [^115jHrx5]. Circulation (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines have proposed that atrial fibrillation (AF) can occur as an isolated event, particularly when precipitated by a secondary, or reversible, condition. However, knowledge of long-term AF outcomes after diagnosis during a secondary precipitant is limited.

Methods and Results

In 1409 Framingham Heart Study participants with new-onset AF, we examined associations between first-detected AF episodes occurring with and without a secondary precipitant and both long-term AF recurrence and morbidity. We selected secondary precipitants based on guidelines (surgery, infection, acute myocardial infarction, thyrotoxicosis, acute alcohol consumption, acute pericardial disease, pulmonary embolism, or other acute pulmonary disease). Among 439 patients (31%) with AF diagnosed during a secondary precipitant, cardiothoracic surgery (n = 131 [30%]), infection (n = 102 [23%]), noncardiothoracic surgery (n = 87 [20%]), and acute myocardial infarction (n = 78 [18%]) were most common. AF recurred in 544 of 846 eligible individuals without permanent AF (5-, 10-, and 15-year recurrences of 42%, 56%, and 62% with versus 59%, 69%, and 71% without secondary precipitants; multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio, 0.65 [95% confidence interval, 0.54–0.78]). Stroke risk (n = 209/1262 at risk; hazard ratio, 1.13 [95% confidence interval, 0.82–1.57]) and mortality (n = 1098/1409 at risk; hazard ratio, 1.00 [95% confidence interval, 0.87–1.15]) were similar between those with and without secondary precipitants, although heart failure risk was reduced (n = 294/1107 at risk; hazard ratio, 0.74 [95% confidence interval, 0.56–0.97]).

Conclusions

AF recurs in most individuals, including those diagnosed with secondary precipitants. Long-term AF-related stroke and mortality risks were similar between individuals with and without secondary AF precipitants. Future studies may determine whether increased arrhythmia surveillance or adherence to general AF management principles in patients with reversible AF precipitants will reduce morbidity.

### Thromboembolic risk in patients with pneumonia and new-onset atrial fibrillation not receiving anticoagulation therapy [^112M6s3P]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

New-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) is commonly reported in patients with severe infections. However, the absolute risk of thromboembolic events without anticoagulation remains unknown.

Objective

To investigate the thromboembolic risks associated with AF in patients with pneumonia, assess the risk of recurrent AF, and examine the association of initiation of anticoagulation therapy with new-onset AF.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-based cohort study used linked Danish nationwide registries. Participants included patients hospitalized with incident community-acquired pneumonia in Denmark from 1998 to 2018. Statistical analysis was performed from August 15, 2021, to March 12, 2022.

Exposures

New-onset AF.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Thromboembolic events, recurrent AF, and all-cause death. Estimated risks were calculated for thromboembolism without anticoagulation therapy, new hospital or outpatient clinic contact with AF, initiation of anticoagulation therapy, and all-cause death at 1 and 3 years of follow-up. Death was treated as a competing risk, and inverse probability of censoring weights was used to account for patient censoring if they initiated anticoagulation therapy conditioned on AF.

Results

Among 274 196 patients hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia, 6553 patients (mean age [SD], 79.1 [11.0] years; 3405 women [52.0%]) developed new-onset AF. The 1-year risk of thromboembolism was 0.8% (95% CI, 0.8%-0.8%) in patients without AF vs 2.1% (95% CI, 1.8%-2.5%) in patients with new-onset AF without anticoagulation; this risk was 1.4% (95% CI, 1.0%-2.0%) among patients with AF with intermediate stroke risk and 2.8% (95% CI, 2.3%-3.4%) in patients with AF with high stroke risk. Three-year risks were 3.5% (95% CI, 2.8%-4.3%) among patients with intermediate stroke risk and 5.3% (95% CI, 4.4%-6.5%) among patients with high stroke risk. Among patients with new-onset AF, 32.9% (95% CI, 31.8%-34.1%) had a new hospital contact with AF, and 14.0% (95% CI, 13.2%-14.9%) initiated anticoagulation therapy during the 3 years after incident AF diagnosis. At 3 years, the all-cause mortality rate was 25.7% (95% CI, 25.6%-25.9%) in patients with pneumonia without AF vs 49.8% (95% CI, 48.6%-51.1%) in patients with new-onset AF.

Conclusions and Relevance

This cohort study found that new-onset AF after community-acquired pneumonia was associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, which may warrant anticoagulation therapy. Approximately one-third of patients had a new hospital or outpatient clinic contact for AF during the 3-year follow-up, suggesting that AF triggered by acute infections is not a transient, self-terminating condition that reverses with resolution of the infection.

### Acute heart failure is a malignant process: but we can induce remission [^112w5FN9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

EPIDEMIOLOGY AND CAUSE

It is estimated that > 60 million people experience HF globally; however, how many of them are admitted with AHF is not known, partially because of the lack of objective criteria for the diagnosis of AHF. In the United States, 4.5 to 4.9/1000 people are admitted for HF as a primary diagnosis every year, putting the number of AHF admissions in the United States at 1.5 million yearly, ≈25% of patients with HF. Applying the same ratios globally, one would assume that AHF is the cause of at least 20 million hospital admission per year.

Several registries have outlined the possible causes for an AHF event. Acute coronary syndromes, valvular heart diseases, arrhythmias, especially atrial fibrillation, infections, uncontrolled hypertension, and nonadherence with medication prescriptions are the most commonly identified precipitants. However, in about half the patients, no causes were identified, whereas in up to a quarter, > 1 cause was noted. The identification of potential causes for AHF is important for 2 reasons. First, it provides prognostic information. For instance, AHF following an acute coronary syndrome or infection is associated with higher short‐term mortality than AHF associated with atrial fibrillation or uncontrolled hypertension. Second, some of these causes may have therapeutic implications, as described later. Valvular heart disease is frequently associated with AHF. AHF may result from either a new or a worsening acute valvular lesion, or it may be attributable to combined precipitants (such as an infection or arrhythmia) in a patient with significant valvular heart disease. The severity of the AHF event associated with valvular heart disease may vary from mild to frank cardiogenic shock.

Given the prognostic and therapeutic importance of the different causes of AHF (detailed later), it is recommended that some workup of patients with AHF should be undertaken after the initial stabilization to determine whether such precipitants have contributed to the AHF event. This should include at a minimum a full evaluation of blood hematology and chemistry, a chest x‐ray, heart rhythm monitoring, and echocardiography. These may be followed by ischemia evaluation. With respect to valvular heart disease, the evaluation is especially difficult because of the rapid variation in loading conditions and the presence of combined valvular lesions. Additional tests may be needed depending on the clinical presentation, such as exploring possible pulmonary embolism or various infections. The identification of precipitating factors may enable the delivery of specific treatments directed toward the underlying causes of AHF.

### Outcomes and management of stressor-associated atrial fibrillation: JACC state-of-the-art review [^114TTtUk]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Stressor-associated atrial fibrillation (AF) is defined as new onset AF occurring in the setting of an acute and reversible physiologic stressor (eg, cardiac surgery, acute infection). Although historically viewed as transient and potentially benign, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that stressor-associated AF is prognostically important, with long-term rates of AF recurrence and AF-related adverse events (eg, stroke, heart failure) approaching those of AF occurring without a stressor. Nevertheless, key aspects of stressor-associated AF management (eg, prevention, surveillance, treatment) remain highly variable. In this state-of-the-art review, we provide a clinically oriented synthesis of the epidemiology, mechanisms, outcomes, and management of stressor-associated AF across the breadth of characterized precipitants. Within this context, we outline a pathophysiologic framework in which stressor-associated AF represents a spectrum spanning variable relative contributions of direct stressor effects, stressor-mediated substrate, and underlying predisposition (ie, modifiable and nonmodifiable AF risk factors). Stressor-associated AF episodes occurring in the setting of a strong underlying predisposition to AF (sometimes termed "provoked AF") have a higher risk of recurrence, while episodes occurring in response to a profound physiologic stressor with minimal or no underlying predisposition (sometimes termed "reversible AF") have a lower risk of recurrence. Using postcardiac surgery stressor-associated AF as an exemplar, we summarize recent advances translating greater pathophysiologic understanding (eg, role of local inflammation) into novel clinical interventions capable of reducing stressor-associated AF incidence (eg, posterior pericardiotomy). We summarize available evidence for clinical management of stressor-associated AF and offer a conceptual framework to inform care. Finally, we conclude by outlining key priorities for future research designed to facilitate precision management of stressor-associated AF, including identification of more effective preventive measures, development of models to stratify risk of recurrent AF and AF-related adverse events following a stressor-associated AF episode, and integration of patient-centered outcomes.

### Risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation among Asian chronic hepatitis C virus carriers: a nationwide population-based cohort study [^111zY3LD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic viral hepatitis is not only a common infectious disease around the world but also causes heavy public health problems and socioeconomic burden. 1, 2 Its prevalence is particularly high in Asia Pacific regions. 3 Unlike hepatitis B, which is commonly self‐limiting, 4 patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection easily become chronic carriers and even develop liver cirrhosis or cancer several decades later. 5 In addition to hepatic pathologic change, chronic HCV infection has many extrahepatic manifestations, eg, hematological diseases, autoimmune disorders, nephropathy, and dermatological abnormalities. 6, 7 Data from recent studies 8, 9 have also shown that chronic HCV infection is strongly associated with atherosclerosis, cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events, and relevant mortality. Among them, HCV infection–associated systemic inflammation and consequent vasculitis are thought to be the major disease mediators of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. 10, 11, 12

Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac arrhythmia in middle‐aged and elderly adults, is positively associated with stroke, heart failure (HF), and cardiac death if not identified early and treated appropriately with antiarrhythmic or anticoagulant agents. 13 The causes of AF are relevant to diverse hereditary and acquired factors. 14, 15 Apart from progressive atrial remodeling and fibrosis, which are considered as a primary pathologic change for AF, 16 emerging recent evidence 17 has revealed that genetic factors and inflammation are 2 major contributors for AF development. Furthermore, clinical observation and literature reviews 18, 19 have revealed that new‐onset AF (NOAF) is frequently observed in the critically ill or patients with sepsis, implicating that acute or chronic inflammation might lead to occurrence and progression of AF. Thus, it is rationale to hypothesize that HCV carriers might have an increased risk for NOAF through sharing common mechanisms of inflammation. Nevertheless, in contrast to cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events, which have been frequently noted in HCV, 11 the clinical evidence for a relationship between AF arrhythmia and HCV remains scarce. In this study, we attempt to investigate the real‐world risk of NOAF in patients with chronic HCV infection by employing a nationwide database with a long‐term follow‐up.

### Causes of death in atrial fibrillation: challenges and opportunities [^112Q8Dxg]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an age-related arrhythmia associated with several co-morbidities and significant mortality. Most AF patients are in need of anticoagulation due to increased risk of stroke. Despite anticoagulation, AF patients still have a significant risk of death (about 5%/y). Approximately half of deaths in AF are due to heart-related causes (i.e., sudden death, heart failure, and myocardial infarction), one-third of deaths are due to non-vascular causes (i.e., cancer, respiratory diseases, and infections) and the remaining AF patients die from stroke or hemorrhage (about 6% each), or other causes. This review describes current situations related to causes of death in AF, the challenges in the management of AF (e.g., frequent presence of cardiovascular risk factors and co-morbidities, physicians adherence to clinical guidelines and patients adherence to cardiovascular medications in AF) as well as the opportunities for intervention.

### Secondary precipitants of atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation therapy [^116E4wX6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Over 5 million Americans have atrial fibrillation (AF), with 12 million projected by 2030. AF is an important ischemic stroke risk factor, increasing the risk 5‐fold and accounting for 1 in 4 ischemic strokes. The presence of AF at the time of ischemic stroke is associated with increased stroke severity, mortality, and risk of recurrence. Nevertheless, in a national outpatient registry of patients with AF, only 60% received any oral anticoagulant (OAC).

Approximately one‐third of new AF cases occur in the setting of acute, "reversible" causes(hereafter referred to as secondary AF). Acute conditions associated with secondary AF include pulmonary embolism, sepsis, acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, pericarditis, thyrotoxicosis, cardiothoracic surgery, and alcohol intoxication (hereafter referred to as AF precipitants). AF occurring in the setting of acute conditions was previously thought to be a self‐limited event that is potentially curable with elimination of the underlying cause. However, there is now a considerable body of evidence demonstrating that the AF will likely recur even after elimination of the inciting event. Importantly, secondary AF is associated with elevated risk of stroke, and the risk may be similar to the stroke risk in AF without precipitants. In a major departure from previous guidelines, the 2014 US AF guidelines stated that patients with secondary AF require long‐term follow‐up to evaluate for recurrence. The guidelines also highlighted knowledge gaps in long‐term outcomes and the role of OAC in secondary AF. An assessment of current OAC utilization in relation to presence of AF precipitants is a critical, initial step to understanding current prescribing patterns and potential targets for future intervention.

In the current study, we assembled a sample of patients with new‐onset AF with and without AF precipitants using previously developed electronic health record (EHR) algorithmand manual validation. We then measured the association between presence of secondary precipitants and subsequent OAC use.

### Optimizing atrial fibrillation management: from ICU and beyond [^1148GPoR]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) that newly occurs during critical illness presents challenges for both short- and long-term management. During critical illness, patients with new-onset AF are clinically evaluated for hemodynamic instability owing to the arrhythmia as well as for potentially reversible arrhythmia triggers. Hemodynamically significant AF that persists during critical illness may be treated with heart rate or rhythm control strategies. Recent evidence suggests that patients in whom AF develops during acute illness (eg, sepsis, postoperatively) have high long-term risks for AF recurrence and for AF-associated complications, such as stroke, heart failure, and death. Therefore, we suggest increased efforts to improve communication of AF events between inpatient and outpatient providers and to reassess patients who had experienced new-onset AF during critical illness after they transition to the post-ICU setting. We describe various strategies for the assessment and long-term management of patients with new-onset AF during critical illness.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114JsNzq]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation during acute medical illness or surgery — epidemiology and outcomes show wide incidence and high recurrence with adverse events. Incidence ranges from 1% to 46% in medical illness, with 6% to 22% in severe sepsis, and 3% to 16% after noncardiac surgery; recurrent AF was noted in 42% to 68% in acute medical illness and 39% after noncardiac surgery during 5-year follow-up. In 10 723 patients with newly diagnosed AF (67.9 ± 9.9 years, 41% women), 11% had an acute AF precipitant — cardiac surgery (22%), pneumonia (20%), and noncardiac surgery (15%) — and AF recurrence at 5 years was 41% with a precipitant versus 52% without (adjusted HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.69–0.81]; P < 0.001). Regardless of a precipitant, recurrent AF was associated with increased risks of heart failure (HF; HR, 2.74 [95% CI, 2.39–3.15]; P < 0.001), stroke (HR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.30–1.90]; P < 0.001), and death (HR, 2.96 [95% CI, 2.70–3.24]; P < 0.001).

### Paracrine signalling by cardiac calcitonin controls atrial fibrogenesis and arrhythmia [^112BvKdu]. Nature (2020). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation, the most common cardiac arrhythmia, is an important contributor to mortality and morbidity, and particularly to the risk of stroke in humans 1. Atrial-tissue fibrosis is a central pathophysiological feature of atrial fibrillation that also hampers its treatment; the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood and warrant investigation given the inadequacy of present therapies 2. Here we show that calcitonin, a hormone product of the thyroid gland involved in bone metabolism 3, is also produced by atrial cardiomyocytes in substantial quantities and acts as a paracrine signal that affects neighbouring collagen-producing fibroblasts to control their proliferation and secretion of extracellular matrix proteins. Global disruption of calcitonin receptor signalling in mice causes atrial fibrosis and increases susceptibility to atrial fibrillation. In mice in which liver kinase B1 is knocked down specifically in the atria, atrial-specific knockdown of calcitonin promotes atrial fibrosis and increases and prolongs spontaneous episodes of atrial fibrillation, whereas atrial-specific overexpression of calcitonin prevents both atrial fibrosis and fibrillation. Human patients with persistent atrial fibrillation show sixfold lower levels of myocardial calcitonin compared to control individuals with normal heart rhythm, with loss of calcitonin receptors in the fibroblast membrane. Although transcriptome analysis of human atrial fibroblasts reveals little change after exposure to calcitonin, proteomic analysis shows extensive alterations in extracellular matrix proteins and pathways related to fibrogenesis, infection and immune responses, and transcriptional regulation. Strategies to restore disrupted myocardial calcitonin signalling thus may offer therapeutic avenues for patients with atrial fibrillation.

### Treatment strategies for new onset atrial fibrillation in patients treated on an intensive care unit: a systematic scoping review [^111U4D3w]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

New onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF), usually defined as atrial fibrillation (AF) occurring in patients with no known history of AF, is a common arrhythmia in critically ill patients. NOAF occurs in 5–11% of patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and up to 46% of patients with septic shock. NOAF in critically ill patients can cause cardiovascular instability and is associated with increased risk of thromboembolism, increased mortality and length of ICU stay, and higher healthcare costs.

Guidelines for management of AF do not directly apply to critically ill patients. NOAF in patients treated on an ICU differs from AF in patients in the community in terms of causes of rhythm disturbance, risks and effectiveness of treatments. The lack of evidence for managing NOAF in patients treated on an ICU means treatment practice differs widely.

We conducted a scoping review to provide an overview of current evidence for the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological, electrical, and other non-pharmacological NOAF treatments, prophylactic strategies, and acute anticoagulation for stroke prophylaxis in critically ill patients. We also aimed to describe commonly used definitions of NOAF in patients treated on an ICU and suggest recommendations and barriers for future research.

A recent scoping review described the incidence, risk factors, outcomes and management strategies related to NOAF during critical illness. It included patients with pre-existing AF and studies conducted outside ICUs. Our review focusses on the comparative evidence for treatment of NOAF in patients treated on an ICU.

### Electrocardiographic manifestations of COVID-19 [^114YZFDc]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a lower respiratory tract infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease can impact the cardiovascular system and lead to abnormal electrocardiographic (ECG) findings. Emergency clinicians must be aware of the ECG manifestations of COVID-19.

Objective

This narrative review outlines the pathophysiology and electrocardiographic findings associated with COVID-19.

Discussion

COVID-19 is a potentially critical illness associated with a variety of ECG abnormalities, with up to 90% of critically ill patients demonstrating at least one abnormality. The ECG abnormalities in COVID-19 may be due to cytokine storm, hypoxic injury, electrolyte abnormalities, plaque rupture, coronary spasm, microthrombi, or direct endothelial or myocardial injury. While sinus tachycardia is the most common abnormality, others include supraventricular tachycardias such as atrial fibrillation or flutter, ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, various bradycardias, interval and axis changes, and ST segment and T wave changes. Several ECG presentations are associated with poor outcome, including atrial fibrillation, QT interval prolongation, ST segment and T wave changes, and ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation.

Conclusions

This review summarizes the relevant ECG findings associated with COVID-19. Knowledge of these findings in COVID-19-related electrocardiographic presentations may assist emergency clinicians in the evaluation and management of potentially infected and infected patients.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — causes and associated conditions include reversible triggers, AF without demonstrable heart disease, and metabolic contributors. AF may be related to acute, temporary causes such as alcohol intake, surgery, electrocution, myocardial infarction (MI), pericarditis, myocarditis, pulmonary embolism or other pulmonary diseases, hyperthyroidism, and other metabolic disorders, and successful treatment of the underlying condition often eliminates AF. AF that develops in the setting of acute MI portends an adverse prognosis compared with preinfarction AF or sinus rhythm, and AF may be associated with atrial flutter, the Wolff–Parkinson–White (WPW) syndrome, or atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentrant tachycardias, where treatment of the primary arrhythmias reduces or eliminates recurrent AF; AF is a common early postoperative complication of cardiac or thoracic surgery. AF is often an electrical manifestation of underlying cardiac disease, yet approximately 30% to 45% of cases of paroxysmal AF and 20% to 25% of cases of persistent AF occur in younger patients without demonstrable underlying disease. Obesity is an important risk factor for development of AF, and after adjustment the excess risk appears mediated by left atrial dilation, with a graded increase in left atrial size as body mass index increases from normal to the overweight and obese categories.

### Risk factors for atrial fibrillation in a multicenter United States clinical cohort of people with HIV infection [^113jSpnX]. AIDS (2022). Medium credibility.

To assess atrial fibrillation risk factors in people with HIV, we identified incident atrial fibrillation in a large clinical cohort of people receiving care. Compared with 970 controls without atrial fibrillation, the 97 with adjudicated incident atrial fibrillation were older, less likely Hispanic, and had more coronary disease, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In multivariable analysis, nonuse of antiretroviral therapy and prescription of antiretroviral regimens with multiple core agents were associated with increased atrial fibrillation risk.

Regarding medical management for COVID-19 infection, more specifically with respect to antithrombotic therapy (AF), ACCP 2023 guidelines recommend to consider initiating therapeutic-dose parenteral anticoagulation in hospitalized (either non-ICU or ICU) patients with COVID-19 and new-onset AF, irrespective of the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score. Consider initiating long-term oral anticoagulation if the score is ≥ 1 in males or ≥ 2 in females.

### New-onset atrial fibrillation predicting for complicating cardiac adverse outcome in scrub typhus infection [^112JnTmq]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Scrub typhus is a well-known infectious disorder of the Asia-Pacific region. However, adverse cardiac outcomes are an under-recognized complication of scrub typhus infection, and new-onset AF has been reported to be a prognostic factor in other, more common infectious diseases. The present study investigated whether new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) is significantly associated with 3-month mortality and adverse cardiac complications in scrub typhus infection.

Methods

We examined data from the National Health Information Database (NHID) which covers nearly the entire population of South Korea, from 2006 to 2016. In total, 233473 patients diagnosed with scrub typhus infection were selected as study participants. New-onset AF, acute heart failure (AHF), ischemic heart disease (IHD), and 3-month mortality were analyzed using a generalized estimating equation model with a Poisson distribution.

Results

Of these, 2402 patients (1%) were diagnosed with new-onset AF (87.2% were over 60years of age, 43.3% were male). Those with new-onset AF were more likely to have underlying cardiovascular disease compared to those without new-onset AF. After being adjusted for demographic factors and comorbidities, those with new-onset AF had a higher incidence risk of concurrent AHF (4.1-fold) and IHD (1.9-fold) compared with those without new-onset AF. In particular, the 3-month mortality was also significantly associated with new-onset AF (1.3-fold), concurrent AHF (2.4-fold), and IHD (13.7-fold).

Conclusions

New-onset AF was significantly associated with 3-month mortality and concurrent AHF and IHD. Therefore, new-onset AF could be a poor prognostic factor for 3-month mortality and cardiac complications in scrub typhus infection.

### Risk factors and prognosis of new-onset atrial fibrillation in sepsis: a nationwide electronic health record study [^115QGBPA]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) may occur in patients with sepsis and is associated with a worse prognosis. To date, no UK nationwide studies have investigated the risks and impact of AF and sepsis.

Objectives

The authors aimed to: 1) identify risk factors contributing to the development of new-onset AF in patients with sepsis; and 2) assess the impact of new-onset AF on in-hospital and long-term outcomes.

Methods

Utilizing linked UK-electronic health records of 5.6 million people between 1998 and 2016, we analyzed risk factors for new-onset AF in the setting of sepsis and assessed duration of hospitalization, rate of septic shock, 7- and 30-day in-hospital mortality, postdischarge mortality, and stroke. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess postdischarge outcomes, and adjustment for behavioral and demographic variables, and comorbid conditions was performed. Fine-Gray analyses were used to account for competing risks.

Results

We identified 7,691 patients hospitalized for sepsis and new-onset AF, 24,506 patients with sepsis who did not develop new-onset AF, and 95,287 patients hospitalized for new-onset AF who did not have sepsis. Age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, and hypertension were significantly associated with new-onset AF. Compared to sepsis patients without AF, those with new-onset AF during sepsis had longer duration of hospitalization, higher risk of developing septic shock, and higher in-hospital mortality. Patients with sepsis and new-onset AF had a higher rate of stroke (adjusted HR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.08–1.30), heart failure, myocardial infarction, and mortality postdischarge (adjusted HR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.03–1.12) than those with sepsis without AF.

Conclusions

AF during sepsis is common and is not an innocent finding. Active monitoring should be pursued as AF has important short- and long-term prognostic implications.

### The association between COVID-19 infection and incident atrial fibrillation: results from a retrospective cohort study using a large US commercial insurance database [^112ZQAwB]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the risk of incident AF among patients with COVID-19 treated in both acute and non-acute care settings. Further, our study used patients with upper respiratory infections as comparators to better reflect the unique association of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and AF incidence. Between 2.2% and 2.7% of patients with COVID-19 in our analysis developed AF in the year following COVID-19 infection. Patients with COVID-19 were observed to be at a higher risk of developing AF as compared with patients with AURI identified in either the pandemic or prepandemic period, respectively.

Our results are consistent with prior studies that have examined an association between COVID-19 and AF. In one such study of a large hospital system in the USA, hospitalised patients with COVID-19 were observed to have 19% higher risk (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.41) of developing AF during their hospitalisation when compared with hospitalised patients without COVID-19. The authors further reported that hospitalised patients with COVID-19 had 57% higher risk of developing AF (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.00) when compared with hospitalised non-COVID-19 patients during the prepandemic period. In our study, patients with COVID-19 had 83% higher risk of 12-month incident AF as compared with patients with AURI in the pandemic period and 70% higher risk as compared with patients with AURI in the prepandemic period. Further, results from our subanalysis suggest that the increased risk of AF extends to both women and men, with women having 68%–76% higher risk of AF and men having 75%–92% higher risk of AF as compared with patients with AURI. Further, subanalysis by age suggested that the increased risk of AF is not just limited to elderly individuals as patients in the 21–49 years and 50–69 years age groups were also observed to be at a higher risk. Patients with COVID-19 aged 21–49 years were more than twice as likely to be diagnosed with AF as compared with their peers in the AURI pandemic cohort and had 70% higher risk of AF as compared with AURI prepandemic cohort. Similar results were observed for patients in the 50–69 years age group. Though results for those aged 70 years and above were similar, we did observe a significant difference in the incidence of AF among AURI pandemic and prepandemic cohorts for this age group. As such, the relationship between COVID-19 and AF in this elderly cohort of patients aged 70 years and above was inconclusive. The incremental AF burden observed among young adults in our study is concerning, as the classical association between AF genesis and age skews towards older patients.

### New-onset atrial fibrillation among patients with infection in the emergency department: a multicenter cohort study of 1-year stroke risk [^116AWWv4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation in relation to infection are frequent in emergency departments (EDs) and may require antithrombotic therapy because of the increased risk of stroke. Our objective was to describe the 1-year risk of stroke in patients in the ED with infection, new-onset atrial fibrillation, and no antithrombotic therapy.

Methods

This was a population-based cohort study at 4 EDs in Denmark and Sweden. Atrial fibrillation was identified by electrocardiogram (ECG) upon arrival at the ED, and infection was identified by discharge diagnosis. Patient history was followed for 12 months or until initiation of oral anticoagulant therapy, ischemic stroke, or death. Primary outcome was stroke within 12 months compared to patients with infection and no atrial fibrillation.

Results

In the analysis, 15,505 patients were included; 48.7% were male and the median age was 71 (IQR, 56–83). Among the included patients, 2107 (13.6%) had atrial fibrillation of any kind and 822 (39.0%) of these had new-onset atrial fibrillation with a median CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 3 (IQR 2–4). New-onset atrial fibrillation during infection showed an absolute postdischarge 1-year risk of stroke of 2.7% (95% CI 1.6–4.2), corresponding to a crude hazard ratio (HR) of 1.4 (95% CI 0.9–2.3), a sex and age adjusted HR of 1.0 (95% CI 0.6–1.6), and a CHA₂DS₂-VASc adjusted HR of 1.1 (95% CI, 0.7–1.8) compared to patients with infection but no atrial fibrillation.

Conclusions

Patients in the ED with infection and new-onset atrial fibrillation without current oral anticoagulant therapy had a 2.7% absolute 1-year risk of stroke. Stroke events were mainly related to sex and age and risk factors identified by the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score.

### Causes of death and influencing factors in patients with atrial fibrillation [^114kDYJC]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation is associated with a higher mortality, but causes of death of atrial fibrillation patients and their specific predictors have been less well defined. We aimed to identify the causes of death among atrial fibrillation patients and secondly, clinical predictors for the different modes of deaths.

Methods

Patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation in a four-hospital institution between 2000 and 2010 were identified. During a follow-up of 929 ± 1082 days (median 456, interquartile 10–1584), 1253 deaths were recorded (yearly rate 5.5%).

Results

Cardiovascular deaths accounted for 54% and noncardiovascular for 43%. The three main causes of death were heart failure (29%), infection (18%), and cancer (12%). Fatal stroke or fatal bleeding each accounted for 7% of all deaths. On multivariate analysis, the strongest predictors of death were permanent atrial fibrillation, heart failure (whether with decreased or with preserved ejection fraction), previous bleeding, and renal failure, which were independently associated with an increase in the risk of all-cause mortality (35%, 78%, 42%, and 79%, respectively), cardiovascular mortality (43%, 129%, 46%, and 93%, respectively), and noncardiovascular mortality (21%, 45%, 40%, and 50%, respectively). Oral anticoagulant use was independently associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54–0.71; P < .0001), cardiovascular mortality (HR 0.60; 95% CI, 0.49–0.72; P < .0001), and noncardiovascular mortality (HR 0.60; 95% CI, 0.49–0.74; P < .0001).

Conclusions

The majority of deaths were related to a cardiovascular origin, and heart failure was the most common cause of death in atrial fibrillation patients. Despite the high risk of stroke associated with atrial fibrillation, only 7% died from stroke. Optimization of management of any underlying heart disease and associated comorbidities should be a relevant therapeutic target to reduce total mortality in atrial fibrillation patients.

### Thromboembolic risk in patients with pneumonia and new-onset atrial fibrillation not receiving anticoagulation therapy [^115psChH]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Pneumonia and atrial fibrillation (AF) are leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Pneumonia is the most common medical diagnosis responsible for hospitalizations in the US. AF is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and carries up to a 5-fold increased risk of stroke. Pneumonia and AF often coexist, and new-onset AF is a common complication occurring in 4.7% to 9.5% of patients with pneumonia.

A prevailing thought has been that AF triggered by acute infection is a transient and self-terminating condition that reverses with resolution of infection. However, mounting evidence suggest that AF frequently recurs, carrying an increased risk of stroke. Stroke risk in patients with infections and AF has been shown to exceed the risk of both the general population with AF, and patients with infections without AF. Nonetheless, guidelines do not provide clear recommendations regarding the role of oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy to mitigate stroke risk in this context. The decision to initiate OAC therapy should be based on the expected net clinical benefit of OAC therapy, which tracks closely with the absolute risk of stroke and bleeding in patients not receiving OAC therapy. Patients at low stroke risk may have little to no or negative net clinical benefit from therapy. Decision analyses have indicated that the threshold at which OAC treatment yields a net clinical benefit is a stroke risk between 1% to 2% per year. However, there is a paucity of data on the absolute thromboembolic risk associated with AF triggered by infections to guide the treatment decision among patients with pneumonia and incident AF.

This nationwide cohort study in Denmark sought to investigate the risks of arterial thromboembolism in patients with new-onset AF after community-acquired pneumonia without anticoagulation therapy. In secondary analyses, we sought to clarify the concept of postinfection new-onset AF as a transient condition by estimating risks of recurrent hospital or outpatient clinic contact with AF, OAC therapy initiation, and all-cause mortality.

### Incidence, risk factors and outcomes of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with sepsis: a systematic review [^117W5c3D]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Data analysis

Abstracts were screened for inclusion by the primary author. Articles that were selected for full-text review were assessed by both the first and second author. In case of uncertainty about study inclusion consensus was sought with the third author. Subsequently, data were extracted by the primary author. Where possible, the cumulative incidence of new-onset AF during the sepsis episode, the odds ratios (ORs) for the relations between risk factors and the occurrence of AF, and the OR for the relation between AF and mortality were calculated based on the crude data provided in the article. We calculated weighted mean incidences across studies by summing the reported frequencies of AF in all eligible studies and dividing this by the total number of participants. Risk factors were considered to have a high level of evidence if a significant association (P < 0.05) was reported in ≥ 2 studies using multivariable analyses; a moderate level of evidence if a significant association was reported in a single study using a multivariable analysis, or in ≥ 2 studies using univariable analyses; and a low level of evidence if a significant association was reported in a single study using a univariable analysis. The strength of association was then classified as strong (OR < 0.4 or > 3.0), moderate (OR 0.4 to 0.7 or 1.5 to 3.0) and weak (OR = 0.7 to 0.9 or OR = 1.1 to 1.5).

6 CONCLUSION

Our study underscores the significant impact of AF on the outcomes of hospitalized COVID‐19 patients. The findings of the study suggest that COVID‐19 patients with AF constitute a vulnerable subgroup with worse clinical outcomes. Further research is warranted to enhance our understanding of the intricate relationship between AF and COVID‐19 and develop evidence‐based strategies to mitigate its adverse effects on this high‐risk subgroup.

### Incidence, risk factors and outcomes of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with sepsis: a systematic review [^111Qx13j]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Table 4 shows outcomes for patients with at least a single episode of new-onset AF as compared to patients with maintained sinus rhythm. All studies reporting mortality found increased case fatality rates in patients who had developed AF during their stay. Estimated ORs varied from 1.96 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26 to 3.03) to 3.32 (95% CI 1.12 to 9.84) for acute (that is, ICU or in-hospital) mortality, and from 2.25 (95% CI 0.66 to 7.73) to 4.29 (95% CI 1.53 to 11.97) for 28-day mortality. Only two studies reported a measure of association that was corrected for baseline imbalances in severity of illness, with an adjusted relative risk (RR) 1.07 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.11) for in-hospital mortality and adjusted OR 3.28 (95% CI 1.13 to 9.57) for 28-day mortality, respectively. Three studies reported a significantly increased length of stay for patients who had experienced an episode of new-onset AF in the ICU (weighted mean difference 9 days, reported range 5 to 13 days). An increased risk for in-hospital ischemic stroke was found in a single study that reported this outcome (adjusted OR 2.70, 95% CI 2.05 to 3.57).

### Pericarditis and atrial arrhythmias… [^116BEY6B]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The incidence of paroxysmal atrial arrhythmias during pericarditis is probably higher than is generally realized. James1 reported the appearance of atrial arrhythmias in 26 patients with pericarditis secondary to collagen disease, neoplasm, trauma, infection, or after myocardial infarction. Soffer2 noted that, in his series of patients with idiopathic pericarditis, transient atrial fibrillation appeared in 13%. This is the exact incidence recorded by Scherl3 in a study of 30 patients with idiopathic pericarditis. Several morphologic features explain the occurrence of arrhythmias during the acute phase of pericarditis. Proximity of the diseased pericardium to the atria and the fact that the sinus node is located 1 mm or less beneath the atrial epicardium suggest that clinically significant involvement of these structures will occur in many patients with pericarditis.

James1 described the results of histological study of the cardiac conduction system in 38 patients in whom pericarditis was found. PERICARDITIS AND ATRIAL ARRHYTHMIAS. JAMA. 1963; 185: 316–317.

### Guidance on short-term management of atrial fibrillation in coronavirus disease 2019 [^1165k1Xh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a common clinical manifestation in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Medications used to treat atrial fibrillation, such as antiarrhythmic drugs and anticoagulants, may have significant drug interactions with emerging COVID-19 treatments. Common unintended nontherapeutic target effects of COVID-19 treatment include potassium channel blockade, cytochrome P 450 isoenzyme inhibition or activation, and P-glycoprotein inhibition. Drug-drug interactions with antiarrhythmic drugs and anticoagulants in these patients may lead to significant bradycardia, ventricular arrhythmias, or severe bleeding. It is important for clinicians to be aware of these interactions, drug metabolism changes, and clinical consequences when choosing antiarrhythmic drugs and anticoagulants for COVID-19 patients with atrial fibrillation. The objective of this review is to provide a practical guide for clinicians who are managing COVID-19 patients with concomitant atrial fibrillation.

Heart Rhythm (2020). High credibility.

Post-cardiac surgery atrial fibrillation (AF) — monitoring and risk profile: Heart rhythm monitoring for 4–7 days is recommended for detection of post-operative AF, and most events occur early since the majority of post-cardiac surgical AF occurs within the first 4 post-operative days, is most common on the 2nd post-operative day, with recurrences most common on the 3rd post-operative day, and 94% of post-operative AF occurred by the 7th post-operative day; its incidence ranges between 20–50%. Patients with post-operative AF may undergo follow-up rhythm monitoring to assess for the presence of symptomatic and asymptomatic arrhythmias, and follow-up rhythm monitoring, for example with ECG or Holter monitoring is advisable in this subset of patients particularly in the setting of symptom development. Procedural-related risk factors include type of surgery, mitral valve surgery, use of intra-aortic balloon pump, longer cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic clamp times, and perioperative issues such as inflammation, infection, fluid overload, inotropic use, atrial ischemia, hypokalaemia, and hypomagnesemia, while patient-related risk factors include advanced age, history of AF, history of HF, renal failure, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, post-operative withdrawal or absence of beta-blocker, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) therapy.

### Incidence, risk factors and outcomes of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with sepsis: a systematic review [^116gSwvg]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

New-onset AF is a common occurrence in critically ill patients with sepsis, and its incidence rises with increasing severity of disease. Multivariable analyses suggest that it is independently associated with poor outcome, but whether this relation is truly causal remains difficult to establish. In view of these findings there is a need for better quality observational studies, because reliable identification of patients with sepsis who are prone for the development of AF may allow for early pharmacological interventions to prevent this complication.

### New-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. impact of timing and duration on short-and medium-term mortality [^111HGwDa]. The Journal of Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Objetives

To assess the incidence, related factors, timing and duration of new- onset atrial fibrillation in a cohort of consecutive patients diagnosed with pneumococcal pneumonia.

Methods

Observational study including all immunocompetent adults hospitalized for pneumococcal pneumonia. Patients were classified by time (atrial fibrillation recognized on emergency room arrival or developed during hospitalization) and duration (paroxysmal or persistent). Patients were followed-up for 6 months after discharge.

Results

We included 1092 patients, of whom 109 (9.9%) had new-onset atrial fibrillation. An early event was documented in 87 (79.8%) cases. Arrhythmia was classified as paroxysmal in 78 patients. Older age, heavy drinking, respiratory rate ≥ 30/minute, leukopenia, severe inflammation and bacteremia were independent risk factors for developing new-onset atrial fibrillation on admission. Overall, 48 (4.4%) patients died during hospitalization, the rate being higher in those patients who developed new-onset arrhythmia (17.9% vs 2.9% p < 0.001). Among patients with events recognized at admission, in-hospital mortality was higher in those with persistent arrhythmia (34.8% vs 6.3%, p = 0.002) and 6-month survival was better among those who developed paroxysmal event.

Conclusions

The development of new-onset atrial fibrillation was associated with pneumonia severity, and higher in-hospital mortality. Bacteremia and severe systemic inflammation were factors associated with its development.

### Thromboembolic risk in patients with pneumonia and new-onset atrial fibrillation not receiving anticoagulation therapy [^114MR3D6]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

Among patients with community-acquired pneumonia, new-onset AF was associated with increased risks of thromboembolism, which may cross the threshold where OAC therapy is considered beneficial. One-third of patients had a new hospital AF diagnosis during follow-up, indicating that the concept of infection-related AF as a transient condition may need reconsideration. These findings may have rhythm monitoring and treatment implications, and improved communication and monitoring of long-term AF risks is warranted.

AF in COVID‐19

The prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias was up to 16.7% in hospitalized patients and as high as 44.4% in the intensive care unit in Wuhan. 8 In New York City, arrhythmias were reported in 24 of 130 patients (18.5%) who required invasive mechanical ventilation, of whom 23 of 24 patients (95.8%) had atrial arrhythmias. 9 In an Italian cohort of 99 patients hospitalized with COVID‐19, AF was found in 19% of all cases and in 36% of patients with underlying cardiovascular disease, and AF was more common in patients who did not survive (42.1% versus 32.5%). 10 In a small Italian report, 75% of hospitalized COVID‐19 geriatric patients in Italy had a medical history of AF. 11

Evidence of myocardial injury was noted in 19.7% of 416 hospitalized COVID‐19 patients, leading to a higher mortality rate compared with those without myocardial injury (51.2% versus 4.5%, respectively). 12 Viral activated cytokine storm syndrome in fulminant myocarditis could play a major role in COVID‐19 mortality. 13 CHF was present in up to 23.0% of COVID‐19 patients and was more prevalent in nonsurvivors compared with survivors (52% versus 12%; P < 0.0001). 14 AF is associated with in‐hospital mortality and morbidity in patients with acute myocarditis. 15 Inflammatory cytokines, including CRP (C‐reactive protein), interleukin‐6, and tumor necrosis factor‐α, may have an important role in AF pathogenesis. 16 Guidelines for the management of AF in various conditions and populations have been published 17, 18; however, guidance for managing AF in COVID‐19 patients is currently not available.

### The incidence and impact of atrial fibrillation on hospitalized coronavirus disease-2019 patients [^112GWpnC]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The Coronavirus disease‐2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic has posed a challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. As researchers continue to understand the intricate interactions between COVID‐19 and various pre‐existing medical conditions, emerging evidence suggests that cardiovascular comorbidities may play a significant role in the clinical course and outcomes of COVID‐19 patients.

Among these comorbidities, atrial fibrillation (AF), one of the most common cardiac arrhythmias, has emerged as a topic of interest in COVID‐19 research. An increasing body of evidence suggests that AF, may play a crucial role in shaping the clinical outcomes of COVID‐19 patients. Several preliminary studies have hinted at a potential bidirectional link between COVID‐19 and AF. One study conducted by Daniel D et al. reported a higher prevalence of AF in severe COVID‐19 cases compared to milder cases. Additionally, recent evidence suggests that COVID‐19 may lead to myocardial injury and contribute to AF initiation or exacerbation. However, the mechanisms underlying this relationship remain largely elusive.

Understanding the impact of AF on COVID‐19 patients is essential for optimizing clinical management strategies. The presence of AF may pose unique challenges for antiviral therapies, immunomodulatory drugs, and anticoagulant regimens used in COVID‐19 treatment. This research paper aims to comprehensively investigate the implications of AF on hospitalized COVID‐19 patients.

### The association between COVID-19 infection and incident atrial fibrillation: results from a retrospective cohort study using a large US commercial insurance database [^1173neyY]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since its emergence in 2019, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has led to considerable morbidity and mortality globally. A few studies have examined the relationship between COVID-19 and new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF), with mixed results. AF is a common arrhythmia conferring its own risks of complications, many of which align with those associated with COVID-19 (eg, stroke, heart failure and death). In their study comparing the incidence of AF among patients hospitalised with COVID-19 versus those hospitalised without COVID-19, Wollborn et al observed the COVID-19 cohort to have 19% higher risk of new onset AF (OR 1.19; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.41) as compared with the non-COVID-19 cohort. In contrast, when comparing outcomes among patients hospitalised with COVID-19 to those hospitalised with influenza in France, Piroth et al observed a significantly lower risk of developing AF (12.4% vs 15.8%; p < 0.0001) among the former cohort as compared with the latter.

While these prior studies offer critical insights, the apparent inconsistencies in their findings make it difficult to draw further conclusions on the potential causal relationship between COVID-19 and AF. Further, these studies have focused on patients hospitalised with COVID-19, representing a sicker cohort of patients affected by COVID-19. Though rates of COVID-19 hospitalisation have been substantial and varied by different phases of the pandemic, it may be argued that a considerably higher proportion of COVID-19 cases were treated in a community setting. The objective of this study was to assess the 12-month risk of incident AF among patients diagnosed with COVID-19 when compared with those with non-COVID-19 acute upper respiratory infections (AURI) in a broad population of patients treated in non-acute and acute care settings.

### Initial precipitants and recurrence of atrial fibrillation [^11371peK]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) may occur after an acute precipitant and subsequently resolve. Management guidelines for AF in these settings are unclear as the risk of recurrent AF and related morbidity is poorly understood. We examined the relations between acute precipitants of AF and long-term recurrence of AF in a clinical setting.

Methods

From a multi-institutional longitudinal electronic medical record database, we identified patients with newly diagnosed AF between 2000 and 2014. We developed algorithms to identify acute AF precipitants (surgery, sepsis, pneumonia, pneumothorax, respiratory failure, myocardial infarction, thyrotoxicosis, alcohol, pericarditis, pulmonary embolism, and myocarditis). We assessed risks of AF recurrence in individuals with and without a precipitant and the relations between AF recurrence and heart failure, stroke, and mortality.

Results

Among 10 723 patients with newly diagnosed AF (67.9 ± 9.9 years, 41% women), 19% had an acute AF precipitant, the most common of which were cardiac surgery (22%), pneumonia (20%), and noncardiothoracic surgery (15%). The cumulative incidence of AF recurrence at 5 years was 41% among individuals with a precipitant compared with 52% in those without a precipitant (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.75 [95% CI, 0.69–0.81]; P < 0.001). The lowest risk of recurrence among those with precipitants occurred with postoperative AF (5-year incidence 32% in cardiac surgery and 39% in noncardiothoracic surgery). Regardless of the presence of an initial precipitant, recurrent AF was associated with increased adjusted risks of heart failure (hazard ratio, 2.74 [95% CI, 2.39–3.15]; P < 0.001), stroke (hazard ratio, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.30–1.90]; P < 0.001), and mortality (hazard ratio, 2.96 [95% CI, 2.70–3.24]; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

AF after an acute precipitant frequently recurs, although the risk of recurrence is lower than among individuals without an acute precipitant. Recurrence is associated with substantial long-term morbidity and mortality. Future studies should address surveillance and management after newly diagnosed AF in the setting of an acute precipitant.

### Atrial fibrillation in the ICU [^112LTDvz]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered in the ICU. Preexisting AF is highly prevalent among older patients with chronic conditions who are at risk for critical illness, whereas new-onset AF can be triggered by accelerated atrial remodeling and arrhythmogenic triggers encountered during critical illness. The acute loss of atrial systole and onset of rapid ventricular rates that characterize new-onset AF often lead to decreased cardiac output and hemodynamic compromise. Thus, new-onset AF is both a marker of disease severity as well as a likely contributor to poor outcomes, similar to other manifestations of organ dysfunction during critical illness. Evaluating immediate hemodynamic effects of new-onset AF during critical illness is an important component of rapid clinical assessment aimed at identifying patients in need of urgent direct current cardioversion, treatment of reversible inciting factors, and identification of patients who may benefit from pharmacologic rate or rhythm control. In addition to acute hemodynamic effects, new-onset AF during critical illness is associated with both short- and long-term increases in the risk of stroke, heart failure, and death, with AF recurrence rates of approximately 50% within 1 year following hospital discharge. In the absence of a strong evidence base, there is substantial practice variation in the choice of strategies for management of new-onset AF during critical illness. We describe acute and long-term evaluation and management strategies based on current evidence and propose future avenues of investigation to fill large knowledge gaps in the management of patients with AF during critical illness.

### Thromboembolic risk in patients with pneumonia and new-onset atrial fibrillation not receiving anticoagulation therapy [^115wZyXs]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Among 293 051 patients with community-acquired pneumonia and no history of AF, 3.8% developed AF after pneumonia hospitalization. Without OAC therapy, new-onset AF was associated with a 2.1% 1-year risk of arterial thromboembolic events (1.4% among patients with intermediate stroke risk and 2.8% among patients at high risk). The 3-year risks were 3.5% and 5.3%, respectively. These estimates exceed the general threshold of 1.7% per year for vitamin K antagonists and 0.9% for the non–vitamin K OACs for obtaining a positive net clinical benefit of stroke prevention, and are considerably higher than risks observed among patients with pneumonia without AF. Among patients with new-onset AF, 32.9% (95% CI, 31.8%-34.1%) had a new hospital or outpatient clinic contact with AF and 14.0% (95% CI, 13.2%-14.9%) initiated OAC during follow-up.

Comparison With Other Studies

This study expands the evidence suggesting that there is an increased risk of thromboembolism in patients with infection-related AF, and it adds to the notion that new-onset AF should not be regarded as self-limiting and benign. Previous studies have demonstrated similar relative risk of thromboembolism in patients with infection-related AF compared with patients with AF without infection matched by baseline OAC treatment status, and in patients with infections without AF. Among patients with infection-related AF, pneumonia was associated with the highest risk of thromboembolic events, but the association has also has been demonstrated in patients with sepsis. The benefit of OAC therapy was similar between matched patients with infection-related AF and non–infection-related AF; for infection-related AF, the adjusted HR for thromboembolism was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.68–0.83) compared with those without OAC therapy, and for non–infection-related AF the HR was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.63–0.78). Most previous studies have only reported the relative risks, which does not inform about baseline risk and may obscure the magnitude of the association. In many situations, the absolute risk gives a better representation of the clinical situation, also from the patient's point of view. Our study reporting absolute risks and focusing on a specific infection in patients without OAC, therefore, supports and strengthens the validity of previous findings.

### Comparative effectiveness of heart rate control medications for the treatment of sepsis-associated atrial fibrillation [^113DtqfB]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response frequently complicates the management of critically ill patients with sepsis and may necessitate the initiation of medication to avoid hemodynamic compromise. However, the optimal medication to achieve rate control for AF with rapid ventricular response in sepsis is unclear.

Research Question

What is the comparative effectiveness of frequently used AF medications (β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, amiodarone, and digoxin) on heart rate (HR) reduction among critically ill patients with sepsis and AF with rapid ventricular response?

Study Design and Methods

We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study among patients with sepsis and AF with rapid ventricular response (HR > 110 beats/min). We compared the rate control effectiveness of β-blockers to calcium channel blockers, amiodarone, and digoxin using multivariate-adjusted, time-varying exposures in competing risk models (for death and addition of another AF medication), adjusting for fixed and time-varying confounders.

Results

Among 666 included patients, 50.6% initially received amiodarone, 10.1% received a β-blocker, 33.8% received a calcium channel blocker, and 5.6% received digoxin. The adjusted hazard ratio for HR of < 110 beats/min by 1 h was 0.50 (95% CI, 0.34–0.74) for amiodarone vs β-blocker, 0.37 (95% CI, 0.18–0.77) for digoxin vs β-blocker, and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.51–1.11) for calcium channel blocker vs β-blocker. By 6 h, the adjusted hazard ratio for HR < 110 beats/min was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.47–0.97) for amiodarone vs β-blocker, 0.60 (95% CI, 0.36–1.004) for digoxin vs β-blocker, and 1.03 (95% CI, 0.71–1.49) for calcium channel blocker vs β-blocker.

Interpretation

In a large cohort of patients with sepsis and AF with rapid ventricular response, a β-blocker treatment strategy was associated with improved HR control at 1 h, but generally similar HR control at 6 h compared with amiodarone, calcium channel blocker, or digoxin.

### Atrial fibrillation is an independent predictor of mortality in critically ill patients [^1117EraZ]. Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Atrial fibrillation has been associated with increased mortality in critically ill patients. We sought to determine whether atrial fibrillation in the ICU is an independent risk factor for death. A secondary objective was to determine if patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation have different risk factors or outcomes compared with patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation.

Design

Prospective observational cohort study.

Setting

Medical and general surgical ICUs in a tertiary academic medical center.

Patients

One thousand seven hundred seventy critically ill patients requiring at least 2 days in the ICU.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Demographics, medical history, development of atrial fibrillation, fluid balance, echocardiographic findings, medication administration, and hospital mortality were collected during the first 4 days of ICU admission. Atrial fibrillation occurred in 236 patients (13%) (Any AF). Of these, 123 patients (7%) had no prior atrial fibrillation (New-onset AF) while the remaining 113 (6%) had recurrent atrial fibrillation (Recurrent AF). Any AF was associated with male gender, Caucasian race, increased age, cardiac disease, organ failures, and disease severity. Patients with Any AF had increased mortality compared with those without atrial fibrillation (31% vs 17%; p < 0.001), and Any AF was independently associated with death (odds ratio, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.14–2.29; p = 0.007) in multivariable analysis controlling for severity of illness and other confounders. The association of atrial fibrillation with death was magnified in patients without sepsis (odds ratio, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.52–5.60; p = 0.001). Treatment for atrial fibrillation had no effect on hospital mortality. New-onset AF and Recurrent AF were each associated with increased mortality. New-onset AF, but not Recurrent AF, was associated with increased diastolic dysfunction and vasopressor use and a greater cumulative positive fluid balance.

Conclusions

Atrial fibrillation in critical illness, whether new-onset or recurrent, is independently associated with increased hospital mortality, especially in patients without sepsis.

### Stroke risk factors, genetics, and prevention [^1142DV1r]. Circulation Research (2017). Low credibility.

Stroke is a heterogeneous syndrome, and determining risk factors and treatment depends on the specific pathogenesis of stroke. Risk factors for stroke can be categorized as modifiable and nonmodifiable. Age, sex, and race/ethnicity are nonmodifiable risk factors for both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, while hypertension, smoking, diet, and physical inactivity are among some of the more commonly reported modifiable risk factors. More recently described risk factors and triggers of stroke include inflammatory disorders, infection, pollution, and cardiac atrial disorders independent of atrial fibrillation. Single-gene disorders may cause rare, hereditary disorders for which stroke is a primary manifestation. Recent research also suggests that common and rare genetic polymorphisms can influence risk of more common causes of stroke, due to both other risk factors and specific stroke mechanisms, such as atrial fibrillation. Genetic factors, particularly those with environmental interactions, may be more modifiable than previously recognized. Stroke prevention has generally focused on modifiable risk factors. Lifestyle and behavioral modification, such as dietary changes or smoking cessation, not only reduces stroke risk, but also reduces the risk of other cardiovascular diseases. Other prevention strategies include identifying and treating medical conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, that increase stroke risk. Recent research into risk factors and genetics of stroke has not only identified those at risk for stroke but also identified ways to target at-risk populations for stroke prevention.

### Thromboembolic risk in patients with pneumonia and new-onset atrial fibrillation not receiving anticoagulation therapy [^1152sECL]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

From a clinical point of view, our study has 2 major implications. First, our findings suggest that new-onset AF during pneumonia is a marker of future AF. This implies that vigilance for recurrent AF may be warranted and that attention should be given to each episode of infection-related AF, regardless of its duration, to tailor surveillance in patients developing this complication. Second, our findings suggest that new-onset AF occurring with pneumonia is associated with a risk of thromboembolism that reaches a level where OAC therapy is considered beneficial. The question remains whether these patients should initiate lifelong OAC therapy. Previously, a UK study found that patients with resolved AF remained at higher risk of stroke than patients without AF. According to current guidelines, patients with non–infection-related AF receive OAC therapy according to their perceived stroke risk rather than the heart rhythm displayed at a particular time. The updated European Society of Cardiology guidelinesstate that the clinical pattern of AF (ie, first detected, paroxysmal, persistent, longstanding persistent, or permanent) should not condition the indication to thromboprophylaxis. In the era of non–vitamin K OAC therapy, perhaps it is time for infection-related AF to be treated in the same way as non–infection-related AF, with long-term anticoagulation maintained in patients with manifested clinical stroke risk factors. However, the decision to initiate anticoagulation treatment in the setting of severe infections is complex. High bleeding risk due to systemic activation of the inflammatory response and depletion of coagulation factors and platelets may outweigh the benefits of anticoagulation. Most trials investigating different OAC therapies for stroke prophylaxis excluded patients with AF due to reversible conditions, and high-quality evidence regarding the role of OAC in patients with infection-related AF is lacking.

### Incidence, risk factors and outcomes of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with sepsis: a systematic review [^1155q2de]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Data sources and search strategy

We searched the literature from 1966 through 2013 using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science. In our query we used compound search strings for both the determinant (atrial fibrillation) and domain (sepsis) (see Additional file 1 of the online supplemental digital content for full specification of our search query). Only articles published in English, Dutch, French or German were considered for this review. We screened titles and abstracts of identified articles and included all studies describing the incidence, risk factors or outcome of new-onset AF, atrial flutter or other supraventricular tachycardia occurring during ICU stay in adult patients with sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock. Patients with a supraventricular tachycardia that was not further specified or of unknown origin were included because we expected a high percentage of AF among these patients. Furthermore, we also included reports that primarily focused on patients with severe sepsis and septic shock but that were not specifically restricted to the ICU setting, because we expected a high proportion of critically ill patients to be represented in these studies. We excluded reports that primarily included patients following cardiotomy, that contained no original data, that were published only in abstract form, or that provided no clear definition of the patients or the arrhythmia being studied. Institutional Review Board approval was not sought since our study did not involve human research.

Quality assessment

Studies that met the inclusion criteria were evaluated for their methodological quality using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines. The following items were assessed: study design, sample size, domain definition, determinant parameterization, risk factor parameterization and outcome parameterization. We scored all items on a four-point scale from low to high.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 and cardiovascular complications: focused clinical review [^112mbXj4]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

ARRHYTHMIAS

In COVID-19 patients, arrhythmias may occur because of cardiac injury (inflammation, ischemia, stress); the detrimental systemic effects of COVID-19 (dehydration, hypoxia, electrolyte abnormalities) or the pro-arrhythmic effects of the drugs given to the patients before or during the infection. Approximately 6–17% of COVID-19 patients develop arrhythmias, and this percentage increases markedly (up to 44%) in patients treated in ICU. Sinus tachycardia is common in COVID-19 patients, in whom it becomes most frequently manifest as palpitations, whereas the most frequent pathological arrhythmias are atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter and ventricular arrhythmias. In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the prevalence of atrial fibrillation was reported to range between 9 and 21%. Bradyarrhythmias were also not rare, that is, there was 8% of patients with sinus bradycardia and another 8% with complete heart block. In a study of COVID-19 patients from Spain, the prevalence of previously known atrial fibrillation was 18.8% whereas new-onset atrial fibrillation involved 7.5% of the patients. New-onset of atrial fibrillation during hospital was an independent predictor of in-hospital embolic events.

### National trends in healthcare-associated infections for five common cardiovascular conditions [^113FB421]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Healthcare-associated infections (HAI) are generally preventable causes of increased cost, morbidity, and mortality. Further, HAI carry penalties in the era of hospital value-based care. However, very little is known about the incidence and outcomes of HAI among patients hospitalized with common cardiovascular conditions. Using a national database, we identified adults aged ≥ 18 years hospitalized with 5 common cardiovascular conditions, including heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, cardiogenic shock, and atrial fibrillation or flutter. We assessed for temporal trends in incidence, cost, length of stay (LOS), and mortality associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, central line-associated bloodstream infection, and Clostridium difficile infections. Between 2008 and 2015, we identified 159,021 hospitalizations ≥ 1 HAI (49.6% heart failure, 20.4% acute myocardial infarction, 10.5% coronary artery bypass grafting, 18.6% cardiogenic shock, and 11.9% atrial fibrillation or flutter). Clostridium difficile infections (75.4%) were the most common followed by catheter-associated urinary tract infections (15.1%), ventilator-associated pneumonia (7.9%), and central line-associated bloodstream infection (3.1%). Nearly half of the patients (46.3%) with HAI required discharge to a skilled care facility compared with 15.7% of patients who did not. After propensity matching, HAI remained associated with an increased LOS (4.9 vs 9.6 days, p < 0.0001), total hospital charges ($79,227 vs $50,699, p < 0.0001), and in-hospital mortality (13% vs 10.4%, p < 0.0001) compared with patients who did not acquire a HAI. In conclusion, patients with cardiovascular disease acquiring a HAI had substantially higher costs, LOS, and mortality.

### One-year outcomes in atrial fibrillation presenting during infections: a nationwide registry-based study [^114sSNga]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

Thromboprophylaxis guidelines for patients with concurrent atrial fibrillation (AF) during infections are unclear and not supported by data. We compared 1-year outcomes in patients with infection-related AF and infection without AF.

Methods and Results

By crosslinking Danish nationwide registry data, AF naïve patients admitted with infection (1996–2016) were identified. Those with AF during the infection (infection-related AF) were matched 1:3 according to age, sex, type of infection, and year with patients with infection without AF. Outcomes (AF, thromboembolic events) were assessed by multivariable Cox regression. The study population comprised 30 307 patients with infection-related AF and 90 912 patients with infection without AF [median age 79years (interquartile range 71–86), 47.6% males in both groups]. The 1-year absolute risk of AF and thromboembolic events were 36.4% and 7.6%, respectively (infection-related AF) and 1.9% and 4.4%, respectively (infection without AF). In the multivariable analyses, infection-related AF was associated with an increased long-term risk of AF and thromboembolic events compared with infection without AF: hazard ratio (HR) 25.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 24.64–27.39 for AF and HR 2.10, 95% CI 1.98–2.22 for thromboembolic events. Further, differences in risks existed across different subtypes of infections.

Conclusion

During the first year after discharge, 36% of patients with infection-related AF had a new hospital contact with AF. Infection-related AF was associated with increased risk of thromboembolic events compared with infection without AF and our results suggest that AF related to infection may merit treatment and follow-up similar to that of AF not related to infection.

### Risk factors and prognosis of new-onset atrial fibrillation in sepsis: a nationwide electronic health record study [^114ynA98]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Our findings reinforce the need to actively screen AF and risk stratify AF patients with sepsis so they can receive appropriate treatment. Adding to this matter, a Danish nationwide study has investigated the broader problem of infection-related new-onset AF, similarly to sepsis, and increased thromboembolic risk was observed for infection-related AF, prompting the need for risk stratification and potential use of anticoagulation in AF arising in the setting of any infectious process. Our observations are of interest for local agencies like the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence but could also provide support to other international AF and sepsis guidelines.

Our study has some limitations that need to be highlighted. First, these are UK data, representing a majority of Caucasian elderly patients, and may not apply to countries with a different demographic structure. Second, as for every electronic health records investigation, it is possible some AF cases may have been misclassified due to coding. However, we have utilized a validated AF definition, which has previously reproduced results from Framingham Heart Study and other landmark studies with clinical adjudication. Finally, as for every observational analysis, we cannot infer causality and there is the risk of unmeasured risk factors or comorbidities. We overcame this limitation by including key comorbidities supported by the previous literature.

### Comparative thromboembolic risk in atrial fibrillation patients with and without a concurrent infection [^114zLtvL]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to compare long-term thromboembolic risk in infection-related and non-infection-related atrial fibrillation (AF).

Methods

Using Danish nationwide registries, we identified patients with first-time AF from 1996–2015 and performed a retrospective cohort study. We did a 1:1 match (upon sex, age, calendar year, and oral anticoagulation (OAC) status at the beginning of follow-up) of patients with infection-related (concurrent discharge diagnosis code for infection) and non-infection-related AF. Long-term outcomes were examined using multivariable Cox regression analyses.

Results

Our study population comprised 48,644 patients equally distributed on infection-related and non-infection-related AF. In both groups, those initiated on OAC therapy were younger than those not initiated on OAC therapy (median age 77 years, interquartile range 69–83 versus median age 79 years, interquartile range 71–86). During the 1st year of follow up, infection-related AF was associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events compared with non-infection-related AF: adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.44 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16–1.78) for those initiated on OAC therapy and HR 1.17 (95% CI 1.06–1.28) for those not initiated on OAC therapy. In both groups, OAC therapy was associated with better outcomes than no OAC therapy (HR of thromboembolic events 0.75 (95% CI 0.68–0.83) and HR 0.70 (95% CI 0.63–0.78) for patients with infection-related and non-infection-related AF, respectively).

Conclusion

Infection was associated with an increased thromboembolic risk in patients with first-time AF. OAC therapy was associated with a similar risk-reduction in AF patients with and without a concurrent infection.

### Thromboembolic risk in patients with pneumonia and new-onset atrial fibrillation not receiving anticoagulation therapy [^111NiXF7]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Potential Explanations and Clinical Implications

Several mechanisms explain why infections can trigger AF, including systemic inflammation, electrophysiological disturbances, metabolic imbalances, hypoxia, and dysvolemia. New-onset AF after pneumonia may identify a subset of patients who have a substrate for thromboembolism regardless of the arrhythmia. A key finding of our study was that the AF episode was not a transient, self-limited event, because approximately one-third of patients had a new hospital AF diagnosis during follow-up. This corroborates previous findings, and suggests that restoration of sinus rhythm with resolution of infection may not protect against AF recurrence. In this respect, infection may merely be a stress test that demonstrates the likelihood for future AF. The substantial observed risk of recurrent AF suggests that individuals with new-onset AF in the context of pneumonia may have underlying predisposition to AF. Indeed, patients with AF in our cohort were older and had a high prevalence of comorbidities, both associated with high risk of AF and thromboembolism.

### The future of atrial fibrillation management: integrated care and stratified therapy [^111xAZtD]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is one of the major cardiovascular health problems: it is a common, chronic condition, affecting 2–3% of the population in Europe and the USA and requiring 1–3% of health-care expenditure as a result of stroke, sudden death, heart failure, unplanned hospital admissions, and other complications. Early diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, ideally before the first complication occurs, remains a challenge, as shown by patients who are only diagnosed with the condition when admitted to hospital for acute cardiac decompensation or stroke. Once diagnosed, atrial fibrillation requires chronic, multidimensional management in five domains (acute management, treatment of underlying and concomitant cardiovascular conditions, stroke prevention therapy, rate control, and rhythm control). The consistent provision of these treatment options to all patients with atrial fibrillation is difficult, despite recent improvements in organisation of care, knowledge about atrial fibrillation, and treatment options. Integrated care models that provide patient-centred care in, or close to, the patient's community while maintaining access to all specialist treatment options, emerge as the best approach to achieve consistent delivery of these chronic treatments to all patients with atrial fibrillation. Ongoing research efforts will establish when to initiate oral anticoagulation in patients with device-detected atrial high-rate episodes, quantify the prognostic effect of early and comprehensive rhythm control therapy, including atrial fibrillation ablation, and delineate optimum methods to reduce bleeding complications in patients treated with anticoagulation. Additionally, research efforts are needed to define different types of atrial fibrillation on the basis of the main causes of atrial fibrillation to pave the way for the clinical development of stratified atrial fibrillation therapy.

### Incidence, risk factors and outcomes of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with sepsis: a systematic review [^111f9c8q]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

New-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common complication of critical illness, with a reported incidence that varies from 4 to 9% in general intensive care unit (ICU) patients to 32 to 50% in postcardiotomy patients. Furthermore, new-onset AF predicts mortality in patients who are hospitalized for heart failure as well as various other critical conditions, although it is possible that AF in these cases is primarily a marker of disease severity rather than a direct cause of death. Nonetheless, the development of AF is associated with a sudden reduction in cardiac output and rise in filling pressures and it is, therefore, possible that increased mortality is due to the adverse consequences of AF on cardiac function. In addition, chronic AF is associated with thromboembolic complications, and it is plausible that some of these risks also affect critically ill patients with an acute episode of AF.

Although cardiac arrhythmias in the general ICU population have been described since the early 1990s, most authors have studied unselected cohorts of patients, with neither exclusion of subjects who had a cardiac reason for admission nor those with a known history of chronic or paroxysmal AF. As a consequence, the true incidence and prognosis of new-onset AF in patients presenting with sepsis remains unknown.

Sepsis is characterized by a systemic release of proinflammatory cytokines, high levels of circulating stress hormones, autonomic dysfunction, and may be complicated by organ dysfunction. In addition, intravascular volume shifts and cardiovascular compromise will frequently lead to hypotension and elevated lactate levels. All of these features of sepsis are possible triggers for the development of AF.

If AF causes poor outcome it might be desirable to start antiarrhythmic prophylaxis in critically ill patients with sepsis in an attempt to prevent this complication. Current guidelines advise the use of beta blockers or amiodarone to prevent postoperative AF in patients following cardiac surgery and it is conceivable that a preemptive strategy could also be effective in patients with (severe) sepsis. Identification of patients at highest risk for AF is therefore important. We aimed to gain better understanding of the incidence, risk factors and outcomes of new-onset AF in critically ill patients with sepsis.

Sepsis-related atrial fibrillation (AF) — incidence and outcomes are substantial: new-onset AF was common (5.9%) in patients hospitalized with sepsis (compared to 0.65% of those without sepsis, OR 6.82, 95% CI 5.44–7.11) and was related to an increased risk of in-hospital stroke (2.7-fold) and mortality; most sepsis survivors with new-onset AF during sepsis have AF occurring after discharge and have increased long-term risks of heart failure, ischaemic stroke, and death, and the new development of AF during sepsis in the critically ill indicates a propensity to develop incident AF later in life.

Key points
- Atrial fibrillation, often called AFib or AF, is the most common type of treated heart arrhythmia.
- Some people who have AFib don't know they have it and don't have any symptoms. What it is Atrial fibrillation, often called AFib or AF, is the most common type of treated heart arrhythmia. An arrhythmia is when the heart beats too slowly, too fast, or in an irregular way. When a person has AFib, the normal beating in the upper chambers of the heart is irregular, and blood doesn't flow as well as it should from the atria to the lower chambers of the heart. AFib may happen in brief episodes, or it may be a permanent condition. Risk factors The risk for AFib increases with age. High blood pressure, the risk for which also increases with advancing age, accounts for about 1 in 5 cases of AFib. Risk factors for AFib include:

- Advancing age.
- High blood pressure.
- Obesity.
- European ancestry.
- Diabetes.
- Heart failure.
- Ischemic heart disease.
- Hyperthyroidism.
- Chronic kidney disease.
- Moderate to heavy alcohol use.
- Smoking.
- Enlargement of the chambers on the left side of the heart. How is AFib related to stroke. AFib increases a person's risk for stroke. When standard stroke risk factors were accounted for, AFib was associated with an approximately fivefold increased risk of ischemic stroke. AFib causes about 1 in 7 strokes. Strokes caused by complications from AFib tend to be more severe than strokes with other underlying causes. Strokes happen when blood flow to the brain is blocked by a blood clot or by fatty deposits called plaque in the blood vessel lining. Treatment and recovery Treatment for AFib can include:

- Medicines to control the heart's rhythm and rate.
- Blood-thinning medicine to prevent blood clots from forming and reduce stroke risk.
- Surgery.
- Medicine and healthy lifestyle changes to manage AFib risk factors. What are the consequences of AFib.

More than 454, 000 hospitalizations with AFib as the primary diagnosis happen each year in the US. The condition contributes to about 158, 000 deaths each year. The death rate from AFib as the primary or a contributing cause of death has been rising for more than two decades.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, which was first reported in 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China. 1, 2 It infects host cells through angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 membrane receptors, which are highly expressed in heart and lungs, especially in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease. 3 COVID‐19 patients with underlying cardiovascular disease have increased risk of morbidity and mortality from complicated myocardial injury, myocarditis, congestive heart failure (CHF), thromboembolism, and arrhythmias. 4 Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia seen in critically ill patients. 5 Several potential pharmacotherapies are emerging. 4, 6 Risks of arrhythmogenic effects of COVID‐19 pharmacotherapies have been noted 4, 7 (Table). The overall objective of this review is to provide practical guidance for clinicians who are managing COVID‐19 patients with concomitant AF recommendations (Figure 1) based on the pharmacological characteristics of COVID‐19 pharmacotherapies, anticoagulants, and antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) in the setting of limited clinical data.

Among the cohort, 16 815 patients died at the time of the NVAF diagnosis (or during the entry NVAF hospitalisation) and overall, 22 325 died within 1 month of diagnosis. The most common causes of death in the 30 days following NVAF diagnostic were cardiac (28.5%), cancer (24%), pulmonary (9.5%), infections (7.3%), and stroke (6.4%). The corresponding 30‐day case‐fatality risk was 9.2% (95% CI 9.0 to 9.3), with 83% of these deaths occurring in the first week. Compared with women, men had a higher 30‐day case‐fatality (age‐standardized case‐fatality 10.0% (95% CI 9.8 to 10.1) and 8.46 (95% CI 8.30 to 8.61), respectively, P < 0.0001). As expected, the 30‐day case‐fatality increased steadily with CHADS₂ score, ranging from 3.04% (95% CI 2.89 to 3.19) for a score of 1 to 26.79% (95% CI 24.30 to 29.28) for a score of 6, and was much higher for patients diagnosed in hospital, whether it was a primary or a secondary diagnosis (Table 3). Also, case‐fatality varied greatly according to associated comorbidities at the time of diagnosis, from 22.24% (95% CI 21.69 to 22.80) in patients with recent acute coronary syndrome, to 5.85% (95% CI 5.69 to 6.02) in patients with hypertension without cardiac or chronic kidney disease (Table 4). Figure 3 describes the 30‐day case‐fatality stratified by age and sex, showing that the difference in case‐fatality was more pronounced in the elderly.

### Incidence, risk factors and outcomes of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with sepsis: a systematic review [^111MUuQ7]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Outcomes of new-onset AF in patients with sepsis were described in five studies. All studies consistently reported worse outcome in patients with new-onset AF as compared to patients with preserved sinus rhythm, although only two studies used multivariate analyses to adjust for baseline imbalances. Even then, residual confounding in both studies is likely since only limited numbers of covariables were collected and time-dependent variations in the evolution of disease severity prior to the onset of AF were ignored. Methodologically advanced analytical approaches are necessary to demonstrate genuinely independent associations with morbidity and mortality. In the end, therefore, it still remains somewhat elusive to what extent new-onset AF in patients with sepsis truly impacts outcome. However, given the consistency of the findings across settings and biological plausibility, a relation that is (at least in part) causal seems likely.

Additional morbidity and mortality following the development of AF in patients with sepsis may be explained by the decrease in cardiac output and blood pressure that occurs in most patients due to reduced left ventricular filling. This is particularly the case in the presence of rapid ventricular response rates. The resulting hemodynamic compromise may impair the recovery of organ function in patients with severe sepsis or shock. Furthermore, AF has been associated with the development of intracardiac thrombi, posing a subsequent risk of systemic embolization and stroke. Harm, however, may also result from the indiscriminate use of anticoagulants in patients with AF, particularly in an ICU setting. Unfortunately, there are presently no evidence-based guidelines for the use of anticoagulant prophylaxis in these patients.

Taken together, the management of new-onset AF in critically ill patients with sepsis poses a major clinical challenge. It may therefore be desirable to start pharmacological prophylaxis in an attempt to prevent this complication rather than to be reactive, provided that it is possible to adequately identify patients who are at highest risk for developing AF during sepsis. A recent study investigating the effect of esmolol in patients with septic shock gives support to the feasibility of such approach. Although reducing heart rate is likely to improve cardiovascular function, treating sinus tachycardia - and thereby possibly preventing AF - in patients with sepsis remains controversial, however, and further research is necessary before any recommendations regarding pharmacological prophylaxis can be made.

### Risk factors and prognosis of new-onset atrial fibrillation in sepsis: a nationwide electronic health record study [^111iMhuy]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The length of hospitalization in AF patients with sepsis was significantly longer than for patients without the 2 conditions. In our study, the mean number in days in hospital was similar to the one described by Guenancia and colleagues, but shorter than reported by Christian et al. Furthermore, we observed a 40% higher rate of septic shock in patients with new-onset AF and sepsis, supporting previous reports of higher severity of sepsis in the AF population from previous studies, which may explain why these patients have higher mortality during hospitalization.

Similarly to Walkey et al, we observed a high mortality during follow-up (approximately 75% at 5 years) in patients with sepsis and new-onset AF, which was higher than for patients with sepsis without AF. On the other hand, we observed a much higher rate of stroke at 5 years (nearly 20% based on survival curves) than the aforementioned study, and more in line with the rate observed by Ayaz et al.

Patients with sepsis may be at increased risk of myocardial stress and AF due to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, changes in vascular volume, high stress hormones, autonomic dysfunction, and cardiovascular injury. These inflammatory responses may cause myocardial electrophysiological instability and necrosis, which in turn may induce various arrhythmias, especially AF. The systemic inflammatory response may also trigger a coagulopathic state, leading to stroke. However, our findings suggest that AF in the sepsis population represents more than a stress response during infection and signals the presence of an important prothrombotic risk state that remains even after treatment of the index insult. Of relevance, use of anticoagulants in our AF cohort was low (< 1/3 as per our previous publication) as most patients were hospitalized prior to the publication of the CHA₂DS₂ VASc score and the availability of direct oral anticoagulants in the United Kingdom.

### Variable use of amiodarone is associated with a greater risk of recurrence of atrial fibrillation in the critically ill [^115AQrPo]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac rhythm disturbance encountered in critically ill patients in the general medical or surgical intensive care unit (ICU). Depending upon the study population, AF is reported to occur at frequencies ranging from 8.3% to 46%, the latter being associated with patients who have undergone cardiac surgery or were admitted for treatment of sepsis. The occurrence of AF potentially leads to thromboembolism or haemodynamic compromise. Risk factors for the development of AF in critically ill patients have been predominantly derived from cardiothoracic surgical patients. Data on risk factors for atrial fibrillation in the non-cardiothoracic surgery ICU population are scarce.

Defined risks include: use of catecholamines and positive inotropic drugs, high severity of disease index scores, sepsis, cardiovascular disease, electrolyte disturbances, advanced age, elevated markers of inflammation, hypoxia, and high central venous pressures. Whether part of the patient's prior history, new in onset or recurrent, AF has been shown to be an independent risk factor for mortality in the ICU. Of note, new-onset AF has been associated with increased diastolic dysfunction, vasopressor use, and a greater cumulative positive fluid balance, although similar data are not widely available for recurrent AF in the ICU.

Amiodarone is considered the drug of choice for the treatment of AF in the ICU. Two randomised controlled trials have shown amiodarone to be effective in converting AF into sinus rhythm in this setting. The efficacy of amiodarone has also been confirmed by other studies showing that it is effective at both converting AF into sinus rhythm and controlling ventricular rate, while being haemodynamically well tolerated. Many dosing regimens have been described with no consensus on the optimal treatment strategy. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the effect of variation in amiodarone use on dysrhythmia recurrence in patients with new-onset AF admitted to a non-cardiothoracic ICU.

### Incidence, risk factors and outcomes of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with sepsis: a systematic review [^111Axbg9]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Key messages

New-onset AF is a common complication in critically ill patients with sepsis and its incidence increases with progression of the disease stage.
New-onset AF is independently associated with a risk of stroke, a prolonged length of stay in the ICU, and increased mortality.
Early identification of patients who are at increased risk for developing AF seems feasible and may allow for pharmacological interventions to prevent this complication.

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Atrial septal defect (ASD) — clinical course of unrepaired lesions explains that left‑to‑right shunt produces right ventricular (RV) volume overload and pulmonary overcirculation; large shunts can cause frequent pulmonary infections, fatigue, exercise intolerance, palpitations, and right‑sided heart failure; atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, and sick sinus syndrome commonly result from longstanding right‑sided volume and pressure overload; large shunts are accompanied by flow‑related pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and pulmonary vascular obstructive disease may develop later than in high‑pressure shunts such as ventricular septal defect (VSD) or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA); paradoxical embolism is a risk for all defect sizes; adults most commonly present with dyspnea and palpitations, or with findings such as cardiomegaly on chest x‑ray, a louder murmur during pregnancy, new atrial flutter/fibrillation, or a paradoxical embolic event.

### Atrial fibrillation among Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with sepsis: incidence and risk factors [^115fr6fT]. American Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation (AF) during severe sepsis is associated with increased risks of in-hospital stroke and mortality. However, the prevalence, incidence, and risk factors associated with AF during the sepsis syndromes are unclear.

Methods

We identified patients with preexisting, newly diagnosed, or no AF in a nationally representative 5% sample of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with sepsis between 2004 and 2007. We identified multivariable-adjusted demographic and clinical characteristics associated with development of newly diagnosed AF during a sepsis hospitalization.

Results

A total of 60,209 beneficiaries had a sepsis hospitalization. Mean age was 80.2 years, 44.4% were men, and 83.1% were white. Atrial fibrillation occurred during 25.5% (95% CI 25.2–25.9) of sepsis hospitalizations, including 18.3% (18.0%-18.7%) with preexisting AF and 7.2% (7.0%-7.4%) with newly diagnosed AF. Patients with sepsis requiring intensive care had a greater risk of newly diagnosed AF (10.7%, 95% CI 10.3%-11.1%) compared with patients who did not require intensive care (4.4%, 4.2%-4.5%, P < .001). In multivariable analysis, factors associated with newly diagnosed AF during sepsis included older age, white race, acute organ dysfunction, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, right heart catheterization, diagnosis of endocarditis, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Cardiovascular comorbid conditions generally were not associated with increased risk for newly diagnosed AF during sepsis.

Conclusions

Atrial fibrillation is common among critically ill patients with sepsis. Acute factors, rather than preexisting cardiovascular comorbid conditions, are associated with increased risk for newly diagnosed AF during sepsis, suggesting that mechanisms of newly diagnosed AF during sepsis may differ from the general population of patients with AF.

### Atrial fibrillation: common questions and answers about diagnosis and treatment [^115TCGPH]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular arrhythmia that increases the risk of stroke and all-cause mortality. It is the most common cardiac dysrhythmia in adults in the primary care setting, and its prevalence increases with age. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there is insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of screening asymptomatic adults older than 50 years for atrial fibrillation. Many patients with atrial fibrillation are asymptomatic, but symptoms can include palpitations, exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and chest pain. Diagnosis is based on history and physical examination findings and should be confirmed with 12-lead electrocardiography or other recording device. The initial evaluation should include transthoracic echocardiography; serum electrolyte levels; complete blood count; and thyroid, kidney, and liver function tests. Stroke risk should be assessed in patients with atrial fibrillation using the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score. Warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants reduce the risk of stroke by preventing atrial thrombus formation and subsequent cerebral or systemic emboli. Hemodynamically unstable patients, including those with decompensated heart failure, should be evaluated and treated emergently. Most hemodynamically stable patients should be treated initially with rate control and anticoagulation. Rhythm control, using medications or procedures, should be considered in patients with hemodynamic instability or in some patients based on risk factors and shared decision-making. Electrical cardioversion may be appropriate as first-line rhythm control. Conversion to sinus rhythm with catheter ablation may be considered in patients who are unable or unwilling to take rate or rhythm control medications long-term or if medications have been ineffective.

### Prognostic impact of restored sinus rhythm in patients with sepsis and new-onset atrial fibrillation [^116hRv3i]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Key messages

New-onset atrial fibrillation (NeOAF) is prevalent and associated with increased mortality in patients with sepsis.
It remains unclear whether restored sinus rhythm (SR) of NeOAF leads to better outcomes and how to suitably manage in patients with NeOAF.
NeOAF with failure to restore SR (but not all NeOAF) was an independent risk for in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis.
Further prospective trials are warranted to elucidate the clinical implications of a rate versus a rhythm control strategy in patients with sepsis and NeOAF.

### Atrial fibrillation (chronic) [^1151roRM]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia characterised by the presence of fast and uncoordinated atrial activation leading to reduced atrial mechanical function. Risk factors for atrial fibrillation include increasing age, male sex, co-existing cardiac and thyroid disease, pyrexial illness, electrolyte imbalance, cancer, and co-existing infection.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of oral medical treatments to control heart rate in people with chronic (defined as longer than 1 week for this review) non-valvular atrial fibrillation? What is the effect of different treatment strategies (rate versus rhythm) for people with persistent non-valvular atrial fibrillation? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 23 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: beta-blockers (with or without digoxin), calcium channel blockers (with or without digoxin), calcium channel blockers (rate-limiting), digoxin, and rate versus rhythm control strategies.

### 2021 ACC / AHA key data elements and definitions for heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical data standards (writing committee to develop clinical data standards for heart failure) [^111Me5xs]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2021). High credibility.

ACC/AHA heart failure data standards — COVID-19–related myocardial injury and arrhythmia definitions specify criteria for classifying events during acute infection. Acute myocardial injury can be diagnosed with "elevation in cardiac troponin and/or with cardiac imaging such as cardiac MRI, without any evidence of decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), with no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease or without clinical or electrocardiographic evidence of acute coronary syndrome presentation during acute COVID-19 infection"; additional patterns include the same criteria "with evidence of a decline in LVEF", a right ventricular (RV) variant "with evidence of a decline in RV function", and an acute coronary syndrome presentation requiring "elevation in cardiac troponin, along with clinical presentation suggestive of acute coronary syndrome with chest pain and electrocardiographic changes during acute COVID-19 infection". Arrhythmia elements are defined as "Persistent sinus tachycardia with COVID-19 infection that cannot be explained by the degree of hypoxia, hypotension, fever, or anemia during acute COVID-19 infection", ventricular arrhythmias as "PVCs, ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation during acute COVID-19 infection", and atrial tachyarrhythmias as "Atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation during acute COVID-19 infection".

### Thromboembolic risk in patients with pneumonia and new-onset atrial fibrillation not receiving anticoagulation therapy [^111gNnnc]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the risk of thromboembolism and recurrent atrial fibrillation after infection-related atrial fibrillation?

Findings

In this cohort study including 274 196 patients with pneumonia, of whom 6553 developed atrial fibrillation, the 1-year risk of thromboembolism was 0.8% in patients without atrial fibrillation vs 2.1% in patients with atrial fibrillation. Among patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation, 32.9% had a recurrent hospital contact with atrial fibrillation and 14.0% initiated anticoagulation therapy during 3-year follow-up.

Meaning

These findings suggest that the concept of infection-related atrial fibrillation as a transient condition needs reconsideration given the high risks of recurrence combined with risks of thromboembolism that may warrant anticoagulation therapy.

### Long-term outcomes following development of new-onset atrial fibrillation during sepsis [^113xZoCQ]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

Background

New-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with adverse outcomes during a sepsis hospitalization; however, long-term outcomes following hospitalization with sepsis-associated new-onset AF are unclear.

Methods

We used a Medicare 5% sample to identify patients who survived hospitalization with sepsis between 1999 and 2010. AF status was defined as no AF, prior AF, or new-onset AF based on AF claims during and prior to a sepsis hospitalization. We used competing risk models to determine 5-year risks of AF occurrence, heart failure, ischemic stroke, and mortality after the sepsis hospitalization, according to AF status during the sepsis admission.

Results

We identified 138,722 sepsis survivors, of whom 95,536 (69%) had no AF during sepsis, 33,646 (24%) had prior AF, and 9,540 (7%) had new-onset AF during sepsis. AF occurrence following sepsis hospitalization was more common among patients with new-onset AF during sepsis (54.9%) than in patients with no AF during sepsis (15.5%). Compared with patients with no AF during sepsis, those with new-onset AF during sepsis had greater 5-year risks of hospitalization for heart failure (11.2% vs 8.2%; multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.25; 95% CI, 1.16–1.34), ischemic stroke (5.3% vs 4.7%; HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.10–1.36), and death (74.8% vs 72.1%; HR, 1.04; 95% CI,1.01–1.07).

Conclusions

Most sepsis survivors with new-onset AF during sepsis have AF occur after discharge from the sepsis hospitalization and have increased long-term risks of heart failure, ischemic stroke, and death. Our findings may have implications for posthospitalization surveillance of patients with new-onset AF during a sepsis hospitalization.

### Risk factors for new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113uZRnP]. Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Atrial fibrillation frequently develops in patients with sepsis and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, risk factors for new-onset atrial fibrillation in sepsis have not been clearly elucidated. Clarification of the risk factors for atrial fibrillation during sepsis may improve our understanding of the mechanisms of arrhythmia development and help guide clinical practice.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL.

Study Selection

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify risk factors for new-onset atrial fibrillation during sepsis.

Data Extraction

We extracted the adjusted odds ratio for each risk factor associated with new-onset atrial fibrillation during sepsis. For risk factors present in more than one study, we calculated pooled odds ratios (meta-analysis). We classified risk factors according to type and quantified the factor effect sizes. We then compared sepsis-associated atrial fibrillation risk factors with risk factors for community-associated atrial fibrillation.

Data Synthesis

Forty-four factors were examined as possible risk factors for new-onset atrial fibrillation in sepsis, 18 of which were included in meta-analyses. Risk factors for new-onset atrial fibrillation included demographic factors, comorbid conditions, and most strongly, sepsis-related factors. Sepsis-related factors with a greater than 50% change in odds of new-onset atrial fibrillation included corticosteroid use, right heart catheterization, fungal infection, vasopressor use, and a mean arterial pressure target of 80–85mm Hg. Several cardiovascular conditions that are known risk factors for community-associated atrial fibrillation were not identified as risk factors for new-onset atrial fibrillation in sepsis.

Conclusions

Our study shows that risk factors for new-onset atrial fibrillation during sepsis are mainly factors that are associated with the acute sepsis event and are not synonymous with risk factors for community-associated atrial fibrillation. Our results provide targets for future studies focused on atrial fibrillation prevention and have implications for several key areas in the management of patients with sepsis such as glucocorticoid administration, vasopressor selection, and blood pressure targets.

### The ATHERO-AF study: a need to optimize AF management in an environment of medical advancement [^1123YWmd]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia with worldwide impact and high frequency with increasing age. AF is associated with an increased incidence of stroke and systemic embolism (SSE), and mortality. The ATHERO-AF prospective cohort study conducted by Menichelli et alfrom the Sapienza University based in Rome, Italy, provides insight into the frequency and causes of hospitalization in a predominantly elderly population with AF. Understanding the causes of hospitalization creates the potential to lower hospitalization rates. The ATHERO-AF study enrolled 2,782 patients with AF, mean age 74.6 years, evenly divided by gender, with a mean follow-up of 31 months. The rate of all-cause hospitalization was 12.9% per year. The causes of hospitalization were classified as cardiac, respiratory, cancer, trauma, bleeding, cerebrovascular, infection, or surgery-related. Cardiac hospitalizations were defined as those not related to AF and were acute coronary syndromes, heart failure, systemic embolism, hypertensive urgency, requiring vascular/cardiac surgery, and then those that were AF-related. AF-related hospitalization was defined as recurrence of AF in patients with paroxysmal AF or high ventricular rate symptomatic AF episodes in patients with persistent/permanent AF. Cardiovascular-related hospitalizations for the full period of observation totaled 44.2%, of which 37.0% were AF-related.
