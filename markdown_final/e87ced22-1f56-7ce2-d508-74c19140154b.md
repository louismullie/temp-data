## Question

indications for tamiflu

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the indications for Tamiflu (oseltamivir). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indications and core limitations. Then, I should verify age thresholds for treatment versus prophylaxis. Next, I will review the 48-hour window and its exceptions. After that, I need to check special populations, including renal impairment, pregnancy, pediatrics, and immunocompromised hosts. I will then examine efficacy data and guideline nuances that sometimes extend beyond the label. Finally, I should confirm dosing adjustments, safety, and a practical decision framework, and I will double-check any conflicting statements before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the FDA-labeled indications so I don't overstate anything. Tamiflu is indicated for treatment of acute, uncomplicated influenza A or B in patients 2 weeks of age and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours, and for prophylaxis of influenza A or B in patients 1 year and older, with the explicit limitations that it is not a substitute for annual vaccination, prescribers should consider susceptibility patterns, and it is not recommended in end-stage renal disease not undergoing dialysis [^114eSLAd] [^115u1S2x] [^115xfCNT].

> Wait, let me verify the age thresholds because I initially thought both treatment and prophylaxis started at 1 year, but that would be incorrect. Treatment is approved down to 2 weeks of age, whereas prophylaxis is approved from 1 year and older, so I need to keep those distinct in my mind and in counseling [^114eSLAd] [^115u1S2x].

> I need to ensure I capture the timing window correctly. For treatment, benefit is greatest when started within 48 hours of symptom onset; however, guidelines allow extension beyond 48 hours in selected scenarios such as severe, complicated, or progressive disease, or in hospitalized patients, recognizing that evidence is weaker but still supportive enough to act, so I should not reflexively withhold therapy after 48 hours in high-risk or severe presentations [^114eSLAd] [^1142aANd] [^113axHMj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal use in pregnancy; I should confirm the risk–benefit stance. Pregnant patients are at higher risk of severe influenza complications, and while human data are observational, multiple analyses have not shown increased congenital anomalies with oseltamivir, so treatment is generally recommended when indicated, ideally within 48 hours, without dose adjustment despite lower exposure in pregnancy, and with shared decision-making about uncertainties [^114k8KaP] [^116xdtcf].

> Next, I should review pediatrics carefully. The FDA approves treatment from 2 weeks of age, and major pediatric guidelines endorse treatment even beyond 48 hours for children with serious, complicated, or progressive disease, and for those at high risk for complications, noting that children under 2 years are at increased risk of hospitalization; for prophylaxis, approval begins at 1 year, though CDC/AAP allow post-exposure prophylaxis in infants 3 months to 1 year in select circumstances, and prophylaxis is not recommended for infants under 3 months outside critical situations due to limited data [^114eSLAd] [^113axHMj] [^115bE7Na] [^114VbkSY].

> I will now examine renal impairment because dosing is frequently misunderstood. For creatinine clearance greater than 60 mL/min, standard adult dosing applies; for 30–60 mL/min, treatment is 30 mg twice daily and prophylaxis is 30 mg once daily; for 10–30 mL/min, treatment is 30 mg once daily and prophylaxis is 30 mg every 48 hours; for less than 10 mL/min or ESRD not on dialysis, use is not recommended; for intermittent hemodialysis, give 30 mg immediately and then 30 mg after each dialysis session for treatment, or after alternate sessions for prophylaxis; for peritoneal dialysis, a single 30 mg dose is used for treatment, and 30 mg weekly for prophylaxis, so I should double-check creatinine clearance before prescribing [^1173eiNS] [^115dn77P] [^1142HdTc] [^111YsAXg] [^114Fs41P] [^114jWuKe].

> Let me consider hepatic impairment so I don't overcomplicate things. No dose adjustment is required for mild to moderate hepatic impairment, and there is insufficient information for severe hepatic impairment, so standard dosing is reasonable in Child-Pugh A/B, with caution and clinical judgment in Child-Pugh C [^111QMNes] [^114CNsoh].

> I should confirm the stance in immunocompromised patients. Efficacy data are limited and viral shedding may be prolonged, so while treatment is still recommended in severe disease, some experts extend therapy to 10 days or longer if illness is severe and RNA remains detectable, and there is no evidence supporting higher dosing, so I need to individualize duration and monitor closely [^111zHnPE] [^114tLpsz].

> Next, I should review efficacy signals to align expectations. Randomized trials consistently show a modest reduction in time to symptom alleviation by about 1 day in adults and children, with a larger signal in otherwise healthy children than in those with asthma; some analyses also suggest fewer lower respiratory complications and hospitalizations, though hospitalization events are rare and confidence intervals are wide, and a recent meta-analysis did not find a reduction in first hospitalization among outpatients, underscoring that the clearest benefit remains symptom shortening rather than hard outcomes in low-risk populations [^116AnA7U] [^113oYPfX] [^113Wu3wA].

> But wait, what if the patient is high risk or hospitalized; does the balance change. Observational data in hospitalized influenza, particularly during the H1N1 era, associate early oseltamivir with substantially reduced mortality, and IDSA recommends initiating therapy as soon as possible in hospitalized patients or those with severe disease even if beyond 48 hours, given the potential for benefit and the low risk profile, so I should not delay therapy while waiting for test results in these scenarios [^1142aANd] [^114xQ4j7].

> I need to check safety and tolerability so counseling is accurate. Common adverse effects include nausea and vomiting, which can be mitigated by taking with food; neuropsychiatric events have been reported, particularly in pediatric patients, so families should be advised to monitor for abnormal behavior; serious hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis and severe cutaneous reactions, is rare but mandates discontinuation if suspected [^115h9Jv5] [^116nUttK] [^117KdpDE].

> Let me verify drug–drug interactions and vaccine timing so I don't create conflicts. Oseltamivir has no clinically meaningful interactions with common medications, but it may interfere with live attenuated influenza vaccine replication, so LAIV should be avoided for 2 weeks before or 48 hours after oseltamivir; inactivated influenza vaccine can be given at any time relative to oseltamivir use [^1173HnX3].

> I should double-check a practical decision framework. Treat when there is laboratory-confirmed or high suspicion of influenza in patients with severe, complicated, or progressive disease, in those requiring hospitalization, or in those at high risk for complications, ideally within 48 hours but not withholding after 48 hours if illness is severe or high risk; consider treatment in otherwise healthy outpatients within 48 hours, balancing modest benefit against gastrointestinal adverse effects; use prophylaxis for close contacts at high risk or in outbreak settings, adhering to age-appropriate dosing and duration [^1142aANd] [^113axHMj] [^114VbkSY].

> Hold on, I should verify a potential inconsistency I recall seeing about infants. One summary suggested treatment is not established under 2 weeks, but the FDA label supports treatment from 2 weeks of age, and pediatric guidance allows treatment from birth in certain contexts, so I should correct that earlier misstatement and align with the label and AAP/CDC positions for neonatal use when clinically indicated [^114eSLAd] [^113axHMj] [^114VbkSY].

> In summary, Tamiflu is indicated for treatment of acute, uncomplicated influenza A or B in patients 2 weeks and older within 48 hours of symptom onset, and for prophylaxis in patients 1 year and older, with important extensions beyond 48 hours for severe or high-risk patients, special dosing in renal impairment, and supportive use in pregnancy and pediatrics, while remembering it does not replace vaccination and should be used judiciously in the context of circulating strains and patient-specific risks [^114eSLAd] [^1142aANd] [^113axHMj].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Treatment of Influenza

Of the 4,765 adults in clinical trials of TAMIFLU for the treatment of influenza, 948 (20%) were 65 years and older, while 329 (7%) were 75 years and older. In three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in the treatment of influenza in patients at least 65 years old, that enrolled 741 subjects (374 received placebo and 362 received TAMIFLU), no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Prophylaxis of Influenza

Of the 4,603 adults in clinical trials of TAMIFLU for the prophylaxis of influenza, 1,046 (23%) were 65 years and older, while 719 (16%) were 75 years and older. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in elderly residents of nursing homes who took TAMIFLU for up to 42 days for the prophylaxis of influenza (TAMIFLU n = 276, placebo n = 272), no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

8.6	Renal Impairment

Patients with renal impairment had higher blood levels of oseltamivir carboxylate compared to patients with normal renal function which may increase the risk of TAMIFLU-associated adverse reactions. Therefore, dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with a serum creatinine clearance between 10 and 60 mL/minute and for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing routine hemodialysis or continuous peritoneal dialysis treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. TAMIFLU is not recommended for patients with ESRD not undergoing dialysis [see Indications and Usage (1.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7	Hepatic Impairment

No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The safety and pharmacokinetics in patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been evaluated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.8	Use in Patients with Chronic Conditions

Efficacy of TAMIFLU in the treatment of influenza in patients with chronic cardiac disease and/or respiratory disease was evaluated in one randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Efficacy in this population, as measured by time to alleviation of all symptoms, was not established, but no new safety signals were identified [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

No clinical trial data are available regarding treatment of influenza in patients with any medical condition sufficiently severe or unstable to be considered at imminent risk of requiring hospitalization.

8.9	Immunocompromised Patients

Efficacy of TAMIFLU for the treatment or prophylaxis of influenza has not been established in immunocompromised patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Safety of TAMIFLU has been demonstrated for up to 12 weeks for prophylaxis of influenza in immunocompromised patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Renal Impairment

Administration of 100 mg of TAMIFLU twice daily (about 1.3 times the maximum recommended dosage) for 5 days to subjects with various degrees of renal impairment showed that exposure to oseltamivir carboxylate is inversely proportional to declining renal function.

Population-derived pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for patients with varying degrees of renal function including ESRD patients on hemodialysis. Median simulated exposures of oseltamivir carboxylate for recommended treatment and prophylaxis regimens are provided in Table 7. The pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir have not been studied in ESRD patients not undergoing dialysis [see Indications and Usage (1.3), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

In continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients, the peak concentration of oseltamivir carboxylate following a single 30 mg dose of oseltamivir or once weekly oseltamivir was approximately 3-fold higher than in patients with normal renal function who received 75 mg twice daily. The plasma concentration of oseltamivir carboxylate on Day 5 (147 ng/mL) following a single 30 mg dose in CAPD patients is similar to the predicted Cmin(160 ng/mL) in patients with normal renal function following 75 mg twice daily. Administration of 30 mg once weekly to CAPD patients resulted in plasma concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate at the 168 hour blood sample of 63 ng/mL, which were comparable to the Cminin patients with normal renal function receiving the approved regimen of 75 mg once daily (40 ng/mL).

Hepatic Impairment

In clinical studies, oseltamivir carboxylate exposure was not altered in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Pregnant Women

A pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that the TAMIFLU dosage regimen resulted in lower exposure to the active metabolite in pregnant women (n = 59) compared to non-pregnant women (n = 33). However, this predicted exposure is expected to have activity against susceptible influenza virus strains and there are insufficient pharmacokinetics and safety data to recommend a dose adjustment for pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

2.3	Recommended Dosage for Prophylaxis of Influenza

Initiate post-exposure prophylaxis with TAMIFLU within 48 hours following close contact with an infected individual. Initiate seasonal prophylaxis with TAMIFLU during a community outbreak.

Adults and Adolescents (13 years of age and older)

The recommended dosage of TAMIFLU for prophylaxis of influenza in adults and adolescents 13 years and older is 75 mg orally once daily (one 75 mg capsule or 12.5 mL of oral suspension once daily) for at least 10 days following close contact with an infected individual and up to 6 weeks during a community outbreak. In immunocompromised patients, TAMIFLU may be continued for up to 12 weeks [see Use in Specific Populations (8.9)]. The duration of protection lasts for as long as TAMIFLU dosing is continued.

Pediatric Patients (1 year to 12 years of age)

Table 1 displays the recommended oral dosage of TAMIFLU for prophylaxis of influenza in pediatric patients 1 year to 12 years of age based on body weight and provides information about prescribing the capsule or the formulation for oral suspension. Prophylaxis in pediatric patients is recommended for 10 days following close contact with an infected individual and up to 6 weeks during a community outbreak [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2)].

2.4	Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment

Table 2 displays the dosage recommendations for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza in adults with various stages of renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance of less than or equal to 90 mL per minute). Dosage modifications are recommended in adults with an estimated creatinine clearance less than or equal to 60 mL per minute [see Use in Specific Population (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Adults

Two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of TAMIFLU were conducted in adults between 18 and 65 years old, one in the U.S. and one outside the U.S., for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza. Eligible subjects had fever of at least 100ºF, accompanied by at least one respiratory symptom (cough, nasal symptoms, or sore throat) and at least one systemic symptom (myalgia, chills/sweats, malaise, fatigue, or headache), and influenza virus was known to be circulating in the community. Subjects were randomized to receive oral TAMIFLU or placebo for 5 days. All enrolled subjects were allowed to take fever-reducing medications.

Of 1,355 subjects enrolled in these two trials, 849 (63%) subjects were influenza-infected (median age 34 years; 52% male; 90% Caucasian; 31% smokers). Of the 849 influenza-infected subjects, 95% were infected with influenza A, 3% with influenza B, and 2% with influenza of unknown type.

Study medication was started within 40 hours of onset of symptoms and administered twice daily for 5 days. Subjects were required to self-assess the influenza-associated symptoms (nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, aches, fatigue, headaches, and chills/sweats) twice daily as "none", "mild", "moderate", or "severe". Time to improvement was calculated from the time of treatment initiation to the time when all symptoms were assessed as "none" or "mild". In both trials, there was a 1.3-day reduction in the median time to improvement in influenza-infected subjects who received TAMIFLU 75 mg twice a day for 5 days compared to subjects who received placebo. Subgroup analyses by gender showed no differences in the treatment effect of TAMIFLU in men and women.

In the treatment of influenza, no increased efficacy was demonstrated in subjects who received higher doses of TAMIFLU.

Risk Summary

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with TAMIFLU in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. Available published epidemiological data suggest that TAMIFLU, taken in any trimester, is not associated with an increased risk of birth defects. However, these studies individually are limited by small sample sizes, use of different comparison groups, and some lacked information on dose, which preclude a definitive assessment of the risk [see Data and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In animal reproduction studies with oseltamivir, no adverse developmental effects were observed at clinically relevant exposures (see Data).

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk

Pregnant women are at higher risk of severe complications from influenza, which may lead to adverse pregnancy and/or fetal outcomes including maternal death, still births, birth defects, preterm delivery, low birth weight and small for gestational age.

8.2	Lactation

Risk Summary

Based on limited published data, oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate have been shown to be present in human milk at low levels considered unlikely to lead to toxicity in the breastfed infant. Postmarketing experience has not reported any information to suggest serious adverse effects of oseltamivir exposure via breast milk in infants. It is not known if oseltamivir affects human milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for TAMIFLU and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition.

Treatment of Influenza

The safety and efficacy of TAMIFLU for the treatment of influenza in pediatric patients 2 weeks old to 17 years of age has been established [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.1)] and is based on:

13 to 17 years of age: Safety and efficacy in adolescent patients 13 to 17 years of age was supported by adequate and well-controlled trials in adults and adolescents and younger pediatric patients and safety data in adolescents treated with TAMIFLU in a study of treatment and prophylaxis.
1 year to 12 years of age: Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients 1 year to 12 years of age was supported by results of one double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 452 pediatric patients with influenza in whom TAMIFLU 2 mg per kg twice daily or placebo was administered within 48 hours of symptom onset [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Additional safety information was provided in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in pediatric patients 6 to 12 years of age with known asthma. Efficacy could not be established in pediatric patients with asthma.
2 weeks to less than 1 year of age: Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age is supported by adequate and well-controlled trials in adults and older pediatric patients and two open-label trials of TAMIFLU (2 to 3.5 mg per kg twice daily for 5 days) in 136 pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age. In these two trials, the oseltamivir plasma concentrations in these subjects were similar to or higher than the oseltamivir plasma concentrations observed in older pediatric subjects and adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

The safety and efficacy of TAMIFLU for treatment of influenza in pediatric patients less than 2 weeks of age have not been established.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), intranasal:

Avoid administration of LAIV within 2 weeks before or 48 hours after TAMIFLU use, unless medically indicated. (7)

7.1	Influenza Vaccines

Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine

The concurrent use of TAMIFLU with live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) intranasal has not been evaluated. However, because of the potential for TAMIFLU to inhibit replication of live vaccine virus and possibly reduce the efficacy of LAIV, avoid administration of LAIV within 2 weeks before or 48 hours after TAMIFLU administration, unless medically indicated.

### Types of antiviral drugs… [^114H4xuz]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

What to know Antiviral medications are an important adjunct to influenza vaccines in the prevention and control of influenza. The information on this page should be considered current for clinical practice regarding the use of influenza antiviral medications. Types of Antiviral Drugs Neuraminidase Inhibitors Neuraminidase Inhibitors are chemically related antiviral medications that block the viral neuraminidase protein and have activity against both influenza A and B viruses. The neuraminidase inhibitors include: Oseltamivir is FDA-approved for early treatment of uncomplicated influenza in people two weeks and older, and for chemoprophylaxis to prevent influenza in people one year and older.

Although not part of the FDA-approved indications, use of oral oseltamivir for treatment of influenza in infants younger than 14 days old, and for chemoprophylaxis in infants 3 months to 1 year, is recommended by CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics. If a child is younger than 3 months old, use of oseltamivir for chemoprophylaxis is not recommended unless the situation is judged critical, due to limited data in this age group. Zanamivir for oral inhalation is FDA-approved for early treatment of uncomplicated influenza in people 7 years and older and to prevent influenza in people 5 years and older. It is not recommended for use in people with underlying respiratory disease, including people with asthma. Peramivir for intravenous administration is FDA-approved for early treatment of uncomplicated influenza in people 6 months and older.

Cap-dependent Endonuclease Inhibitor An endonuclease inhibitor has a different mechanism of action than a neuraminidase inhibitor. Endonuclease inhibitors interfere with viral RNA transcription and block virus replication of both influenza A and B viruses. There is only one approved cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor: Baloxavir marboxil for oral administration is FDA-approved for early treatment of uncomplicated influenza in otherwise healthy non-high risk people 5 years to less than 12 years and for all persons 12 years and older, and for post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza in people 5 years and older. Baloxavir is not recommended for pregnant women, immunocompromised persons, breastfeeding mothers, outpatients with complicated or progressive illness, or hospitalized patients. Adamantanes The adamantanes target the M2 ion channel protein of influenza A viruses. The adamantanes are not currently recommended for use in the United States because of widespread antiviral resistance in circulating seasonal influenza A viruses. The adamantanes include: Amantadine for oral administration is FDA-approved to treat and prevent only influenza A viruses in people older than 1 year. Rimantadine for oral administration is FDA-approved to prevent only influenza A virus infection among people older than 1 year. It is approved to treat only influenza A virus infections in people 17 years and older.

### Oseltamivir for influenza [^111ddHgB]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2002). Low credibility.

Oseltamivir (pronounced os-el-ta-mi-veer; Tamiflu — Roche), an oral anti-influenza drug that inhibits influenza virus neuraminidase, is now available in the UK. It has recently been licensed throughout the EU for use, when influenza is circulating in the community, in the treatment of patients with early influenza-like symptoms, and for prophylaxis in people who have had close contact with someone with influenza. Oseltamivir is the second neuraminidase inhibitor to be licensed in the UK, the other being zanamivir (Relenza — GlaxoSmithKline), which is taken by inhalation and licensed only for treatment. Previously, we concluded that there was insufficient evidence that treatment with zanamivir prevented serious complications in people most at risk from influenza to recommend its use. Here we review the efficacy and safety of oseltamivir and discuss its role in the management of influenza.

Pediatric Subjects (1 year to 12 years of age)

One double-blind placebo-controlled treatment trial was conducted in pediatric subjects aged 1 year to 12 years (median age 5 years) who had fever (at least 100ºF) plus one respiratory symptom (cough or coryza) when influenza virus was known to be circulating in the community. Of 698 subjects enrolled in this trial, 452 (65%) were influenza-infected (50% male; 68% Caucasian). Of the 452 influenza-infected subjects, 67% were infected with influenza A and 33% with influenza B.

Efficacy in this trial was determined by the time to alleviation or resolution of influenza signs and symptoms, measured by a composite endpoint that required the following four individual conditions be met: i) alleviation of cough, ii) alleviation of coryza, iii) resolution of fever, and iv) parental opinion of a return to normal health and activity. TAMIFLU treatment of 2 mg per kg twice daily, started within 48 hours of onset of symptoms, reduced the total composite time to freedom from illness by 1.5 days compared to placebo. Subgroup analyses by gender showed no differences in the treatment effect of TAMIFLU in male and female pediatric subjects.

Pediatric Subjects (2 weeks to less than 1 year of age)

Two open-label trials evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate in influenza-infected pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age (including premature infants at least 36 weeks post conceptional age). Subjects received TAMIFLU at doses ranging from 2 to 3.5 mg per kg twice daily for 5 days depending on subject age. These clinical trials were not designed to evaluate clinical efficacy or virologic response.

Of the 136 subjects under the age of 1 year enrolled and dosed in the trials, the majority of the subjects were male (55%), white (79%), non-Hispanic (74%), full term (76%) and infected with influenza A (80%). Pharmacokinetic data indicated that a dose of 3 mg per kg twice daily in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age provided TAMIFLU concentrations similar to or higher than those observed in older pediatric subjects and adults receiving the approved dose and provided the basis for approval [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

Elimination

Absorbed oseltamivir is primarily (> 90%) eliminated by conversion to the active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate. Plasma concentrations of oseltamivir declined with a half-life of 1 to 3 hours in most subjects after oral administration. Oseltamivir carboxylate is not further metabolized and is eliminated unchanged in urine. Plasma concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate declined with a half-life of 6 to 10 hours in most subjects after oral administration.

Metabolism

Oseltamivir is extensively converted to the active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate, by esterases located predominantly in the liver. Oseltamivir carboxylate is not further metabolized. Neither oseltamivir nor oseltamivir carboxylate is a substrate for, or inhibitor of, cytochrome P450 isoforms.

Excretion

Oseltamivir carboxylate is eliminated entirely (> 99%) by renal excretion. Renal clearance (18.8 L/h) exceeds glomerular filtration rate (7.5 L/h), indicating that tubular secretion (via organic anion transporter) occurs in addition to glomerular filtration. Less than 20% of an oral radiolabeled dose is eliminated in feces.

### Debate regarding oseltamivir use for seasonal and pandemic influenza [^112UuYUb]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Existing observational evidence on the benefits of oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza in hospitalized patients, including assessing the risk for death, accrues from ecologic data from Japan, weak secondary analyses from randomized controlled trials of laboratory-confirmed influenza initially managed in the community, and the systematic reviews and analyses of observational studies of patients with confirmed infections caused by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H5N1) viruses. Methodologically less robust, small observational studies conducted before the pandemic support the finding that oseltamivir decreases the risk for death. However, well-designed prospective observational studies may provide the most informative data in the next 5–10 years.

We reached several conclusions regarding the use of oseltamivir and the considerations that will be necessary for future studies (Table). Nguyen-Van-Tam et al. recently outlined a list of covariates that would need to be collected to help strengthen the evidence that oseltamivir treatment benefits hospitalized patients with influenza. These include standardized data on illness onset and progression, comorbid conditions, disease severity, treatment, duration of hospital stay, the need for critical care, and influenza-related mortality. In addition, a review by the UK Academy of Medical Sciences, sponsored by the Wellcome Trust, has offered a range of approaches to potential future studies and called specifically for "pragmatic or adaptive [randomized controlled trial] designs" of neuraminidase inhibitors in hospitalized patients. Our conclusions are in broad agreement with those of this report.

Selection of studies

Types of studies

We included randomised controlled trials testing the effects of oseltamivir for treatment, prophylaxis, and post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza. Treatment was the use of oseltamivir in people showing signs of influenza-like illness that might be caused by influenza A and B viruses. Prophylaxis was the mode of use of oseltamivir when there was expectation of possible exposure to influenza in the near future. Post-exposure prophylaxis was the use of oseltamivir after probable exposure to influenza but before symptoms developed. Studies which were open label, and those not involving naturally occurring influenza were excluded.

Because of discrepancies between published and unpublished reports of the same trials, we decided to include only those trials for which we had unabridged clinical study reports. Two authors (PD and TJ) reapplied inclusion criteria for the full clinical study reports received in 2013 and resolved disagreements through discussion.

Types of participants

Randomised controlled trials had to be in children and adults who either were healthy before exposure to respiratory agents or had a chronic illness (such as asthma, diabetes, hypertension) but excluding people whose immune system had been affected by diseases such as malignancy or HIV infection. Exposure had to be naturally occurring influenza, with or without symptoms.

We analysed the intention to treat and safety populations, as our previous review had discovered compelling evidence that the intention to treat influenza infected subpopulation deemed to be influenza infected was not balanced between treatment groups in the oseltamivir trials. In addition, estimates from the intention to treat population are generalisable to clinical practice where routine testing for influenza is not common in many countries (and even where used, remains of variable accuracy).

Types of interventions

We included trials of neuraminidase inhibitors administered by any route compared with placebo during the period in which treatment was assumed and during the follow-up ("on-treatment" and "off-treatment") periods.

Types of outcomes

We divided the outcomes of clinical interest into primary and secondary by indication:

Primary outcome measures for treatment studies — symptom relief, admission to hospital, complications, and harms.

Secondary outcome measures for treatment studies — symptom relapse after finishing treatment, drug resistance, viral excretion, and mortality.

Primary outcome measures for prophylaxis studies — influenza (symptomatic and asymptomatic, always with laboratory confirmation) and influenza-like illness, admission to hospital, complications, interruption of transmission (in its two components, reduction of viral spread from index cases and prevention of onset of influenza in contacts), and harms.

Secondary outcome measures for prophylaxis studies — drug resistance, viral excretion, and mortality.

### Debate regarding oseltamivir use for seasonal and pandemic influenza [^116MjpuU]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

A debate about the market-leading influenza antiviral medication, oseltamivir, which initially focused on treatment for generally mild illness, has been expanded to question the wisdom of stockpiling for use in future influenza pandemics. Although randomized controlled trial evidence confirms that oseltamivir will reduce symptom duration by 17–25 hours among otherwise healthy adolescents and adults with community-managed disease, no randomized controlled trials have examined the effectiveness of oseltamivir against more serious outcomes. Observational studies, although criticized on methodologic grounds, suggest that oseltamivir given early can reduce the risk for death by half among persons hospitalized with confirmed infection caused by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H5N1) viruses. However, available randomized controlled trial data may not be able to capture the effect of oseltamivir use among hospitalized patients with severe disease. We assert that data on outpatients with relatively mild disease should not form the basis for policies on the management of more severe disease.

### Oseltamivir treatment for influenza in adults: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116AnA7U]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Despite widespread use, questions remain about the efficacy of oseltamivir in the treatment of influenza. We aimed to do an individual patient data meta-analysis for all clinical trials comparing oseltamivir with placebo for treatment of seasonal influenza in adults regarding symptom alleviation, complications, and safety.

Methods

We included all published and unpublished Roche-sponsored randomised placebo-controlled, double-blind trials of 75 mg twice a day oseltamivir in adults. Trials of oseltamivir for treatment of naturally occurring influenza-like illness in adults reporting at least one of the study outcomes were eligible. We also searched Medline, PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the ClinicalTrials.gov trials register for other relevant trials published before Jan 1, 2014 (search last updated on Nov 27, 2014). We analysed intention-to-treat infected, intention-to-treat, and safety populations. The primary outcome was time to alleviation of all symptoms analysed with accelerated failure time methods. We used risk ratios and Mantel-Haenszel methods to work out complications, admittances to hospital, and safety outcomes.

Findings

We included data from nine trials including 4328 patients. In the intention-to-treat infected population, we noted a 21% shorter time to alleviation of all symptoms for oseltamivir versus placebo recipients (time ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.74–0.85; p < 0.0001). The median times to alleviation were 97.5 h for oseltamivir and 122.7 h for placebo groups (difference -25.2 h, 95% CI -36.2 to -16.0). For the intention-to-treat population, the estimated treatment effect was attenuated (time ratio 0.85) but remained highly significant (median difference -17.8 h). In the intention-to-treat infected population, we noted fewer lower respiratory tract complications requiring antibiotics more than 48 h after randomisation (risk ratio [RR] 0.56, 95% CI 0.42–0.75; p = 0.0001; 4.9% oseltamivir vs 8.7% placebo, risk difference -3.8%, 95% CI -5.0 to -2.2) and also fewer admittances to hospital for any cause (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.17–0.81; p = 0.013; 0.6% oseltamivir, 1.7% placebo, risk difference -1.1%, 95% CI -1.4 to -0.3). Regarding safety, oseltamivir increased the risk of nausea (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.29–1.99; p < 0.0001; 9.9% oseltamivir vs 6.2% placebo, risk difference 3.7%, 95% CI 1.8–6.1) and vomiting (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.83–3.23; p < 0.0001; 8.0% oseltamivir vs 3.3% placebo, risk difference 4.7%, 95% CI 2.7–7.3). We recorded no effect on neurological or psychiatric disorders or serious adverse events.

Interpretation

Our findings show that oseltamivir in adults with influenza accelerates time to clinical symptom alleviation, reduces risk of lower respiratory tract complications, and admittance to hospital, but increases the occurrence of nausea and vomiting.

### Update: influenza activity-United States, October 1, 2017-February 3, 2018 [^116WvsNH]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

With several more weeks of elevated influenza activity anticipated this season, it is too early to assess overall severity of the season. However, estimates of the burden of influenza disease from the 2012–13 and 2014–15 seasons provide an indication of what might be anticipated for the 2017–18 season. CDC estimated that during each of those seasons influenza accounted for as many as 35.6 million illnesses, 16.6 million medically attended visits, 710,000 hospitalizations and 56,000 deaths.

Interim estimates of 2017–18 season vaccine effectiveness (VE) against influenza A and influenza B virus infection associated with medically attended acute respiratory illness in the United States was 36% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 27%–44%). VE was estimated to be 25% (95% CI = 13%–36%) against illness caused by influenza A(H3N2) virus, 67% (95% CI = 54%–76%) against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and 42% (95% CI = 25%–56%) against influenza B virus. During the 2014–15 season, an A(H3N2) virus–predominant season with high severity and low vaccine effectiveness, influenza vaccine was estimated to have prevented millions of illnesses and tens of thousands of influenza-related hospitalizations. With several more weeks of elevated influenza activity expected, an increasing proportion of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses, and the potential to prevent significant illness through influenza vaccination, CDC continues to recommend influenza vaccination at this time.

During influenza seasons with increased severity, influenza antiviral medications are an increasingly important adjunct to vaccination in the treatment of influenza. Three neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral medications are approved and recommended for use in the United States during the 2017–18 influenza season: oral oseltamivir (available as a generic or under the trade name Tamiflu [Genentech, South San Francisco, California]), inhaled zanamivir (Relenza [GlaxoSmithKline, London, England]) and intravenous peramivir (Rapivab [Seqirus, Summit, New Jersey]). Resistance to these medications is not a concern at this time because only four influenza viruses (all A[H1N1]pdm09 viruses) collected in the United States since October 1, 2017, were identified as not being sensitive to oseltamivir and peramivir.

Oseltamivir treatment recommendations in children — indications, timing, and decision factors are as follows: "The AAP, CDC, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society recommend treatment with oseltamivir for children with serious, complicated, or progressive disease presumptively or definitively caused by influenza, irrespective of influenza vaccination status… or whether illness began > 48 hours before presentation". Moreover, "treatment after 48 hours of symptoms in adults and children with moderate to severe disease or with progressive disease has been shown to provide some benefit and should be offered", and "the AAP recommends treatment of children at risk for severe complications of influenza, regardless of duration of symptoms", noting that "Children younger than 2 years are at an increased risk of hospitalization and complications attributable to influenza". For initiation, "Antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible after illness onset and should not be delayed while waiting for a definitive influenza test result because early therapy provides the best outcomes". For otherwise healthy outpatients, they "should be considered for antiviral medication, particularly if they are in contact with other children who either are younger than 6 months… or have high-risk conditions (including age < 5 years)… when influenza viruses are known to be circulating in the community". The report adds that "Algorithms for interpreting positive and negative influenza tests are available" and that "The balance between benefits and harms should be considered when making decisions about the use of NAIs for either treatment or chemoprophylaxis of influenza".

### Maximizing the value of drug stockpiles for pandemic influenza [^111f9tuv]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Tamiflu (oseltamivir; Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) is destined to be one of the few branded drugs to develop instant street recognition because of its status as 1 of only 2 licensed drugs shown to be active against the influenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. Tamiflu is the major drug stockpiled by governments around the world in preparedness against an influenza pandemic. More than 70 governments have placed orders for Tamiflu, and at least 220 million treatment courses have been stockpiled since 2003 at a cost of $6.9 billion. Roche is producing 110 million courses for the 5 months from May to fall 2009 and will produce up to 36 million courses per month by year's end if necessary. Given the estimated world population of 6.8 billion, it is clear that, on a global basis, stockpiles are woefully inadequate. For the United Kingdom, official estimates indicate sufficient stocks currently exist for half of the population.

### Evaluation of oseltamivir used to prevent hospitalization in outpatients with influenza: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112JSnbC]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, influenza was one of the most clinically burdensome respiratory viruses. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated 29 million cases, 380 000 hospitalizations, and 28 000 deaths from influenza in the US during the 2018 to 2019 season. While COVID-19 led to a temporary reduction in infections, influenza is now expected to have a resurgence. Novel strains or a rise in a relatively less immune population could trigger an influenza pandemic resembling the crises experienced in 1968 or 2009. As such, the availability of safe and effective treatments is critical to avoid overwhelming health care systems and to reduce morbidity and mortality. Indeed, a breakthrough in the COVID-19 pandemic occurred when outpatient randomized clinical trials demonstrated reductions in hospitalization and death. In contrast, despite the substantial threat that influenza poses, there are no evidence-based outpatient treatments proven to prevent the progression to hospitalization.

Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is an antiviral that is commonly prescribed to outpatients with influenza to accelerate recovery and prevent complications. Detailing by key opinion leaders, guideline panels, and the manufacturer has even led to stockpiling of the medication as part of national pandemic responses. Yet, despite guideline recommendations, and millions of doses prescribed, it is unclear whether oseltamivir reduces severe complications requiring hospitalization. Three prior systematic reviews (1 independent and 2 supported by the manufacturer) have arrived at different conclusions. Since these publications, several large randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have been completed and have yet to be meta-analyzed. We, therefore, sought to clarify whether oseltamivir is a high-value medical treatment (achieving optimal results for patients balanced with an efficient use of resources). To do so, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs of oseltamivir for the prevention of first hospitalization in adolescent and adult outpatients (efficacy) and treatment-associated adverse events (safety).

### Evaluation of oseltamivir used to prevent hospitalization in outpatients with influenza: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Wu3wA]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the administration of oseltamivir to adult and adolescent outpatients with confirmed influenza associated with a reduced risk of first hospitalization?

Findings

In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 randomized clinical trials including 6166 patients, oseltamivir was not associated with reduced risk of first hospitalization compared with placebo or standard of care. Results were similar in a subgroup of patients considered at high risk of hospitalization; however, the CIs were wide.

Meaning

An adequately powered trial in a suitably high-risk population is needed to determine who might benefit from early treatment with oseltamivir to prevent hospitalization.

### Debate regarding oseltamivir use for seasonal and pandemic influenza [^114xQ4j7]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Oseltamivir Policies for Seasonal and Pandemic Influenza

The evidence from randomized controlled trials is clear that oseltamivir treatment decreases the duration of symptoms by up to 1 day in adolescent and adult patients with laboratory-confirmed seasonal influenza whose infections are able to be managed in the community. Oseltamivir provides no benefit to patients who have influenza-like illness not caused by influenza virus. Reviews of observational data regarding patients hospitalized with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 or influenza A(H5N1) infections found that risk for death is cut in half if treatment is initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset. Small prepandemic observational studies, although they generally have controlled less for potential biases, also support the conclusion that risk for death is decreased with oseltamivir treatment.

These 2 lines of evidence may appear inconsistent. How would an intervention that has a modest effect on symptom duration in patients whose uncomplicated influenza was treated after a visit to a general practitioner be able to cut in half the risk for death among hospitalized patients?

### Debate regarding oseltamivir use for seasonal and pandemic influenza [^1142tJdw]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The Way Forward

There is general agreement derived from randomized controlled trials about the modest effectiveness of oseltamivir against relatively mild illness in otherwise healthy persons, but several lines of evidence from observational studies suggest that oseltamivir decreases the risk for death. However, within the next 5–10 years, we do not expect to see clarifying new evidence from trials of patients recruited from the community who have an endpoint of severe influenza. Severe outcomes from influenza are uncommon, as shown in the meta-analyses of community trial data, and randomized controlled trials that recruit healthy persons would require extremely large patient numbers and need to be conducted over multiple seasons to account for potentially different outcomes by influenza type and sub-type.

On the other hand, a randomized controlled trial that recruited only patients with severe influenza, although feasible from a design perspective, could not ethically evaluate active treatment versus placebo treatment because oseltamivir treatment is the standard of care for patients with severe influenza virus infections. In a study that overcame the ethical issue, a randomized controlled trial of patients with severe influenza that examined single-dose versus double-dose oseltamivir found no difference in outcomes between the 2 treatment arms. We do not anticipate that this trial would be repeated.

Adverse Reactions from Treatment and Prophylaxis Trials in Pediatric Subjects (1 year to 12 years of age)

A total of 1,481 pediatric subjects (including otherwise healthy pediatric subjects aged 1 year to 12 years and asthmatic pediatric subjects aged 6 to 12 years) participated in clinical trials of TAMIFLU for the treatment of influenza. A total of 859 pediatric subjects received treatment with TAMIFLU for oral suspension either at a 2 mg per kg twice daily for 5 days or weight-band dosing. Vomiting was the only adverse reaction reported at a frequency of > 1% in subjects receiving TAMIFLU (16%) compared to placebo (8%).

Amongst the 148 pediatric subjects aged 1 year to 12 years who received TAMIFLU at doses of 30 to 60 mg once daily for 10 days in a post-exposure prophylaxis study in household contacts (n = 99), and in a separate 6–week seasonal influenza prophylaxis safety study (n = 49), vomiting was the most frequent adverse reaction (8% on TAMIFLU versus 2% in the no prophylaxis group).

Adverse Reactions from Treatment Trials in Pediatric Subjects (2 weeks to less than 1 year of age)

Assessment of adverse reactions in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age was based on two open-label studies that included safety data on 135 influenza-infected subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age (including premature infants at least 36 weeks post conceptional age) exposed to TAMIFLU at doses ranging from 2 to 3.5 mg per kg of the formulation for oral suspension twice daily orally for 5 days. The safety profile of TAMIFLU was similar across the age range studied, with vomiting (9%), diarrhea (7%) and diaper rash (7%) being the most frequently reported adverse reactions, and was generally comparable to that observed in older pediatric and adult subjects.

Adverse Reactions from the Prophylaxis Trial in Immunocompromised Subjects

In a 12-week seasonal prophylaxis study in 475 immunocompromised subjects, including 18 pediatric subjects 1 year to 12 years of age, the safety profile in the 238 subjects receiving TAMIFLU 75 mg once daily was consistent with that previously observed in other TAMIFLU prophylaxis clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Step #3: Follow the instructions below for preparing the 75 mg TAMIFLU capsules to produce the oral suspension (6 mg per mL):

Place the specified amount of water into a polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) or glass bottle (see Table 4). Constitution in other bottle types is not recommended because there is no stability data with other bottle types.
Carefully separate the capsule body and cap and pour the contents of the required number of TAMIFLU 75 mg capsules into the PET or glass bottle.
Gently swirl the suspension to ensure adequate wetting of the TAMIFLU powder for at least 2 minutes.
Slowly add the specified amount of vehicle to the bottle.
Close the bottle using a child-resistant cap and shake well for 30 seconds to completely dissolve the active drug and to ensure homogeneous distribution of the dissolved drug in the resulting suspension. The active drug, oseltamivir phosphate, readily dissolves in the specified vehicles. The suspension is caused by inert ingredients of TAMIFLU capsules which are insoluble in these vehicles.
Put an ancillary label on the bottle indicating "Shake Well Before Use".
Instruct the parent or caregiver that any unused suspension remaining in the bottle following completion of therapy must be discarded by either affixing an ancillary label to the bottle or adding a statement to the pharmacy label instructions.
Place a pharmacy label on the bottle that includes the patient's name, dosing instructions, drug name and any other required information to be in compliance with all State and Federal Pharmacy Regulations. Place an appropriate expiration date on the label according to storage conditions below.
Include the recommended dosage on the pharmacy label as per Tables 1 and 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3, and 2.4)].
Store the prepared oral suspension in glass or PET bottles either:
In a refrigerator [2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F)]: Stable for 5 weeks when stored in a refrigerator.
At room temperature [25°C (77°F)]: Stable for 5 days when stored at room temperature.

### Oseltamivir for influenza in pregnancy [^117Bx1Sd]. Seminars in Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Pregnancy predisposes women to disproportionate morbidity and mortality from influenza infections. This is true for both seasonal epidemics as well as occasional pandemics. Inactivated yearly influenza vaccines are the best available method of disease prevention and are recommended for all pregnant women in any trimester of pregnancy and postpartum. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu(®)) is currently the first-line recommended and most commonly used pharmaceutical agent for influenza prophylaxis and treatment. Oseltamivir has been demonstrated to prevent disease among exposed individuals, as well as to shorten the duration of illness and lessen the likelihood of complications among those infected. The physiologic adaptations of pregnancy may alter the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this important drug. Updated evidence regarding these potential alterations, current knowledge gaps, and future investigative directions is discussed.

Table
Conclusions of study evaluating the use of oseltamivir for seasonal and pandemic influenza and wisdom of stockpiling*

*RCT, randomized controlled trial; ICU, intensive care unit.

The details of study design may be best accomplished by an experienced group of international researchers, focusing on standardized recruitment procedures and covariate and outcome definitions with a clearly defined analysis plan designed to minimize bias, as far as possible. Funding for such studies could come from the public or private sectors, with prior safeguards on perceptions of conflicts of interest. The studies should be adaptable to evaluate new antiviral medications, including intravenous forms of the NAIs, newly licensed non-NAI antiviral agents that are currently in late-phase clinical trials, or adjunctive therapies and immunomodulatory agents. Combinations of novel drugs with existing NAIs will likely be a useful approach and will require evaluation. Plans for ensuring broad availability and regulatory approval for emergency use of unlicensed antiviral agents will need to be established on very short notice. If pragmatic trials or high-quality prospective observational studies are completed and published over the next decade, an improved evidence base may help clinicians and public health planners decide on the most appropriate use of oseltamivir and potential new influenza antiviral agents for patients with severe infections caused by seasonal or pandemic influenza.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2022–2023 [^115bE7Na]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Influenza in children — antiviral treatment indications and timing: The AAP, CDC, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society recommend treatment with oseltamivir for children with serious, complicated, or progressive disease irrespective of vaccination status and even if illness began > 48 hours before presentation. Earlier treatment provides better responses, but treatment after 48 hours in outpatients with moderate to severe or progressive disease has been shown to provide some benefit and should be offered. The AAP recommends treatment of children at risk for severe complications regardless of duration of symptoms, noting that children younger than 2 years are at increased risk of hospitalization and complications. Antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible after illness onset and should not be delayed while waiting for a definitive influenza test result. The FDA has approved oseltamivir for treatment of children as young as 2 weeks of age. Otherwise healthy children with suspected uncomplicated influenza should be considered for antiviral medication, particularly if they are in contact with children younger than 6 months or with high-risk conditions, including age < 5 years, when influenza viruses are circulating in the community.

### New treatments for influenza [^113sPaS8]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The influenza NA is a classic example of rational drug design based on the crystal structure of NA. Currently, two NA inhibitors are used in clinical practice: oseltamivir (Tamiflu; Roche/Genentech) and zanamivir (Relenza; GlaxoSmithKline) (Figure 2). The 2009 H1N1 pandemic witnessed record sales of both drugs, together exceeding US $4 billion, partly due to stockpiles for fear of a forthcoming epidemic. Both drugs bind the catalytic pocket of NA and function as competitive inhibitors of NA activity.

Oseltamivir as a prodrug is sold in capsules containing 30 mg, 45 mg or 75 mg oseltamivir phosphate and also as powder for oral suspension in water (6 mg/mL). For treatment of influenza, the recommended dose for adults is 75 mg, twice a day, for 5 days. The preventive (prophylactic) dose is usually 75 mg, once a day for at least 10 days, or for up to 6 weeks during a community influenza outbreak. Smaller doses are recommended for children, according to age and weight. Adverse drug reactions may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache and neuropsychiatric events such as self-inflicted injury and delirium (Table 1). As with many drugs, such as the M2 inhibitors, oseltamivir may be less effective if used in late-stage influenza.

Some information was obtained from manufacturers' inserts and/or websites.

Zanamivir (Relenza)

Zanamivir is more effective than oseltamivir and is supplied for oral inhalation only. It is sold as double-foiled 'blisters' that release the drug in an inhaler when pierced by the user. Each blister contains a powder mixture of 5 mg of zanamivir and 20 mg of lactose (plus milk proteins). The recommended dose for treatment of influenza in adults and pediatric patients aged 7 years and older is 10 mg twice daily (that is, two inhalations, one 5-mg blister per inhalation) for 5 days. For prevention of influenza (prophylaxis), the recommended dose in adults and pediatric patients 5 years and older is 10 mg once daily for 10 days, inhaled as above. Adverse drug reactions are rarer than with oseltamivir (Table 1).

Antiviral medications for pediatric influenza — Antiviral medications are important in the control of influenza but are not a substitute for influenza vaccination. The neuraminidase inhibitors oral oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and inhaled zanamivir (Relenza) are the best-studied options recommended for chemoprophylaxis or treatment in children during the 2018–2019 season. Intravenous peramivir (Rapivab) was approved in September 2017 for acute uncomplicated influenza in children 2 years and older who are not hospitalized and have been symptomatic for no more than 2 days. Intravenous zanamivir is not approved in the United States and is not available for compassionate use. Intravenous formulations are especially important as the only treatment option for serious influenza infection in children who cannot absorb orally or enterally administered oseltamivir or tolerate inhaled zanamivir. Surveillance and resistance data indicate that the majority of currently circulating influenza viruses likely to cause influenza in North America during the 2018–2019 season continue to be susceptible to oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir, and up-to-date recommendations can be found on the AAP Web site or the CDC Web site.

### Neuraminidase inhibitors for preventing and treating influenza in healthy adults and children [^116RRwGz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Planning for outbreaks of influenza is a high priority public health issue for national governments. Neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs) are thought to help reduce the symptoms of influenza with several possible mechanisms proposed. NIs have been stockpiled with a view to their widespread use in the event of a pandemic. However, the evidence base for this class of agents remains a source of debate. In a previous review we have documented substantial risks of publication bias of trials of NIs for influenza (60% of patient data from phase III treatment trials of oseltamivir have never been published) and reporting bias in the published trials. Our confidence in the conclusions of previous versions of this review has been subsequently undermined. Since we have become aware of a large number of unpublished trials of NIs in the management of influenza, this review updates and merges existing reviews in this area.

Objectives

To review clinical study reports of placebo-controlled randomised trials, regulatory comments and reviews ('regulatory information') of the effects of the NIs oseltamivir and zanamivir for influenza in all age groups and appraise trial programmes, rather than single studies. Clinical study reports are very detailed, unpublished clinical trial data containing in-depth descriptions of protocol rationale, methods analysis plans, trial results and organisational documents (such as contracts). A series of clinical studies designed and conducted by one sponsor represents a trial programme of a drug indication (for example treatment of influenza).

Search Methods

We searched trial registries, cross-referencing published and unpublished sources and corresponded with manufacturers and regulators. We searched the archives of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European and Japanese regulators. The evidence in this review reflects searches to obtain relevant information up to 12 April 2011.

Selection Criteria

We included regulatory information based on assessments of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in people of any age who had either confirmed or suspected influenza, or who had been exposed to influenza in the local community or place of residence. We included information which had been made available by our deadline.

Data Collection and Analysis

We indexed regulatory information in two purpose-built instruments and reconstructed trials using CONSORT statement-based templates. To progress to Stage 2 (full analysis) we sought manufacturer explanations of discrepancies in the data. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) offered us individual patient data and responded to our queries, but Roche did not provide us with complete clinical study reports. In Stage 2 we intended to analyse trials with validated data (i.e. assuming our validation questions aimed at clarifying omissions and discrepancies were resolved). No studies progressed to Stage 2. We carried out analyses of the effects of oseltamivir on time to first alleviation of symptoms and hospitalisations using the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and tested five hypotheses generated post-protocol publication.

Main Results

We included and analysed data from 25 studies (15 oseltamivir and 10 zanamivir studies). We could not use data from a further 42 studies due to insufficient information or unresolved discrepancies in their data. The included trials were predominantly conducted in adults during influenza seasons in both hemispheres. A small number of studies were conducted in older people residing in care homes and in people with underlying respiratory diseases. The studies had adequate randomisation and blinding procedures, but imbalances in the analysis populations available (ITT influenza-infected) left many of the studies at risk of attrition bias. All the studies were sponsored by manufacturers of NIs. Time to first alleviation of symptoms in people with influenza-like illness symptoms (i.e. ITT population) was a median of 160 hours (range 125 to 192 hours) in the placebo groups and oseltamivir shortened this by around 21 hours (95% confidence interval (CI) -29.5 to -12.9 hours, P < 0.001; five studies) but there was no evidence of effect on hospitalisations based on seven studies with a median placebo group event rate of 0.84% (range 0% to 11%): odds ratio (OR) 0.95; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.61, P = 0.86). These results are based on the comprehensive ITT population data and are unlikely to be biased. A post-protocol analysis showed that participants randomised to oseltamivir in treatment trials had a reduced odds being diagnosed with influenza (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.73 to 0.94, P = 0.003; eight studies), probably due to an altered antibody response. Zanamivir trials showed no evidence of this. Due to limitations in the design, conduct and reporting of the trial programme, the data available to us lacked sufficient detail to credibly assess a possible effect of oseltamivir on complications and viral transmission. We postponed analysis of zanamivir evidence because of the offer of individual patient data (IPD) from its manufacturer. The authors have been unable to obtain the full set of clinical study reports or obtain verification of data from the manufacturer of oseltamivir (Roche) despite five requests between June 2010 and February 2011. No substantial comments were made by Roche on the protocol of our Cochrane Review which has been publicly available since December 2010.

Authors' Conclusions

We found a high risk of publication and reporting biases in the trial programme of oseltamivir. Sub-population analyses of the influenza infected population in the oseltamivir trial programme are not possible because the two arms are non-comparable due to oseltamivir's apparent interference with antibody production. The evidence supports a direct oseltamivir mechanism of action on symptoms but we are unable to draw conclusions about its effect on complications or transmission. We expect full clinical study reports containing study protocol, reporting analysis plan, statistical analysis plan and individual patient data to clarify outstanding issues. These full clinical study reports are at present unavailable to us.

### Debate regarding oseltamivir use for seasonal and pandemic influenza [^116FCHB8]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The first pandemic of the 21st century occurred unexpectedly in 2009 after the global spread of a novel virus — influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 — of swine (rather than avian) origin. In response, many countries activated their stockpiles of antiviral agents or accessed existing community supplies. This was the first time that specific antiviral drugs were available in a pandemic. In the United States during 2009, 8.7 million oseltamivir prescriptions (28.4 prescriptions/1,000 persons) were dispensed from community pharmacies, not from the stockpile, at a cost of US $905 million.

Although the number of deaths due to the 2009 pandemic was lower than initially anticipated, a unique opportunity was provided to review the effectiveness of oseltamivir in the pandemic setting and to determine the benefit of oseltamivir for patients who were hospitalized with confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection. Such observational data were valuable to ascertain the effect of oseltamivir in severely ill or hospitalized patients given the continued absence of data from placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trials.

Questioning whether oseltamivir is useful for treating serious illness and whether it should be stockpiled has extended the debate on the effectiveness of oseltamivir in the community. We believe that these issues should be considered separately.

### Improving access to influenza testing and treatment: is It time for over-the-counter oseltamivir? [^114To32n]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Oseltamivir, an antiviral medication that has been used for influenza prophylaxis and treatment since 1999 and now available as a generic drug, is being considered for over-the-counter (OTC) status to allow individuals to access treatment without a prescription. This proposal has engendered controversy. With the rising availability of at-home diagnostic tests and the ever-present threat of an influenza pandemic, it is timely to revisit issues surrounding this controversy. In this commentary, we examine the potential benefits and risks of reclassifying oseltamivir as an OTC drug to enhance access to rapid influenza treatment. Additionally, we explore alternative models to improve oseltamivir accessibility, potentially utilizing rapid influenza testing. As newer drugs to treat influenza are proven safe and effective, they would be subject to similar considerations.

8.2	Lactation

Risk Summary

Based on limited published data, oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate have been shown to be present in human milk at low levels considered unlikely to lead to toxicity in the breastfed infant. Postmarketing experience has not reported any information to suggest serious adverse effects of oseltamivir exposure via breast milk in infants. It is not known if oseltamivir affects human milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for oseltamivir phosphate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Treatment of Influenza

The safety and efficacy of oseltamivir phosphate for the treatment of influenza in pediatric patients 2 weeks old to 17 years of age has been established [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.1)] and is based on:

- **13 to 17 years of age**: Safety and efficacy in adolescent patients 13 to 17 years of age was supported by adequate and well‐controlled trials in adults and adolescents and younger pediatric patients and safety data in adolescents treated with oseltamivir phosphate in a study of treatment and prophylaxis.

- **1 year to 12 years of age**: Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients 1 year to 12 years of age was supported by results of one double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial in 452 pediatric patients with influenza in whom oseltamivir phosphate 2 mg per kg twice daily or placebo was administered within 48 hours of symptom onset [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Additional safety information was provided in a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial in pediatric patients 6 to 12 years of age with known asthma. Efficacy could not be established in pediatric patients with asthma.

- **2 weeks to less than 1 year of age**: Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age is supported by adequate and well‐controlled trials in adults and older pediatric patients and two open‐label trials of oseltamivir phosphate (2 to 3.5 mg per kg twice daily for 5 days) in 136 pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age. In these two trials, the oseltamivir plasma concentrations in these subjects were similar to or higher than the oseltamivir plasma concentrations observed in older pediatric subjects and adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

### Influenza virus resistance to antiviral agents: a plea for rational use [^113jjc97]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Although influenza vaccine can prevent influenza virus infection, the only therapeutic options to treat influenza virus infection are antiviral agents. At the current time, nearly all influenza A/H3N2 viruses and a percentage of influenza A/H1N1 viruses are adamantane resistant, which leaves only neuraminidase inhibitors available for treatment of infection with these viruses. In December 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new data demonstrating that a high percentage of circulating influenza A/H1N1 viruses are now resistant to oseltamivir. In addition, oseltamivir-resistant influenza B and A/H5N1 viruses have been identified. Thus, use of monotherapy for influenza virus infection is irrational and may contribute to mutational pressure for further selection of antiviral-resistant strains. History has demonstrated that monotherapy for influenza virus infection leads to resistance, resulting in the use of a new monotherapy agent followed by resistance to that new agent and thus resulting in a background of viruses resistant to both drugs. We argue that combination antiviral therapy, new guidelines for indications for treatment, point-of-care diagnostic testing, and a universal influenza vaccination recommendation are critical to protecting the population against influenza virus and to preserving the benefits of antiviral agents.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2024–2025: technical report [^1138VptM]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Influenza antiviral therapy in children — The AAP considers oral oseltamivir (Tamiflu) the antiviral drug of choice for the management of illness caused by influenza virus infections, and states, This is the only drug recommended by the AAP for treatment of hospitalized children. Available agents include neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs [oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir]) and baloxavir, all of which have activity against influenza A and B viruses. Inhaled zanamivir (Relenza) is an acceptable alternative for patients 7 years and older who do not have chronic respiratory disease, with a nationwide cohort study reporting zanamivir was not inferior to oseltamivir in preventing influenza-related hospitalization or death when started within 48 hours, although an exploratory subgroup analysis favored oseltamivir in children through 17 years of age. A single dose of intravenous peramivir (Rapivab) is approved for acute uncomplicated influenza in ambulatory children 6 months and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 2 days, but its efficacy for serious influenza requiring hospitalization has not been established; among hospitalized children 0 to 5 years of age with influenza A, oseltamivir was associated with improved recovery and shorter hospital stays (5 vs 6 days; P = 0.02), and in another retrospective cohort of 97 children 29 days to 18 years of age treated with peramivir, fever duration and influenza nucleic acid positivity were shorter for influenza A H3N2 than for influenza B, with other outcomes similar.

### Modeling influenza antiviral strategies: reducing burden and preventing resistance [^1115AJ9u]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Seasonal influenza remains a major cause of disease and death globally, leading to an estimated 290 000–650 000 deaths each year and causing many more people to be hospitalized. Annual vaccination campaigns help reduce that burden but are impeded by low coverage (< 50% of people receive the vaccine in a typical season) and limited vaccine effectiveness due to the rapid evolution of the influenza virus, which makes it challenging to match vaccine strains to circulating strains. Antiviral drugs are used both therapeutically to reduce illness duration and complications and, much less frequently, prophylactically to prevent illness, particularly in high-risk individuals. If taken shortly after the onset of symptoms, antivirals can reduce infectiousness and thereby reduce virus transmission to individuals who come in contact with treated case patients. In addition to mitigating the seasonal burden of influenza, antivirals are stockpiled by the United States and other nations as a first line of defense against novel influenza viruses that spill over from wild or domesticated animals, such as the highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) observed in humans in the United States in 2024.

Two classes of antivirals are currently recommended for influenza treatment in the United States: the neuraminidase inhibitors, including the most commonly prescribed antiviral oseltamivir which is approved for all ages (brand name Tamiflu), and the endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir marboxil, approved for adults and children aged ≥ 5 years (brand name Xofluza; referred to as baloxavir hereafter). In Europe, baloxavir is approved for treatment and prevention of influenza starting at 1 year of age. Baloxavir and oseltamivir are effective in reducing the duration of symptoms in patients treated for influenza A virus illness, but clinical trial data indicate that upper respiratory tract infectious viral titers decrease faster in baloxavir-treated than oseltamivir-treated patients. Findings from prior observational studies and a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of oseltamivir treatment indicate that its timely use may reduce virus transmission to household contacts. Observational data indicate that baloxavir treatment also reduces the risk of onward virus transmission to close contacts, and a randomized placebo-controlled trial measured this effect.

Special authorizations during public health emergencies

The following pathways are reserved for when a national or global public health emergency has been formally declared.

FDA's Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) is enabled once the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services declares a specific national public health emergency. It considers whether the "known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks" providing that no reasonable alternatives exist for treating the cause of the specified national public health emergency. Data to support the application may include domestic and/or foreign clinical trial data, in vivo animal data, and in vitro data that provide plausible support for clinical efficacy. Access to a product under an EUA is limited to the duration of the national health emergency and the specific access caveats imposed. Thereafter the product is again considered investigational. For example, during the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak, EUAs were granted for the dispensing of Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate) and Relenza (zanamivir), and intravenous Peramivir. These were discontinued in 2010 once H1N1 was no longer deemed a threat to the United States. This pathway is applicable to medicines, biologics, vaccines, and medical devices, including in vitro diagnostics. So far, the EUA has been utilized primarily for diagnostic tests for several infectious agents including influenza, anthrax, coronaviruses, ebolavirus, and zika viruses.

- Influenza and COVID-19 have overlapping signs and symptoms. Testing can help distinguish between influenza virus infection and SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, clinicians should not wait for the results of influenza testing, SARS-CoV-2 testing, or multiplex molecular assays that detect influenza A and B viruses and SARS-CoV-2 to initiate empiric antiviral treatment for influenza in the above priority groups.
- Co-infection with influenza A or B viruses and SARS-CoV-2 can occur and should be considered, particularly in hospitalized patients with severe respiratory disease.
- Patients at higher risk for influenza complications should be advised to call their provider as soon as possible if they have acute respiratory illness symptoms for consideration of infection with influenza A or B viruses, SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory pathogens.
- Clinicians can consider starting early empiric antiviral treatment of non-higher-risk outpatients with suspected influenza, based upon clinical judgment, including without an office visit. SARS-CoV-2 and other etiologies of acute respiratory illness should also be considered.
- Infectious Diseases Society of America Guidelines on the Treatment and Management of Patients with COVID-19 are available.
- Clinical algorithms for the testing and treatment of influenza when SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses are circulating are available.

Antiviral Medications Recommended for Treatment and Chemoprophylaxis of Influenza Download Table 1. Antiviral Medications Recommended for Treatment and Chemoprophylaxis of Influenza Abbreviations: N/A = not applicable, COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
- Oral oseltamivir phosphate is approved by the FDA for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset in people 14 days and older, and for chemoprophylaxis in people 1 year and older. Although not part of the FDA-approved indications, use of oral oseltamivir for treatment of influenza in infants less than 14 days old, and for chemoprophylaxis in infants 3 months to 1 year, is recommended by the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics.
- There are no data available for use of peramivir for chemoprophylaxis of influenza.
- The recommended treatment course for uncomplicated influenza is two doses per day of oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir for 5 days, or one dose of intravenous peramivir or oral baloxavir for 1 day.
- While influenza vaccination is the best way to prevent influenza illness, a history of influenza vaccination does not rule out the possibility of influenza virus infection in an ill patient with clinical signs and symptoms compatible with influenza.

### Update: influenza activity-United States, September 28-December 6, 2014 [^115kqX51]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Antiviral medications continue to be an important adjunct to vaccination for reducing the health impact of influenza. On January 21, 2011, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations on the use of antiviral agents for treatment and chemoprophylaxis of influenza were released. This guidance remains in effect for the 2014–15 season, and recommended antiviral medications include oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). All influenza viruses tested for the 2014–15 season since October 1 have been susceptible to oseltamivir and zanamivir. Amantadine and rimantadine are not recommended because of high levels of resistance to these drugs among circulating influenza A viruses. In addition, influenza B viruses are not susceptible to amantadine or rimantadine. Treatment with antivirals is recommended as soon as possible without waiting for confirmatory testing for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; who require hospitalization; or who are at higher risk for influenza complications §§§. Clinical benefit is greatest when antiviral treatment is administered early. When indicated, antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible after illness onset, ideally within 48 hours of symptom onset. However, antiviral treatment might still have some benefits in patients with severe, complicated, or progressive illness and in hospitalized patients when started after 48 hours of illness onset. Antiviral treatment also may be considered for previously healthy, symptomatic outpatients who are not considered to be at high risk and have confirmed or suspected influenza, if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset. Residents of long-term care facilities can experience severe and fatal illness during influenza outbreaks; residents with confirmed or suspected influenza should be treated with antivirals immediately, without waiting for laboratory confirmation of influenza. During periods where two or more residents of long-term care facilities are ill within 72 hours with confirmed or suspected influenza, antivirals should be given prophylactically to residents and should be considered for any unvaccinated staff. Additionally, antiviral chemoprophylaxis can be considered for all staff, regardless of vaccination status, if the outbreak is caused by a strain of influenza virus that is not well matched to the vaccine.

Influenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted online weekly and are available at. Additional information regarding influenza viruses, influenza surveillance, influenza vaccine, influenza antiviral medications, and novel influenza A virus infections in humans is available at.

### Neuraminidase inhibitors for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza in children: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112v9sT3]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

During epidemic years, influenza attack rates often exceed 40% in preschool children and 30% in school age children. School age children are the main source of spread of influenza into households. In some influenza seasons, a quarter of children presenting to emergency departments and paediatric clinics with respiratory symptoms or fever will have laboratory evidence of influenza. Moreover, complications of influenza are common in children and include respiratory tract infections (acute otitis media, sinusitis, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, croup), febrile convulsions, and exacerbations of asthma. Acute otitis media, for example, occurs in 20–50% of children under 6 after influenza. In contrast, deaths from seasonal influenza are rare. During the 2003–4 influenza season in the United States, 2.1 per million children died from influenza or its complications, such as pneumonia. In the current H1N1 pandemic, about 30% of cases in the United Kingdom have been in children aged under 10.

The primary strategy for control of influenza is vaccination. Coverage, however, might be low, and often there is inadequate time to produce and distribute vaccines in response to emerging strains, such as influenza A/H5N1 and the new variant influenza A/H1N1 (Mexico). Therefore, current control strategies include using antiviral medications for preventing spread, as well as for treating infected individuals. Because amantadine and rimantidine are effective only against influenza A, are limited by drug resistance, and have poor tolerability, they have been replaced by neuraminidase inhibitors. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is administered orally and in the UK is licensed for the treatment and postexposure prophylaxis of influenza in children aged over 1. Zanamivir (Relenza) is inhaled as a dry powder and is currently licensed in the UK for the treatment and postexposure prophylaxis of influenza in children aged 5 and over. For treatment to be effective, current guidelines for treating seasonal influenza state that oseltamivir should be administered within 48 hours and zanamivir within 36 hours of onset of symptoms.

The last update of our Cochrane review of this treatment was in 2005 and included three treatment trials and one prophylaxis trial. We need an accurate, up to date assessment of the benefits and harms of oseltamivir and zanamivir so that national bodies, clinicians, and parents can make evidence informed decisions about treating and preventing influenza in children. We assessed the current evidence for the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of neuraminidase inhibitors for the treatment and prevention of influenza in children.

### Oseltamivir for influenza in adults and children: systematic review of clinical study reports and summary of regulatory comments [^113oYPfX]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To describe the potential benefits and harms of oseltamivir by reviewing all clinical study reports (or similar document when no clinical study report exists) of randomised placebo controlled trials and regulatory comments ("regulatory information").

Design

Systematic review of regulatory information.

Data Sources

Clinical study reports, trial registries, electronic databases, regulatory archives, and correspondence with manufacturers.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Randomised placebo controlled trials on adults and children who had confirmed or suspected exposure to natural influenza.

Main Outcome Measures

Time to first alleviation of symptoms, influenza outcomes, complications, admissions to hospital, and adverse events in the intention to treat population.

Results

From the European Medicines Agency and Roche, we obtained clinical study reports for 83 trials. We included 23 trials in stage 1 (reliability and completeness screen) and 20 in stage 2 (formal analysis). In treatment trials on adults, oseltamivir reduced the time to first alleviation of symptoms by 16.8 hours (95% confidence interval 8.4 to 25.1 hours, P < 0.001). There was no effect in children with asthma, but there was an effect in otherwise healthy children (mean difference 29 hours, 95% confidence interval 12 to 47 hours, P = 0.001). In treatment trials there was no difference in admissions to hospital in adults (risk difference 0.15%, 95% confidence interval -0.91% to 0.78%, P = 0.84) and sparse data in children and for prophylaxis. In adult treatment trials, oseltamivir reduced investigator mediated unverified pneumonia (risk difference 1.00%, 0.22% to 1.49%; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 100, 95% confidence interval 67 to 451). The effect was not statistically significant in the five trials that used a more detailed diagnostic form for "pneumonia", and no clinical study reports reported laboratory or diagnostic confirmation of "pneumonia". The effect on unverified pneumonia in children and for prophylaxis was not significant. There was no significant reduction in risk of unverified bronchitis, otitis media, sinusitis, or any complication classified as serious or that led to study withdrawal. 14 of 20 trials prompted participants to self report all secondary illnesses to an investigator. Oseltamivir in the treatment of adults increased the risk of nausea (risk difference 3.66%, 0.90% to 7.39%; number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 28, 95% confidence interval 14 to 112) and vomiting (4.56%, 2.39% to 7.58%; 22, 14 to 42). In treatment of children, oseltamivir induced vomiting (5.34%, 1.75% to 10.29%; 19, 10 to 57). In prophylaxis trials, oseltamivir reduced symptomatic influenza in participants by 55% (3.05%, 1.83% to 3.88%; NNTB 33, 26 to 55) and households (13.6%, 9.52% to 15.47%; NNTB 7, 6 to 11) based on one study, but there was no significant effect on asymptomatic influenza and no evidence of a reduction in transmission. In prophylaxis studies, oseltamivir increased the risk of psychiatric adverse events during the combined "on-treatment" and "off-treatment" periods (risk difference 1.06%, 0.07% to 2.76%; NNTH 94, 36 to 1538) and there was a dose-response effect on psychiatric events in two "pivotal" treatment trials of oseltamivir, at 75 mg (standard dose) and 150 mg (high dose) twice daily (P = 0.038). In prophylaxis studies, oseltamivir increased the risk of headaches on-treatment (risk difference 3.15%, 0.88% to 5.78%; NNTH 32, 18 to 115), renal events with treatment (0.67%, -0.01% to 2.93%), and nausea while receiving treatment (4.15%, 0.86% to 9.51%; NNTH 25, 11 to 116).

Conclusions

In prophylactic studies oseltamivir reduces the proportion of symptomatic influenza. In treatment studies it also modestly reduces the time to first alleviation of symptoms, but it causes nausea and vomiting and increases the risk of headaches and renal and psychiatric syndromes. The evidence of clinically significant effects on complications and viral transmission is limited because of rarity of such events and problems with study design. The trade-off between benefits and harms should be borne in mind when making decisions to use oseltamivir for treatment, prophylaxis, or stockpiling.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2017–2018 [^112w5696]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Use of antiviral medications — agent selection states that oral oseltamivir remains the antiviral drug of choice for the management of influenza infections; although more difficult to administer, inhaled zanamivir is an equally acceptable alternative for patients who do not have chronic respiratory disease; and intravenous peramivir, a third neuraminidase inhibitor, is available for children who cannot absorb orally or tolerate inhaled zanamivir.

Oseltamivir Treatment of Severe Influenza

Although necessary to consider oseltamivir's effect on more serious infections, no randomized controlled trials exist that can be included in a meta-analysis. The Cochrane group chooses only to conduct meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials, which are generally accepted to be the highest level of evidence. Thus, the Cochrane group could not review severe outcomes of laboratory-confirmed influenza. Evidence is instead derived from observational studies on the use of oseltamivir to treat complications of influenza virus infection, as in hospitalized patients or in those who died. These studies are subject to uncontrolled bias. For instance, sicker patients may be more (or less) likely to be treated, thus attenuating (or exaggerating) the effect of the intervention. Also, a serious outcome may occur soon after the treatment was initiated in a severely ill patient, so that the treatment has not had a chance to succeed. Similarly, patients who receive early treatment are more likely to benefit from treatment than patients who receive late treatment. To minimize bias, researchers conducting observational studies have attempted to adjust for time from disease onset to treatment and time from treatment to outcome. Some observational studies have also adjusted for propensity to be treated as well as patient coexisting conditions and disease severity, which may affect treatment decisions and outcomes.

Observational studies that enrolled adults have often used death as an outcome, given its ease of definition. However, many observational studies fail to control completely for potential biases, including time biases. Among studies that have attempted to control for these biases, a decreased risk for death after oseltamivir treatment has been reported, and early treatment appears to be critical. For instance, in a retrospective cohort study from Israel of 449 patients hospitalized with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, all patients were treated with oseltamivir, and 189 (42%) were treated within 48 hours. This observational study controlled for propensity to treat and patient coexisting conditions and demonstrated the odds of death increased by 2.2 times (95% CI 1.4–3.5 times) if treatment was started late (> 48 hours after symptom onset).

### WHO rapid advice guidelines for pharmacological management of sporadic human infection with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus [^112HzBji]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Recent spread of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus to poultry and wild birds has increased the threat of human infections with H5N1 virus worldwide. Despite international agreement to stockpile antivirals, evidence-based guidelines for their use do not exist. WHO assembled an international multidisciplinary panel to develop rapid advice for the pharmacological management of human H5N1 virus infection in the current pandemic alert period. A transparent methodological guideline process on the basis of the Grading Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to develop evidence-based guidelines. Our development of specific recommendations for treatment and chemoprophylaxis of sporadic H5N1 infection resulted from the benefits, harms, burden, and cost of interventions in several patient and exposure groups. Overall, the quality of the underlying evidence for all recommendations was rated as very low because it was based on small case series of H5N1 patients, on extrapolation from preclinical studies, and high quality studies of seasonal influenza. A strong recommendation to treat H5N1 patients with oseltamivir was made in part because of the severity of the disease. Similarly, strong recommendations were made to use neuraminidase inhibitors as chemoprophylaxis in high-risk exposure populations. Emergence of other novel influenza A viral subtypes with pandemic potential, or changes in the pathogenicity of H5N1 virus strains, will require an update of these guidelines and WHO will be monitoring this closely.

### Neuraminidase inhibitors for preventing and treating influenza in adults and children [^115Y1Y7R]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs) are stockpiled and recommended by public health agencies for treating and preventing seasonal and pandemic influenza. They are used clinically worldwide.

Objectives

To describe the potential benefits and harms of NIs for influenza in all age groups by reviewing all clinical study reports of published and unpublished randomised, placebo-controlled trials and regulatory comments.

Search Methods

We searched trial registries, electronic databases (to 22 July 2013) and regulatory archives, and corresponded with manufacturers to identify all trials. We also requested clinical study reports. We focused on the primary data sources of manufacturers but we checked that there were no published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from non-manufacturer sources by running electronic searches in the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE, Embase.com, PubMed (not MEDLINE), the Database of Reviews of Effects, the NHS Economic Evaluation Database and the Health Economic Evaluations Database.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, placebo-controlled trials on adults and children with confirmed or suspected exposure to naturally occurring influenza.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted clinical study reports and assessed risk of bias using purpose-built instruments. We analysed the effects of zanamivir and oseltamivir on time to first alleviation of symptoms, influenza outcomes, complications, hospitalisations and adverse events in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. All trials were sponsored by the manufacturers.

Main Results

We obtained 107 clinical study reports from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), GlaxoSmithKline and Roche. We accessed comments by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), EMA and Japanese regulator. We included 53 trials in Stage 1 (a judgement of appropriate study design) and 46 in Stage 2 (formal analysis), including 20 oseltamivir (9623 participants) and 26 zanamivir trials (14,628 participants). Inadequate reporting put most of the zanamivir studies and half of the oseltamivir studies at a high risk of selection bias. There were inadequate measures in place to protect 11 studies of oseltamivir from performance bias due to non-identical presentation of placebo. Attrition bias was high across the oseltamivir studies and there was also evidence of selective reporting for both the zanamivir and oseltamivir studies. The placebo interventions in both sets of trials may have contained active substances. Time to first symptom alleviation. For the treatment of adults, oseltamivir reduced the time to first alleviation of symptoms by 16.8 hours (95% confidence interval (CI) 8.4 to 25.1 hours, P < 0.0001). This represents a reduction in the time to first alleviation of symptoms from 7 to 6.3 days. There was no effect in asthmatic children, but in otherwise healthy children there was (reduction by a mean difference of 29 hours, 95% CI 12 to 47 hours, P = 0.001). Zanamivir reduced the time to first alleviation of symptoms in adults by 0.60 days (95% CI 0.39 to 0.81 days, P < 0.00001), equating to a reduction in the mean duration of symptoms from 6.6 to 6.0 days. The effect in children was not significant. In subgroup analysis we found no evidence of a difference in treatment effect for zanamivir on time to first alleviation of symptoms in adults in the influenza-infected and non-influenza-infected subgroups (P = 0.53). Hospitalisations. Treatment of adults with oseltamivir had no significant effect on hospitalisations: risk difference (RD) 0.15% (95% CI -0.78 to 0.91). There was also no significant effect in children or in prophylaxis. Zanamivir hospitalisation data were unreported. Serious influenza complications or those leading to study withdrawal. In adult treatment trials, oseltamivir did not significantly reduce those complications classified as serious or those which led to study withdrawal (RD 0.07%, 95% CI -0.78 to 0.44), nor in child treatment trials; neither did zanamivir in the treatment of adults or in prophylaxis. There were insufficient events to compare this outcome for oseltamivir in prophylaxis or zanamivir in the treatment of children. Pneumonia. Oseltamivir significantly reduced self reported, investigator-mediated, unverified pneumonia (RD 1.00%, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.49); number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 100 (95% CI 67 to 451) in the treated population. The effect was not significant in the five trials that used a more detailed diagnostic form for pneumonia. There were no definitions of pneumonia (or other complications) in any trial. No oseltamivir treatment studies reported effects on radiologically confirmed pneumonia. There was no significant effect on unverified pneumonia in children. There was no significant effect of zanamivir on either self reported or radiologically confirmed pneumonia. In prophylaxis, zanamivir significantly reduced the risk of self reported, investigator-mediated, unverified pneumonia in adults (RD 0.32%, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.41); NNTB = 311 (95% CI 244 to 1086), but not oseltamivir. Bronchitis, sinusitis and otitis media. Zanamivir significantly reduced the risk of bronchitis in adult treatment trials (RD 1.80%, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.80); NNTB = 56 (36 to 155), but not oseltamivir. Neither NI significantly reduced the risk of otitis media and sinusitis in both adults and children. Harms of treatment. Oseltamivir in the treatment of adults increased the risk of nausea (RD 3.66%, 95% CI 0.90 to 7.39); number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) = 28 (95% CI 14 to 112) and vomiting (RD 4.56%, 95% CI 2.39 to 7.58); NNTH = 22 (14 to 42). The proportion of participants with four-fold increases in antibody titre was significantly lower in the treated group compared to the control group (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.97, I(2) statistic = 0%) (5% absolute difference between arms). Oseltamivir significantly decreased the risk of diarrhoea (RD 2.33%, 95% CI 0.14 to 3.81); NNTB = 43 (95% CI 27 to 709) and cardiac events (RD 0.68%, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.0); NNTB = 148 (101 to 2509) compared to placebo during the on-treatment period. There was a dose-response effect on psychiatric events in the two oseltamivir "pivotal" treatment trials, WV15670 and WV15671, at 150 mg (standard dose) and 300 mg daily (high dose) (P = 0.038). In the treatment of children, oseltamivir induced vomiting (RD 5.34%, 95% CI 1.75 to 10.29); NNTH = 19 (95% CI 10 to 57). There was a significantly lower proportion of children on oseltamivir with a four-fold increase in antibodies (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00, I(2) = 0%). Prophylaxis. In prophylaxis trials, oseltamivir and zanamivir reduced the risk of symptomatic influenza in individuals (oseltamivir: RD 3.05% (95% CI 1.83 to 3.88); NNTB = 33 (26 to 55); zanamivir: RD 1.98% (95% CI 0.98 to 2.54); NNTB = 51 (40 to 103)) and in households (oseltamivir: RD 13.6% (95% CI 9.52 to 15.47); NNTB = 7 (6 to 11); zanamivir: RD 14.84% (95% CI 12.18 to 16.55); NNTB = 7 (7 to 9)). There was no significant effect on asymptomatic influenza (oseltamivir: RR 1.14 (95% CI 0.39 to 3.33); zanamivir: RR 0.97 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.24)). Non-influenza, influenza-like illness could not be assessed due to data not being fully reported. In oseltamivir prophylaxis studies, psychiatric adverse events were increased in the combined on- and off-treatment periods (RD 1.06%, 95% CI 0.07 to 2.76); NNTH = 94 (95% CI 36 to 1538) in the study treatment population. Oseltamivir increased the risk of headaches whilst on treatment (RD 3.15%, 95% CI 0.88 to 5.78); NNTH = 32 (95% CI 18 to 115), renal events whilst on treatment (RD 0.67%, 95% CI -2.93 to 0.01); NNTH = 150 (NNTH 35 to NNTB > 1000) and nausea whilst on treatment (RD 4.15%, 95% CI 0.86 to 9.51); NNTH = 25 (95% CI 11 to 116).

Authors' Conclusions

Oseltamivir and zanamivir have small, non-specific effects on reducing the time to alleviation of influenza symptoms in adults, but not in asthmatic children. Using either drug as prophylaxis reduces the risk of developing symptomatic influenza. Treatment trials with oseltamivir or zanamivir do not settle the question of whether the complications of influenza (such as pneumonia) are reduced, because of a lack of diagnostic definitions. The use of oseltamivir increases the risk of adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, psychiatric effects and renal events in adults and vomiting in children. The lower bioavailability may explain the lower toxicity of zanamivir compared to oseltamivir. The balance between benefits and harms should be considered when making decisions about use of both NIs for either the prophylaxis or treatment of influenza. The influenza virus-specific mechanism of action proposed by the producers does not fit the clinical evidence.

### Update: influenza activity-United States, September 29-December 7, 2013 [^113bBvfh]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Antiviral medications continue to be an important adjunct to vaccination for reducing the health impact of influenza. On January 21, 2011, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations on the use of antiviral agents for treatment and chemoprophylaxis of influenza were released. This guidance remains in effect for the 2013–14 season. Treatment with antivirals is recommended as soon as possible for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; who require hospitalization; or who are at higher risk for influenza complications, ††† without waiting for confirmatory testing. Antiviral treatment also may be considered for outpatients with confirmed or suspected influenza who do not have known risk factors for severe illness, and is most effective when treatment is initiated within 48 hours of illness onset. Recommended antiviral medications include oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). The majority of influenza viruses tested for the 2013–14 season since October 1, 2013, have been susceptible to oseltamivir. The seven oseltamivir-resistant pH1N1 viruses identified in late October through November were from three different states in the South and West. Sporadic oseltamivir-resistant pH1N1 virus infections, including small geographic clusters, have occurred previously, but the public health impact has been limited. This situation is being closely monitored. All influenza viruses, including those from the oseltamivir-resistant cluster, tested since October 1, 2013, have been susceptible to zanamivir. Amantadine and rimantadine are not recommended because of high levels of resistance to these drugs among circulating influenza A viruses. In addition, influenza B viruses are not susceptible to amantadine or rimantadine.

Influenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted online weekly and are available at. Additional information regarding influenza viruses, influenza surveillance, influenza vaccine, influenza antiviral medications, and novel influenza A virus infections in humans is available at.

### Oseltamivir phosphate [^113xoYFK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3	Recommended Dosage for Prophylaxis of Influenza

Initiate post-exposure prophylaxis with oseltamivir phosphate capsules within 48 hours following close contact with an infected individual. Initiate seasonal prophylaxis with oseltamivir phosphate capsules during a community outbreak.

 Adults and Adolescents (13 years of age and older)

The recommended dosage of oseltamivir phosphate capsules for prophylaxis of influenza in adults and adolescents 13 years and older is 75 mg orally once daily (one 75 mg capsule or 12.5 mL of oral suspension once daily) for at least 10 days following close contact with an infected individual and up to 6 weeks during a community outbreak. In immunocompromised patients, oseltamivir phosphate capsules may be continued for up to 12 weeks [see Use in Specific Populations (8.9)]. The duration of protection lasts for as long as oseltamivir phosphate capsules dosing is continued.

 Pediatric Patients (1 year to 12 years of age)

Table 1 displays the recommended oral dosage of oseltamivir phosphate capsules for prophylaxis of influenza in pediatric patients 1 year to 12 years of age based on body weight and provides information about prescribing the capsule or the formulation for oral suspension. Prophylaxis in pediatric patients is recommended for 10 days following close contact with an infected individual and up to 6 weeks during a community outbreak [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Table 1 Oseltamivir phosphate Dosage Recommendations in Pediatric Patients for Treatment and Prophylaxis of Influenza

* The recommended duration for post-exposure prophylaxis is 10 days and the recommended duration for community outbreak (seasonal/pre-exposure) prophylaxis is up to 6 weeks (or up to 12 weeks in immunocompromised patients). The amount supplied (e.g., number of bottles or capsules) for seasonal prophylaxis may be greater than for post-exposure prophylaxis.

†Use an oral dosing dispensing device that measures the appropriate volume in mL with the oral suspension.

‡Oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension is the preferred formulation for patients who cannot swallow capsules.

§For patients less than 1 year of age, provide an appropriate dosing device that can accurately measure and administer small volumes.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2022–2023 [^115SKeEY]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Influenza antivirals in children — agents and preferred therapy are summarized. Antiviral agents available for treatment and chemoprophylaxis include the neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs: oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir) and a selective inhibitor of influenza cap-dependent endonuclease (baloxavir), all of which have activity against influenza A and B viruses. Oral oseltamivir (Tamiflu) remains the antiviral drug of choice for the management of illness caused by influenza virus infections, and inhaled zanamivir (Relenza) is an equally acceptable alternative for patients who do not have chronic respiratory disease. Options are limited for children who cannot absorb orally or enterally administered oseltamivir or tolerate inhaled zanamivir. Intravenous peramivir (Rapivab) was approved in September 2017 for treatment of acute complicated influenza in ambulatory children 2 years and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 2 days, and in February 2021 the FDA expanded approval to include children as young as 6 months of age; however, the efficacy of peramivir in patients with serious influenza requiring hospitalization has not been established, and IV zanamivir is not approved in the United States and has not been available for compassionate use since the 2017 to 2018 season.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^114tLpsz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Seasonal influenza (IDSA 2018) — immunocompromised patients: Influenza viral replication, including asymptomatic shedding, can be prolonged and resistant variants during or after antiviral treatment can occur more frequently than in immunocompetent patients. Retrospectively collected data suggest treatment can safely extend to 10 days or longer, and rebound viral replication has been observed in some patients treated for 5 days; longer duration is advisable if disease is severe and influenza viral RNA remains detectable. There are no data to support the use of higher doses of oseltamivir in this population. Early initiation of antiviral therapy is associated with the best outcomes, although clinical benefit has been reported when starting treatment > 48 hours after symptom onset.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2021–2022 [^112Wvoir]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Influenza antivirals in children — agent classes, approvals, and age/timing parameters are summarized as follows: The neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) (oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir) and a selective inhibitor of influenza cap-dependent endonuclease (baloxavir) have activity against influenza A and B viruses. Oral oseltamivir (Tamiflu) remains the antiviral drug of choice for the management of illness caused by influenza virus infections, and inhaled zanamivir (Relenza) is an equally acceptable alternative for patients who do not have chronic respiratory disease, although options are limited for children who cannot absorb orally or enterally administered oseltamivir or tolerate inhaled zanamivir. Intravenous (IV) peramivir (Rapivab) was approved in September 2017 as a treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza in nonhospitalized children 2 years and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 2 days, but the efficacy of peramivir in patients with serious influenza requiring hospitalization has not been established, and IV zanamivir is not approved in the United States and has not been available for compassionate use since the 2017–2018 season. Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza) was approved in 2018 for the early treatment of uncomplicated influenza in outpatients 12 years and older who have been ill for no more than 2 days; in a phase 3 randomized, double-blind, active controlled study in children 1 to 12 years of age, baloxavir treatment was well tolerated and resulted in a similar median time to alleviation of signs and symptoms of influenza as oseltamivir in ambulatory children with acute influenza, and another study suggests that baloxavir is also effective in reducing viral titers and achieving comparable time to alleviation of symptoms as NAIs in high-risk patients ≥ 12 years of age with uncomplicated influenza. In November 2020, baloxavir was approved by the FDA for single-dose postexposure prophylaxis in people 12 years of age or older after exposure to someone with influenza.
