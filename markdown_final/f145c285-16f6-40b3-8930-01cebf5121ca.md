First line diabetic medicine

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medication should be used first for type 2 diabetes, and in what situations alternatives might be considered. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about foundational lifestyle therapy and whether it truly precedes or accompanies pharmacotherapy. Then, I should verify the consensus on metformin as the default first-line drug and the strength of evidence. Next, I will review how cardiorenal risk status modifies the initial choice, including ADA/EASD and cardiometabolic society guidance. After that, I should weigh cost, access, and equity considerations. I will then consider special populations, such as older adults, people with obesity, and those with marked hyperglycemia. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, patient-centered algorithm and state the bottom line with caveats, making sure each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the foundation: lifestyle modification is first-line and should begin at diagnosis and continue lifelong, with diabetes self-management education and support, nutrition, and physical activity integrated into the plan. Pharmacotherapy is layered on top of that, not in place of it, and I need to ensure I do not overstate medication sequencing without acknowledging this baseline requirement [^114rkHe5] [^111AVvMo] [^113PkgNo].

> Now, I should verify the default pharmacologic first-line choice. Across ADA/EASD, AAFP, and Canadian guidelines, metformin remains the preferred initial agent for most adults with type 2 diabetes unless contraindicated or not tolerated, owing to durable A1C lowering, low hypoglycemia risk, weight neutrality or modest loss, favorable safety profile, and low cost; I should double-check that this consensus remains consistent in 2024–2025 updates, and yes, it does [^1166XBdv] [^112gSxmS] [^114yCGpj] [^117H4U9h].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — metformin's cardiovascular outcome data are less robust than its glycemic efficacy, so I need to check how guidelines have evolved for patients with established ASCVD, heart failure, or CKD. The ADA/EASD consensus and cardiometabolic society guidance now recommend that in patients with established ASCVD or at high risk, an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist with proven cardiovascular benefit should be considered as first-line or early add-on, independent of baseline A1C, because these agents reduce MACE, heart failure events, and kidney outcomes; this is where metformin may be deferred or used in combination rather than as sole initial therapy [^114rkHe5] [^112VEpub] [^116dUpym] [^115bxTv3].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of those recommendations. The BMJ 2021 guideline uses risk-stratified recommendations: strong support for SGLT2 inhibitors in those with both CVD and CKD, and weaker but supportive recommendations for SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs across other high-risk categories, emphasizing that absolute benefits scale with baseline risk. This supports tailoring first-line therapy to cardiorenal phenotype rather than a one-size-fits-all metformin approach [^112VEpub].

> I should confirm how broadly these cardiometabolic-first strategies apply in real-world populations. Modeling suggests that a large proportion of U.S. adults with type 2 diabetes meet criteria for GLP-1 RA or SGLT2 inhibitor initiation based on ASCVD/CKD/heart failure risk, underscoring the potential impact on practice patterns and budgets; however, I need to ensure I also weigh cost-effectiveness, which remains unfavorable for universal first-line use of these agents at current prices [^1122m9GD] [^114fmbP1].

> Next, I should review cost, access, and equity. Metformin's low cost and wide availability make it the pragmatic first-line choice in many settings, especially where cost-related barriers exist; guidelines explicitly advise prioritizing lower-cost options when access is limited, while recognizing that formulary step-therapy requirements may lag behind evidence and constrain timely use of SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs in high-risk patients; I need to ensure shared decision-making accounts for these realities [^115Kx4cT] [^1152P4GQ] [^112jY9jx].

> Let me consider special populations and scenarios. In older adults, lifestyle remains first-line and metformin is generally preferred pharmacotherapy if indicated, with attention to renal function and hypoglycemia risk. In people with obesity, weight-losing or weight-neutral agents such as GLP-1 RAs or SGLT2 inhibitors are attractive early options. With marked hyperglycemia at diagnosis (for example, A1C > 1.5% above target), initial combination therapy can be reasonable to accelerate control. And in pregnancy or gestational diabetes, insulin — not metformin — is first-line due to placental transfer and offspring safety concerns [^113PkgNo] [^114NfKkp] [^112Vy4C8] [^111rHtsL].

> I should double-check pediatric considerations. For youth with type 2 diabetes, metformin remains first-line pharmacotherapy alongside lifestyle, with close monitoring and early addition of insulin if glycemic deterioration occurs; this aligns with pediatric guidance and the general principle of metformin's favorable safety profile in children and adolescents [^1162xjCg].

> But wait, what if the patient is drug-naïve and at very high cardiorenal risk — should I start metformin alone or go straight to an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 RA? The contemporary approach is to individualize: in very high-risk patients, starting an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 RA with proven outcome benefit, with or without metformin, is reasonable; in average-risk patients, metformin remains the default; and in cost-constrained settings, metformin followed by timely addition of a cardiorenal-benefit agent is a pragmatic pathway; I need to ensure this is framed as shared decision-making that incorporates patient goals, comorbidities, and access [^112VEpub] [^116dUpym] [^115Kx4cT].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm without oversimplifying. For most adults with type 2 diabetes, start lifestyle therapy and, when medication is indicated, initiate metformin unless contraindicated. Reassess in 3–6 months and add a second agent if A1C remains above target, choosing among SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 RAs, DPP-4 inhibitors, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, or insulin based on comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, weight goals, and cost. For patients with established ASCVD, heart failure, or CKD, prioritize an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 RA with proven benefit early, even as first-line in some cases. For marked hyperglycemia, consider initial combination therapy. And throughout, address adherence, adverse effects, and therapeutic inertia with quarterly follow-up and adjustment [^1166XBdv] [^112VEpub] [^112Vy4C8] [^112jY9jx].

> Bottom line, I should confirm the core answer clearly. Metformin remains the first-line pharmacologic therapy for most adults with type 2 diabetes, initiated alongside lifestyle interventions, because of its efficacy, safety, and affordability; however, in patients with established ASCVD, heart failure, CKD, or high cardiorenal risk, an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 RA with proven cardiovascular and renal benefits should be considered early, sometimes as first-line or as an initial combination, to optimize outcome benefits beyond glycemic control; this is a risk-stratified, patient-centered evolution of care rather than a rejection of metformin's foundational role [^1166XBdv] [^112VEpub] [^116dUpym] [^1152P4GQ].

---

Metformin is the **first-line pharmacologic therapy** for type 2 diabetes because of its efficacy, safety, low hypoglycemia risk, weight neutrality, and low cost [^112gSxmS] [^114yCGpj]. It is recommended by major guidelines unless contraindicated (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², severe hepatic impairment, or high risk of lactic acidosis) [^1166XBdv] [^117H4U9h]. For patients with established ASCVD, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease, **SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists** should be considered early, often alongside metformin, to reduce cardiovascular and renal events [^112VEpub] [^116dUpym]. Lifestyle interventions remain foundational for all patients [^111AVvMo].

---

## Rationale for metformin as first-line therapy

Metformin is the preferred initial pharmacologic therapy for T2DM because it offers **effective glycemic control** — lowering HbA1c by about 1–1.5% — and has a favorable safety profile with minimal hypoglycemia risk, is weight-neutral or promotes modest weight loss, and is generally well tolerated [^112gSxmS] [^114yCGpj]. It is also inexpensive and widely available, supporting broad access and adherence [^115Kx4cT].

---

## Clinical guidelines supporting metformin

Major diabetes organizations consistently recommend metformin as **first-line therapy**:

- **ADA 2025**: Metformin remains the preferred initial pharmacologic treatment unless contraindicated [^notfound].
- **AAFP 2024**: Recommends metformin as first-line due to efficacy, safety, and cost [^112gSxmS].
- **AACE 2023**: Emphasizes metformin as initial therapy for most patients, with early addition of agents for ASCVD, HF, or CKD [^116nzvSq].

---

## Situations where metformin may not be suitable

Metformin is contraindicated or should be used with caution in the following scenarios:

- **Renal impairment**: eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m².
- **Hepatic impairment**: Severe liver disease.
- **Risk of lactic acidosis**: Conditions such as sepsis, dehydration, or severe infection.

---

## Alternative first-line therapies

Recent guidelines recognize that some patients may benefit from alternative **first-line therapies**, particularly when comorbidities are present:

- **SGLT-2 inhibitors**: Recommended for patients with established ASCVD, HF, or CKD due to cardiovascular and renal benefits [^112VEpub] [^116dUpym].
- **GLP-1 receptor agonists**: Recommended for patients with established ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk, particularly when weight loss is desired [^112VEpub] [^116dUpym].

---

## Role of lifestyle interventions

Lifestyle interventions, including dietary modifications, physical activity, and weight management, remain foundational and should be initiated alongside pharmacologic therapy [^111AVvMo]. They enhance glycemic control, reduce cardiovascular risk, and may reduce medication requirements [^112JnKsw].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Patient profile** | **Recommended first-line therapy** |
|-|-|
| General population | Metformin |
| Established ASCVD, HF, or CKD | - SGLT-2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist (often with metformin) [^112VEpub] [^116dUpym] |
| Metformin contraindicated | - SGLT-2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist [^notfound] |

---

Metformin remains the **first-line pharmacologic therapy** for T2DM due to its efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness. Alternative therapies, such as SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists, are recommended for patients with specific comorbidities or when metformin is contraindicated. Lifestyle interventions should be initiated in all patients to optimize glycemic control and reduce cardiovascular risk [^112gSxmS] [^112VEpub].

### Should metformin continue as first-line pharmacotherapy… [^111MVbdR]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Yes: Metformin Is Still the Best Choice Metformin has been the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus for decades. The glucose-lowering effects of metformin were first discovered in the 1920s. 1 After extensive use throughout Europe, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved metformin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes with a 1995 randomized controlled trial demonstrating metformin's safety and efficacy. 2 Following two decades of widespread use in the United States, extended-release and combination formulations were introduced. 4 This study shifted primarily sulfonylurea-based regimens to metformin-first regimens for the treatment of non–insulin-dependent diabetes. Subsequent studies demonstrating reduced mortality in populations with atherothrombosis or heart failure and its affordable cost further solidified metformin as the preferred initial treatment for diabetes.

5, 6 Metformin is the most commonly prescribed glucose-lowering medication worldwide and the recommended initial pharmacologic option in major clinical guidelines, including those from the International Diabetes Federation, American Association of Clinical Endocrinology, and American College of Physicians. 7–9. During the years the FDA guidance was in effect, two novel classes of medications were developed, studied, and marketed: sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. Both have been shown to reduce ASCVD events in patients with type 2 diabetes, leading to questions about whether they should be considered first-line therapy. 17 However, selecting therapy to meet patient goals is the approach every clinician should use for those with type 2 diabetes; this does not automatically exclude the use of metformin.

The goals for each patient are different and include considerations such as costs, adverse effects, and administration. Metformin's established safety and effectiveness at A1C reduction — in addition to its relatively low cost and widespread availability to patients — make it an ideal first-line option for many patients with diabetes. Because of safety concerns, metformin is preferred over other older and inexpensive options such as sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones.
9. Metformin should be included in first-line medication regimens. Whether additional therapies are started concurrently or deferred depends on individual patient goals. Primary care physicians should not overstate the ASCVD benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonist medications.

### A registry-based randomised trial comparing an SGLT2 inhibitor and metformin as standard treatment of early stage type 2 diabetes (SMARTEST): rationale, design and protocol [^111MjjJd]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to reduce cardiovascular and renal complications in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients at high cardiovascular risk. Metformin is currently widely used as initial monotherapy in T2D but lacks convincing data to show that it reduces risk of complications. We aim to compare the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin and metformin as first-line T2D medication with regard to development of complications in a registry-based randomised controlled trial.

Methods

The SGLT2 inhibitor or metformin as standard treatment of early stage type 2 diabetes (SMARTEST) trial will enrol 4300 subjects at 30–40 study sites in Sweden who will be randomised 1:1 to either metformin or dapagliflozin. Participants must have T2D duration < 4 years, no prior cardiovascular disease, and be either drug-naïve or on monotherapy for T2D.

Results

The primary endpoint is a composite of all-cause death, major adverse cardiovascular events and occurrence or progression of microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, diabetic foot lesions). Secondary endpoints include individual components of the primary endpoint, start of insulin therapy, risk factor biomarkers, patient-reported outcome measures, and cost-effectiveness analysis. Outcomes will primarily be assessed using nationwide healthcare registries.

Conclusions

The SMARTEST trial will investigate whether dapagliflozin is superior to metformin in preventing complications in early stage T2D. (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT03982381, EudraCT 2019–001046–17).

### Comparison of national / regional diabetes guidelines for the management of blood glucose control in non-Western countries [^1113SVQx]. Diabetes Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

First-line Medication Therapy for Glucose-Lowering in Type 2 Diabetes

Overall, 33 countries had national guideline recommendations for type 2 diabetes (Table 2). Most countries (67%) recommended lifestyle changes either before or in conjunction with beginning therapy with oral glucose-lowering drugs (OGLDs).

In only one country (Mexico) metformin was not formally endorsed as first-line therapy, but this guideline made provision for use of any oral agent. In South Korea, first-line options included metformin, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, or a sulfonylurea. In Russia, first-line options included metformin, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, or a DPP-4 inhibitor, especially if metformin is poorly tolerated. In all other countries (94%), metformin was recommended as the first-line treatment. However, in 48% of countries who recommended beginning OGLD therapy with metformin, provision was also made for metformin to be used in combination with either another oral agent therapy if HbA 1c was > 8.0% (> 64 mmol/mol), or with insulin if HbA 1c was > 9.0% (> 75 mmol/mol).

Specific recommendations for non-obese, weight-unspecified, or metformin-intolerant people were available in guidelines from 26 (79%) countries. Alternatives included sulfonylureas (77% of countries), thiazolidinediones (35%), glinides (19%), alpha–glucosidase inhibitors (27%), GLP-1 receptor agonists (19%), or DPP-4 inhibitors (35%).

### Narrative review of data supporting alternate first-line therapies over metformin in type 2 diabetes [^115jCeMJ]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The International Diabetes Foundation recommended metformin as the gold standard first-line therapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (DMII) in 2005 due to its proven efficacy and safety profile. In 2006, the American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (ADA/EASD) also endorsed metformin as the first line medication in DMII. Metformin has been shown to reduce blood glucose levels, improve insulin sensitivity, reduce the risk of microvascular complications, and improve cardiovascular outcomes independent of glucose control.

However, in a paradigm shift reflecting recent clinical data, the guidelines for management of DMII have been modified to elevate the use of GLP-1 RA and SGLT-2i. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) and European Society of Cardiology in collaboration with the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (ESC/EASD) both updated their treatment algorithms in 2019 to recommend the use of GLP-1 RA and SGLT-2i as alternate therapy options to metformin based on cardiovascular (CV) and renal comorbidities independent of glycemic control. This was followed by the ADA updating their 2021 guidelines with the same recommendation. In 2022, the ADA/EASD published a consensus report that removed metformin as the only first-line therapy and provided the emphasis of using GLP-1 RA or SGLT-2i as first line options in patients with cardiovascular and renal disease.

### Advances in the management of type 2 diabetes in adults [^1152P4GQ]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Role of metformin

Although metformin was a commonly used background drug in most large trials of cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, several post hoc analyses have demonstrated benefit with GLP1RAs or SGLT2is regardless of background use of metformin. Current guidelines from the American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology no longer recommend metformin as the preferred first line agent for all individuals with type 2 diabetes, and instead suggest consideration of cardiac and kidney comorbidities when selecting first line treatment. Cost is a major consideration in selecting the most appropriate treatment, however, probably contributing to differences in these recommendations from guidelines used in other countries. In the US, insurers have not caught up with the guidelines, and require that metformin is used before other agents. Guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) still recommends metformin as the first line treatment for people with cardiac or kidney comorbidities, or both, with introduction of an SGLT2i in people who cannot tolerate metformin or need intensification of treatment. Despite robust outcome data, GLP1RAs are not recommended ny NICE until failure of triple oral drug treatment and only in people with a high body mass index or in whom insulin treatment cannot be used. Insurance formulary restrictions on prescribing GLP1RAs and SGLT2is, including the requirement of step treatment starting with metformin, still persist but should be reconsidered to better align with scientific evidence.

### Trends in selection and timing of first-line pharmacotherapy in older patients with type 2 diabetes diagnosed between 1994 and 2006 [^1136xNsE]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

To characterize temporal trends in the selection and timing of first-line pharmacotherapy among older patients with Type 2 diabetes.

Design and Methods

We studied five population-based cohorts every 3 years, from 1994 to 2006. In each of those years, we identified all subjects aged 66 years or older newly diagnosed with diabetes and determined the initial glucose-lowering drug and the time between diagnosis and drug initiation. We calculated the proportion of patients prescribed each agent and estimated time from diagnosis to initiation using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.

Results

We identified a total of 64 368 eligible people who initiated drug therapy during the study period. From 1994 to 2006, first-line metformin use increased from 20.1 to 79.0%. Glyburide (glibenclamide) decreased from 71.1% of all first-line therapies in 1994 to 9.8% in 2006, while first-line use of insulin or combination therapy have changed little at approximately 5% each. No other medication exceeded 2% of first-line therapies. The median time from diagnosis to initiation of pharmacotherapy increased dramatically during the study period, from 1.8 years in 1994 to 4.6 years in 2006.

Conclusions

Metformin has become the most commonly used initial medication for the treatment of diabetes. Although guidelines have evolved to recommend more aggressive initiation and intensification of pharmacotherapy, our results suggest that the time from diagnosis to initiation has increased substantially.

### First-line therapy for type 2 diabetes with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists: a cost-effectiveness study [^114fmbP1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) receptor agonists as second-line therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes. Expanding their use as first-line therapy has been proposed but the clinical benefits may not outweigh their costs.

Objective

To evaluate the lifetime cost-effectiveness of a strategy of first-line SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP1 receptor agonists.

Design

Individual-level Monte Carlo-based Markov model.

Data Sources

Randomized trials, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention databases, RED BOOK, and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

Target Population

Drug-naive U.S. patients with type 2 diabetes.

Time Horizon

Lifetime.

Perspective

Health care sector.

Intervention

First-line SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP1 receptor agonists.

Outcome Measures

Life expectancy, lifetime costs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).

Results Of Base-Case Analysis

First-line SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP1 receptor agonists had lower lifetime rates of congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke compared with metformin. First-line SGLT2 inhibitors cost $43 000 more and added 1.8 quality-adjusted months versus first-line metformin ($478 000 per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]). First-line injectable GLP1 receptor agonists cost more and reduced QALYs compared with metformin.

Results Of Sensitivity Analysis

By removing injection disutility, first-line GLP1 receptor agonists were no longer dominated (ICER, $327 000 per QALY). Oral GLP1 receptor agonists were not cost-effective (ICER, $823 000 per QALY). To be cost-effective at under $150 000 per QALY, costs for SGLT2 inhibitors would need to be under $5 per day and under $6 per day for oral GLP1 receptor agonists.

Limitation

U.S. population and costs not generalizable internationally.

Conclusion

As first-line agents, SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP1 receptor agonists would improve type 2 diabetes outcomes, but their costs would need to fall by at least 70% to be cost-effective.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111ma83f]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus, pharmacotherapy, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to include drug classes demonstrated to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes. Initiate ACEis or ARBs as first-line therapy for HTN in patients with diabetes and coronary artery disease.

### Clinical benefits of treating patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with iGlarLixi: a patient-level simulation study [^117WA3av]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes is a lifelong chronic condition that is imposing a significant burden on patients and healthcare systems and affects more than 536 million people worldwide, a number which is expected to grow to 642 million by 2030. As per the 2022 National Diabetes Statistics Report, about 37.3 million people in the United States (US) have diabetes, accounting for $379 billion in health care costs, with the largest share (73%) attributable to direct medical treatment. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) accounts for more than 95% of all diabetes cases. Among adults ≥ 65 years in the US, about 29.2% have the disease and 48.8% are believed to live with prediabetes.

Historically, metformin was prescribed as the first-line therapy for T2DM due to its high efficacy, low cost, weight neutrality, and few adverse events; however, evidence points to the need for treatment intensification for patients with T2DM who fail to achieve their optimal glycemic targets. The 2023 standards of care in diabetes (SOC) guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommend treatments like sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2) and/or glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) or gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP)/GLP-1RA, based on existing comorbidities and other patient-centered treatment factors, as the first line of therapy. The ADA now also recommends GLP-1 RA or GIP/GLP-1RA as the first injectable for patients not meeting A1C targets and the addition of basal insulin as a free or a fixed-ratio combination for those unable to achieve A1C goals with GIP/GLP-1 RA.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114cmqKp]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 1, more specifically with respect to management of hypertension (pharmacotherapy), ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to include drug classes demonstrated to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes.

### Clinical approach to the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy [^114vuxM6]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Painful neuropathy is a common and often progressive complication of diabetes. Patients frequently report symptoms of tingling, burning, lancinating pain, hyperesthesia and allodynia. The natural history of the disease may vary from intermittent mild symptoms to severe chronic daily pain; the latter is often associated with diminished quality of life. There are a variety of pharmaceutical agents from different medicinal categories available for the symptomatic treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy, however selecting an agent is often challenging given the breadth of choices and lack of consistent guidelines. As a result, many patients remain untreated or undertreated. This article presents a practical clinical approach to the treatment of pain in diabetic neuropathy. Recommendations for first, second and third line medications are based on specific evidence for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy as well as safety, tolerability, drug interactions and cost. Additional topics of discussion include breakthrough pain, opioid use and topical therapies. This review does not comprehensively discuss all possible treatments for painful neuropathy, but provides a systematic approach designed to guide clinicians in tailoring therapies to the individual patient.

### Use of new diabetes medicines… [^1122m9GD]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What did this study examine. In 2022, the ADA and EASD jointly released new medication recommendations for adults with type 2 diabetes. They recommended newer types of diabetes medications as first-line treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes who also have:

- A heart disease called atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
- Heart failure.
- Kidney disease.
- High risk for ASCVD. This study examined how many US adults with type 2 diabetes would meet the recommended criteria to use these medications. Terms to know Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, or GLP-1s, are a type of medicine for people with diabetes. They lower blood sugar levels, can help with weight loss, and protect the heart and kidneys. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, or SGLT-2s are a type of medicine for people with diabetes. Similar to GLP-1s, they lower blood sugar levels, can help with weight loss, and protect the heart and kidneys.

Because GLP-1s and SGLT-2s work in different ways, they can be taken together. Study results CDC researchers studied 1, 330 nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes between 2017 and 2020. Researchers estimate that with new ADA and EASD guidelines, 82% of US adults with type 2 diabetes may be eligible to take a GLP-1, or SGLT-2, or both. They also estimate that almost all Medicare beneficiaries with type 2 diabetes may be eligible to take these medicines. Very few US adults were taking GLP-1s or SGLT-2s during the study timeframe. This is because they were not yet approved for first-line treatment. Only 9% were already taking either a GLP-1 or an SGLT-2 medication. What's important about this study. This study showed that over 8 in 10 US adults with type 2 diabetes are eligible for new, effective diabetes medicines. These medicines are not just beneficial for blood sugar management.

They also help reduce risk for diabetes complications by protecting the heart and kidneys, and help people lose weight if needed.

### Pharmacological management of type 2 diabetes: the potential of incretin-based therapies [^113ypLwG]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Management guidelines recommend metformin as the first-line therapy for most patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled by diet and exercise. Efficacy with metformin therapy is usually of limited duration, which necessitates the early introduction of one or two additional oral agents or the initiation of injections, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists or insulin. Although safe and effective, metformin monotherapy has been associated with gastrointestinal side effects (≈20% of treated patients in randomized studies) and is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency or severe liver disease. Patients treated with a sulphonylurea are at increased risk for hypoglycaemia and moderate weight gain, whereas those receiving a thiazolidinedione are subject to an increased risk of weight gain, oedema, heart failure or fracture. Weight gain and hypoglycaemia are associated with insulin use. Thus, there is an unmet need for a safe and efficacious add-on agent after initial-therapy failure. Evidence suggests that incretin-based agents, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, can successfully achieve glycaemic targets and potentially provide cardiovascular and β-cell-function benefits. This review will examine current approaches for treating type 2 diabetes and discuss the place of incretin therapies, mainly GLP-1 agonists, in the type 2 diabetes treatment spectrum.

### Is time ready for combination therapy at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes? [^112VoQt7]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Emerging evidence is showing a range of beneficial effects for GLP-1 receptor agonists and especially SGLT-2 inhibitors on the cardio-renal axis in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Preliminary findings suggest that: 1- such benefit extends also to patients with T2D without pre-existing CVD; and 2- background therapies do not modify the effect of these drugs. Given these considerations, some authors advanced the hypothesis that these novel agents might undermine the first-line position of metformin in the treatment algorithm of T2D. Here, we briefly discuss some pros and cons of such scenario, proposing a "starting" combination therapy with metformin plus one novel agent with trial-proven benefit as the best option to make use of the available knowledge and minimize the risk of complications in patients with newly diagnosed T2D.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^115Qc2DG]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The consensus algorithm for the medical management of type 2 diabetes was published in August 2006 with the expectation that it would be updated, based on the availability of new interventions and new evidence to establish their clinical role. The authors continue to endorse the principles used to develop the algorithm and its major features. We are sensitive to the risks of changing the algorithm cavalierly or too frequently, without compelling new information. An update to the consensus algorithm published in January 2008 specifically addressed safety issues surrounding the thiazolidinediones. In this revision, we focus on the new classes of medications that now have more clinical data and experience.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^111gjVNW]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Algorithm

The algorithm (Fig. 2) takes into account the characteristics of the individual interventions, their synergies, and expense. The goal is to achieve and maintain A1C levels of < 7% and to change interventions at as rapid a pace as titration of medications allows when target glycemic goals are not being achieved. Mounting evidence suggests that aggressive lowering of glycemia, especially with insulin therapy, in newly diagnosed diabetes can result in sustained remissions, i.e. normoglycemia without need for glucose-lowering medications. Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease, and patients should be informed that they are likely to require the addition of glucose-lowering medications over time.

The amylin agonists, α-glucosidase inhibitors, glinides, and DPP-4 inhibitors are not included in the two tiers of preferred agents in this algorithm, owing to their lower or equivalent overall glucose-lowering effectiveness compared with the first- and second-tier agents and/or to their limited clinical data or relative expense (Table 1). However, they may be appropriate choices in selected patients.

### Medication-induced weight gain and advanced therapies for the child with overweight and obesity: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement 2022 [^117RYbcS]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Obesity pharmacotherapy risk management — understanding which medications have the greatest risk of weight gain, using lower risk medications as first-line options, and monitoring closely for weight gain when higher risk medications are required should be considered standard of care. This requires patient-specific shared-decision making and ongoing care, and patients with obesity should be screened for obesity-related co-occurring diseases; when possible, treatment should be initiated, noting that many AOMs can reduce obesity and resolve many of these complications such as type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Contemporary trends in the utilization of second-line pharmacological therapies for type 2 diabetes in the United States and the United Kingdom [^116ppYS8]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

To examine trends of second-line glucose-lowering therapies among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) initiating first-line metformin in the United States and the United Kingdom, overall and by subgroups of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and calendar time.

Methods

Using the US Optum Clinformatics and the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, we identified adults with T2D who initiated first-line metformin or sulphonylurea monotherapy, separately, from 2013 to 2019. Within both cohorts, we identified patterns of second-line medications through June 2021. We stratified patterns by CVD and calendar time to investigate the impact of rapidly evolving treatment guidelines.

Results

We identified 148511 and 169316 patients initiating treatment with metformin monotherapy in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively. Throughout the study period, sulphonylureas and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors were the most frequently initiated second-line medications in the United States (43.4% and 18.2%, respectively) and the United Kingdom (42.5% and 35.8%, respectively). After 2018, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists were more commonly used as second-line agents in the United States and the United Kingdom, although these agents were not preferentially prescribed among patients with CVD. Initiation of first-line sulphonylureas was much less common, and most sulphonylurea initiators had metformin added as the second-line agent.

Conclusions

This international cohort study shows that sulphonylureas remain the most common second-line medications prescribed following metformin in both the United States and the United Kingdom. Despite recommendations, the use of newer glucose-lowering therapies with cardiovascular benefits remains low.

### Care of diabetes and the sacrifice of evidence-based medicine and health equity [^1136q7r2]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes published a 2022 consensus report recommending changes in diabetes care. This Perspective raises three concerns: with how the report summarizes evidence, how it frames the social determinants of health (SDOH), and with its transnational composition and conflicts of interest. The Perspective analyzes three new clinical recommendations that change the role of metformin from first-line therapy to a first-line option, for the inclusion of weight management as a co-primary treatment goal with glycemic control for patients without cardiac or renal complications, and for addition of the SDOH as a universal component of diabetes care together with lifestyle changes and self-management support. The Perspective considers how the poor evidence assessments of the recommendations and the imprecise framing of the SDOH introduce bias. The composition of the panel's membership poorly represents and accounts for the challenges faced by vulnerable US communities or safety net providers. The report is placed in a historical context for diabetes of organized medicine's failures to overcome prejudices and promote health equity. The Perspective concludes that the report perpetuates a pattern of prejudice within organized medicine at the expense of scientific precision and health equity.

### Patterns of medication initiation in newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus: quality and cost implications [^116xdUn2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Currently, 25 million Americans are known to have diabetes, with an additional 7 million cases believed to be undiagnosed. It is estimated that direct and indirect costs of diabetes top $200 billion. Due to the significant health and financial burdens associated with diabetes, it is imperative that this disease be treated quickly and aggressively. In 2009, the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes developed a consensus statement regarding the treatment of type 2 diabetes, citing lifestyle modification and metformin as the preferred first line therapies. In this study, the authors looked at prescription claims data for adults who were newly initiated on oral hypoglycemic monotherapy between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2008, to determine if initiation patterns changed over time, to evaluate how well the treatment guidelines were being followed, and to assess the economic consequences of prescribing patterns by drug class for both patients and insurers. The results showed that over the course of the study period the proportion of patients initially treated with metformin increased, whereas those receiving sulfonylureas as first-line therapy decreased. Thiazolidinediones experienced the greatest decrease, falling from 20% to 8%, while prescriptions for dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors increase from 0–7%. Over a 6-month period, patients taking metformin or sulfonylureas paid approximately $38 to $40 in co-pays while insurance paid about $77. Patients taking other agents paid approximately $130 in co-pays and insurance paid over $500. The authors concluded that based its cost and safety profile, metformin should be the first line drug therapy for patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.

### Diabetes: the place of new therapies [^115NTre9]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Changes in prescribing practice

It was the publication of the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) that propelled the use of metformin as the main first-line agent for treating diabetes in 1998. Since then many national and international guidelines have promoted the use of metformin as the first-line agent to treat type 2 diabetes. – However what should be the second line has been a matter of conjecture and debate for some time. Given that sulfonylureas have become so cheap their use as second-line agents has been very common until the appearance of the agents that were launched in the 21st century. However, with the suggestions that their use is associated with an increase in severe hypoglycaemia and cardiovascular mortality their use has been in decline. – The most recent data are now suggesting that in the UK the DPP-4 inhibitors have now overtaken the use of sulfonylureas as second-line agents, with the most common third-line agents now being SGLT-2 inhibitors. The use of thiazolidinones was rising between 2000 and 2006, but then declined sharply after the publication of data suggesting that at least one of these agents, rosiglitazone, was associated with an increase in cardiovascular mortality. –

The result of these newer agents being much more commonly prescribed, is an associated increase in cost, such that on average in the UK it costs £100 per patient with type 2 diabetes per year to treat them with glucose-lowering drugs.

In 2015, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes and the American Diabetes Association updated their recommendations for the management of type 2 diabetes. After the use of metformin as the first-line agent, they suggest that any of the other treatment classes, including basal insulin, could be second line, and then any combination of the remaining classes could be third or fourth line, although they recommended injectable therapy as the ideal fourth line in addition to the preceding agent.

Whilst there are increasing numbers of head to head studies looking at the new agents with older agents, there are still no clear data to suggest which agent should be used as second or third line in preference to any other. This has led to a huge variety in prescribing practice, and therefore spending. In those geographical areas which continue to use metformin and sulfonylureas as the preferred agents, prescribing is associated with the lowest cost, whilst those areas that use some of the newer agents are increasing in cost, with a range of between £60 and £200 per person per year in the UK.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^115Kx4cT]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to initial therapy, general principles, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider prescribing lower-cost medications for glycemic management (metformin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and human insulin) in adult patients with diabetes and cost-related barriers within the context of their risks for hypoglycemia, weight gain, cardiovascular and kidney events, and other adverse effects.

### First-line pharmacotherapy for incident type 2 diabetes: prescription patterns, adherence and associated costs [^115HWADC]. Diabetic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

To use real-world prescription data from Alberta, Canada to: (a) describe the prescribing patterns for initial pharmacotherapy for those with newly diagnosed uncomplicated type 2 diabetes; (b) describe medication-taking behaviours (adherence and persistence) in the first year after initiating pharmacotherapy; and (c) explore healthcare system costs associated with prescribing patterns.

Methods

We employed a retrospective cohort design using linked administrative datasets from 2012 to 2017 to define a cohort of those with uncomplicated incident diabetes. We summarized the initial prescription patterns, adherence and costs (healthcare and pharmaceutical) over the first year after initiation of pharmacotherapy. Using multivariable regression, we determined the association of these outcomes with various sociodemographic characteristics.

Results

The majority of individuals for whom metformin was indicated as first-line therapy received a prescription for metformin monotherapy (89%). Older individuals, those with higher baseline A1C and those with no comorbidities, were most likely to be started on non-metformin agents. Adherence with the initially prescribed regimen was suboptimal overall, with nearly half (48%) being non-adherent over the first year. One-third of those who started metformin discontinued it in the first 3 months. Those started on non-metformin agents had roughly twice the healthcare costs, and five to seven times higher medication costs, compared to those started on metformin, in the first year after starting therapy.

Conclusions

With the addition of new classes of medications, healthcare providers who look after those with type 2 diabetes have more pharmaceutical options than ever. Most individuals continue to be prescribed metformin monotherapy. However, adherence is suboptimal, and drops off considerably within the first 3 months.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^116dUpym]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

American Association of Clinical Endocrinology 2023 type 2 diabetes — cardiovascular risk therapy selection states that GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) lower major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in meta-analysis (hazard ratio [HR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80–0.93, P < .001), while sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) reduce hospitalization for heart failure (HF) and cardiovascular death, including a 32% reduction in HF hospitalization (HR 0.68 [95% CI 0.61–0.76]) and a 15% reduction in CV death (HR 0.85 [95% CI 0.78–0.93]) versus placebo. For persons with T2D and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or at high risk, a GLP-1 RA with cardiovascular benefit should be initiated as first-line therapy independent of A1C goal or other antihyperglycemic treatments, and as an alternative clinicians may recommend an SGLT2i with proven cardiovascular benefit to reduce MACE or CV death in persons with T2D and established ASCVD. SGLT2is should be recommended in persons with T2D and HF regardless of A1C goal or other antihyperglycemic treatments, and they have been shown to improve HF-related symptoms irrespective of left ventricular ejection fraction and background therapies. High-risk trial features included "albuminuria or proteinuria, HTN and LV hypertrophy, LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction, and/or ABI < 0.9". DPP-4 inhibitors show neutrality for MACE, but saxagliptin increased HF hospitalizations and caution is advised with alogliptin in New York Heart Association Class III or IV CHF. Thiazolidinediones can worsen fluid retention and should not be used in symptomatic HF, and initiation of pioglitazone is contraindicated in New York Heart Association Class III or Class IV CHF.

### What next after metformin in type 2 diabetes? Selecting the right drug for the right patient [^112sWpxw]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Meta-analyses comparing the effectiveness of the different drug classes have demonstrated similar clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c for all classes of second-line drugs when they are added to metformin as dual therapy, but with differences in weight gain and risk of hypoglycaemia. However, the real-world effectiveness of these drugs in routine clinical practice is less well understood. The purpose of this study was to explore the real-world efficacy profiles of OHAs following metformin monotherapy in terms of glycaemic control as a function of baseline phenotypic characteristics. By using data collected from routine primary care practice, the study will generate valuable evidence that is currently lacking to inform clinical decision making on the management of people with T2DM who have failed metformin monotherapy. A better understanding of patient profiles and treatment practices may lead to improved disease management through better targeting of second-line regimens according to demographic and clinical characteristics to achieve optimal clinical outcomes.

### The current drug treatment landscape for diabetes and perspectives for the future [^116a3mCH]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

The escalating global epidemic of type 2 diabetes mellitus has focused attention on the devastating consequences of protracted hyperglycemia. Early and effective intervention to control blood glucose is a fundamental principle of treatment guidelines, requiring assiduous use of current therapies. However, many patients do not achieve or maintain glycemic targets, emphasizing the need for further therapies. This narrative review assesses the available medicinal options to address hyperglycemia and the opportunities to develop novel agents.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^113jySzk]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Process

The guidelines and algorithm that follow are derived from two sources. One source is the clinical trials that address the effectiveness and safety of the different modalities of therapy. Here, the writing group reviewed a wide variety of studies related to the use of drugs as monotherapy or in combination to lower glycemia. Unfortunately, the paucity of high-quality evidence in the form of well-controlled clinical trials that directly compare different diabetes treatment regimens remains a major impediment to recommending one class of drugs, or a particular combination of therapies, over another.

The second source of material that informed our recommendations was clinical judgement, that is, our collective knowledge and clinical experience, which takes into account benefits, risks, and costs in the treatment of diabetes. As in all clinical decision making, an evidence-based review of the literature must also be supplemented by value judgements, where the benefits of treatment are weighed against risks and costs in a subjective fashion. While we realize that others may have different judgements, we believe that the recommendations made in this new iteration of our treatment algorithm will guide therapy and result in improved glycemic control and health status over time.

### Prescribing paradigm shift? Applying the 2019 European Society of Cardiology-led guidelines on diabetes, prediabetes, and cardiovascular disease to assess eligibility for sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists as first-line monotherapy (or add-on to metformin monotherapy) in type 2 diabetes in scotland [^112D9wDL]. Diabetes Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

In 2019, the European Society of Cardiology led and released new guidelines for diabetes cardiovascular risk management, reflecting recent evidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) reduction with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) and some glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in type 2 diabetes (T2D). A key recommendation is that all those with T2D who are (antihyperglycemic) drug naïve or on metformin monotherapy should be CVD risk stratified and an SGLT-2i or a GLP-1RA initiated in all those at high or very high risk, irrespective of glycated hemoglobin. We assessed the impact of these guidelines in Scotland were they introduced as is.

Research Design and Methods

Using a nationwide diabetes register in Scotland, we did a cross-sectional analysis, using variables in our register for risk stratification at 1 January 2019. We were conservative in our definitions, assuming the absence of a risk factor where data were not available. The risk classifications were applied to people who were drug naïve or on metformin monotherapy and the anticipated prescribing change calculated.

Results

Of the 265,774 people with T2D in Scotland, 53,194 (20.0% of those with T2D) were drug naïve, and 56,906 (21.4%) were on metformin monotherapy. Of these, 74.5% and 72.4%, respectively, were estimated as at least high risk given the guideline risk definitions.

Conclusions

Thus, 80,830 (30.4%) of all those with T2D (n = 265,774) would start one of these drug classes according to table 7 and figure 3 of the guideline. The sizeable impact on drug budgets, enhanced clinical monitoring, and the trade-off with reduced CVD-related health care costs will need careful consideration.

### First-line renin-angiotensin system inhibitors vs. other first-line antihypertensive drug classes in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^111X6rU3]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

First-line renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors are recommended for diabetic patients because of their potential nephron-protective properties. For hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, little is known about first-line RAS inhibitors vs. other first-line antihypertensive agents in terms of cardiovascular outcomes. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the comparative efficacy of first-line RAS inhibitors vs. other first-line antihypertensive drug classes in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We identified RCTs by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE and EMBASE up to December 15, 2015. Eighteen RCTs involving 18,862 participants were included. First-line RAS inhibitors were not different from first-line diuretics for all the primary outcomes. First-line RAS inhibitors reduced major cardiovascular events (2 RCTs, relative risk [RR] 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66, 0.91) and heart failure (4 RCTs, RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61, 0.83) compared to first-line calcium channel blockers. Compared to β-blockers, RAS inhibitors reduced the risk of all-cause mortality (1 RCT, RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.47, 0.84), major cardiovascular events (1 RCT, RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.62, 0.93) and heart failure (1 RCT, RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.40, 0.92). Our meta-analysis indicates that, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, first-line RAS inhibitors reduced adverse cardiovascular events to the same degree as first-line diuretics but to a greater degree than first-line calcium channel blockers and first-line beta blockers.

### Predicting responsiveness to GLP-1 pathway drugs using real-world data [^112AVvX2]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Over 460 million people worldwide have diabetes. In the United States, 10.5% of the population has diabetes, with about 90–95% of those having T2D. Metformin is the preferred first-line treatment for.

T2D. However, due to the progressive nature of diabetes, a second-line medication is commonly required at some point in the course of the disease to maintain glucose homeostasis. When combined with metformin, on average all non-insulin medications lower hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) by about 0.7–1.0%. However, at the individual level, patients are known to respond differently to different medications. Moreover, many factors contribute to diabetes etiology and responsiveness to medications, including patient characteristics and environmental factors. Unfortunately, there are few widely used biomarkers to aid in predicting individual patient responses. Therefore, it is important to understand real-world patient responses to different combinations of medications to enhance personalized treatment for T2D.

When cost is not an issue, the ADA recommends choosing a second-line medication from one of the following: dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1-RA), or sodium/glucose co-transporter inhibitors (SGLT2i). Among these options, the incretin-based drugs GLP-1-RA and DPP4i (which we will collectively call GLP-1 M) are widely used. From 2013 to 2016, 23% of T2D patients in the US received DPP4i, and 6% of patients received GLP-1-RA. A recent recommendation published by a group of diabetologists suggests that GLP-1-RA are currently under-prescribed, and thus, use of GLP-1 M is likely to continue to increase in the future. GLP-1-RA mimic the actions of GLP-1, binding the GLP-1 receptor on the surface of β cells (and other cell types) and stimulating insulin secretion in the presence of elevated glucose. DPP4i block the activity of the enzyme that normally degrades endogenously produced GLP-1, thus, increasing its half-life in the circulation.

### Impact of regulatory guidance on evaluating cardiovascular risk of new glucose-lowering therapies to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus: lessons learned and future directions [^112SU7fQ]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Responding to concerns about the potential for increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, specifically myocardial infarction, associated with certain glucose-lowering therapies, the US Food and Drug Administration and the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency issued guidance to the pharmaceutical industry in 2008. Glucose-lowering therapies were granted regulatory approval primarily from smaller studies that have demonstrated reductions in glycated hemoglobin concentration. Such studies were overall underpowered and of insufficient duration to show any effect on cardiovascular outcomes. The 2008 guidance aimed to ensure the cardiovascular safety of new glucose-lowering therapies to treat patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This resulted in a plethora of new cardiovascular outcome trials, most designed primarily as placebo-controlled noninferiority trials, but with many also powered for superiority. Several of these outcome trials demonstrated cardiovascular benefits of the newer agents, resulting in the first-ever cardiovascular protection indications for glucose-lowering therapies. Determining whether the guidance continues to have value in its current form is critically important as we move forward after the first decade of implementation. In February 2018, a think tank comprising representatives from academia, industry, and regulatory agencies convened to consider the guidance in light of the findings of the completed cardiovascular outcome trials. The group made several recommendations for future regulatory guidance and for cardiovascular outcome trials of glucose-lowering therapies. These recommendations include requiring only the 1.3 noninferiority margin for regulatory approval, conducting trials for longer durations, considering studying glucose-lowering therapies as first-line management of type 2 diabetes mellitus, considering heart failure or kidney outcomes within the primary outcome, considering head-to-head active comparator trials, increasing the diversity of patients enrolled, evaluating strategies to streamline registries and the study of unselected populations, and identifying ways to improve translation of trial results to general practice.

### Evaluation of guideline recommendations on oral medications for type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review [^116jKxjX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical practice guidelines have an important role in guiding choices among the numerous medications available to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus, but little is known about their quality.

Purpose

To assess whether guidelines on oral medications for type 2 diabetes are consistent with a systematic review of the current evidence and whether the consistency of the guidelines depends on the quality of guideline development.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, CINAHL, and guideline-specific databases were searched between July 2007 and August 2011, after the 2007 publication of a peer-reviewed systematic review on oral diabetes medications.

Study Selection

Two reviewers independently screened citations to identify English-language guidelines on oral medications to treat type 2 diabetes that were applied in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada.

Data Extraction

Reviewers assessed whether the guidelines addressed and agreed with 7 evidence-based conclusions from the 2007 systematic review. Two reviewers independently rated guideline quality by using 2 domains from the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation instrument.

Data Synthesis

Of the 1000 screened citations, 11 guidelines met the inclusion criteria. Seven guidelines agreed with the conclusion that metformin is favored as the first-line agent. Ten guidelines agreed that thiazolidinediones are associated with higher rates of edema and congestive heart failure compared with other oral medications to treat type 2 diabetes. One guideline addressed no evidence-based conclusions, and 5 guidelines agreed with all 7 conclusions. The summary scores of the rigor of development (median, 28.6% [range, 16.7% to 100.0%]) and editorial independence (median, 75.0% [range, 8.3% to 100.0%]) domains varied greatly across guidelines. Guidelines that received higher quality scores contained more recommendations that were consistent with the evidence-based conclusions.

Limitation

Only English-language guidelines targeting users in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada that contained recommendations on oral medications were included.

Conclusion

Not all practice guidelines on oral treatment of type 2 diabetes were consistent with available evidence from a systematic review. Guidelines judged to be of higher quality contained more recommendations consistent with evidence-based conclusions. The quality of guideline development processes varied substantially.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^1177bVo8]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus — treatment algorithm for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: Entry is HbA1c ≥ 6.5% consistent with T2DM. Initial management includes dietary counseling regarding key aspects of a heart-healthy diet (Class I), at least 150 minutes /week of moderate to vigorous physical activity (Class I), aggressive treatment of other CVD risk factors, and consideration of metformin as first-line pharmacologic therapy to improve glycemic control and reduce CVD risk (Class IIa). Reassessment asks whether HbA1c < 7.0% after lifestyle therapies and metformin; if yes, reinforce the importance of diet and physical activity and continue current management. If no, determine whether the patient has other CVD risk factors; if yes, consideration may be given to an SGLT-2 inhibitor or a GLP-1R agonist to improve glycemic control and reduce CVD risk (Class IIb), and if no, further management of diabetes per primary care provider or endocrinology.

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes? [^112j2fzB]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metformin is a biguanide that is used as first-line treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and is effective as monotherapy and in combination with other glucose-lowering medications. It is generally well-tolerated with minimal side effects and is affordable. Although the safety and efficacy of metformin have been well-established, there is discussion regarding whether metformin should remain the first choice for therapy in all patients as other anti-hyperglycemic medications have proven to have additional benefits in certain populations. It is important to understand the risks and benefits of metformin and other anti-hyperglycemic medications before making any change in clinical practice.

### Management of type 2 diabetes: new and future developments in treatment [^111uPph3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

To date, six classes of oral medication have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and several new agents are in the pipeline. In 2009, the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes developed a consensus statement regarding the treatment of type 2 diabetes, citing lifestyle modification and metformin as the preferred first line therapies. In addition to the currently available drugs, several new agents have recently been introduced or are in the development pipeline. Incretin therapies include both glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) inhibitors and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Non-incretin beta cell stimulants still in development include glucokinase activators, G-protein-coupled receptors, and anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant therapies. Additional agents that target glucose synthesis include glucose-6-phosphatase and glycogen phosphorylase. Other new agents target metabolic syndrome, which is often the first clinical condition that presents in patients at risk for type 2 diabetes. Finally, for obese patients who are unable to lose weight through diet and exercise, weight-loss surgery is an option that should be discussed with their physicians.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) algorithm — actions and classes: For HbA1c (hemoglobin A1c) "HbA1c ≥ 6.5% consistent with T2DM", Class I actions include "Dietary counseling regarding key aspects of a heart-healthy diet", "At least 150 minutes/week of moderate to vigorous physical activity", and "Aggressive treatment of other CVD risk factors", while "Consideration of metformin as first-line pharmacologic therapy to improve glycemic control and reduce CVD risk" is Class IIa. If the reassessment question "HbA1c ≥ 7.0% after lifestyle therapies and metformin?" is answered no, proceed to "Reinforce the importance of diet and physical activity and continue current management"; if yes, ask "Does the patient have other CVD risk factors?" and, if yes, pursue "Consideration may be given to an SGLT-2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2) inhibitor or a GLP-1R (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor) agonist to improve glycemic control and reduce CVD risk (Class IIb)", whereas if no, follow "Further management of diabetes per primary care provider or endocrinology".

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes? [^111ZXfet]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Metformin is a biguanide that is used as first-line treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and is effective as monotherapy and in combination with other glucose-lowering medications. It is generally well-tolerated with minimal side effects and is affordable. Although the safety and efficacy of metformin have been well-established, there is discussion regarding whether metformin should continue to be the first choice for therapy as other anti-hyperglycemic medications exhibit additional advantages in certain populations. Despite a long-standing history of metformin use, there are limited cardiovascular outcomes data for metformin. Furthermore, the available studies fail to provide strong evidence due to either small sample size or short duration. Recent data from glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor cardiovascular and renal outcomes trials demonstrated additional protection from diabetes complications for some high-risk patients, which has impacted the guidelines for diabetes management. Post-hoc analyses comparing hazard ratios for participants taking metformin at baseline versus not taking metformin are inconclusive for these two groups. There are no data to suggest that metformin should not be initiated soon after the diagnosis of diabetes. Furthermore, the initiation of newer glycemic-lowering medications with cardiovascular benefits should be considered in high-risk patients regardless of glycemic control or target HbA1c. However, cost remains a major factor in determining appropriate treatment.

### Baseline characteristics of patients with type 2 diabetes initiating second-line treatment in Japan: findings from the J-DISCOVER study [^111TBnQo]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

In this study, the patients were enrolled from hospitals and clinics. According to the Health Care Act in Japan, a "hospital" is defined as "a medical institution with an inpatient facility of 20 beds or more" and "clinics" have no beds or not more than 19 beds. Although endocrine/diabetes specialists can work both in clinics and hospitals in Japan, hospitals are mainly responsible for the treatment of serious diseases and for precise examinations. On the other hand, the clinics focus on treating common diseases, minor injuries, and chronic diseases. Additionally, the physicians included diabetes specialists and general physicians (GPs) without expertise in diabetes. Japan provides universal coverage of insurance and patients can visit any medical institution (hospital or clinic) as they wish. Therefore, patients with diabetes are treated by both specialists and GPs. In general, diabetes specialists see patients who have difficulty in glycemic control or have multiple complications and are referrals from GPs. On the other hand, patients whose conditions are stable are often referred back to GPs.

Statistical Analyses

Demographic variables, patient characteristics, and treatment patterns were summarized using descriptive statistics including numbers, percentages, mean (standard deviation [SD]), and median (interquartile range [IQR]). Univariate and multivariate Firth logistic regression models were used to identify baseline characteristics associated with the choice of a specific second-line treatment. Covariates were age (≥ 65 vs < 65 years), sex, baseline HbA1c (continuous variable, per 1% increment), body mass index (BMI) (< 22 and ≥ 25 vs ≥ 22 to < 25 kg/m²), renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 60 vs ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), history of cardiovascular disease (yes vs no), and first-line antihyperglycemic medication (biguanides, sulfonylureas, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors [α-GIs], thiazolidinediones, glinides, DPP4is, SGLT2is). The odds ratio of first-line antihyperglycemic medication compared with the overall mean was calculated using effect coding, a commonly used method for coding categorical variables in regression models. Cardiovascular disease history was defined as a medical history including myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, coronary intervention, stable angina, unstable angina, heart failure, stroke, transient ischemic attack, carotid artery stenting, carotid endarterectomy, peripheral artery disease, peripheral artery bypass graft, venous thromboembolism, or thrombolytic therapy.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors combination therapy for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a network meta-analysis [^111guQaK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic, complex, and progressive metabolic disease with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Its prevalence among adults in 2021 was 537 million and is predicted to rise to 643 million by 2030. Diabetes was responsible for 6.7 million deaths in 2021. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the most frequent type of diabetes mellitus worldwide and is characterised by insulin resistance in the peripheral tissues and progressive impairment of insulin secretion from the dysfunctional β‐cell of the pancreas.

Lifestyle modifications and diabetes management, education, and support are the foundation for achieving long‐term glycaemic control, minimising the risk of hyper‐ and hypoglycaemia, and delaying, or even preventing, the onset of microvascular and macrovascular diabetes complications. In the absence of contraindications, supportive pharmacotherapy can be started at the time of T2DM diagnosis.

Although metformin remains the first‐line therapy for most individuals, the progressive nature of T2DM commonly requires the use of second‐line therapies, either in combination with metformin or as an alternative, to achieve the targeted glucose levels. The choice of these therapies should be highly individualised and depend on the balance between many person‐centred factors, such as glycaemic control goals and risk of hypoglycaemia, effect on body weight, the patient's comorbidity profile including cardiovascular risk, cost, and individual patient preference.

### Options for combination therapy in type 2 diabetes: comparison of the ADA / EASD position statement and AACE / ACE algorithm [^113paztV]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Treating patients with diabetes is one of the most challenging and important activities a physician (primary care physician or specialist) can undertake. A key to successful therapy for type 2 diabetes is the insight that this condition is progressive and that the need for additional agents over time is normative. The ability to individualize therapy by patient and medication characteristics comes from experience and knowledge of pertinent clinical studies. However, guidelines from expert bodies such as the American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology can help clinicians of all levels of expertise to approach therapy choices more rationally. There is unity across these guidelines about the role and benefits of metformin as first-line pharmacological treatment, probability of good efficacy, low risk of hypoglycemia, modest weight loss, and overall long-term data. Unfortunately, this unity does not extend to recommendations for subsequent pharmacological agents and their use in combination to intensify treatment when insulin is not (yet) appropriate. Across both statements, some drug classes seem more prominent, and looking at their benefit-risk profile, it is clear why this is the case. The most profound recent change in diabetes therapy has been the introduction of incretin therapies. Incretin therapies minimize 2 important adverse effects seen with many other therapies: hypoglycemia and weight gain. These agents have increased the range of options available for early intensification of treatment of type 2 diabetes. In combination with more established therapies, there are more opportunities than ever to accommodate patient preferences while improving glycemic control and harnessing extraglycemic benefits of a second (or third) agent.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists for adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical practice guideline [^112VEpub]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists when added to usual care (lifestyle interventions and/or other diabetes drugs) in adults with type 2 diabetes at different risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes?

Current Practice

Clinical decisions about treatment of type 2 diabetes have been led by glycaemic control for decades. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are traditionally used in people with elevated glucose level after metformin treatment. This has changed through trials demonstrating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) benefits independent of medications' glucose-lowering potential.

Recommendations

The guideline panel issued risk-stratified recommendations concerning the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists in adults with type 2 diabetes• Three or fewer cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation against starting SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists.• More than three cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak against starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD and CKD: Strong recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak recommendation for starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• For those committed to further reducing their risk for CVD and CKD outcomes: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors rather than GLP-1 receptor agonists.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists created these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel applied an individual patient perspective.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (764 randomised trials included 421346 participants) of benefits and harms found that SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists generally reduce overall death, and incidence of myocardial infarctions, and end-stage kidney disease or kidney failure (moderate to high certainty evidence). These medications exert different effects on stroke, hospitalisations for heart failure, and key adverse events in different subgroups. Absolute effects of benefit varied widely based on patients' individual risk (for example, from five fewer deaths in the lowest risk to 48 fewer deaths in the highest risk, for 1000 patients treated over five years). A prognosis review identified 14 eligible risk prediction models, one of which (RECODe) informed most baseline risk estimates in evidence summaries to underpin the risk-stratified recommendations. Concerning patients' values and preferences, the recommendations were supported by evidence from a systematic review of published literature, a patient focus group study, a practical issues summary, and a guideline panel survey.

Understanding The Recommendation

We stratified the recommendations by the levels of risk for CVD and CKD and systematically considered the balance of benefits, harms, other considerations, and practical issues for each risk group. The strong recommendation for SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with CVD and CKD reflects what the panel considered to be a clear benefit. For all other adults with type 2 diabetes, the weak recommendations reflect what the panel considered to be a finer balance between benefits, harms, and burdens of treatment options. Clinicians using the guideline can identify their patient's individual risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes using credible risk calculators such as RECODe. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids may support well informed treatment choices, including shared decision making.

### Narrative review of data supporting alternate first-line therapies over metformin in type 2 diabetes [^1115Xk7B]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Since then, the ADA guideline of 2023 has modified its pharmacological treatment algorithm based on cardiorenal risk reduction in high-risk patients or achievement and maintenance of glycemic and weight management goals. Thus, the first-line therapy option is highly dependent on patient specific factors. The AACE guideline of 2023 has included therapy options of either a GLP-1 RA or pioglitazone for patients who have experienced strokes or transient ischemic attacks, and continues to recommend mono, dual, or triple therapy based on HbA1c laboratory values. The ESC/EASD has not released an updated guideline for the management of pre-diabetes, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

GLP-1 RA offer a wide range of benefits in the management of DMII. Clinical trials have demonstrated their efficacy in improving glycemic control by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppressing glucagon release. Additionally, GLP-1 RA can help patients achieve significant weight loss due to their effects on appetite suppression, delayed gastric emptying, and promoting satiety which can be beneficial for patients with obesity. Other studies have demonstrated that GLP-1 RA have large CV benefits such as reduction in major adverse CV events. GLP-1 RA have proven to be a favorable therapeutic option in the management of DMII.

SGLT-2i are also a valuable therapeutic class for treatment of DMII for similar reasons as GLP-1 RA. These agents improve glycemic control by inhibiting renal glucose reabsorption, resulting in increased urinary glucose excretion. SGLT-2i can provide reductions in body weight and blood pressure, which offer advantages for patients with T2DM with obesity or hypertension. SGLT-2i have shown CV benefits as evidenced by reduced rates of cardiovascular deaths and hospitalizations from heart failure in clinical trials. These agents also exhibit renoprotective effects and have been shown to slow the progression of diabetic kidney disease. The multifaceted benefits of SGLT-2i position them as valuable therapeutic options in the comprehensive management of DMII.

By thoroughly examining supportive literature, this review article aims to assess whether metformin should remain a solitary first-line agent or if clinicians may consider GLP-1 RA and SGLT-2i as first line therapy options without metformin on board.

Objectives

Primary Objectives

The primary objective is to describe the long-term disease management patterns (type and number of medicines prescribed, and other management approaches used) and clinical evolution (clinical course, such as glycemic control, including HbA1c and hypoglycemic frequencies; degree of progression and prognosis of complications; and changes in the quality of life) of patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with a first-line antidiabetic therapy who initiate a second-line antidiabetic treatment (either adding a second therapy to the first therapy or switching the first therapy to a second therapy).

Secondary Objectives

The secondary objectives include describing the overall and medication class-specific treatment response in terms of change from baseline in HbA1c, blood glucose (fasting plasma glucose [FPG], casual plasma glucose [CPG], or postprandial plasma glucose [PPG]), body weight, blood pressure and lipid profile, and the achievement rates of HbA1c and blood glucose target goals. Furthermore, we aim to describe treatment changes, including the proportion of patients who initiate with a second, third, fourth or higher level of antidiabetic medication at each follow-up visit, the proportion that initiate insulin therapy and the dose of insulin, the proportion of patients who switch antidiabetic medication, and the changes in dose for each treatment.

We also aim to describe the diabetes-associated complications in terms of microvascular complications, incidence of chronic nephropathy, dialysis, diabetic retinopathy, retinal photocoagulation, amputation of lower extremity, diabetic foot disease, peripheral nerve disorders, autonomic nervous system disorders, and erectile dysfunction in the whole population and by second-line antidiabetic medication class.

Further secondary objectives include describing the incidence of macrovascular complications (heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke), hypoglycemic events and hyperglycemia hospitalizations in the whole population and by second-line antidiabetic medication class; describing in the whole population and in second-line antidiabetic medication class subgroups the patient-reported quality of life, diet, and level of physical activity; identifying risk factors associated with poorer clinical outcomes during follow-up, such as patient characteristics at baseline (age, gender, duration of diabetes, and presence of comorbidities); and identifying the determinants of treatment choice at baseline.

The American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes convened a panel to update the prior position statements, published in 2012 and 2015, on the management of type 2 diabetes in adults. A systematic evaluation of the literature since 2014 informed new recommendations. These include additional focus on lifestyle management and diabetes self-management education and support. For those with obesity, efforts targeting weight loss, including lifestyle, medication, and surgical interventions, are recommended. With regards to medication management, for patients with clinical cardiovascular disease, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with proven cardiovascular benefit is recommended. For patients with chronic kidney disease or clinical heart failure and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven benefit is recommended. GLP-1 receptor agonists are generally recommended as the first injectable medication.

Introduction

The annual prevalence of type 2 diabetes remains high, impacting an estimated 11.3% of the US population and 9.3% of people worldwide. Current clinical treatment guidelines recommend targeting glycated hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) less than 7% for most adults (to convert to proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01), although there is heterogeneity across recommendations, ranging between 6.5% and 8%, depending on the target population and risk of various microvascular and macrovascular complications. Moderate glycemic control, defined by HbA 1c within 7% to 8%, has been shown to improve macrovascular and microvascular outcomes in individuals with diabetes. Metformin is a preferred glucose-lowering drug and is often recommended at treatment initiation for patients with diabetes due to its tolerability, efficacy, and low cost. However, intensification of treatment with an additional agent is often needed to maintain glycemic levels in the recommended range. Indeed, an estimated one-third of the US population with HbA 1c greater than 7% is prescribed an additional drug to maintain glycemic control. However, the choice of such an add-on treatment is ambiguous, owing to the lack of direct comparisons of currently available agents. Additionally, evidence emerging from the characterization of clinical data suggests that the actual choices clinicians make in adding another agent onto metformin is highly variable across health systems, both in the US and worldwide. Therefore, to help inform clinical decision-making, it is imperative to fill this knowledge gap by comparing the effectiveness and safety of agents added on to metformin in a head-to-head fashion. However, such rigorous comparison across multiple therapeutic options is simply not feasible in the context of classical randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for myriad reasons, including but not limited to cost, time, patient follow-ups, and the combinatorial nature of diabetes treatment options.

Research design and methods

Study design and exposures of interest

Using administrative databases including more than 53 million health plan enrollees, we applied a multiple case-comparison study design to evaluate correlates of a first fill for one of six second-line T2D medication classes received by patients who previously were prescribed metformin alone. The six diabetes drug classes compared were dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) receptor agonists, long-acting or intermediate-acting insulin given as a basal (rather than mealtime) injection (INS/B), sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, sulfonylurea or meglitinides (SFU), and thiazolidinediones (TZD). An overview of these medications is displayed in table 1. Because this research used coded, non-identifiable data, the Northwestern University Institutional Review Board judged that this work was not classifiable as human subjects research.

Trade-offs among existing diabetes drug treatment alternatives

Study population

The study included health plan enrollees nationally who were ≥ 18 years of age and had diabetes treated with metformin alone before recording a first fill for a second-line diabetes medication. Individuals who met the following three criteria were considered to have T2D: (1) ≥ 1 pharmacy claim for one of the six diabetes medication classes of interest (we refer to the first dispensing date as the 'index date'); (2) ≥ 1 inpatient or outpatient medical claim with a diabetes diagnosis code occurring on or before the index date; and (3) ≥ 1 pharmacy claim for metformin in the 180 days before the index date. We excluded patients who did not also have evidence of metformin pharmacy claims in the 180 days after the index date. In addition, we excluded patients with a fill for any other T2D medication before the index date. Finally, we excluded patients with evidence of a pregnancy or a condition or treatment that might cause secondary diabetes, including hemochromatosis, acromegaly, cystic fibrosis, or more than 21 days of an oral corticosteroid medication within 180 days of the index date. Details regarding the definitions for these criteria are available in the online supplementary appendix.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^115NtE51]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes dyslipidemia — statins are first-line and intensity is matched to ASCVD risk with monitoring. Unless contraindicated, a statin should be used as the first-line therapy for dyslipidemia in persons with T2D. High-risk patients (T2D with < 10% 10-year risk) should be started on moderate-intensity statin therapy, which results in an LDL-C reduction in the range of 30% to 40%. For persons at very high risk (10%–20% 10-year risk) and extreme risk (> 20% 10-year risk), high-intensity statin therapy, which lowers LDL-C by > 50% to 60%, should be started regardless of baseline LDL-C level. Lipids should initially be monitored at 6- to 12-week intervals and then at less frequent intervals (eg, 6 months) once at goal.

### Antihyperglycemic medications: a claims-based estimate of first-line therapy use prior to initialization of second-line medications [^111M7Sjy]. Diabetes Care (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The American Diabetes Association recommends metformin as first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes. However, nonadherence to antihyperglycemic medication is common, and a clinician could confuse nonadherence with pharmacologic failure, potentially leading to premature prescribing of second-line therapies. We measured metformin use prior to second-line therapy initialization.

Research Design and Methods

This retrospective cross-sectional study used unidentifiable member claims data from individuals covered from 2010 to 2015 by Aetna, a U.S. health benefits company. Beneficiaries with two physician claims or one hospitalization with a type 2 diabetes diagnosis were included. Recommended use of metformin was measured by the proportion of days covered over 60 days. Through sensitivity analysis, we varied estimates of the percentage of beneficiaries who used low-cost generic prescription medication programs.

Results

A total of 52,544 individuals with type 2 diabetes were eligible. Of 22,956 patients given second-line treatment, only 1,875 (8.2%) had evidence of recommended use of metformin in the prior 60 days, and 6,441 (28.0%) had no prior claims evidence of having taken metformin. At the top range of sensitivity, only 49.5% patients could have had recommended use. Patients were more likely to be given an additional second-line antihyperglycemic medication or insulin if they were given their initial second-line medication without evidence of recommended use of metformin (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Despite published guidelines, second-line therapy often is initiated without evidence of recommended use of first-line therapy. Apparent treatment failures, which may in fact be attributable to nonadherence to guidelines, are common. Point-of-care and population-level processes are needed to monitor and improve guideline adherence.

### Stem cell-derived pancreatic beta cells: a step closer to functional diabetes treatment? [^115pu1xM]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Diabetes has remained a disease of public health importance, affecting over 800 million individuals globally, with its prevalence rising exponentially in low-middle-income countries. It affects almost all the systems in the body, resulting in microvascular complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy, and macrovascular complications such as cardiovascular complications and peripheral arterial disease, which results in lower limb ulceration and amputation. Data from 2021 revealed that almost 2 million deaths were directly a result of diabetes, with kidney diseases related to diabetes causing more than 500,000 extra deaths. Additionally, 11% of cardiovascular deaths were reported to be due to hyperglycemia. There are several classifications of diabetes mellitus, but the two major ones are type 1 and type 2. Type 1 DM occurs due to autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells, which results in deficient insulin production. It is also treated with daily insulin administration. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is more prevalent and often remains undiagnosed for long periods due to its asymptomatic progression. It occurs due to the combination of defects in insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells and insulin resistance.

While classic symptoms like polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia and weight loss are observed in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), many type 2 diabetics may remain asymptomatic. Management of Type 2 DM includes lifestyle modifications such as diet, exercise, and medications.

DM medications could be insulin, oral medications, or other injected medications. Insulin replacement therapy is used to treat type 1 DM, in which the pancreas does not secrete insulin. Insulin can also be used to manage type 2 DM when blood glucose levels cannot be controlled by diet, weight loss, and oral medications. Oral hypoglycemic agents are used to treat type 2 DM in addition to lifestyle modifications. These oral hypoglycemic agents are divided into various classes, which include sulphonylureas, biguanides, DPP-4 inhibitors, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, meglitinide analogues, thiazolidinediones, and SGLT-2 inhibitors. Metformin, a biguanide which enhances insulin sensitivity, is used as the first-line drug. Other classes can be used as second-line or third-line drugs. Despite the availability of these drugs that significantly improve the quality of life for type 2 DM patients, treatment limitations persist. Over time, as the disease progresses, these medications offer little to no help.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^113i4TjW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

Objectives

To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2016, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) up to February 2016. We searched in clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs in Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line antihypertensive drug with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events or serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias and entered the data. Primary outcomes were mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to drug-related adverse effects, reaching blood pressure control (as defined in each trial) and blood pressure change from baseline. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. We summarized data on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

We found three studies in which a subgroup of participants met our inclusion criteria. None of the studies focused solely on people initiating antihypertensive treatment so we asked investigators for data for this subgroup (monotherapy: 335 participants; combination therapy: 233 participants). They included outpatients, and mostly European and white people. Two trials included only people with type 2 diabetes, whereas the other trial excluded people treated with diabetes, hypocholesterolaemia or cardiovascular drugs. The follow-up was 12 months in two trials and 36 months in one trial. Certainty of evidence was very low due to the serious imprecision, and for using a subgroup not defined in advance. Confidence intervals were extremely wide for all important outcomes and included both appreciable harm and benefit.

Authors' Conclusions

The numbers of included participants and, hence the number of events, were too small to draw any conclusion about the relative efficacy of monotherapy versus combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension. There is a need for large clinical trials that address the question and report clinically relevant endpoints.

### Should metformin still be the first-line of treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus? A comprehensive review and suggested algorithm [^116K8PvA]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

For more than a century, the high occurrences of coronary and peripheral artery diseases in diabetes mellitus patients has been well recognised; despite that, the ability to improve CV event rates by optimizing glycaemic control has remained elusive. Nevertheless, the last decade has seen several cardiovascular outcome clinical trials (CVOTs) of many antihyperglycemic agents that reported promising results for cardiovascular and renal outcomes. This leads to a hot debate on the ideal drug choice for first-line treatment in T2DM. The purpose of this paper is to review the evidence supporting the use of metformin, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and incretin-based therapies for the management of individuals with T2DM and, discuss the rationale for selection.

ACC/AHA 2019 — Adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) primary prevention recommendations state that for all adults with T2DM, a tailored nutrition plan focusing on a heart-healthy dietary pattern is recommended to improve glycemic control, achieve weight loss if needed, and improve other ASCVD risk factors. Adults with T2DM should perform at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity to improve glycemic control, achieve weight loss if needed, and improve other ASCVD risk factors. For adults with T2DM, it is reasonable to initiate metformin as first-line therapy along with lifestyle therapies at the time of diagnosis to improve glycemic control and reduce ASCVD risk. For adults with T2DM and additional ASCVD risk factors who require glucose-lowering therapy despite initial lifestyle modifications and metformin, it may be reasonable to initiate a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist to improve glycemic control and reduce CVD risk.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity — antihyperglycemic therapy and related agents include that in patients with T2DM who are overweight or obese, we suggest the use of antidiabetic medications that have additional actions to promote weight loss such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs or sodium-glucose–linked transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors in addition to metformin; we recommend weight-losing and weight-neutral medications as first- and second-line agents and clinicians should discuss weight effects and consider weight-neutral or weight-losing antihyperglycemic medications; in obese patients with T2DM requiring insulin therapy, we suggest adding at least one of metformin, pramlintide, or GLP-1 agonists to mitigate insulin-associated weight gain, the first-line insulin for this type of patient should be basal insulin and this is preferable to insulin alone or insulin with sulfonylurea with a preferential trial of basal insulin prior to premixed or combination insulin; and for hypertension in obese patients with T2DM, we recommend ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and calcium channel blockers rather than β-adrenergic blockers as first-line therapy.

### Choosing first-line therapy for management of type 2 diabetes… [^114Y8W6L]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Which controls type 2 diabetes best at five years: rosiglitazone, metformin, or glyburide. Mark: For the estimated 20 million Americans with type 2 diabetes, this is a very important question. This article is an excellent demonstration of why reading just the abstract could lead you to the wrong conclusion. What does this article say. Mark: This study randomized 4, 360 patients to monotherapy with rosiglitazone, metformin, or glyburide. The end point was fasting blood glucose over 180 mg per dL. The authors concluded that, at five years, only 15 percent of patients taking rosiglitazone failed mono-therapy versus 21 percent of those taking metformin and 34 percent taking glyburide. Although the abstract trumpets rosiglitazone as "the winner, " this is exactly the wrong conclusion to draw from this study. What should the family physician do.

Mark: I would begin medical therapy with metformin and use sulfonylureas and insulin as second-line treatment options. If you use glitazones, watch for adverse events, including increased fluid retention, CHF, and cardiovascular events. Bob: CHF has been seen with glitazone use in the past. In 2002, the FDA recognized the increased rates of CHF associated with glitazones and required the makers of pioglitazone and Avandia to strengthen the warnings concerning adverse cardiovascular events. Andrea: I agree. Start with metformin. This study should also serve as a warning that abstracts may not reflect the true results of a study, even in journals like the New England Journal of Medicine. You should evaluate the study yourself before you change your clinical practice.

Main Points Glitazones are associated with fluid retention, increased CHF rates, and, possibly, increased rates of cardiovascular events compared with sulfonylureas and metformin. The FDA and the Canadian government have issued warnings about CHF and cardiovascular events with rosiglitazone. Metformin should be the first-line drug for managing type 2 diabetes. Insulin and sulfonylureas should be second line, and glitazones should be reserved for third line.

### New perspectives in management of cardiovascular risk among people with diabetes [^115bxTv3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Following the publication of results from multiple landmark cardiovascular outcome trials of antihyperglycemic medications over the past 8years, there has been a major shift in the focus of care for people with type 2 diabetes, from control of hyperglycemia to managing cardiovascular risk. Multiple international cardiology and diabetes society guidelines and recommendations now endorse sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like protein-1 receptor agonists as first-line therapies to mitigate cardiovascular risk. The most recent publication is the 2023 European Society of Cardiology guideline on the management of cardiovascular disease in those with type 2 diabetes that, for the first time, recommends use of both classes of medications for the mitigation of cardiovascular risk for those with or at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. Here, we review the evidence behind contemporary society guidelines and recommendations for the management of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular risk.

### Advances in diabetes pharmacotherapy: an update for the emergency provider [^1122oJ8H]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetes mellitus is a disease that affects millions of Americans, and its prevalence is only anticipated to increase in coming years. It is estimated that diabetes-related visits account for 1% of all emergency department (ED) encounters. In recent years, there have been several new categories of medications approved for the treatment of diabetes, including new insulins, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, an amylin analogue, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors.

Objective Of The Review

This review presents recently approved agents to treat diabetes, with a focus on basic mechanism, place in therapy, and toxicities the ED provider may encounter.

Discussion

Many of these new therapies have been incorporated as first- and second-line agents for the management of diabetes. Recently approved diabetes medications often have different mechanisms of action and adverse effect and overdose profiles compared to traditional agents, such as sulfonylureas and metformin.

Conclusions

Emergency providers will encounter patients taking these newly approved medications, as well as treat those presenting with adverse effects and overdoses from them. As such, emergency providers must have a basic understanding of these new therapies so that they can optimally care for diabetic patients.

### Narrative review of data supporting alternate first-line therapies over metformin in type 2 diabetes [^113GzDrx]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Meta-analyses regarding metformin's effects on adverse CV outcomes provide conflicting conclusions. Limited availability of long-term evaluations of metformin hinders effective meta-analysis. For example, one recent meta-analysis of the effect of metformin on the incidence of MI included seven trials, with durations ranging from 6 months to 10 years, and with numbers of events ranging from 14 to 423. In 2019, a very large meta-analysis included more than 1 million patients, who participated in 40 randomized or observational evaluations of metformin. Treatment with metformin versus no metformin therapy was associated with reduced risk of CV death (HR 0.81; 0.79–0.84). Moreover, all-cause mortality was reduced in the overall population (HR 0.67; 0.60–0.75) in those with prior MI (HR 0.79; 0.68–0.92) and in those with prior congestive heart failure (HR 0.84; 0.81–0.87). The frequency of CV events was also reduced although no significant effect was observed in the absence of type 2 diabetes.

Overall, the randomized trials that evaluated metformin were small by current trial standards, although the 10-year UKPDS employed a considerably longer follow-up duration than most other studies. The Kaplan–Meier curves for macrovascular outcomes in the metformin and conventional therapy groups did not diverge until about 6 years into the study. Larger studies which were not designed as outcomes trials were of shorter duration and insufficient to show benefit. The ongoing VA-IMPACT outcomes trial in subjects with prediabetes will provide additional clinical data to determine the cardiovascular efficacy of metformin. Results are expected to be reported in mid-2024. However, from approval until recently, metformin has shown at least non-inferiority and many times superiority in glycemic, weight, cardiovascular, and adverse effect outcomes compared to older agents used for diabetes. These studies ultimately led to major guidelines historically recommending metformin as their first line agent.

Benefits of GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i

Research has shown that GLP-1 RA and SGLT-2i in combination with metformin are effective in lowering A1c, reducing cardiovascular events, preventing renal disease progression, and decreasing body weight. Key literature is summarized in Tables 2 and 3 to illustrate the proven benefits of these therapies. It is important to note that all of these studies were done in patients taking metformin at baseline. The benefits of these drug classes were the initial driving factor in joining metformin as a first-line agent for diabetes.

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes? [^1166XBdv]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards of care guidelines

In 2008, the first ADA and European Association of the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus guidelines on management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes stated that metformin, along with lifestyle interventions, should be used as first-line therapy. While the guidelines of pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes in the United States have largely remained the same, recent updates in 2019 and 2020 have added additional components in light of compelling data from cardiovascular and renal outcomes trials. According to the ADA 2020 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, metformin remains the preferred first-line pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes unless contraindicated or not tolerated by the patient. Other glucose-lowering agents may be added to metformin considering patient preferences, hypoglycemic risk, and comorbidities.

While the ADA still recommends metformin as first-line therapy, the updated Standards of Care have become more outcomes-focused rather than solely concentrating on glycemic control. For this reason, in patients with certain comorbidities such as high-risk for or established ASCVD, heart failure or chronic kidney disease, it is recommended to consider GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors independently of baseline HbA1c or individualized HbA1c target. In 2019, the European Society of Cardiology, in collaboration with the EASD, went one step further in altering their treatment guidelines. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs are now recommended as first-line therapy for patients with established ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk in Europe. Metformin should be considered as the first line in patients without CVD and at moderate cardiovascular risk.

### Treatment of diabetes in older adults: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^115v8d8z]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Hypertension management in older adults with diabetes — In patients aged 65 years and older with diabetes and hypertension, we recommend that an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker should be the first-line therapy, and Technical remark: If one class is not tolerated, the other should be substituted. Therefore, ACE inhibitors and ARBs should be the first-line therapy used for the treatment of hypertension in older patients with diabetes and should be included when more than one medication is needed, and these two drug classes should not be used together, especially in patients with CKD, due to increased risks of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury. Two drugs should be started together if the initial BP is ≥ 160/100 mm Hg. Because hypertension involves a volume component in many patients with diabetes, a thiazide diuretic is commonly recommended as the third drug unless the eGFR is ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m², in which case a loop diuretic might be more appropriate. If coronary artery disease is significant, a beta-blocker may be appropriate and can be added as a fourth drug to a prior three-drug regimen; if a beta-blocker is used, carvedilol has been shown to have fewer metabolic effects than metoprolol. Notably, when BP is not controlled with three or more medications, referral to a hypertension specialist is indicated.

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes? [^111zWTnH]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Metformin in the 21st century

By the end of the 20th century, metformin's ability to safely lower glucose levels in patients with diabetes had been well-documented on a global scale. In 2002, metformin became the most commonly prescribed oral anti-hyperglycemic medication. In 2005, the International Diabetes Foundation published guidelines recommending metformin as a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes. Nearly 50 years after the rediscovery of metformin, the World Health Organization added metformin to its list of essential medications in 2011. Numerous clinical trials in the last decade have thoroughly assessed concerns regarding the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis in patients with comorbidities such as renal and hepatic dysfunction or congestive heart failure. Results from such trials continue to support metformin as a safe and effective medication for the vast majority of patients. In fact, the restriction for using metformin in patients with impaired kidney function has recently been relaxed.

### Dulaglutide and insulin: how can the AWARD studies help guide clinical practice? [^116QuVu4]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

The glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) dulaglutide has many characteristics to recommend it both as a second-line agent and as an alternative to or in combination with insulin. This commentary summarises recent updates to diabetes management guidelines regarding the use of GLP-1RAs such as dulaglutide, both as a second-line agent and as a first-line injectable agent in type 2 diabetes (T2D). It also examines how the Assessment of Weekly AdministRation of LY2189265 [dulaglutide] in Diabetes (AWARD) studies with dulaglutide and insulin may help to guide clinical practice for the use of dulaglutide as an alternative to basal insulin or in combination with insulin. Individualising glucose-lowering therapy is important in patients with T2D, especially given patients' heterogeneity in terms of age, lifestyle, disease duration, level of hyperglycaemia and comorbidities. Choice of therapy should be guided by clinical considerations (e.g. high risk or existing cardiovascular [CV] disease, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, risk of hypoglycaemia), side effect profile, contraindications, patient preferences and cost. The recently updated American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (ADA/EASD) guidelines now recommend adding a GLP-1RA with proven CV benefit to metformin in patients with T2D and indicators of high risk or established atherosclerotic CV disease. The AWARD studies demonstrate that dulaglutide provides effective glucose lowering together with sustained weight loss and a low incidence of hypoglycaemia when used as the first injectable option and when used in combination with titrated basal insulin or prandial insulin, providing a valid treatment option across a wide range of patients with T2D, including those with chronic kidney disease.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^112jY9jx]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

Antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy for persons with type 2 diabetes — general principles state that individualized pharmacotherapy for persons with T2D should be prescribed based on evidence for benefit that includes glucose lowering, avoidance of hypoglycemia and weight gain, and reduction of cardio-renal risk; persons with T2D and their health care professionals should use patient-centered shared decision-making to agree on therapy targets and treatments as well as a regimen for glucose monitoring; glycemic targets include A1C, BGM, and, for those using CGM, achievement of CGM targets such as time in range (TIR), percentage in low and very low range, time above range, and glycemic variability, while nonglycemic targets include avoidance of hypoglycemia, control of BP, lipids, other CVD risk factors, and achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight; independent of glycemic control, targets, or treatment, if there is established or high risk for ASCVD, HF, and/or CKD, clinicians should prescribe a GLP-1 RA or an SGLT2i with proven efficacy; DM therapy should be individualized based on level of glycemia and the presence of comorbidities, complications, and access, with metformin often the preferential initial therapy and other agents appropriate as first-line or in addition to metformin to reduce BG and/or address specific comorbidities; clinicians should discuss with persons with T2D the likelihood that most persons with T2D ultimately require a combination of multiple complementary agents to attain and maintain optimal glycemic control, and the DM care team should assess medication adherence and safety and glycemic control in persons with T2D quarterly or more frequently as needed.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^116nzvSq]. Endocrine Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

This consensus statement provides (1) visual guidance in concise graphic algorithms to assist with clinical decision-making of health care professionals in the management of persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve patient care and (2) a summary of details to support the visual guidance found in each algorithm.

Methods

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) selected a task force of medical experts who updated the 2020 AACE Comprehensive Type 2 Diabetes Management Algorithm based on the 2022 AACE Clinical Practice Guideline: Developing a Diabetes Mellitus Comprehensive Care Plan and consensus of task force authors.

Results

This algorithm for management of persons with type 2 diabetes includes 11 distinct sections: (1) Principles for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes; (2) Complications-Centric Model for the Care of Persons with Overweight/Obesity; (3) Prediabetes Algorithm; (4) Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Algorithm: Dyslipidemia; (5) Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Algorithm: Hypertension; (6) Complications-Centric Algorithm for Glycemic Control; (7) Glucose-Centric Algorithm for Glycemic Control; (8) Algorithm for Adding/Intensifying Insulin; (9) Profiles of Antihyperglycemic Medications; (10) Profiles of Weight-Loss Medications (new); and (11) Vaccine Recommendations for Persons with Diabetes Mellitus (new), which summarizes recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Conclusions

Aligning with the 2022 AACE diabetes guideline update, this 2023 diabetes algorithm update emphasizes lifestyle modification and treatment of overweight/obesity as key pillars in the management of prediabetes and diabetes mellitus and highlights the importance of appropriate management of atherosclerotic risk factors of dyslipidemia and hypertension. One notable new theme is an emphasis on a complication-centric approach, beyond glucose levels, to frame decisions regarding first-line pharmacologic choices for the treatment of persons with diabetes. The algorithm also includes access/cost of medications as factors related to health equity to consider in clinical decision-making.

### Trends in first-line glucose-lowering drug use in adults with type 2 diabetes in light of emerging evidence for SGLT-2i and GLP-1RA [^1157nTrw]. Diabetes Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

We evaluated recent use trends and predictors of first-line antidiabetes treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

Using two large U.S. health insurance databases (Clinformatics and Medicare), we identified adult patients with type 2 diabetes who initiated antidiabetes treatment from 2013 through 2019. Quarterly trends in use of first-line antidiabetes treatment were plotted overall and stratified by cardiovascular disease (CVD). Multinomial logistic regressions were fit to estimate predictors of first-line antidiabetes treatment, using metformin, the recommended first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, as the common referent.

Results

Metformin was the most frequently initiated medication, used by 80.6% of Medicare beneficiaries and 83.1% of commercially insured patients. Sulfonylureas were used by 8.7% (Medicare) and 4.7% (commercial). Both populations had low use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i, 0.8% [Medicare] and 1.7% [commercial]) and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1Ra; 1.0% [Medicare] and 3.5% [commercial]), with increasing trends over time (P < 0.01). Initiators of antidiabetes drugs with established cardiovascular benefits (SGLT-2i and GLP-1RA) were more likely to be younger and had prevalent CVD or higher socioeconomic status compared with initiators of metformin.

Conclusions

Among adult patients with type 2 diabetes, metformin was by far the most frequent first-line treatment. While the use of SGLT-2i and GLP-1RA was low from 2013 through 2019, it increased among patients with CVD.

Conclusion

The evidence from this study can potentially be used to support better targeting of second-line T2DM therapy. The choice of which drug to offer after metformin should be based on the individual person's phenotypic characteristics (including gender, age, BMI, eGFR and duration of T2DM), considering their treatment goals, extent of hyperglycaemia, comorbidities and the beneficial and adverse effects of each class of drug to select the right drug for the right patient.

### Therapeutic inertia in type 2 diabetes: prevalence, causes, consequences and methods to overcome inertia [^114mYgY3]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite good-quality evidence, glycaemic control is shown to be inadequate globally. Guidelines suggest an ideal individualized target HbA1c level for most people with T2DM to be < 7% (53 mmol/mol), using metformin as first-line pharmacological treatment at diagnosis along with lifestyle changes. The recommended HbA1c target for people with T2DM without comorbidities is 6.5% (48 mmol/mol), and if levels remain above this value, additional oral antidiabetic (OAD) agents may be added. If, however, after additional medications, the HbA1c levels are still > 7.5% (59 mmol/mol), further advances in therapy are recommended, including insulin. In addition to this, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards of care contain an algorithm of which medications to use as add-on therapy once metformin has been started, along with guidelines advising HbA1c review after 3–6 months post commencement of a new medication. Glycaemic control should then be monitored 3–6 monthly subsequently. Furthermore, the new European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD)–ADA guidelines released in 2018 have shown an overall approach to glucose-lowering medications for patients with type 2 diabetes and the need to reassess treatment regularly to avoid therapeutic inertia.

Despite the evidence and recommendations, the guidelines are not translated into practice. A study showed that a third of patients with T2DM in the UK fail to achieve HbA1c levels ≤ 7.5% (59 mmol/mol). One of the key reasons for this is therapeutic inertia, previously known as clinical inertia, which is the failure to advance or intensify therapy by a healthcare professional. This review explains the prevalence, causes, consequences and methods to overcome therapeutic inertia in T2DM.

### Current therapies for the medical management of diabetes [^1155cKxh]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetes affects a large and diverse number of individuals who share in common its risks for complications but who differ greatly from one another in age, health, and a number of circumstances influential to successful treatment. Because type 2 diabetes comprises the majority of diabetes cases, a number of agents have been developed for its treatment. Their unique properties offer opportunities to overcome some of the treatment limitations of older medicines and enable a more individualized and flexible approach to glucose-lowering. At the same time, new medications are accompanied by greater costs and uncertainties about their long-term benefits or safety, and thus the present state of care for type 2 diabetes places focus on a process of shared decision-making between the clinician and patient as to which treatments can optimize health while minimizing harms.

### Narrative review of data supporting alternate first-line therapies over metformin in type 2 diabetes [^112MWYBw]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

The guidelines for management of DMII have been revised to recommend first line therapy options that can provide improved cardiorenal and weight outcomes compared to previous guidelines that focused more on glycemic control. The ADA 2023 guideline stratified its treatment algorithm to recommend either a GLP-1 RA or SGLT-2i for individuals identified to have high cardiovascular and renal risks. The inclusion criteria used to identify this high-risk group encompasses a large proportion of patients with DMII. This showcases how the ADA guideline may be emphasizing GLP-1 RA and SGLT-2i as treatment options over metformin; however, treatment options are still limited by patient specific factors and the cost of therapy. Compared to SGLT-2i and GLP-1 RA, metformin is more affordable which may impact medication adherence and glycemic outcomes. Further pharmacoeconomic studies may be needed to assess how often GLP-1 RA and SGLT-2i can be used. This, in fact, has caused many insurance companies to introduce step-therapies for newer agents limiting the access to patients not taking metformin. Metformin has also been shown to be safe and tolerable while the long-term side effects of SGT-2i and GLP-1 RA have yet to be fully assessed in the current literature. In summary, although these newer agents are a good option for some patients with cardiovascular and renal disease, practitioners should not completely disregard metformin as a first-line option especially since the comparative cardiovascular outcomes (which are the major highlighted benefit of the medications) are limited and mostly focus on surrogate endpoints.

As newer agents begin having more positive cardiovascular outcome trials, changes in guidelines will follow suit. Similar to metformin no longer being the only first line agent for treatment of DMII, other guidelines such as the cholesterol guidelines may follow as manufacturers of brand name agents push for the support of their medications. Review of the literature indicates that metformin can continue to be considered as first-line therapy for the treatment of DMII. The data demonstrates the efficacy and safety of GLP-1 agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors as monotherapy, which may allow them to be considered as first-line therapies based on patient specific factors such as cardiorenal benefits, weight reduction, and cost of medication.

### Narrative review of data supporting alternate first-line therapies over metformin in type 2 diabetes [^1169MHsR]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Metformin has been the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus as monotherapy or concomitantly with other glucose-lowering therapies due to its efficacy, safety, and affordability. Recent studies on the cardioprotective and renoprotective benefits of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) have influenced guidelines on diabetes management to consider these newer agents as alternative first-line therapies. This paper explores the literature supporting the use of these newer medications alone as a first-line agent in place of metformin.

Methods

A review of citations from the most recent guidelines along with a literature search via PubMed was completed to review (1) what, historically, made metformin first-line (2) if newer agents' benefits remain when used without metformin (3) how newer agents compare against metformin when used without it.

Results

Evaluation of the historical literature was completed to summarize the key findings that support metformin as a first-line therapy agent. Additionally, an assessment of the literature reveals that the benefits of these two newer classes are independent of concomitant metformin therapy. Finally, studies have demonstrated that these newer agents can be either non-inferior or sometimes superior to metformin when used as monotherapy.

Conclusion

GLP-1 RA and SGLT-2i can be considered as first line monotherapies for select patients with high cardiovascular risks, renal disease, or weight loss requirements. However, pharmacoeconomic considerations along with lesser long-term safety outcomes should limit these agents' use in certain patients as the management of diabetes continues to transition towards shared-decision making.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^115Q3UvG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review originally published in 2017. Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

Objectives

To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to April 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 2005), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We used no language restrictions. We also searched clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs on the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency websites, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line antihypertensive drugs with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events, or serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias, and performed data entry. The primary outcomes were mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to drug-related adverse effects, reaching blood pressure control (as defined in each trial), and blood pressure change from baseline. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. We summarised data on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This update included one new study in which a subgroup of participants met our inclusion criteria. As none of the four included studies focused solely on people initiating antihypertensive treatment, we asked investigators for data for this subgroup. One study (PREVER-treatment 2016) used a combination of thiazide-type diuretic/potassium-sparing diuretic; as the former is not indicated in monotherapy, we analysed this study separately. The three original trials in the main comparison (monotherapy: 335 participants; combination therapy: 233 participants) included outpatients, mostly European and white people. Two trials only included people with type 2 diabetes; the remaining trial excluded people treated with diabetes, hypocholesterolaemia, or cardiovascular drugs. The follow-up was 12 months in two trials and 36 months in one trial. It is very uncertain whether combination therapy versus monotherapy reduces total mortality (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.08 to 21.72), cardiovascular mortality (zero events reported), cardiovascular events (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.22 to 4.41), serious adverse events (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.92), or withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.35); all outcomes had 568 participants, and the evidence was rated as of very low certainty due to serious imprecision and for using a subgroup that was not defined in advance. The confidence intervals were extremely wide for all important outcomes and included both appreciable harm and benefit. The PREVER-treatment 2016 trial, which used a combination therapy with potassium-sparing diuretic (monotherapy: 84 participants; combination therapy: 116 participants), included outpatients. This trial was conducted in Brazil and had a follow-up of 18 months. The number of events was very low and confidence intervals very wide, with zero events reported for cardiovascular mortality and withdrawals due to adverse events. It is very uncertain if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy in this trial.

Authors' Conclusions

The numbers of included participants, and hence the number of events, were too small to draw any conclusion about the relative efficacy of monotherapy versus combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension. There is a need for large clinical trials that address the review question and report clinically relevant endpoints.

Type 2 diabetes — antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy principles and initial therapy: The goal of antihyperglycemic treatment is to achieve clinical and laboratory targets with minimal adverse effects and reduce diabetes-related complications, and minimizing the risks of hypoglycemia and weight gain and maximizing cardiovascular and renal benefits should be priorities. As monotherapy, most noninsulin agents reduce A1C by 0.5% to 2.0%. Metformin is often the preferred initial therapy for most persons with new-onset type 2 diabetes and, once initiated, should be continued as long as it is tolerated and not contraindicated; it can be used in combination with virtually all other antihyperglycemic agents, including insulin, when monotherapy does not reach the glycemic target.

### Type 2 diabetes therapies: a STEPS approach [^117SpZm5]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

A concise way to evaluate pharmacotherapy options for type 2 diabetes mellitus is to use the five patient-oriented STEPS criteria: safety, tolerability, efficacy, price, and simplicity. The first-line treatment option, metformin, is safe and fairly well-tolerated, has excellent long-term efficacy for patient-oriented outcomes, is moderately priced, and has a simple dosing regimen. However, most patients with type 2 diabetes require more than one medication. The STEPS approach can help choose subsequent medications if metformin does not provide adequate glycemic control.

Key Points

Question

Can the comparative effectiveness and safety associated with second-line pharmaceutical interventions in type 2 diabetes be assessed using clinical data across a multicenter health care system?

Findings

This cohort study including 31 852 patients with diabetes monitored for 5 years and using clinical data analysis found that treatment with either a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor added to metformin monotherapy was effective compared with a sulfonylurea in maintaining glycemic control, with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist being more effective than dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor. These add-on treatments were associated with fewer diabetes-related cardiovascular and renal complications compared with a sulfonylurea and were safe, avoiding hypoglycemia.

Meaning

These findings suggest that clinical data across a multisite health care system could be used to assess the comparative effectiveness and safety associated with treatments in diabetes and could help guide medical decisions.

### Treatment patterns and associated factors in 14 668 people with type 2 diabetes initiating a second-line therapy: results from the global DISCOVER study programme [^111xSLmQ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Optimal glycaemic control, along with the management of co‐morbidities such as hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, and prevention of long‐term complications, remains the cornerstone of the management of patients with type 2 diabetes. Current clinical guidelines recommend an HbA 1c target of less than 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) for most patients. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 To achieve this target, most guidelines recommend the use of metformin in conjunction with diet and lifestyle modifications as first‐line therapy. When metformin monotherapy fails to control glycaemic levels, a second glucose‐lowering drug should be added to metformin in a timely fashion (within 3‐6 months of an HbA 1c value above target). 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 The Japanese guidelines take a different approach and recommend monotherapy (metformin or other) in conjunction with medical nutrition therapy as first‐line pharmacological treatment; the choice of first‐line glucose‐lowering agent should be tailored to the patient's characteristics and metformin is not recommended over any other agent. 6

Although guidelines suggest using a personalized approach to select second‐line therapy based on patient characteristics (e.g. duration of diabetes, presence of co‐morbidities, age and risk of hypoglycaemia), only the consensus report by the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes provides a clear treatment algorithm based on the presence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease. 5 The wide variety of glucose‐lowering drug classes available as possible second‐line therapies results in difficult treatment decisions for clinicians.

DISCOVER is a 3‐year, global programme of observational research conducted in 38 countries, assessing the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes in routine clinical practice. 7 The primary objective of the study is to describe global disease management patterns and associated clinical outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes initiating a second‐line glucose‐lowering therapy. In many of the included countries, data are currently scarce or non‐existent. Here, we report patterns of treatment changes from first to second line at the start of the study in the overall patient population, and assess factors associated with choice of second‐line therapy in the subset of patients who were prescribed metformin monotherapy as first‐line treatment.

Specific advantages and disadvantages of individual main drug classes

Metformin.

Metformin as first-line therapy is in the general consensus, since its efficacy is similar to other antihyperglycemic drugs — besides insulin. It has a large safety margin and can be used by most patients other than a small number who experience gastrointestinal side effects. It decreases hepatic glucose production, has a mild effect on peripheral resistance, and increases both total and active endogenous glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 in response to food. Metformin might also be cardioprotective, mainly in obese type 2 diabetic patients. Moreover, recently published observational studies, as well as animal and cell-line studies, suggest that this drug might be effective in reducing cancer-related morbidity. Thus, metformin is accepted as first-line therapy by both guidelines and pathophysiologic reasoning.
