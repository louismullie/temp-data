## Question

Things to know about a swan ganz cath

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the Swan-Ganz catheter, specifically seeking a synthesis of its purpose, indications, contraindications, insertion technique, key measurements, complications, alternatives, and current role in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the device and its historical context. Then, I should verify the core indications and where guidelines still recommend use. Next, I will examine contraindications and relative risks. After that, I need to review insertion technique and confirmation of placement. Then, I should detail the hemodynamic parameters and their interpretation. Next, I will quantify complications and their management. I will then compare alternatives and appraise the evidence base. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach to current use and highlight special scenarios where Swan-Ganz remains valuable.

> Let me first confirm the definition and historical context. The Swan-Ganz catheter is a balloon-tipped, flow-directed pulmonary artery catheter introduced in 1970 that enables bedside measurement of right-sided pressures, pulmonary artery pressures, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, cardiac output, and mixed venous oxygen saturation, which historically transformed critical care by allowing invasive hemodynamics at the bedside rather than in the cath lab [^9719784f] [^583b75d2].

> I need to check the core indications where guidelines still endorse use. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — routine use in general ICU populations has not shown mortality benefit, so indications are selective: cardiogenic shock and complex hemodynamic failure where precise CO/CI, PAP, PCWP, and SvO2 guide therapy; mechanical circulatory support where continuous invasive hemodynamics are needed; heart transplantation and lung transplantation perioperative care; and donor heart management to optimize utilization, all typically at experienced centers with protocolized targets and close monitoring [^54dfe0d0] [^2dac7218] [^2de9093d] [^1036b14c].

> Wait, let me verify contraindications and relative risks. Absolute contraindications are few but include right-sided endocarditis or thrombus where manipulation risks embolization; relative contraindications include severe coagulopathy, severe tricuspid regurgitation with entrapment risk, and severe pulmonary hypertension with rupture risk; in pregnancy, risks include arrhythmias, pulmonary hemorrhage, and knotting, and PAC has largely been supplanted by less invasive monitoring, so use should be exceptional and justified [^baf27177].

> I will now examine insertion technique and confirmation. Standard central venous access via internal jugular or subclavian routes is used, with the catheter advanced through the right atrium and ventricle into the pulmonary artery using balloon flotation and waveform guidance; placement is confirmed by characteristic RA, RV, and PA pressure waveforms and, when available, fluoroscopy or chest radiography; I should double-check that many modern practices still obtain a chest X-ray to document position and screen for complications, especially postoperatively or with difficult advancement [^e9b3e680] [^640099ca].

> Next, I should review the key measurements and their interpretation. Let me think about the essentials: RA pressure reflects right-sided filling and venous return; RV pressure informs RV systolic function and outflow obstruction; PA systolic/diastolic and mean pressures assess pulmonary hypertension and RV afterload; PCWP estimates left atrial pressure and LV filling when the mitral valve is patent; thermodilution cardiac output/index quantifies global perfusion; SvO2 gauges oxygen delivery-consumption balance; calculated SVR and PVR index afterload and pulmonary vascular resistance, respectively, and guide vasopressor and pulmonary vasodilator therapy [^e9b3e680] [^60506111].

> Hold on, I should verify complication rates and their management. Arrhythmias are common during passage through the right heart; pulmonary artery rupture or pseudoaneurysm, though rare, can be catastrophic; balloon rupture or embolization occurs infrequently; infection and thrombosis are ongoing risks with indwelling catheters; knotting and entrapment are uncommon but serious, with reported incidence around 0.2–2.5% and often requiring interventional radiology or surgical retrieval; I need to ensure I note that prevention hinges on minimizing manipulation and using imaging when resistance is encountered during removal [^f19375e4] [^b2faa810] [^640099ca].

> Let me consider alternatives and the evolving evidence base. Echocardiography provides noninvasive estimates of filling pressures, CO, and RV function but is operator-dependent and intermittent; pulse contour analysis and transpulmonary thermodilution offer continuous CO and volumetrics with less invasiveness; meta-analyses of randomized trials show no mortality benefit to routine PAC use in general ICU or high-risk surgical populations, though selected cohorts may benefit when hemodynamic data are acted upon within protocols; I should confirm that contemporary guidance favors a stepwise approach, reserving PAC for refractory shock, MCS, or transplant contexts [^d960b674] [^d802a9ab] [^9a33a933] [^60506111].

> But wait, what if the clinical scenario is post–cardiac surgery or ECMO weaning — does PAC still add value? I should double-check that in these settings, invasive hemodynamics remain standard of care to titrate inotropes, fluids, and MCS, and that PAC-derived PAP, PVR, and RV function metrics inform decisions to wean mechanical support; similarly, in donor heart management, PAC-guided resuscitation can convert borderline organs into transplantable ones without compromising short-term outcomes when ischemic time is acceptable [^54dfe0d0] [^2de9093d] [^e777cc84].

> I need to ensure a practical, risk-stratified approach. For unstable patients with unclear shock physiology or those requiring MCS, PAC is reasonable when an experienced team will use the data to guide therapy; for stable patients or those in whom noninvasive monitoring suffices, avoid PAC; in pregnancy, prioritize echocardiography and pulse contour devices; always weigh bleeding, infection, and mechanical risks against the diagnostic yield, and document a clear indication and removal plan to limit dwell time [^baf27177] [^d802a9ab].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line: the Swan-Ganz catheter remains a powerful diagnostic tool for selected critical illnesses where precise hemodynamics alter management, but routine use is not supported by outcome data; modern practice favors selective deployment in cardiogenic shock, mechanical circulatory support, transplantation, and donor optimization, with vigilance for complications and a low threshold to use imaging and alternatives when appropriate [^9a33a933] [^54dfe0d0] [^2de9093d].

A Swan-Ganz catheter is a **balloon-tipped, flow-directed catheter** [^e9b3e680] placed via central venous access into the pulmonary artery to provide real-time hemodynamic monitoring, including cardiac output, pulmonary pressures, and mixed venous oxygen saturation [^60506111]. It is indicated for complex shock, heart failure, and perioperative management of high-risk cardiac surgery or transplant, but routine use is discouraged due to **lack of mortality benefit** [^9a33a933] and potential complications such as arrhythmias, infection, pulmonary artery rupture, and catheter knotting [^baf27177] [^f19375e4]. Alternatives like echocardiography and pulse contour analysis are preferred when feasible [^d802a9ab]; when a PAC is used, strict aseptic technique, waveform-guided positioning, and vigilant monitoring are essential [^b4060643].

---

## Indications

Swan-Ganz catheters are indicated in **select clinical scenarios**, including:

- **Complex shock states**: Differentiating cardiogenic, septic, or hemorrhagic shock [^notfound].
- **Severe heart failure**: Guiding inotrope, vasodilator, or diuretic therapy [^notfound].
- **Perioperative management**: High-risk cardiac surgery, heart transplantation, or mechanical circulatory support [^54dfe0d0] [^2dac7218].
- **Pulmonary hypertension**: Assessing pulmonary pressures and vascular resistance [^dd103e8f].
- **Donor heart management**: Optimizing hemodynamics to maximize organ utilization [^2de9093d] [^e777cc84].

---

## Contraindications

Absolute contraindications include **right-sided endocarditis** or **pulmonary artery thrombus**, due to embolization risk. Relative contraindications include severe coagulopathy, recent venous thrombosis, or severe tricuspid regurgitation.

---

## Insertion technique

Insertion is typically via the **internal jugular or subclavian vein**, using sterile technique and ultrasound guidance [^notfound]. The catheter is advanced through the right atrium and ventricle into the pulmonary artery, with placement confirmed by characteristic pressure waveforms and chest radiography [^640099ca].

---

## Hemodynamic parameters measured

The Swan-Ganz catheter provides **critical hemodynamic data**, including:

| **Parameter** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|
| Cardiac output/cardiac index | Global perfusion assessment [^60506111] |
| Pulmonary artery pressures | Pulmonary hypertension, RV afterload [^dd103e8f] |
| Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure | Left atrial pressure, LV preload [^baf27177] |
| Mixed venous oxygen saturation | Oxygen delivery/consumption balance [^be6fcf56] |
| Systemic vascular resistance | Afterload assessment [^e9b3e680] |

---

## Complications

Swan-Ganz catheters carry **significant risks**, including:

- **Arrhythmias**: Ventricular ectopy, tachycardia, or rarely ventricular fibrillation [^be6fcf56].
- **Infection**: Catheter-related bloodstream infection [^notfound].
- **Pulmonary artery rupture**: Rare but catastrophic [^326d5663].
- **Catheter knotting or entrapment**: Difficult removal, may require interventional or surgical retrieval [^b2faa810] [^f19375e4].
- **Balloon rupture**: Air embolism or fragment embolization [^baf27177].

---

## Limitations and controversies

Routine use of Swan-Ganz catheters has declined due to **lack of mortality benefit** in randomized trials [^9a33a933] and potential for harm [^29bc1c9e]. Modern alternatives, such as echocardiography and pulse contour analysis, offer less invasive hemodynamic assessment [^d802a9ab] [^d960b674].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines recommend **selective use** of Swan-Ganz catheters, reserved for complex cases where hemodynamic data will directly influence management [^54dfe0d0]. Routine use in general ICU populations is discouraged [^9a33a933].

---

## Alternative hemodynamic monitoring methods

Less invasive alternatives include **echocardiography** for comprehensive cardiac function and filling assessment [^d960b674], **pulse contour analysis** for continuous cardiac output and stroke volume variation [^d802a9ab], and **transpulmonary thermodilution** for volumetric preload and extravascular lung water estimation [^d802a9ab].

---

## Nursing considerations

Nursing care includes **aseptic technique** during insertion and maintenance, continuous waveform monitoring with prompt recognition of malposition or complications, and patient education on the catheter's purpose and activity restrictions [^b4060643].

---

Swan-Ganz catheters provide detailed hemodynamic data in complex cases but carry significant risks; **selective use** with careful technique and monitoring is essential, and less invasive alternatives should be considered whenever possible [^9a33a933] [^d802a9ab].

### Swan, ganz, and their catheter: its evolution over the past half century [^9719784f]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Jeremy Swan and William Ganz developed their eponymous pulmonary artery (PA) catheter in the 1970s and, in the process, revolutionized measurement of cardiac output, pressures within the left side of the heart, and resistance in systemic and pulmonary circulations. Their invention enabled diagnostic measurements at the bedside and contributed to the birth of critical care medicine; technologic advances preceding the PA catheter generally could not be used at the bedside and required patients to be stable enough to be taken to the catheterization laboratory. Swan and Ganz worked in the same department but had quite dissimilar backgrounds and personalities. This article describes their lives and careers, the state of intensive care before and after their catheter was introduced, and the natural life cycle the PA catheter faced as new, less invasive technology arrived to replace it.

### The swan-ganz catheters: past, present, and future. A viewpoint [^583b75d2]. Circulation (2009). Low credibility.

The Swan-Ganz balloon flotation catheter was introduced in 1970. It can be placed at the bedside within a few minutes even in critically ill patients. Although placement of these catheters is not difficult, some training and experience are required to avoid complications and for proper interpretation of the hemodynamic data that can be obtained by pulmonary artery catheterization. Because of the many advantages of balloon flotation catheters compared with conventional catheters, they have been used without a proper indication and frequently overused in critical care units, resulting in many complications, including mortality. The prospective randomized trials have reported that in the majority of clinical circumstances, the routine use of balloon flotation catheters is not indicated. These results are not surprising because balloon flotation catheters are diagnostic and not therapeutic tools. That we have learned a great deal about hemodynamics in critically ill patients with the use of balloon flotation catheters should not be ignored or forgotten. Furthermore, our clinical knowledge of hemodynamics has been made possible because of extensive experience gained from directly determined hemodynamics with the use of balloon flotation catheters. It should also be realized that despite the introduction and refinement of newer noninvasive imaging modalities, a number of clinical circumstances exist in which determination of hemodynamics with the use of a balloon flotation catheter is necessary and should be considered, but only by experienced physicians. With the proper use of Swan-Ganz catheters, our knowledge of hemodynamics has been enhanced considerably. Its abuse, particularly by relatively inexperienced operators, has resulted in serious complications, including death. Prospective randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that the routine use of Swan-Ganz catheters does not provide any benefit. However, use of the Swan-Ganz catheter is still indicated in many situations.

### Alternatives to the swan-ganz catheter [^d802a9ab]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

While the pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) is still interesting in specific situations, there are many alternatives. A group of experts from different backgrounds discusses their respective interests and limitations of the various techniques and related measured variables. The goal of this review is to highlight the conditions in which the alternative devices will suffice and when they will not or when these alternative techniques can provide information not available with PAC. The panel concluded that it is useful to combine different techniques instead of relying on a single one and to adapt the "package" of interventions to the condition of the patient. As a first step, the clinical and biologic signs should be used to identify patients with impaired tissue perfusion. Whenever available, echocardiography should be performed as it provides a rapid and comprehensive hemodynamic evaluation. If the patient responds rapidly to therapy, either no additional monitoring or pulse wave analysis (allowing continuous monitoring in case potential degradation is anticipated) can be applied. If the patient does not rapidly respond to therapy or complex hemodynamic alterations are observed, pulse wave analysis coupled with TPTD is suggested.

### "I had a knot in my heart": unusual complication after implantation of a swan-ganz catheter [^e6da0e15]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Swan-Ganz catheter, developed in the 1970 s by Jeremy Swan and William Ganz, revolutionized hemodynamic monitoring of critically ill patients. The ability to measure cardiac output, intracardiac pressures, and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance directly at the bedside represented a significant improvement over previous procedures that required patient treatment in catheter laboratories. Despite its high clinical importance, the Swan-Ganz catheter carries risks such as arrhythmias, infections, or rare complications such as intracardiac knot formation, which can lead to the need for significant therapeutic interventions.

Notably, the ongoing application of the Swan-Ganz catheter in contemporary complex cardiac surgery exemplifies a clinical paradox, wherein its indispensable diagnostic and therapeutic value must be weighed against its inherent potential for severe complications.

### "I had a knot in my heart": unusual complication after implantation of a swan-ganz catheter [^7118c124]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Early detection of intracardiac knot formation through imaging (chest X-ray, vascular ultrasound) is critical for timely intervention. While non-surgical retrieval techniques exist, our case demonstrates that surgical removal via vascular access may represent the safest approach in select scenarios, particularly when catheter integrity is compromised. This complication highlights three fundamental principles of management: minimizing catheter manipulation remains paramount for prevention, interdisciplinary collaboration proves essential for optimal approach selection, and vigilant monitoring is necessary to identify these rare but serious complications. Ultimately, the decision between interventional and surgical management must be individualized, carefully weighing procedural risks against patient-specific factors.

### Swan-ganz catheter-induced pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm formation: three case reports and a review of the literature [^326d5663]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

The use of Swan-Ganz catheters has increased tremendously since they were first introduced in 1970. Their ability to give vital hemodynamic measurements in critically ill patients makes their use invaluable when providing quality medical care. The formation of pulmonary artery (PA) pseudoaneurysm from a Swan-Ganz catheter-induced perforation of the PA is a rare but potentially fatal complication of Swan-Ganz catheter use. Three case presentations and a review of the literature are presented.

### Difficult removal: a swan-ganz catheter coiled on the central venous catheter [^2a8f0ba3]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Difficult removal of the Swan-Ganz catheter has been reported with an estimated incidence of 0.2–2.5%, due to reasons including intracardiac knots and kinks in the Swan-Ganz catheter. Cardiac perforation and pulmonary artery rupture were the most severe complications due to the difficult removal of a catheter in a previous report. This case report features the difficult removal of a Swan-Ganz catheter, which coiled on the central venous catheter in a patient after cardiac surgery.

### Difficult removal: a swan-ganz catheter coiled on the central venous catheter [^640099ca]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

The use of a Swan-Ganz catheter with balloon flotation is a feasible and rapid technique for hemodynamic monitoring in critically ill patients. However, there have been continuous reports of complications related to the removal of Swan-Ganz catheter in clinical practice, and the common causes include intracardiac knots and kinks in the catheter (Table 1). In this case report, fluoroscopy and chest X-ray revealed that a portion of the catheter coiled on the central venous catheter and formed a knot. The cause of the knot is unknown, and the authors hypothesize that the catheter end may form a knot when the cardiothoracic surgeon reinserted the Swan-Ganz catheter into the distal portion of the pulmonary artery after performing tricuspid valve surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass. Therefore, the loop of the catheter may easily coil around the central venous catheter when the Swan-Ganz catheter is withdrawn. This case suggested that although pulmonary artery pressure wave may reflect the Swan-Ganz catheter successfully floated into the pulmonary artery, it could not indicate whether the catheter formed the intracardiac knot and kink.

Table 1
Difficult removal of the Swan-Ganz catheter

In this case report, the authors describe a successful management approach for removing a Swan-Ganz catheter. The key point for addressing loops and knots is to withdraw the central venous catheter with the assistance of radiologic techniques. Then, the Swan-Ganz catheter could be advanced into the right ventricle to provide more space for the catheter to uncoil. Finally, the catheter was withdrawn under X-ray guidance. This case report suggested that the surgeons should place the catheter in a normal coiled state before re-advancing the Swan-Ganz catheter intraoperatively to avoid forming knots and then gently place the catheter in the right ventricle. Additionally, it is important to take a chest X-ray before removing the Swan-Ganz catheter in patients undergoing tricuspid valve surgery. This process may help similar difficult removals of Swan-Ganz catheters, thereby eliminating the need for invasive maneuvers, but cannot be applied for tight knots.

### Closing the loop on right ventricular mechanics: a smarter swan rises [^4ee8bf14]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

In 1970, Swan and Ganz introduced the pulmonary artery catheter (PAC), transforming critical care by enabling real-time, bedside hemodynamic monitoring of patients. However, in the decades since, the PAC has undergone little technical development. Despite its widespread adoption in the 1980s and 1990s, the conventional thermodilution-based PAC — and its later evolution into the continuous cardiac output PAC — has gradually fallen out of favor in many intensive care settings. Several studies and reviews have highlighted its limited clinical impact and even potential for harm, particularly when misused or overinterpreted in complex intensive care unit scenarios.

Yet, the PAC may be poised for a renaissance. Recent multicenter data from the Cardiogenic Shock Working Group, as reported by Khalife et al, have reasserted the value of the PAC in cardiogenic shock, where invasive hemodynamics can guide timely escalation of therapies, including novel mechanical circulatory support systems. In this issue of JACC: Basic to Translational Science, Aslam et alpresent the next technical frontier: a modified PAC capable of generating real-time right ventricular (RV) pressure-volume (PV) loops for advance hemodynamic assessment. Their work represents a fusion of classical invasive tools with modern engineering and computational insight, offering a novel pathway to project this old tool into the realm of precision cardiovascular care (Figure 1).

### Knot in the cava – an unusual complication of swan-ganz catheters [^755cce95]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Complications associated with the use of the Swan-Ganz catheters including coiling and knotting of the catheter in the central venous system or in the chambers of the heart, often with disastrous consequences. We report a case of knotting of a Swan-Ganz catheter in the superior vena cava which necessitated surgical removal via the right internal jugular vein.

### Difficult removal: a swan-ganz catheter coiled on the central venous catheter [^acc71c9f]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The Swan-Ganz catheter plays an important role in gaining understanding of cardiac pathophysiology and in the hemodynamic monitoring of critically ill patients. Difficult removal of the Swan-Ganz catheter is a rare but serious complication.

Case Presentation

This case presents the difficult removal of a Swan-Ganz catheter in a 28-year-old female patient after cardiac surgery. Fluoroscopy and chest X-ray revealed that a portion of the Swan-Ganz catheter was coiled on the central venous catheter at the level of the superior vena cava. Under X-ray guidance, the central venous catheter was first removed, and then the Swan-Ganz catheter was successfully withdrawn through the percutaneous introducer sheath.

Conclusions

This case report provides an unreported reason for difficult removal and describes a successful solution. This report suggests that X-ray examinations may be necessary before removing the Swan-Ganz catheter.

Task Force 3 — Early post-operative management (Class I): Continuous invasive hemodynamic monitoring of cardiac and pulmonary filling pressures, arterial pressure and cardiac output help optimize organ perfusion and identify complications after DMCS implantation (Level of Evidence C). The implantation of Swan Ganz Catheter should be considered for continuous monitoring of the cardiac output, assessment of oxygen delivery (mixed venous oxygen saturation) and pulmonary arterial pressure and vascular resistance (Level of Evidence C). Vasoactive agents and inotropes should be used to maintain a cardiac index of ≥ 2.2 L/min/m² and a mean arterial pressure between 75 and 90 mmHg (Level of Evidence C). A low cardiac index early after DMCS implantation should prompt an urgent evaluation of intravascular volume, cardiac tamponade, and right ventricular dysfunction (Level of Evidence C).

### Swan-ganz catheter use in trauma patients can be reduced without negatively affecting outcomes [^29bc1c9e]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The use of pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) is controversial. The purpose of this study was to document the changing pattern of PAC use and to determine its effect on outcome.

Methods

The use of PAC was analyzed in patients ≥ 16 years old admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) over a 9-year period starting in 2000. Patients with SICU length of stay exceeding 30 days were excluded. For the evaluation of PAC's effect on outcome, PAC and no-PAC patients were matched utilizing propensity scores.

Results

During the 9-year study period, a total of 5,192 trauma patients were admitted to the SICU. Of these, 426 (8.2%) were < 16 years old, and 174 (3.4%) had a SICU length of stay that exceeded 30 days. For the remaining 4,592 patients, the mean ± SD age was 39.5 ± 18.8 years, and the mean ISS was 19.9 ± 12.4. PAC was utilized in 19.5% (n = 896) of all the patients admitted to the SICU. The trend for PAC use decreased significantly over the years (P value for trend < 0.001), from 38.6% in the year 2000 to 4.2% in the year 2008. This decrease was noted in all age and injury severity groups of patients. The overall mortality, however, remained at the same levels (P value for trend = 0.111). Patients managed with a PAC were significantly older, more severely injured, more frequently injured by a blunt mechanism, and were admitted more often in a hypotensive or comatose status. In the early part of the study, the PAC was utilized on the first day and for 4.1 days on average. In the later part of the study, however, the PAC was used on the second day and for a shorter period of time (3 days on average, P < 0.001). In the matched study population, patients in the PAC group had almost twofold higher odds for death, when compared to the no-PAC group [34.2% vs. 22.5%, Odds Ratio (95% CI): 1.78 (1.42, 2.26), P < 0.001]. Patients younger than 50 years of age who had an ISS ≥ 16 had worse outcome when managed with a PAC, whereas patients aged 30–69 years with an ISS < 16 had a higher survival. The overall complication rate was fivefold higher in patients receiving a PAC [46.3% vs. 14.2%, Odds Ratio (95% CI): 5.22 (4.04, 6.74), P < 0.001].

Conclusion

The use of PAC has decreased almost 10-fold over the last decade at our institution. The PAC is being used later during the ICU course and for a shorter period of time. In a matched population, the use of PAC is associated with a significantly higher mortality and complication rate, but the reason for this association remains uncertain. The use of PAC is invasive and is associated with known complications and financial costs. While the use of PAC maybe useful in a select population, routine and widespread use of the PAC should be avoided.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 211: critical care in pregnancy [^baf27177]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Pulmonary artery catheter (Swan–Ganz catheter) monitoring in pregnancy — capabilities, risks, and current role are outlined. The catheter is inserted through the central venous circulation into the pulmonary artery and can directly measure pressures in the right atrium and pulmonary artery and indirectly measure downstream pressures such as pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Known risks include cardiac arrhythmias, pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary artery rupture or thrombosis, balloon rupture and embolization, intracardiac catheter knotting, and vascular infection. Its use was not associated with decreased mortality and it has largely been replaced by minimally invasive monitoring, including pulse contour analysis from a peripheral arterial catheter. Noninvasive systems have been used in obstetrics and perform well when compared with measurements of cardiac output derived from the pulmonary artery catheter, but given reliance on proprietary algorithms that incorporate patient biometric variables, it will be important to ensure that algorithms and specific monitoring systems continue to be validated in pregnancy.

### Transfemoral percutaneous removal of a knotted swan-ganz catheter [^39a3182d]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2009). Low credibility.

Intracardiac knotting of balloon-tipped flow-directed catheters during a heart catheterization procedure represents a rare but serious complication. In case that such an event occurs, leading to inability to remove the catheter, various different methods have been described to solve the problem, varying from the least invasive to open heart surgery. The formation of large knots requires surgical removal in the vast majority of cases. We describe the successful nonsurgical removal of a Swan-Ganz catheter, after the formation of a large double knot, during a right heart catheterization performed without fluoroscopic guidance in the intensive care unit. This technique could serve as a last resort in cases that surgical removal seems inevitable due to size-related inapplicability of other nonsurgical methods.

### "I had a knot in my heart": unusual complication after implantation of a swan-ganz catheter [^f19375e4]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Knot formation in Swan-Ganz catheters often occurs as a result of excessive manipulation during insertion, such as repeated forward and backward movements of the catheter. The risk is further increased by frequent adjustments and repositioning. The incidence of knotting ranges from 0.2–2.5%. This complication, while rare, represents a significant challenge in hemodynamic monitoring, with multiple contributing factors related to technique, catheter design, and patient-specific factors.

In our case, the knot formation occurred immediately after placement and led to a complete impairment of the catheter movement. This resulted in the formation of a knot directly at the thermistor junction, a phenomenon that can be explained through several key mechanisms:

First, regarding insertion techniques, blind introduction and excessive manipulation during placement can lead to loops forming within the catheter. Our case clearly demonstrates this mechanism, as repeated adjustments during placement directly contributed to the rapid knot formation at the thermistor junction.

Second, the catheter's inherent characteristics played a crucial role. The structural weakness at the thermistor junction in our patient likely predisposed to localized stress and knot formation. This observation aligns with well-documented vulnerabilities of Swan-Ganz catheters, where their long length and thin walls increase flexibility and susceptibility to knotting, particularly in dilated right heart chambers.

Finally, the material properties themselves contributed to this complication. The differences in material properties at the thermistor junction may lead to loop formation and, in rare cases, solid knot formation during manipulation. This was strikingly evident in our case where the knot formed precisely at this junction despite maintained balloon function, while cracks developed proximally.

Remarkably, both the distal lumen and the lumen for inflation of the balloon at the catheter tip remained patent, enabling pressure measurements and contributing to initial diagnostic uncertainty. However, after removal and careful inspection, it was evident that fluid infused through the distal lumen exited through cracks proximal to the site of the knot, as well as at the tip. Therefore, our suspicion of kinking or knot formation was based exclusively on the observed blockade to catheter movement, rather than on pressure measurement abnormalities. This finding underscores the complex interplay between mechanical stress and material integrity in catheter-related complications. Additional environmental factors, such as heat-induced bending of the catheter and incomplete balloon inflation during advancement while not directly observed in our case, further emphasize the importance of meticulous technique in preventing such complications.

### Surgical specimens, haemodynamics and long-term outcomes after pulmonary endarterectomy [^edd8c727]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The data support the value of a complete and bilateral surgical endarterectomy, and the need for a final haemodynamic assessment in the intensive care unit prior to removal of the Swan-Ganz catheter to assess postoperative PVR. PVR is the key haemodynamic parameter for predicting prognosis in CTEPH patients undergoing PEA. The outcome of operable CTEPH is best predicted immediately after PEA, based on PVR and the characteristics of the surgical specimen.

### Critical care cardiology: embracing its past for a brighter future [^64b1cf40]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Current state-of-critical care cardiology

CCM became an internal medicine subspecialty over 40 years ago, with the first board examination and certificates issued by the ABIM in 1987. Successful CCM training necessitates mastery of both procedural skills and cognitive skills. The fundamental principle of CCC emphasizes that comprehensive care of the contemporary CICU patient requires the core competencies obtained in both cardiology and CCM training.

Central to CCM training is expertise in the management of noncardiac disease in medical, neurological, trauma, and surgical settings. These skillsets enhance the ability of CCC to deliver well-rounded and comprehensive care in the CICU. We are not only cardiologists but intensivists who have invested considerable time, effort, and energy into honing our critical care knowledge, familiarity with the best practices, and the body of literature for management of critically ill patients (Table 1).

Table 1
Meetings, Research Groups, Research Networks, and Key Journals With a Strong Emphasis in Critical Care Cardiology

An alternative perspective is that while noncritical care–trained cardiologist may not possess all the expertise required for managing every aspect of critical illness in the CICU, their specialized knowledge in cardiology, combined with their ability to work in a team-based care model, makes them valuable contributors to the CICU team. When supported by intensivists, these providers make a significant positive impact on the care of critically ill cardiac patients.

The growing demand for dedicated critical care cardiologists is evident through the increasing number of CCM programs offering training pathways for critical care cardiology and major institutions shifting their preferred staffing models to CICUs staffed and led by critical care cardiologists, dual-trained in both cardiology and CCM. These specialists offer full-spectrum cardiac and critical care but are uniquely positioned to offer specialized services such as transesophageal echo, bedside Swan-Ganz catheter placement/interpretation, optimization of ventilatory settings based on heart-lung interaction, and management of mechanical support (MCS).

Mechanical circulatory support — early postoperative invasive hemodynamic monitoring and targets include that continuous invasive hemodynamic monitoring of cardiac and pulmonary filling pressures, arterial pressure and cardiac output help optimize organ perfusion and identify complications after DMCS implantation. The implantation of Swan Ganz catheter should be considered for continuous monitoring of the cardiac output, assessment of oxygen delivery (mixed venous oxygen saturation) and pulmonary arterial pressure and vascular resistance. Vasoactive agents and inotropes should be used to maintain a cardiac index of > 2.2 L/min/m² and a mean arterial pressure between 75 and 90 mm Hg (Class I, Level of evidence: C), and a low cardiac index early after DMCS implantation should prompt an urgent evaluation of intravascular volume, cardiac tamponade, and right ventricular dysfunction. Adjunctive data from the left ventricular assist device (LVAD) monitor or controller may further help optimize flow and identify complications, however should not supplant hemodynamic data and clinical assessment, and hemodynamic monitoring with echocardiography may be considered in select cases where additional imaging information may alter therapy and the invasive hemodynamics and clinical assessment are nondiagnostic or incongruent.

Postexplant management and surveillance — ICU care targets include minimizing IV fluids, leaving a Swan Ganz catheter in place postoperatively for at least 48 hours, and titrating fluid balance to invasive hemodynamics. Diuretics should be used to maintain the PA diastolic pressure below 20 mm Hg, inotropes are usually continued for the first few days after explant and then slowly discontinued, and caution is advised with high dose milrinone immediately postoperatively so avoidance or an early wean is advised. As inotropes are weaned off after explantation, the ACE inhibitor should be reintroduced followed by the beta blocker, both should be uptitrated as rapidly as possible, and the aldosterone antagonist should also be reintroduced while monitoring the potassium.

### To swan or not to swan: indications, alternatives, and future directions [^e9b3a680]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

The pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) has revolutionized bedside assessment of preload, afterload, and contractility using measured pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, calculated systemic vascular resistance, and estimated cardiac output. It is placed percutaneously by a flow-directed balloon-tipped technique through the venous system and the right heart to the pulmonary artery. Interest in the hemodynamic variables obtained from PACs paved the way for the development of numerous less-invasive hemodynamic monitors over the past 3 decades. These devices estimate cardiac output using concepts such as pulse contour and pressure analysis, transpulmonary thermodilution, carbon dioxide rebreathing, impedance plethysmography, Doppler ultrasonography, and echocardiography. Herein, the authors review the conception, technologic advancements, and modern use of PACs, as well as the criticisms regarding the clinical utility, reliability, and safety of PACs. The authors comment on the current understanding of the benefits and limitations of alternative hemodynamic monitors, which is important for providers caring for critically ill patients. The authors also briefly discuss the use of hemodynamic monitoring in goal-directed fluid therapy algorithms in Enhanced Recovery After Surgery programs.

### Thrombolytic therapy of acute massive pulmonary embolism using swan-ganz pulmonary artery catheter [^ddafcf8a]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Acute massive pulmonary embolism (PE) is associated with high fatality, and catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy has been shown to be an efficacious treatment for this condition. We herein report a patient who developed acute massive PE but could not undergo the conventional catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy. A Swan-Ganz pulmonary artery catheter was placed at bedside to initiate immediate thrombolytic infusion, which resulted in dramatic clinical improvement. This report underscores a potential role of thrombolytic therapy via a transjugular pulmonary artery catheter in patients with acute massive PE who could not undergo the conventional catheter-based thrombolytic intervention.

### Pulmonary artery catheters for adult patients in intensive care [^60506111]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Since pulmonary artery balloon flotation catheterization was first introduced in 1970, by HJ Swan and W Ganz, it has been widely disseminated as a diagnostic tool without rigorous evaluation of its clinical utility and effectiveness in critically ill patients. A pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) is inserted through a central venous access into the right side of the heart and floated into the pulmonary artery. PAC is used to measure stroke volume, cardiac output, mixed venous oxygen saturation and intracardiac pressures with a variety of additional calculated variables to guide diagnosis and treatment. Complications of the procedure are mainly related to line insertion. Relatively uncommon complications include cardiac arrhythmias, pulmonary haemorrhage and infarct, and associated mortality from balloon tip rupture.

Objectives

To provide an up-to-date assessment of the effectiveness of a PAC on mortality, length of stay (LOS) in intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital and cost of care in adult intensive care patients.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 12); MEDLINE (1954 to January 2012); EMBASE (1980 to January 2012); CINAHL (1982 to January 2012), and reference lists of articles. We contacted researchers in the field. We did a grey literature search for articles published until January 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized controlled trials conducted in adults ICUs, comparing management with and without a PAC.

Data Collection and Analysis

We screened the titles and abstracts and then the full text reports identified from our electronic search. Two authors (SR and MG) independently reviewed the titles, abstracts and then the full text reports for inclusion. We determined the final list of included studies by discussion among the group members (SR, ND, MG, AK and SC) with consensus agreement. We included all the studies that were in the original review. We assessed seven domains of potential risk of bias for the included studies. We examined the clinical, methodological and statistical heterogeneity and used random-effects model for meta-analysis. We calculated risk ratio for mortality across studies and mean days for LOS.

Main Results

We included 13 studies (5686 patients). We judged blinding of participants and personnel and blinding of outcome assessment to be at high risk in about 50% of the included studies and at low risk in 25% to 30% of the studies. Regardless of the high risk of performance bias these studies were included based on the low weight the studies had in the meta-analysis. We rated 75% of the studies as low risk for selection, attrition and reporting bias. All 13 studies reported some type of hospital mortality (28-day, 30-day, 60-day or ICU mortality). We considered studies of high-risk surgery patients (eight studies) and general intensive care patients (five studies) separately as subgroups for meta-analysis. The pooled risk ratio (RR) for mortality for the studies of general intensive care patients was 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.09) and for the studies of high-risk surgery patients the RR was 0.98 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.29). Of the eight studies of high-risk surgery patients, five evaluated the effectiveness of pre-operative optimization but there was no difference in mortality when these studies were examined separately. PAC did not affect general ICU LOS (reported by four studies) or hospital LOS (reported by nine studies). Four studies, conducted in the United States (US), reported costs based on hospital charges billed, which on average were higher in the PAC groups. Two of these studies qualified for analysis and did not show a statistically significant hospital cost difference (mean difference USD 900, 95% CI -2620 to 4420, P = 0.62).

Authors' Conclusions

PAC is a diagnostic and haemodynamic monitoring tool but not a therapeutic intervention. Our review concluded that use of a PAC did not alter the mortality, general ICU or hospital LOS, or cost for adult patients in intensive care. The quality of evidence was high for mortality and LOS but low for cost analysis. Efficacy studies are needed to determine if there are optimal PAC-guided management protocols, which when applied to specific patient groups in ICUs could result in benefits such as shock reversal, improved organ function and less vasopressor use. Newer, less-invasive haemodynamic monitoring tools need to be validated against PAC prior to clinical use in critically ill patients.

### "I had a knot in my heart": unusual complication after implantation of a swan-ganz catheter [^e12e02d4]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Importantly, the presence of an additional central venous catheter in close proximity to the pulmonary artery sheath — clearly visible in the chest X-ray (Fig. 1) — may have contributed to directional changes at the Swan-Ganz catheter tip, potentially predisposing to looping or knotting, although direct interaction between the catheters would most likely occur within the superior vena cava due to the length of the introducer sheath.

The diagnosis of an intracardiac knot caused by a Swan-Ganz catheter is typically made in cases where there is difficulty in recording hemodynamics, in injecting fluids, or in moving the catheter. In our patient's case, echocardiography did not provide sufficient clarity, which often occurs with intracardiac knot formation. Therefore, supplementary diagnostics using chest X-ray and vascular ultrasound proved to be crucial.

Therapeutic measures recommended in the literature include non-surgical methods such as balloon dilation within the knot or sling techniques with loop snare catheters. However, due to the patient's stable condition, and in order to avoid possible complications such as cardiac injury or thromboembolic events, the decision was made to perform transcutaneous surgical removal with vascular incision and subsequent suturing.

Right ventricular dysfunction at the end of transplantation — There are clear situations with right ventricular dysfunction (for example, high pulmonary artery pressures) where patients should not be weaned off ECMO at the end of the transplantation (COR: 1, LOE: C-EO). The decision is based on multiple parameters, including hemodynamic parameters from a Swan-Ganz catheter, morphologic criteria from transesophageal echocardiography, and biological parameters, and decreased pulmonary artery pressures and adequate oxygenation have been shown to be useful parameters for determining when to wean, with a published 98.5% rate of successful weaning.

### Impact of the pulmonary artery catheter in critically ill patients: meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^9a33a933]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating the pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) have been limited by small sample size. Some nonrandomized studies suggest that PAC use is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

Objective

To estimate the impact of the PAC device in critically ill patients.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1985–2005), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry (1988–2005), the National Institutes of Health ClinicalTrials.gov database, and the US Food and Drug Administration Web site for RCTs in which patients were randomly assigned to PAC or no PAC were searched. Results from the ESCAPE trial of patients with severe heart failure were also included. Search terms included pulmonary artery catheter, right heart catheter, catheter, and Swan-Ganz.

Study Selection

Eligible studies included patients who were undergoing surgery, in the intensive care unit (ICU), admitted with advanced heart failure, or diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome and/or sepsis; and studies that reported death and the number of days hospitalized or the number of days in the ICU as outcome measures.

Data Extraction

Information on eligibility criteria, baseline characteristics, interventions, outcomes, and methodological quality was extracted by 2 reviewers. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.

Data Synthesis

In 13 RCTs, 5051 patients were randomized. Hemodynamic goals and treatment strategies varied among trials. A random-effects model was used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) for death, number of days hospitalized, and use of inotropes and intravenous vasodilators. The combined OR for mortality was 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90–1.20; P = 0.59). The difference in the mean number of days hospitalized for PAC minus the mean for no PAC was 0.11 (95% CI, -0.51 to 0.74; P = 0.73). Use of the PAC was associated with a higher use of inotropes (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.19–2.12; P = 0.002) and intravenous vasodilators (OR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.75–3.15; P < .001).

Conclusions

In critically ill patients, use of the PAC neither increased overall mortality or days in hospital nor conferred benefit. Despite almost 20 years of RCTs, a clear strategy leading to improved survival with the PAC has not been devised. The neutrality of the PAC for clinical outcomes may result from the absence of effective evidence-based treatments to use in combination with PAC information across the spectrum of critically ill patients.

### Swan-ganz catheter assessment of donor hearts: outcome of organs with borderline hemodynamics [^e777cc84]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

High-dosage inotrope use or periods of hypotension may cause rejection of donor hearts for transplantation. At our institution, we do not refuse potential donor organs based on these criteria alone before Swan-Ganz catheter (SGC) assessment. In this study, we evaluate the role of the SGC in donor heart resuscitation and selection and assess the outcome of using borderline organs.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed 129 donors assessed between 1996 and 1999, all with complete hemodynamic data. Two sets of SGC measurements were analyzed: one set from the initial assessments, and one set from assessments made just before organ harvesting. The physiologic targets were mean blood pressure > 60 mm Hg, central venous pressure < 12 mm Hg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure < 12 mm Hg, left ventricular stroke work index > 15 x g.m/m², and use of only one inotrope. A poorly functioning heart was defined as an organ failing on 2 or more of these criteria. Hemodynamic categories were defined as A, good function throughout assessment; B, sub-optimal function and then improvement; and C, decreasing or poor function throughout. We have a policy to avoid allocating sub-optimal organs to high-risk recipients.

Results

One hundred fourteen donor hearts went on to be transplanted: 75 as orthotopic hearts and 39 as heart-lungs (5 of these were heart, lung, and liver transplantations, not reported further here). Of the 75 donor hearts used for heart transplantations, 53 were from Category A, 9 were from Category B, and 13 were from Category C. Of the donor hearts used for the 34 heart-lung transplantations 16 were from Category A, 10 were from Category B, and 8 were from Category C. Three patients died of donor organ failure: 1 of the corresponding hearts was from Category B, and 2 were from Category C. When comparing separately the outcome of the 2 procedures, we found no significant difference in duration of stay in the intensive care unit, requirement for mechanical support, 30-day mortality, or 1-year survival among patients with hearts from Categories A, B, and C. Ischemic time was the only significant risk factor for death (p = 0.006).

Conclusions

Use of organs from Categories B and C permitted expansion of the donor pool without compromising short-term outcome. However, these organs should be used with caution in combination with other risk factors, in particular long ischemic time.

### The association of pulmonary artery catheterization utilization and surgical patients' outcomes: a PRISMA-compliant systematic review and meta-analysis [^104d733b]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The invention of PAC has a long and distinguished history. Professor Werner Forssmann first performed the human right heart catheter in 1929. In the 1940s, Richards and colleagues developed a catheter that could be inserted in the pulmonary artery to study hemodynamics in patients using fluoroscopy guidance. The introduction of PAC by professors Jeremy Swan and William Ganz in 1970 allowed the insertion of the catheter at the bedside. Following the work of Swan/Ganz, PAC has begun to be routinely used in critically ill patients as a diagnostic tool and monitoring device, particularly for those with myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, and CHF. However, the SUPPORT trial conducted in 1996 revealed that PAC utilization was associated with increased 30-day mortality, LOS in the ICU, and costs. These findings raised concerns regarding the risk–benefit profile of PAC utilization. Conversely, a study called PAC-man enrolled 1,041 ICU patients from the UK and reported no significant difference in in-hospital mortality between patients managed with or without PAC. Several studies including high-risk surgical patients also showed that the benefit of PAC utilization was modest. Concerns about the safety and efficacy of PAC, alternative less invasive or noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring devices emerged. Although many technologies have sought to supplant PAC, none has been subjected to as much clinical use and scrutiny. PAC remains the gold standard for CO/CI, SmvO 2, PAP, blood temperature, and all in one piece. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has been increasingly used in non-cardiac and cardiac surgical patients. TEE could detect wall motion abnormalities, which are early signs of acute myocardial ischemia. Moreover, TEE could provide live information regarding valvular structures and function, and detect intracardiac air. However, TEE use needs a skilled operator, and the standard TEE probes cannot be kept in the patient for too long. Therefore, TEE and PAC were complementary to each other. Combined use of PAC and TEE may be more helpful than alone.

Perfusion imaging with 99mTc-MAA — administration, positioning, projections, SPECT use, and shunt evaluation are described: After the patient has been told to cough and take several deep breaths, 99mTc-MAA is injected slowly during 3–5 respiratory cycles with the patient supine; the tracer should not be administered in the distal port of a Swan-Ganz catheter or any indwelling line or port that contains a filter — for example, a chemotherapy line; imaging is preferably performed with the patient upright to increase chest cavity size and to minimize diaphragmatic motion, though images can be obtained with the patient in the supine or decubitus position; planar images should be obtained in multiple projections including anterior, posterior, both posterior oblique, both anterior oblique, and both lateral projections, although either the anterior oblique or the lateral projections can be omitted; SPECT can be used to obtain a 3-dimensional evaluation of the perfusion, and imaging of high blood-flow systemic organs can be used to detect right-to-left shunting with images of the brain used to distinguish right-to-left shunting from systemic distribution of radiopharmaceutical components too small to be trapped by capillaries.

### "I had a knot in my heart": unusual complication after implantation of a swan-ganz catheter [^2a729dbc]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The implantation of a Swan-Ganz catheter for invasive hemodynamic monitoring is an established measure after cardiac surgery. A rare but serious complication is the formation of a knot in the heart, which can be diagnostically challenging. We report on a patient who developed left heart failure postoperatively after quadruple bypass surgery combined with aortic valve replacement and in whom a knot formed inadvertently during monitoring using a Swan-Ganz catheter.

Case presentation

An 82-year-old female underwent combined quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve replacement for severe coronary and valvular heart disease. Postoperatively, she experienced acute left ventricular dysfunction, necessitating mechanical circulatory support with an Impella device. A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed through the internal jugular vein for accurate hemodynamic monitoring. After placement, unexpected catheter immobility raised suspicion of an intracardiac knot. Initial transthoracic echocardiography did not clearly visualize the lesion; however, subsequent chest radiography and jugular vein ultrasound confirmed catheter-associated intracardiac knot formation. Considering the heightened risk for cardiac injury and thromboembolic events, interdisciplinary consensus recommended bedside surgical extraction. The catheter and associated knot were successfully removed via transcutaneous vascular incision without complications. Inspection revealed knot formation proximal to the catheter thermistor, while the balloon remained intact and functional.

Conclusion

Intracardiac knot formation associated with Swan-Ganz catheter placement is rare but presents significant risks. Timely interdisciplinary assessment, multimodal imaging, and surgical extraction under controlled conditions effectively mitigate potential complications, enabling safe catheter removal and favorable patient outcomes.

### A preliminary study on the monitoring of mixed venous oxygen saturation through the left main bronchus [^be6fcf56]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Discussion

SvO 2 reflects the balance between oxygen delivery and demand. It decreases when oxygen delivery has been compromised or systemic oxygen demands have exceeded supply. Its ability to give a real-time indication of tissue oxygenation makes it a preferred parameter for monitoring the adequacy of hemodynamics. In comparison with traditional parameters such as arterial oxygen saturation and cardiac output, SvO 2 allows a more precise understanding of the adequacy of cardiac and pulmonary function. Declines in SvO 2 precede the onset of inadequate myocardial function, shock, or the development of arrhythmias, even though vital signs may be normal. Its use as an end point for determining the adequacy of hemodynamics (blood pressure, cardiac output/cardiac index), measurement of right to left shunt, and prediction of potential hemodynamic instability makes this parameter invaluable for the knowledgeable clinician. There is now evidence that the timing of diagnostic and therapeutic intervention using this technology may be a critical determinant of outcome.

The PAC, otherwise known as the Swan–Ganz catheter, was developed by cardiologists HJC Swan and William Ganz in 1970. It is a flexible balloon-tipped flow-directed catheter that, when inserted via central venous access, can be guided into a branch of the pulmonary artery. Its ability to provide continuous measurements of SvO 2 in critically ill patients makes its use invaluable in the provision of quality medical care. However, controversy surrounding the efficacy and safety of the PAC has been going on for many years. The complications can be categorized as those of the initial venous cannulation (subclavian or carotid artery laceration, pneumothorax, thoracic duct laceration, phrenic nerve injury, and air embolism) and those due to the catheter itself (ie, arrhythmias, infection, valvular damage, thrombosis, pulmonary infarction, and rupture of the pulmonary artery). At the same time, the device requires a trained operator and is time-consuming. Moreover, it is expensive, bringing high healthcare costs.

### Novel IVC doraya catheter provides congestion relief in patients with acute heart Failure [^0e6eba09]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2022). Medium credibility.

The study followed the current guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology. Each patient served as their own control and underwent at least 24 hours of standard care and assessment prior to catheter deployment. Patients were monitored for adverse events (AEs), particularly for catheter thrombosis, misplacement or migration, edema of lower extremities, and other potential complications. The monitoring of the hemodynamic parameters during the procedure was performed by Swan-Ganz catheter. All patients were followed up for 60 days.

The primary safety outcome was the rate and nature of device- and procedure-related AEs until 1 month following the procedure. The primary feasibility end point was technical success, defined as the ability to position the catheter below the renal veins, to regulate the flow in the IVC using the catheter by creating a gradient pressure of at least 2 mm Hg, and to withdraw the catheter safely. Additional observational measures included the rate of urine output, changes of serum creatinine, and natriuresis.

A total of 9 patients were treated with the catheter (7 male and 2 female patients, mean age 69 ± 9 years, mean left ventricle ejection fraction 24 ± 12%). The technical aspects of catheter use such as its placement, deployment, and removal were successfully achieved, and there were no incidents of device malfunctions. The mean intervention duration was 8.5 hours (range 7–11.5 hours). No device-related AE or embolic event was observed during the procedure nor within 30 days of follow-up; however, 1 procedure-related severe AE was reported (ie, bleeding hematoma from the Swan-Ganz catheter insertion site), which was resolved without sequelae.

The catheter created a transient and fully controllable gradient in the IVC. The mean IVC pressures obtained above and below the catheter were 18.4 ± 3.8 mm Hg and 17.8 ± 4.0 mm Hg, respectively, at baseline. The catheter deployment resulted in significant pressure reduction above the device: 12.4 ± 4.7 mm Hg, when compared to unchanged pressure below the catheter: 18.5 ± 6.2 mm Hg at the end of procedure (P < 0.01; by Student's t-test for paired samples). Additionally, the systolic blood pressures were stable during the study at baseline, minimum during procedure, and at end of procedure and were recorded as 110 ± 13, 100 ± 13, and 109 ± 17 mm Hg, respectively. Heart rates were not recorded during the procedures.

### Difficult removal: a swan-ganz catheter coiled on the central venous catheter [^b908d2cb]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 28-year-old woman, weight 55 kg and height 162 cm, initially presented to the emergency department of an outside hospital with a 2-month history of chest distress, cough and dyspnea. The patient's symptoms did not improve significantly after oxygen therapy or anti-asthma medication combined with aerosol inhalation. The patient was later transferred to the cardiovascular surgery department in the authors' institution with aggravation of the above symptoms. Echocardiography revealed severe tricuspid regurgitation and congenital heart disease, including a ventricular septal defect and rupture of the right coronary sinus aneurysm. An abdominal computed tomography scan revealed that the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins were widened. The preoperative laboratory examination was unremarkable. For invasive hemodynamic measurement, a Swan-Ganz catheter (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) was inserted through an 8-F percutaneous introducer sheath placed in the right internal jugular vein, and a central venous catheter was inserted into the right subclavian vein without any difficulties. The pulmonary artery pressure waveform suggested that the catheter was successfully floated into the pulmonary artery. The patient underwent ventricular septal defect repair, aortoplasty and tricuspid valvuloplasty under cardiopulmonary bypass.

After obtaining the hemodynamic indexes postoperatively, the Swan-Ganz catheter was found difficult to withdraw when it was pulled out to 35 cm mark. The cardiovascular surgeons and intensive care physicians suggested transporting the patient to interventional radiology. The chest X-ray showed that a portion of the Swan-Ganz catheter coiled on the central venous catheters at the level of the superior vena cava and formed a knot approximately 1 cm in diameter (Fig. 1). Under X-ray guidance, the interventional radiologist first removed the central venous catheter smoothly. Then, the Swan-Ganz catheter was gently pushed into the right ventricle to provide more space to uncoil, and then the catheter returned to its original coiled configuration. Finally, the Swan-Ganz catheter was successfully withdrawn through the percutaneous introducer sheath. A closer inspection of the Swan-Ganz catheter coiled on the central venous catheter is shown in Fig. 2. During this procedure, the patient's hemodynamics were not significantly affected, and the patient did not present any complications or cardiovascular injury. Valvar damage was excluded by echocardiography.

We performed urgent tricuspid valve repair by suturing the ruptured papillary muscle. This report highlights preventive measures to avoid suture-related entrapment and raises a word of caution regarding percutaneous removal of accidentally entrapped SCGs.

### "I had a knot in my heart": unusual complication after implantation of a swan-ganz catheter [^27ed074b]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Case report

An 82-year-old female patient underwent quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting combined with aortic valve replacement due to severe coronary artery and valvular heart disease. There was an acute deterioration of the left ventricular pumping function postoperatively that necessitated the implantation of an Impella 5.5 heart pump. In order to ensure reliable hemodynamic monitoring, a Swan-Ganz catheter was subsequently implanted via the internal jugular vein separately during postoperative ICU care.

After initial placement, the Swan-Ganz catheter allowed for right ventricular pressure measurement; however, further advancement into the pulmonary artery to achieve wedge position was unsuccessful, necessitating several repositioning maneuvers. Following these attempts, a persistent blockade in catheter movement was encountered, especially during attempted withdrawal. Given the suspicion of intracardiac knot formation, transesophageal echocardiography was first performed, though it did not provide sufficient visualization of the catheter or knot. Subsequently, chest radiography was performed, which definitively confirmed the presence of a catheter-associated knot (Fig. 1). It is likely that repeated manipulations in the early phase resulted in malpositioning of the catheter tip into the inferior vena cava (IVC), as later demonstrated on imaging. A subsequent ultrasound examination of the jugular vein allowed clear visualization of the knot (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Ultrasound examination of the jugular vein

The percutaneous surgical removal of the knot was performed via direct vascular access under controlled conditions. A parallel incision was made adjacent to the introducer sheath, and under gentle traction, the vessel was locally extended using a stab incision directly over the protruding knot. This maneuver enabled the simultaneous extraction of both the catheter and the knot, after which the vessel was closed with direct suturing. This technique was specifically chosen to minimize the risk of thromboembolism or cardiac injury. The procedure was successful without complications, and the patient subsequently showed stable cardiac function so that he could be discharged after careful monitoring.

A detailed examination of the extracted Swan-Ganz catheter showed knot formation just above the thermistor (Fig. 3), with the balloon remaining intact and fully functional at the catheter tip.

### Accuracy of totally implanted ports, tunnelled, single-and multiple-lumen central venous catheters for measurement of central venous pressure [^b7bef6dc]. Intensive Care Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

To verify the accuracy of totally implanted ports, tunnelled central venous catheters (CVC), widely used in cancer patients, and multi-lumen catheters, used in intensive care units (ICUs), in measuring central venous pressure (CVP), using right atrial pressure (RAP) measured in a Swan-Ganz catheter as the reference standard.

Design

A prospective study, over a 10-month period.

Setting

A medical-surgical ICU in a comprehensive cancer centre.

Patients and Participants

Patients who had both (1) a Swan-Ganz catheter and (2) either a tunnelled catheter, a single or a multi-lumen catheter, or a totally implanted port.

Interventions

RAP and CVP were measured simultaneously in each patient.

Measurements and Results

Fifty-six pairs of RAP-CVP measurements were performed in 35 patients: 6 tunnelled catheters, 6 non-tunnelled single-lumen catheters, 26 multiple-lumen catheters and 18 totally implanted ports were studied. RAP measured in the Swan-Ganz catheter and CVP measured in the CVC were strongly correlated (r = 0.94, p < 0.01), whatever the type of catheter studied. The mean difference between RAP and CVP was -0.39 ± 1.73 (SD) mmHg. In 51 cases (91%), the difference was within the limits of agreement (-3.78 to 3.00 mmHg, Bland and Altman method). For the five cases with a difference of 4 mmHg (three totally implanted ports, one double- and one triple-lumen catheter), CVP was greater than RAP.

Conclusions

CVP can be accurately measured in totally implanted ports, tunnelled or non-tunnelled single-lumen and multiple-lumen catheters. When the difference exceeds the limit of agreement, the discrepancy between the two measurements has limited significance in most cases.

### Doppler echocardiography in advanced systolic heart failure: a noninvasive alternative to swan-ganz catheter [^d960b674]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Although several studies have demonstrated a good correlation between Doppler echocardiographic and invasive measurements of single hemodynamic variables, the accuracy of echocardiography in providing a comprehensive assessment in individual patients has not been validated. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy and clinical applicability of Doppler echocardiography in determining the entire hemodynamic profile in stable patients with advanced systolic heart failure.

Methods and Results

Doppler echocardiography and Swan-Ganz catheterization were simultaneously performed in 43 consecutive patients with advanced heart failure. Echocardiographic data required for estimation of right atrial, pulmonary artery systolic, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures; cardiac output; and pulmonary vascular resistance were obtained and compared with hemodynamic data. For all variables, invasive and noninvasive hemodynamic values were highly correlated (P < 0.0001), with very low bias and narrow 95% confidence limits. In 16 patients with elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (> 3 Wood U) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures (> 20 mm Hg) at baseline, hemodynamic and Doppler measurements were simultaneously repeated after unloading manipulations. Absolute values and changes of pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures after unloading were still accurately predicted (r = 0.96 and r = 0.92, respectively).

Conclusions

Doppler echocardiography may offer a valid alternative to invasive cardiac catheterization for the comprehensive hemodynamic assessment of patients with advanced heart failure, and it may assist in monitoring and optimization of therapy in potential heart transplant recipients.

### Is measurement of central venous pressure required to estimate systemic vascular resistance? A retrospective cohort study [^06e39492]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Data acquisition

All vital data were collected by a free data collection program (Vital recorder version 1.8, accessed at, Seoul, Republic of Korea). CVP and MAP were measured using a central venous or Swan-Ganz catheter (7.5 F Swan-Ganz continuous cardiac output thermodilution catheter: CCOmbo V, model 774F75, Edwards Lifesciences LLC) and an arterial catheter, respectively. In patients who underwent neurosurgery, a FloTrac™/EV1000™ system (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) was used, with CO estimated and updated every 20 s. In patients who underwent cardiac surgery, a HemoSphere advanced monitoring platform (Edwards Lifesciences) and a Swan-Ganz catheter were used, with CO estimated and updated every 60 s (continuous CO). The transducers were zeroed and leveled immediately after the insertion of each catheter (i.e. arterial and central). The transducer unit (attached to the multi-transducer holder) was attached on a rod fixed at the side of the operating table. Then the level of the transducer unit was adjusted to the level of 4th intercostal space at the left mid-axillary line of the patient (phlebostatic axis). It is common practice in our institution to adjust the transducer unit if a significant deviation from the phlebostatic axis is noted intraoperatively. However, information about additional intraoperative adjustments of the transducer level was not included in the current study. Mean CVP value obtained over several cardiac and respiratory cycles through the monitor (Intellivue MX700 and MX800 [Philips, Boeblingen, Germany] for neuro- and cardiac surgery, respectively) was recorded and used for the calculation of the actual SVR. As the SVR displayed by the monitoring devices (i.e. EV1000 or HemoSphere) is derived from past CVP (not real-time CVP; displays a same value during the antegrade value processing), the current study used calculated SVR (not displayed value from the device) using real-time CVP and treated it as actual SVR. It was done for comparison between the real-time SVR and the virtual SVR calculated from fixed or random CVP".

### Emerging applications for transseptal left heart catheterization old techniques for new procedures [^f8b7fb5e]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Transseptal (TS) catheterization was introduced in 1959 as a strategy to directly measure left atrial (LA) pressure. Despite acceptable feasibility and safety, TS catheterization has been replaced by indirect measurements of LA pressure using the Swan-Ganz catheter. Today, TS puncture is rarely performed for diagnostic purposes but continues to be performed for procedures such as balloon mitral valvuloplasty, antegrade balloon aortic valvuloplasty, and ablation of arrhythmias in the LA. Thus, the "art" of TS puncture has been lost, except in centers that perform these procedures with regularity. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in the TS technique because of emerging therapeutic procedures for structural heart disease and atrial fibrillation ablation. Invasive cardiologists will have to refamiliarize themselves with the TS technique, newer TS devices, and advanced ultrasound imaging for guidance of the procedure.

### CAQ corner: surgical evaluation for liver transplantation [^b08f7255]. Liver Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

MEDICAL PERIOPERATIVE CONSIDERATIONS

In addition to the overall assessment of transplant candidacy, the transplant surgeon must identify any risk factors for perioperative morbidity or mortality and technical barriers to completing a liver transplant. Specific aspects of a patient's medical history that would be relevant to perioperative risk include advanced age, any history of coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure, pulmonary hypertension (pHTN), hepatopulmonary syndrome, cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease or end‐stage renal disease, or longstanding diabetes mellitus. Preoperative cardiopulmonary assessment with echocardiography, stress test, and/or potential cardiac catheterization, left for CAD and right for pulmonary artery pressures, is critical. The degree of pHTN may be evaluated by echocardiography or a Swan‐Ganz catheter. In patients with pHTN, it is important to identify the etiology, primary versus secondary to hepatopulmonary syndrome or volume overload. Etiology will dictate further optimization by, for example, pulmonary vasodilators, diuresis, or dialysis.

### Novel use of an irrigated ablation catheter to monitor real-time hemodynamics during ablation [^978bcdfa]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hemodynamic decompensation during catheter ablation occurs due to prolonged procedure time and irrigant delivery directly into the cardiac chambers. Real-time hemodynamic monitoring of patients undergoing catheter ablation procedures may identify patients at risk of decompensation; we set out to assess the feasibility of a novel, real-time, intracardiac pressure monitoring system using a standard irrigated ablation catheter.

Methods

We studied 13 consecutive who underwent pressure measurement of the left atrium (LA) and left ventricle (LV) via transeptal access with a Swan Ganz (SG) catheter followed by two commercially available irrigated ablation catheters. Pressure waveform data was extracted to compare LA peak pressure, LV peak systolic pressure, LV end-diastolic pressure, and waveform analysis.

Results

Comparison between the SG and ablation catheters (AblA; AblB) demonstrated that LV systolic pressure (0.61–16.8mmHg; 1.32–18.2mmHg), and LV end-diastolic pressure (-3.4 to 2.8mmHg; -3.0 to 3.35mmHg) were well correlated and had accepted repeatability. Ablation waveforms demonstrated an 89.9 ± 6.4% correlation compared to SG waveforms.

Conclusion

Pressure measurements derived from an irrigated ablation catheter are accurate and reliable when compared to an SG catheter. Further studies are needed to determine how real-time pressure monitoring can improve outcomes during ablation procedures.

### EACTS / STS / AATS guidelines on temporary mechanical circulatory support in adult cardiac surgery [^536b6cf4]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2025). High credibility.

VA-ECLS adjunct unloading and strategy guidance emphasize improved outcomes with specific approaches. Radakovic et al. reported improved 30-day survival and myocardial recovery with prophylactic mAFP compared to reactive ("bailout") unloading. A meta-analysis of 12 studies (5,063 patients) found that combining VA-ECLS with IABP lowered 30-day mortality and increased successful weaning. Another meta-analysis focusing on patients undergoing ECPR found that combined VA-ECLS and mAFP support was associated with improved survival compared to VA-ECLS alone. Overall, early and effective LV unloading is associated with better survival and increased weaning success. Thus, LV unloading should be promptly considered in all patients supported by VA-ECLS to further improve outcomes. In patients with profound CS, full-support mAFP appears superior to partial support and should be prioritized when feasible. Device selection and unloading strategy should be guided by haemodynamic assessments, preferably with a Swan-Ganz catheter, and in certain clinical scenarios with unique haemodynamic requirements, a synergistic device strategy, such as mAFP with VA-ECLS or BVAD, may be warranted.

Table 2
Proposed protocol for perioperative and intraoperative blood testing

Patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease should have a thorough preoperative cardiological evaluation. Continuous intraoperative assessment of cardiac function and fluid status using an echocardiography probe might be helpful. Using an indicator dilution technique might be questionable, as the algorithms for hemodynamic calculations with a PICCO catheter or a Swan-Ganz catheter use size and weight. With the clamped extremity and abnormal temperatures these might lead to wrong calculations.

It is important to be careful about blood, urine and other body fluids secretions. The washout from the extremity, the pump filling and the circuit were put into cytostatic waste cans. As a routine, we used special-safety trash cans for every secretion and urine during the first 24 hours in recovery and in the ICU.

### Cardio-centric hemodynamic management improves spinal cord oxygenation and mitigates hemorrhage in acute spinal cord injury [^d88945c0]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Hemodynamic management with survival post-SCI in experiment 3

For experiment 3 we specifically developed the methodology to place a Swan-Ganz pulmonary artery catheter percutaneously, which allowed us to repeat thermodilution measures of cardiac output on both the injury and outcome days (i.e. 12 weeks post-SCI) within the same animals. Initially, Swan-Ganz catheters were placed into a jugular vein under ultrasound guidance, and then advanced to the pulmonary artery under fluoroscopic guidance. Placement was confirmed with the pressure waveform. Laminectomy and T2 SCI were thereafter performed identically to experiments 1 and 2. A total of n = 10 animals were randomized and counterbalanced to receive hemodynamic management with continuous infusions of DOB (2.5 μg kg −1 min −1, n = 4), NE (4.25 μg min −1, n = 3), or no treatment (CON, n = 3). Drug dosages were determined as the mean effective doses from DOB+ and NE animals in experiment 2. Hemodynamic management was administered from 30 min post-SCI until 6 h post-SCI, at which point the Swan-Ganz catheter was removed, and animals were recovered and housed for 12 weeks post-SCI.

At 12 weeks post-SCI, animals were anaesthetized and instrumented with a LV pressure-volume catheter, a Swan-Ganz catheter, an IVC occlusion catheter, and a femoral arterial MAP line (identical cardiovascular instrumentation to experiments 1 and 2). Once all anesthetics were maintained consistently at levels similar to the day of SCI for ≥ 1 h, LVpressure-volume (PV) and arterial pressure data were continually recorded over a 30-min period, with serial thermodilution measures of cardiac output and IVC occlusions for assessment of LV load-independent function. Animals were euthanized when data collection was complete.

### Pilot study: advanced haemodynamic monitoring after acute spinal cord injury-keep the pressure up? [^b8adf0a7]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we performed invasive haemodynamic monitoring in patients suffering from acute SCI using the thermodilution-based PiCCO™ system. To our knowledge, this is the first study on advanced haemodynamic monitoring in patients with SCI who are not typically treated with vasopressors, and the first study to present data that are not biased by septic or cardiogenic shock.

Few studies have examined advanced haemodynamic parameters in patients with acute SCI. In 1993, Levi et al. performed haemodynamic monitoring via a Swan-Ganz catheter in 50 patients with SCI to maintain a haemodynamic profile with adequate cardiac output. Similarly, Vale et al. maintained a mean arterial blood pressure above 85 mmHg in 77 patients with acute SCI and used a Swan-Ganz catheter to monitor the haemodynamic status. Both prospective studies aimed to show that maintaining a certain haemodynamic profile improved the neurological outcome of patients with acute SCI and ultimately led to the recommendation to keep the MAP > 85 mmHg for the first 7 days after acute SCI. However, data were collected only within the first week after injury, and most measurements were obtained under the influence of vasopressors. Furthermore, the MAP goal and the period of time for that goal were selected arbitrarily. Another study used impedance cardiography to assess the haemodynamic profiles in 9 patients with neurogenic shock after acute SCI, but only one measurement was obtained from each patient on admission, and the use of vasopressors was not reported. In 2019, Squair et al. monitored MAP and central spinal fluid pressure during the first week after injury and suggested that spinal cord perfusion pressure rather than MAP was an indicator of neurologic outcome. As in previous studies, the measurements were taken within the first week postinjury, and vasopressors were used to maintain the MAP goals.

### Right ventricular response to acute hypoxia among healthy humans [^e7c7df81]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

Pulmonary arterial (PA) pressures and right ventricular (RV) afterload increase in response to hypoxia. Limited data are available that describe RV adaptations to acute hypoxia and the associated increases in afterload, occurring in response to clinical scenarios such as infections, pulmonary embolism, and hypoxia associated with high-altitude exposure.

RV pressure-volume analysis by means of conductance catheterization is a gold-standard method of characterizing RV function using metrics of contractility, lusitropy, energetics, and ventricular-arterial coupling. The primary objective of this single-center prospective study (ID NCT 05272514) was to characterize RV performance in response to acute progressive hypoxia.

The results of this study have been previously reported in an unpublished abstract.

Healthy adults free of cardiovascular, hematologic, and pulmonary disease underwent hemodynamic assessment. Individuals residing at ⩾2,500 m (8,000 ft) for three or more consecutive nights within 30 days of testing were excluded. Written informed consent was obtained. The study was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and overseen by an independent data safety and monitoring board. Participants underwent baseline evaluation with Swan-Ganz catheterization. Thereafter, they were randomized 1:1 to undergo hypoxic testing with Swan-Ganz catheterization versus a conductance catheter inserted into the right ventricle. Oxygen saturation (Sa O 2) and blood pressure were monitored with a radial arterial catheter. Oxygen uptake was continuously recorded (Vyntus, Vyaire Medical) for calculation of direct Fick cardiac output. For participants randomized to testing with a conductance catheter, the Swan-Ganz catheter was replaced by a 7F high-fidelity conductance catheter (CD Leycom). Insertion and calibration were performed according to previous protocols. Single-beat estimation was used to determine end-systolic elastance, effective arterial elastance, and ventricular-arterial coupling. Participants were exposed to staged reductions in F O 2 at 0.21, 0.17, 0.15, and 0.12 every 8–10 minutes by means of an open circuit with Douglas bag reservoirs. Hemodynamic parameters were recorded in the final minute of each stage of hypoxia. Data are reported as mean ± SD or median (and interquartile range) unless otherwise specified.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline on vascular access for haemodialysis [^f4734ebe]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

A proportion of catheters may develop complications over time, of which the most common are dysfunction (poor flow) and infection. As with AV access, much of the literature on catheter complications is limited by small study populations and short term outcomes, leaving many knowledge gaps, so that an evidence-based consensus is not possible for all aspects of management. Since the optimal approach is not always clear, pragmatic shared decisions should be made, taking into account clinical risk, likely treatment outcome and patient preference.

Catheter dysfunction

Tunnelled dialysis catheter dysfunction is a common problem, usually defined as inability of the catheter to deliver a blood flow of at least 300 ml/min in adult patients. Dysfunction from the time of insertion is generally due to poor positioning or kinking (rare following fluoroscopic guided insertion) and usually identified and corrected soon after insertion, through manipulation or repositioning. A catheter which previously functioned well but then delivers poor flow is considered to have late dysfunction, and this is may be caused by thrombus or fibrin, either within the catheter lumen or around the tip, though the distinction is in most cases not important, and imaging is not necessary. Fibrin forms around the external surface of most catheters, like a sheath, sometimes extending beyond the catheter tip.

If flows become problematic during haemodialysis, then repositioning, saline flushes or reversing the catheter lumens may provide a temporary solution, allowing completion of the session. However, these solutions do not address the cause of poor flow and are rarely durable - further treatment options include thrombolytic agents and mechanical measures (removing fibrin, usually at the same time as replacing the catheter). Thrombolytic therapy is immediately available in the dialysis unit, and is usually attempted initially, as it is often able to restore function quickly allowing dialysis to continue without too much interruption.

### Pressure-guided positioning of bicaval dual-lumen catheters for venovenous extracorporeal gas exchange [^d37f28a5]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Bicaval dual-lumen catheters allow for single-site cannulation venovenous extracorporeal gas exchange and facilitate early mobilization of patients. Using these catheters blood is drained from the superior and inferior venae cavae, pumped through a respiratory membrane, and returned into the right atrium. The insertion of these catheters is challenging as their correct positioning is fundamental to reduce recirculation and avoid severe complications. We describe here a new technique for the positioning of bicaval dual-lumen catheters.

Materials and Methods

The right internal jugular vein was percutaneously cannulated in nine sheep. The distance between skin and tricuspid valve was measured from the point of pressure change in the waveform of a Swan-Ganz catheter being retracted from the right ventricle into the right atrium. The atrium-tricuspid valve-ventricle axis was determined by observing the fluctuations of the tip of the Swan-Ganz entering the ventricle during fluoroscopy. A bicaval dual-lumen catheter was placed on the basis of these evaluations and connected to an extracorporeal respiratory support system.

Results

The position of the catheter was verified at necropsy approximately 18 h after insertion. In all cases the catheter was correctly placed, with the central port situated in front of the tricuspid valve.

Conclusions

The described technique may help to position bicaval dual-lumen catheters for venovenous extracorporeal gas exchange without the use of transesophageal echocardiography or contrast media during fluoroscopy.

### Impact of noninvasive studies to distinguish volume overload from ARDS in acutely ill patients with pulmonary edema: analysis of the medical literature from 1966 to 1998 [^65b3c5b2]. Chest (2000). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To assess the impact of substituting noninvasive diagnostic studies for Swan-Ganz catheter (SGC) placement in the evaluation of acutely ill patients.

Design

Modified decision analysis.

Methods

Using published studies that define effectiveness of clinical examination, echocardiography, and SGC placement to diagnose pulmonary edema, an analysis of the impact of substituting three diagnostic approaches using (1) clinical assessment (CA), (2) M-mode two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (EC), or (3) CA then EC if necessary for SGC placement was considered.

Study Population

Patients with acute respiratory distress and radiographic findings of pulmonary edema, and ICU patients with hypotension and/or pulmonary edema without acute cardiac ischemia.

Interventions

Three approaches using noninvasive studies were substituted for placement of SGC in the initial evaluation of pulmonary edema.

Measurements and Results

The number of SGCs placed, the number of tests needed to diagnose (NTND) all cases of volume overload, and the total number of procedure-related adverse events were calculated for each diagnostic approach and compared to SGC placement. EC, and CA then EC approaches produced fewer procedure-related serious complications and deaths, compared to the SGC approach; however, these approaches also produced a higher NTND and total procedures performed than did the SGC or CA approaches. The CA approach led to reduced NTND and procedure-related adverse events.

Conclusions

Substituting noninvasive studies for SGC placement in the initial evaluation of acutely ill patients may slightly reduce procedure-related adverse events, but it may also increase the number of procedures performed. Studies of SGC use are warranted and need to include a clinical assessment control group and an analysis of resource utilization.

### Right ventricular dysfunction in lung disease / hypoxia-associated pulmonary hypertension [^825ca03c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This study had several limitations. First, RV function and RV–PA coupling indices were calculated using the single‐beat method with volume data from CMR and pressure waveforms from a Swan–Ganz catheter rather than the gold‐standard multiple‐beat method with pressure and conductance catheters. However, the accuracy of RV volume measurements using CMR and the reliability of the single‐beat method with a Swan–Ganz catheter are documented. Additionally, the less invasive nature of our chosen method enabled a larger patient cohort, which is a key strength. Second, the sample size was insufficient for detailed subgroup analyses. Disease pathology and its effects on RV function may, in fact, differ among subgroups within both PAH and G3PH. Additionally, the number of deaths observed during the study period was 24 in the group with PAH and 40 in the group with G3PH, which were not sufficiently large. Further validation with a larger sample size is required to analyze mortality. Third, the group with no PH included patients with comorbidities such as systemic sclerosis, which is known to affect RV morphology and function, thus limiting its suitability as a control. This study also did not include patients with interstitial lung disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease without PH, which would have been a more suitable comparator group. Finally, this was a single‐center retrospective study with a relatively small sample size, and PAH drug(s) were used at the discretion of the doctors in charge. Thus, only a pilot analysis of the efficacy and safety of PAH drugs was possible in this study. To address this, a multicenter prospective study is currently underwayto further investigate the presence and clinical significance of RV function and RV–PA coupling impairment in G3PH.

### The right methodology for long-term vascular access research: three burning questions [^6089b207]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2021). Medium credibility.

Over the last 20years, there has been a great proliferation of studies of different aspects of the long-term vascular access field. Despite the availability of such studies, methodological pitfalls surrounding long-term vascular access research are rarely mentioned. Methodological issues inherent to retrospective analyses make them very poor tools for providing generalizable results, as they often become estimates of local experiences rather than reflections of up-to-date practices. Second, despite being an often-ignored element when designing studies on catheter-related complications, a proper follow-up time definition and its length are crucial to limiting the impact of attrition bias on research results. Finally, meta-analyses constitute a powerful tool in modern evidence-based era, but several pitfalls can affect overall results. When designing a systematic review and meta-analytic process, study selection should always reflect the relevance of clinical questions and the capability to contextualize results in the modern and evidence-based vascular access era.

### 2024 AHA / ACC / ACS / ASNC / HRS / SCA / SCCT / SCMR / SVM guideline for perioperative cardiovascular management for noncardiac surgery: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^03b43559]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Mitral stenosis (MS) perioperative management — In patients with symptomatic severe MS or asymptomatic severe MS with elevated pulmonary pressures or new atrial fibrillation (AF), mitral valve (MV) intervention may reduce morbidity and mortality rates, and in patients with severe MS with an indication for valve intervention in whom intervention can be successfully performed, elevated-risk elective noncardiac surgery (NCS) should be delayed until MS has been addressed. There may be lower-risk surgeries where clinicians may favor MV intervention before elective NCS, especially if percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy could be performed without delaying surgery, and the decision to intervene before elective NCS should be contextualized according to the proposed MV intervention (percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy versus a surgical approach) and the risk of the NCS. Patients with MS are at higher risk of pulmonary edema, hypotension, and arrhythmia; pulmonary hypertension (PH) has been associated with adverse perioperative events, and changes in pulmonary hemodynamics may increase cardiovascular risk in patients with MS, so perioperative conditions (eg, hypoxia, hypercapnia/hypercarbia) that could worsen PH should be avoided. Longer durations of observation in the postanesthesia/recovery care unit may allow for earlier detection and intervention of complications, and invasive monitoring could include Swan-Ganz catheters, arterial lines, and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), but the intensity and level of monitoring should be commensurate to the risk of surgery and anesthesia technique. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that heart rate control improves patient symptoms and exercise duration, there have been no RCTs examining the benefit of preoperative heart rate control in patients with MS, and heart rate–controlling medications may be considered for procedures where elevated heart rates or tachycardia are anticipated.

### Removal of knotted intravascular devices. case report and review of the literature [^b2faa810]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

to review published reports on knotted intravascular devices/catheters.

Method

report of two cases and systematic review of the literature.

Results

a total of 113 reported cases of knotted intravascular devices/catheters were located. Pulmonary artery catheters (Swan-Ganz) were responsible for more than two thirds of the total reported intravascular knots. In 62% (70/113) of the cases withdrawal of the knotted catheters was achieved successfully with different interventional radiological techniques, avoiding the need for surgical exploration. In 32% (36/113) of the patients surgical removal was favoured. Capture with one of the interventional techniques and pulling down the knot into an easily accessible vein to be removed through an open venotomy, was the most common surgical procedure. However, in five cases, an open cardiotomy was required. In seven cases the patient's condition was critical and precluded any surgical procedure, so the knotted catheter was left in situ. The mortality of this event was 8% (9/113).

Conclusions

interventional radiological techniques have largely replaced open surgical removal. Knotted catheters may need to be surgically removed when (a) the knot is large in size with many loops, or (b) intracardiac fixing of the knot is encountered.

### Scar formation in the carotid sheath identified during carotid endarterectomy in patients with previous cardiac surgery: significance of history of intraoperative swan-ganz catheter insertion. clinical article [^73c50bb2]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2010). Low credibility.

Object

Scar formation in the carotid sheath is often identified during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with previous cardiac surgery, and dissection of the carotid sheath and exposure of the carotid arteries in such patients are difficult. The purpose of the present study was to investigate factors related to scar formation identified during CEA in patients with previous cardiac surgery.

Methods

Twenty-three patients with internal carotid artery stenosis (≥ 70%) and previous cardiac surgery underwent CEA. A patient was prospectively defined as having scar formation during CEA when scissors were required throughout dissection of the carotid sheath and exposure of the carotid arteries.

Results

Scar formation was identified during dissection of the carotid sheath in 7 patients (30.4%). In all 7 patients, the side of CEA was identical to the side on which the Swan-Ganz catheter was inserted during cardiac surgery, and the incidence of previous ipsilateral Swan-Ganz catheter insertion was significantly higher in patients with the scar formation (100%) than in those without (31.3%). Seven (58.3%) of 12 patients with a history of ipsilateral Swan-Ganz catheter insertion had scar formation. Two of the 7 patients with scar formation experienced complications after CEA, including one patient with hemiparesis due to artery-to-artery embolism during surgery, and another patient with transient vocal cord paralysis.

Conclusions

A history of Swan-Ganz catheter insertion during previous cardiac surgery is associated with the presence of scar tissue in the ipsilateral carotid sheath and a higher risk of complications during CEA.

### Cardio-centric hemodynamic management improves spinal cord oxygenation and mitigates hemorrhage in acute spinal cord injury [^86a8479a]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Instrumentation and experimental timeline in experiments 1 and 2

All animals were instrumented similarly for cardiovascular and spinal cord measurements, with bilateral pressure catheters in the femoral arteries, a PV admittance catheter placed in the LV, a Swan-Ganz thermodilution catheter placed in the pulmonary artery and an IVC occlusion catheter advanced via the right femoral vein. The PV and Swan-Ganz catheters were advanced under fluoroscopic guidance. Placement was confirmed via the emergence of a typical pressure–volume loop and typical pulmonary artery pressure waveforms. A laminectomy was then performed to expose the spinal cord from the C8-T4 level, and custom-designed sensors for spinal cord blood flow, oxygenation, pressure, and microdialysis were placed in the spinal cord parenchyma at 1.2 cm and 3.2 cm caudal to the impactor centre. Once drug levels and sensors had stabilized (~2–3 h after laminectomy), baseline data for cardiac function, hemodynamics and spinal cord indices were obtained over a 30-min period. Following baseline data collection, animals received a T2 weight-drop (50 g) contusion injury with 2 h of spinal cord compression (additional 100 g, 150 g total). Cardiac, hemodynamic and spinal cord indices were continuously recorded up to 4 h post-SCI, at which point animals were euthanized and spinal cord tissue was immediately harvested.

Effect of SCI on contractile function in experiment 1

In n = 8 animals, contractile function was assessed with transient IVC occlusions for characterization of load-independent systolic function, including E es, preload-recruitable stroke work (PRSW) and the maximal rate of pressure generation for a given end-diastolic volume (dp/dt max -EDV), at baseline once a stable plane of anaesthesia was reached prior to SCI, and hourly post-SCI. Contractile reserve was assessed using a constant-rate infusion of DOB (10 μg kg −1 min −1) via an infusate port in the Swan-Ganz catheter for 10 min. This dosage has been previously utilized to challenge LV load-dependentand load-independent contractile function in pigs. Within the final 2 min of DOB infusion, LV E es was assessed with transient IVC occlusions. A minimum of 30 min recovery (≥ 5 half-lives of DOB) was provided before 'baseline' measurements began pre-SCI, and again before euthanasia and tissue collection at the end of the experiments.

### SAGES peritoneal dialysis access guideline update 2023 [^41183f04]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

Decision criteria and additional considerations for AL PD catheter placement — the panel noted potential issues with access to requisite training and equipment to perform laparoscopic surgery; however, with the widespread adoption of laparoscopy, the equipment required for AL placement should hopefully be easily accessible to most surgeons. With regards to appropriate training, it will be important to both present and publish educational videos of the technique and to train new generations of surgeons in AL placement. Another consideration is that open insertion can be performed under local anesthesia and sedation while AL requires general anesthesia and CO2 insufflation which carries a higher risk of cardiopulmonary complications.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline on vascular access for haemodialysis [^18f86232]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

This guideline is written primarily for doctors and nurses working in dialysis centres and related areas of medicine in the UK, and is an update of a previous version written in 2015. It aims to provide guidance on how to provide vascular access care for patients approaching and undergoing haemodialysis, and provides a standard of care which centres should in general aim to achieve. We would not advise patients to interpret the guideline as a rulebook, but perhaps to answer the question: "What does good quality vascular access care look like?". The guideline is split into sections: each begins with a few statements which are graded by strength (1 is a firm recommendation, 2 is more like a sensible suggestion), and the type of research available to back up the statement, ranging from A (good quality trials so we are pretty sure this is right) to D (more like the opinion of experts than known for sure). After the statements there is a short summary explaining why we think this, often including a discussion of some of the most helpful research. There is then a list of the most important medical articles so that you can read further if you want to - most of this is freely available online, at least in summary form. A few notes on the individual sections: 1. This section covers key concepts relevant to vascular access and focusses on access type selection, including a historical introduction and review of the key literature informing our understanding. This explains why we are moving away from the outdated advice in previous guidelines (e.g. that 'all patients should dialyse with a fistula as first choice') towards a process which treats dialysis access selection as a choice, respecting patient individuality, aiming to provide high quality assessment and advice, so that patients are supported in making informed decisions. The basic concept of the fistula as optimal access is highlighted and remains valid, but it is placed within a more modern concept of care, in which the patient is at the centre of the decision process. 2. This section addresses the initial planning of access, from education and vein preservation, through to the timing of assessment and access formation, emphasising in particular the need to plan ahead. 3. This section deals with the formation and routine care of AV access (fistulas and grafts), covering access type and configuration, surgical and anaesthetic technique, the maturation period (before a fistula is ready to be used), and initiation and maintenance of optimal cannulation (needling). 4. This section deals with some of the complications of AV access. Research in this area is ongoing and not yet sufficient to give clear guidance, so we emphasise again the importance of involving patients in treatment decisions. 5. This section deals with the placement and routine care of catheter access (lines), covering location, technique, anticoagulant locks, and regular exit site disinfection and dressings. 6. This section deals with catheter complications, like infection and poor flow, which are sometimes life-threatening, and for which the catheter sometimes needs to be changed. 7. This section deals with central venous stenosis (narrowing of veins deep in the chest) which is mostly a long term complication of catheters, but which is relevant to the planning of all types of access. We thought this important condition deserved its own section. Most of the concepts relevant to adult patients apply equally to children and adolescents, so there is no separate Paediatric section, and unless stated, guidance applies to children as well as adults. Where they do exist, differences are highlighted within the statements and rationale, sometimes with separate paragraphs or subheadings. Access for peritoneal dialysis is not included in this guideline since it is covered elsewhere, and the guideline is not exhaustive, with several aspects not covered, though they may be addressed in future versions. The guideline's principle focus is areas of mainstream practice for which there is variation across different UK centres, in general not covering newly developed or rarely practiced techniques, and it is not intended to replace handbooks and review articles. The guideline's main anticipated audience is NHS professionals caring for patients who are receiving or planning haemodialysis, but it is written to be as accessible as possible to patients and carers also. There are appendices at the end which explain the meaning of words and concepts which are used throughout the guideline, especially the medical and statistical terminology. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.

Tunneled cuffed venous catheters — advantages relative to other access types — are described as universally applicable, insertable into multiple sites relatively easily, requiring no maturation time so they can be used immediately, and not requiring skin puncture for repeated vascular access for HD; they also do not have short-term hemodynamic consequences (e.g., changes in cardiac output or myocardial load), have lower initial and replacement costs, can provide access during a period of months permitting fistula maturation in patients who require immediate HD, and facilitate correcting thrombotic complications.

### Fluid mechanics and clinical success of central venous catheters for dialysis – answers to simple but persisting problems [^7de2cd1d]. Seminars in Dialysis (2007). Low credibility.

Over 60% of patients initiating chronic hemodialysis in the United States have a chronic central venous catheter (CVC) as their first blood access device. Although it would be better if these patients started dialysis with fistulas, the CVC is used because it is a reliable and relatively safe method for obtaining blood access over a period of months. Drawing blood from a vein at 300–400 ml/minute is a relatively delicate and somewhat unpredictable process, and there is always a tendency for the vein wall to draw over the arterial tip and obstruct flow. Several methods have been employed to minimize this problem and maximize blood flow, and differing catheter designs have resulted. With all of the different catheter designs now on the market, it is natural to ask what is the logic of different designs. Moreover, in the absence of many direct comparative studies it is natural to ask whether one design is really better than another. There is some misinformation regarding catheter design and function. The following is a list of 10 frequently asked questions In this review, the hydraulic features of CVC are discussed and explained, and logical answers are provided for the following questions: 1. Why do "D" catheters flow better than concentric or side by side catheters? 2. Why are all catheters about the same diameter? Does making them bigger really decrease the resistance to flow? 3. Why might a split tip catheter flow better than a solid body catheter? 4. What happens to injections of lock solution at catheter volume? 5. What's better-numerous side holes or none? 6. Why does blood rise into some internal jugular catheters over time, displacing the lock solution? 7. How can a little kink (or stenosis) decrease flow so much? 8. Where should the tips be placed-superior vena cava or right atrium? 9. Which is really better, splitsheath or over-the-wire placement? 10. Which dialysis access has a lower complication rate — CVC or arteriovenous (AV) graft? There remain important problems with CVC for dialysis. With a few more improvements, chronic CVC for dialysis could become a painless, effective and safe long-term access for the majority of dialysis patients and acceptable as an alternative to AV grafts.

### How to measure blood pressure using an arterial catheter: a systematic 5-step approach [^caa4563d]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Arterial blood pressure (BP) is a fundamental cardiovascular variable, is routinely measured in perioperative and intensive care medicine, and has a significant impact on patient management. The clinical reference method for BP monitoring in high-risk surgical patients and critically ill patients is continuous invasive BP measurement using an arterial catheter. A key prerequisite for correct invasive BP monitoring using an arterial catheter is an in-depth understanding of the measurement principle, of BP waveform quality criteria, and of common pitfalls that can falsify BP readings. Here, we describe how to place an arterial catheter, correctly measure BP, and identify and solve common pitfalls. We focus on 5 important steps, namely (1) how to choose the catheter insertion site, (2) how to choose the type of arterial catheter, (3) how to place the arterial catheter, (4) how to level and zero the transducer, and (5) how to check the quality of the BP waveform.

### Maternal cardiovascular hemodynamics in normotensive versus preeclamptic pregnancies: a prospective longitudinal study using a noninvasive cardiac system (NICaS ™) [^b6b1608a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Preeclampsia is among the most common medical complications of pregnancy, with an incidence of 4.6% of pregnancies worldwide and is defined as the onset of hypertension with either proteinuria or end-organ dysfunction or both at the second half of pregnancy in a previously normotensive woman. The severe form of the disease includes severe hypertension and signs or symptoms of end-organ injury. Though most affected pregnancies deliver at term, with good outcomes, they carry increased risk for maternal and fetal complications.

A major disagreement exists in the literature regarding the hemodynamics of preeclampsia, attributed mainly to variances in the definition and severity of the disease and the techniques used to quantity cardiac output (CO) and blood pressure (BP).

Until the early 1970s, the techniques for measuring cardiac hemodynamics were mostly based upon invasive methods, such as the Swan-Ganz catheter. However, the clinical value of invasive hemodynamic monitoring in preeclampsia is debatable. Moreover, right heart catheterization with the Swan-Ganz catheter carries significant risks, including arrhythmias, thrombosis and death. The emergence of noninvasive techniques has made it feasible to perform serial measurements of maternal hemodynamics throughout pregnancy. The most widely used techniques include thoracic impedance cardiography (TIC) and Doppler echocardiography, however, they both have important limitations. Doppler echocardiography requires expensive equipment and intensive training of operators. TIC is simpler to use and inexpensive, however the signals used to estimate the stroke volume (SV) are taken from the thoracic area and are exposed to competing signals from the lungs, vena cava and movement of the heart. As a result, the accuracy and reproducibility are limited.

In 2010, a noninvasive cardiac system (NICaS™, NI Medical, Petach Tikva, Israel) for determining CO first became available for clinical use. The method utilizes regional impedance cardiography (RIC) by measuring noninvasively the impedance signal in the periphery. The new approach was validated by several studies, which found that NICaS™ outperformed any other impedance cardiographic technology and was twice as accurate as TIC.

Here, we compare maternal cardiac functional parameters in normotensive versus preeclamptic women undergoing cesarean section (CS) under spinal anesthesia. Establishing the typical range of the parameters associated with preeclampsia would allow the clinician to assess the level of deviation from expected cardiac performance and help to shed light upon the optimal clinical management of individual pathological situations.

### Mild pulmonary hemodynamic alterations in patients with systemic sclerosis: relevance of the new 2022 ESC / ERS definition of pulmonary hypertension and impact on mortality [^dd103e8f]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

RHC were performed by pulmonary hypertension specialist practitioners using a 6-French Swan-Ganz catheter in non-acute clinical conditions. The catheter was placed under fluoroscopic guidance from a right antebrachial vein or a right femoral vein as needed. The correct position of the catheter was confirmed by fluoroscopy and by the presence of characteristic pressure waveforms. The "zero-ing" transducer to atmospheric pressure was at the level of the mid-axillary line. Right atrial pressure (RAP), mPAP and PAWP were determined electronically by the mean of several beats during quiet breathing. mPAP was determined by the mean of the area under pressure curves. Cardiac Output (CO) was measured by the thermodilution technique (mean of 3–6 measures with exclusion of measurements that exceed 10% of the mean); and Cardiac Index (CI) calculated by the ratio of CO to body surface area. Mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO 2) was measured from blood drawn from the pulmonary artery. PVR were then calculated (PVR = [(mPAP − PAWP)/CO]). In case of mPAP > 20 mmHg and a PAWP more than 12 mmHg (13–15 mmHg), suggesting a possible post-capillary pulmonary hypertension, a fluid challenge (500 mL of saline solution over 5 min) was performed as proposed in guidelines.

The initial (i.e. within the first 4 months of baseline visit) and follow-up treatment strategies were defined according to the number of PAH medications prescribed (endothelin receptor antagonist, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, and prostacyclin analogue). Patients whose death was not registered were censored at the time of last clinical contact.

### The potential of arterial pulse wave analysis in burn resuscitation: a pilot in vivo study [^b4d0096a]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

While urinary output (UOP) remains the primary endpoint for titration of intravenous fluid resuscitation, it is an insufficient indicator of fluid responsiveness. Although advanced hemodynamic monitoring (including arterial pulse wave analysis [PWA]) is of recent interest, the validity of PWA-derived indices in burn resuscitation extremes has not been established. The goal of this paper is to test the hypothesis that PWA-derived cardiac output (CO) and stroke volume (SV) indices as well as pulse pressure variation (PPV) and systolic pressure variation (SPV) can play a complementary role to UOP in burn resuscitation. Swine were instrumented with a Swan-Ganz catheter for reference CO and underwent a 40% TBSA burns with varying resuscitation paradigms, and were monitored for 24 hours in an ICU setting under mechanical ventilation. The longitudinal changes in PWA-derived indices were investigated, and resuscitation adequacy was compared as determined by UOP vs PWA indices. The results indicated that PWA-derived indices exhibited trends consistent with reference CO and SV measurements: CO and SV indices were proportional to reference CO and SV, respectively (CO: postcalibration limits of agreement [LoA] = ± 24.7 [ml/min/kg], SV: postcalibration LoA = ± 0.30 [ml/kg]) while PPV and SPV were inversely proportional to reference SV (PPV: postcalibration LoA = ± 0.32 [ml/kg], SPV: postcalibration LoA = ± 0.31 [ml/kg]). The results also indicated that PWA-derived indices exhibited notable discrepancies from UOP in determining adequate burn resuscitation. Hence, it was concluded that the PWA-derived indices may have complementary value to UOP in assessing and guiding burn resuscitation.

### Comparison between cardiac output measured by the pulmonary arterial thermodilution technique and that measured by the femoral arterial thermodilution technique in a pediatric animal model [^3aea056d]. Pediatric Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

This study compares the correlation between two methods for the determination of cardiac output-the pulmonary arterial thermodilution technique using the Swan-Ganz catheter and the femoral arterial thermodilution technique using a pulse contour analysis computer (PiCCO) catheter. We performed a prospective animal study using 16 immature Maryland pigs weighing 9 to 16 kg. A 5.5- or 7.5-Fr Swan-Ganz catheter was introduced into the femoral or jugular vein, and a 4- or 5-Fr arterial PiCCO catheter was introduced into the femoral artery. In each animal, we made measurements of cardiac output at 30-minute intervals, simultaneously by pulmonary arterial thermodilution and femoral arterial thermodilution, before, during, and after hemodiafiltration carried out via different venous catheters, recording a total of 78 measurements. The mean Swan-Ganz cardiac output was 2.22 ± 0.94 L/min, and mean PiCCO cardiac output was 1.94 ± 0.80 L/min (no significant difference). The mean difference (bias) of differences (limits of agreement) was 0.2812. The differences between the methods increased with higher cardiac output, but the percentage differences in relation to cardiac output remained stable. Good correlation was found between the two methods: single-measure intraclass correlation was 0.8892 (95% confidence interval, 0.54–0.95). There were no differences between the 5.5- and 7.5-FR Swan-Ganz catheters or between the 4- and 5-Fr PiCCO catheters. Femoral arterial thermodilution cardiac output measurements correlated well with pulmonary arterial thermodilution cardiac output measurements in a pediatric animal model.

Long-term cardiovascular outcomes in animals with T2 SCI (12-week survival).

a Animals were randomized to receive no treatment (control, CON; n = 3), dobutamine (DOB, n = 4), or norepinephrine (NE, n = 3) treatment. Prior to injury, animals were instrumented with a Swan-Ganz catheter for thermodilution measures of cardiac output (Q TD). Animals received a T2 SCI with hemodynamic management starting at 30 mins post-SCI and continued until 6 h post-SCI, at which point the Swan-Ganz catheter was removed. Animals were recovered and survived for 12 weeks. At study endpoint, animals were fully instrumented for cardiovascular assessments as in experiments 1 and 2. b All bar plots represent means, and symbols represent data from individual animals at 12 weeks post-SCI. At 12 weeks post-SCI, Q TD appears to be lowered in CON (circles) and animals treated with NE (triangles), but is preserved in DOB-treated animals (squares). c Representative left ventricular (LV) pressure–volume loops during IVC occlusions indicate superior LV end-systolic elastance (E es) in DOB animals compared to CON and NE. d – f Following 12 weeks survival, mean arterial pressure (MAP) is low in animals that received no treatment (CON), but is normal in DOB-treated animals. NE animals, however, exhibit hypertension as seen with elevated MAP, total peripheral resistance (TPR), and augmented arterial elastance (E a) which collectively indicate elevated cardiac afterload in those animals. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

One of the NE-treated animals suffered pulmonary complications and was euthanized 2 days post-SCI. At 12 weeks post-SCI, Q TD was preserved in DOB-treated animals but otherwise appeared to be lowered in both CON and NE animals (Fig. 6b). Measures during IVC occlusions indicated that LV load-independent contractility (E es) was lower in both CON and NE groups as compared to DOB-treated animals (Fig. 6c). Animals that received NE, however, exhibited notable hypertension as indicated by uncharacteristically high MAP (Fig. 6d), total peripheral resistance (TPR, Fig. 6e) and arterial elastance (E a, Fig. 6f).

Postoperative management

Postoperative management included continuous ECG and invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring for systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and MAP. A Swan-Ganz catheter was used for detailed hemodynamic measurements, including central venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PA), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), cardiac output (CO) and cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), and pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI). Detailed data were obtained every 6 h (Table 2). Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) with left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment was performed daily. Within the first 48 h, all patients received mycophenolate mofetil, corticosteroids, and anti-thymocyte globulin for immunosuppression induction. Calcineurin inhibitors were added in further treatment schemes. Continuous infusion of inotropic or vasoactive agents was used when necessary with the lowest effective dose and data were collected daily (Table 2). The inotrope score was established daily and calculations were made in accordance with the ISHLT consensus on PGD.
