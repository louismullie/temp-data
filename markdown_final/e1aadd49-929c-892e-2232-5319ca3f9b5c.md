## Question

An 83-year-old woman with fever, malaise, and cough for the past 24 hours is brought to the emergency department. She lives in an assisted living facility, and several of her neighbors have had similar symptoms. She has a past medical history of hypertension treated with lisinopril. Her temperature is 38.9°C (102.2°F), pulse is 105/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 112/62 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 88%. Her leukocyte count is 10,500/mm3, and serum creatinine is 0.9 mg/dL. An X-ray of the chest shows bilateral reticulonodular opacities in the lower lobes. Serum procalcitonin level is 0.06 µg/L (N < 0.06 µg/L). What mechanism of action is the appropriate next step to manage her condition?
A. Inhibition of DNA polymerase
B. Inhibition of neuraminidase
C. Inhibition of nucleoside reverse transcriptase
D. Inhibition of protease

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antiviral mechanism of action is the appropriate next step to manage an 83-year-old woman with suspected influenza pneumonia, given her clinical presentation and a procalcitonin level of 0.06 µg/L. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely diagnosis and whether this is viral versus bacterial pneumonia. Then, I should verify how procalcitonin informs the decision to start antibiotics versus antivirals. Next, I will review which antiviral class is indicated for influenza and its mechanism. Finally, I will match the mechanism to the correct option and consider alternatives if influenza is unlikely or contraindicated.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome. Fever, cough, malaise, hypoxemia, and bilateral reticulonodular opacities in the setting of a congregate care outbreak strongly suggest influenza pneumonia in an older adult, and the normal procalcitonin supports a viral etiology rather than bacterial coinfection, although I should not jump to conclusions without considering atypicals or COVID-19 given the season and epidemiology [^69967f97] [^604a8577].

> Wait, let me verify the role of procalcitonin here. A procalcitonin of 0.06 µg/L is within the normal range and argues against a bacterial process; in respiratory infections, low PCT levels support withholding antibiotics and favor viral management, whereas higher PCT levels would push toward bacterial coverage, so I should avoid reflex antibiotics in this case unless new evidence emerges [^69967f97] [^957d0821] [^6643ccce].

> I need to check the antiviral indication and timing. For suspected influenza in a high-risk patient, empiric neuraminidase inhibitor therapy is indicated as early as possible, ideally within 48 hours of symptom onset, because it reduces complications and mortality in older adults; if presentation is beyond 48 hours but illness is severe or progressive, treatment can still be considered, so I should not delay unnecessarily [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify the mechanism. Neuraminidase inhibitors like oseltamivir block viral neuraminidase, preventing release of new virions from infected cells and limiting spread; this matches option B, inhibition of neuraminidase, which is the correct mechanism for influenza antivirals in this scenario [^notfound].

> Let me consider the distractors to ensure I'm not missing anything. Inhibition of DNA polymerase would target herpesviruses or other DNA viruses, not influenza; nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibition is for retroviruses like HIV; and protease inhibition is used for HIV and SARS-CoV-2, not influenza, so those options do not fit the pathophysiology here [^notfound].

> But wait, what if this is COVID-19 rather than influenza. I should double-check the epidemiology and consider testing, but the question is framed around influenza mechanisms; if COVID-19 were confirmed, management would pivot to COVID-19–directed therapy rather than neuraminidase inhibition, so I will keep the answer anchored to influenza given the stem and the low PCT supporting a viral process [^604a8577].

> Final answer: B. Inhibition of neuraminidase, because the presentation is most consistent with influenza pneumonia, the normal procalcitonin supports a viral etiology and argues against routine antibiotics, and early neuraminidase inhibitor therapy is indicated for high-risk patients with suspected influenza [^69967f97] [^957d0821].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **influenza pneumonia** given the clinical picture, bilateral reticulonodular opacities, and low procalcitonin [^notfound]. The appropriate next step is to start **oseltamivir**, a neuraminidase inhibitor [^notfound], which reduces viral replication and complications in influenza. The correct mechanism is **B. Inhibition of neuraminidase**.

---

## Clinical reasoning and diagnosis

- **Clinical presentation**: Fever, cough, malaise, and hypoxemia in an elderly resident of an assisted living facility with a cluster of similar cases strongly suggest influenza pneumonia [^notfound].

- **Radiographic findings**: Bilateral reticulonodular opacities are consistent with interstitial pneumonia, commonly seen in influenza [^notfound].

- **Laboratory findings**: Normal procalcitonin (< 0.06 µg/L) supports a viral etiology rather than bacterial infection [^69967f97].

---

## Mechanism of action of oseltamivir

Oseltamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor that **blocks the neuraminidase enzyme** on the influenza virus surface, preventing cleavage of sialic acid residues and release of new virions. This inhibits viral spread and reduces viral load, which can lessen illness severity and complications, especially when started within 48 hours of symptom onset [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and evidence

Current guidelines recommend **early neuraminidase inhibitor therapy** for suspected or confirmed influenza in high-risk patients, including older adults and those with severe disease or hypoxemia. Early treatment reduces complications, hospitalizations, and mortality [^notfound].

---

## Alternative antiviral mechanisms

- **Inhibition of DNA polymerase**: Used for herpesviruses (e.g. acyclovir), not influenza.

- **Inhibition of nucleoside reverse transcriptase**: Used for retroviruses (e.g. HIV), not influenza.

- **Inhibition of protease**: Used for HIV and SARS-CoV-2, not influenza.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The appropriate next step is to initiate **oseltamivir**, a neuraminidase inhibitor, to treat suspected influenza pneumonia. The correct mechanism of action is **B. Inhibition of neuraminidase**.

### Procalcitonin is useful for evaluating patients with ambiguous presentation and for early discontinuation of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia [^95f6b452]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

The updated American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) conclude that procalcitonin (PCT) is not recommended to determine the need for initial antibacterial therapy in patients with clinically suspected and radiographically confirmed CAP. It seems rational that in a patient with a high pretest probability for pneumonia, any biomarker (including PCT) that is not 100% accurate should not have a strong influence on treatment decisions. The advantage of using PCT for the management of patients with CAP, however, has been demonstrated for patients in whom a CAP diagnosis is unclear (e.g. patients with no infiltrate in chest X-ray) and for monitoring patients with CAP to decide whether to stop treatment early. Most trials that evaluated PCT for the management of CAP did not rely on the initial PCT level and instead focused on the kinetics of this blood marker to indicate that antibiotic treatment should be stopped early. The initial PCT level was found to be helpful in patients with a bronchitis-like illness and possible CAP but an ambiguous clinical presentation. A recent meta-analysis of individual patient data that focused specifically on patients with respiratory infection and CAP who had participated in randomized trials showed that PCT is highly effective in reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment. Specifically, the analysis included 6,708 patients from 26 eligible trials in 12 countries and found a 2.4-day reduction in antibiotic exposure (5.7 vs. 8.1 d [95% confidence interval (CI), –2.71 to –2.15]; P < 0.0001) and a reduction in antibiotic-related side effects (16% vs. 22%, adjusted odds ratio, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.57 to 0.82]; P < 0.0001). Importantly, when PCT was used to guide discontinuation of treatment, patients had significantly improved clinical outcomes (odds ratio for mortality, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.70–0.99]; P = 0.037).

### Procalcitonin testing to guide antibiotic therapy in acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections [^6643ccce]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Is the use of procalcitonin for guiding antibiotic decisions in patients with acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections associated with improved clinical outcomes compared with usual care?

Bottom Line

Among patients with varying types and severity of acute respiratory infection, using procalcitonin to guide decisions about antibiotics is associated with lower rates of antibiotic exposure, antibiotic-related adverse effects, and mortality.

### Procalcitonin and other markers of infection. what should be their role in clinical practice? [^7720287d]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Clinicians are always faced with a decision when confronted with a febrile patient; they must decide between what is an infectious condition and what is not, and between what merits hospital observation, what requires empirical antibiotic treatment and what needs outpatient follow-up. In this respect, judgement based on medical history and physical examination outweigh the predictive value of various laboratory markers of infection, as the latter generally reflect a nonspecific reaction of the host to widely different infectious and inflammatory stimuli. In the evaluation of specific subgroups of patients, e.g. those in the intensive care unit, laboratory tests should also preferably form a continuum with medical history and physical examination, aimed at clarifying host condition, the setting and the source of a possible infection.

### Procalcitonin for triage of patients with respiratory tract symptoms: a case study in the trial design process for approval of a new diagnostic test for lower respiratory tract infections [^5207034c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Symptoms of cough, fever, chest pain, and shortness of breath are common reasons that patients seek medical care, and they can be due to a variety of medical conditions, including lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Only a small proportion of these patients will actually have a bacterial etiology, but many will receive antibiotic treatment because physicians cannot readily determine the etiology at the time of presentation. Current diagnostic methodologies are not sensitive or specific enough to reliably distinguish bacterial from viral or noninfectious etiologies. Procalcitonin (PCT) is a marker of host response. PCT serum levels are elevated in patients with bacterial infection, compared with levels in those with viral infections or other inflammatory pulmonary conditions. Studies have suggested that the determination of PCT levels can identify a subset of patients with LRTI symptoms who can safely avoid antibiotic treatment. As with any new test, clinical trials are necessary to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the test to obtain U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance. However, in the absence of standard reference methods for comparison that are reliably sensitive and specific, meeting the regulatory requirements for proof of safety and efficacy is a major challenge. Additional challenges include the choice of study design, the definition and determination of end points, and the justification of statistical analysis.

### Clinical outcomes associated with procalcitonin algorithms to guide antibiotic therapy in respiratory tract infections [^e9152902]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

In patients with respiratory tract infection, is measurement of procalcitonin to guide antibiotic prescriptions associated with reduced antibiotic exposure without increases in all-cause mortality or treatment failure?

Bottom Line

The measurement of procalcitonin to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with respiratory tract infections of varying severity is associated with lower antibiotic exposure without increasing all-cause mortality or treatment failure.

### Role of procalcitonin in managing adult patients with respiratory tract infections [^b3950817]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Respiratory infections remain the most common reason why patients seek medical care in ambulatory and hospital settings, and they are the most frequent precursor of sepsis. In light of the limitations of clinical signs and symptoms and traditional microbiologic diagnostics for respiratory infections, blood biomarkers that correlate with the presence and extent of bacterial infections may provide additional useful information to improve diagnostic and prognostic efforts and help with therapeutic decisions in individual patients. A growing body of evidence supports the use of procalcitonin (PCT) to differentiate bacterial from viral respiratory diagnoses, to help risk stratify patients, and to guide antibiotic therapy decisions about initial need for, and optimal duration of, therapy. Although still relatively new on the clinical frontier, a series of randomized controlled trials have evaluated PCT protocols for antibiotic-related decision making and have included patients from different clinical settings and with different severities of respiratory infection. In these trials, initial PCT levels were effective in guiding decisions about the initiation of antibiotic therapy in lower-acuity patients, and subsequent measurements were effective for guiding duration of therapy in higher-acuity patients, without apparent harmful effects. Recent European respiratory infection guidelines now also recognize this concept. As with any other laboratory test, PCT should not be used on a stand-alone basis. Rather, it must be integrated into clinical protocols, together with clinical, microbiologic data and with results from clinical risk scores. The aim of this review is to summarize recent evidence about the usefulness of PCT in patients with lower respiratory tract infections and to discuss the potential benefits and limitations of this marker when used for clinical decision making.

### Procalcitonin-guided diagnosis and antibiotic stewardship revisited [^09ef438b]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Infections of the respiratory tract

Infections of the respiratory tract, including bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and acute exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), are the most important drivers for antibiotic (over-) treatment and thereby contribute to the increasing rate of antibiotic multi-resistance. The diagnosis of respiratory infections relies mainly on clinical criteria (e.g. cough, dyspnea, fever) and chest radiography to document infiltration of the lung. Identification of the pathogen by culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods has low sensitivity, and thus may not rule out bacterial infection. For some types of infections, such as Legionella, clinical scores can help to assess the risk of infection. Several observational studies as well as interventional trials have established the usefulness of PCT in patients with respiratory infections.

A 2012 Cochrane meta-analysis based on individual patient data from 14 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focused on effects of PCT in patients with respiratory infections. The studies had somewhat similar PCT protocols with recommendations for or against initiation or continuation of antibiotic therapy based on initial PCT levels, PCT kinetics over time (i.e. 80% PCT decrease from peak), or both, in combination with the clinical presentation and resolution of illness (Figs. 2 and 3). The cut-offs were adapted to the clinical setting and the acuity of presentation, with cut-offs of 0.25 (0.1) ng/ml in respiratory infections and 0.5 ng/ml in sepsis. The meta-analysis found a strong reduction in the initial use of antibiotics, by around 60–70%, for low-severity respiratory infection (i.e. bronchitis, upper respiratory infections, AECOPD). In cases of higher-severity respiratory infection (i.e. pneumonia), monitoring of PCT resulted in earlier cessation of antibiotic treatment with a relative reduction in the duration of antibiotic treatment of around 40% for pneumonia and around 25% in the critical care of patients with sepsis caused by lung infections. Based on these studies, recent respiratory infection guidelines state that "… biomarkers can guide treatment duration by the application of predefined stopping rules for antibiotics. It has been shown that such rules work even in most severe cases, including pneumonia with septic shock… ", thereby emphasizing the concept of using a biomarker to guide the duration of antibiotic treatment.

### Irinotecan hydrochloride (Camptosar) [^8c631ed3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6	Pulmonary Toxicity

Interstitial Pulmonary Disease (IPD)-like events, including fatalities, have occurred in patients receiving irinotecan (in combination and as monotherapy). Risk factors include pre-existing lung disease, use of pneumotoxic drugs, radiation therapy, and colony stimulating factors. Patients with risk factors should be closely monitored for respiratory symptoms before and during CAMPTOSAR therapy. In Japanese studies, a reticulonodular pattern on chest x-ray was observed in a small percentage of patients. New or progressive, dyspnea, cough, and fever should prompt interruption of chemotherapy, pending diagnostic evaluation. If IPD is diagnosed, CAMPTOSAR and other chemotherapy should be discontinued and appropriate treatment instituted as needed [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.7	Toxicity of the 5 Day Regimen

Outside of a well-designed clinical study, CAMPTOSAR Injection should not be used in combination with a regimen of 5-FU/LV administered for 4–5 consecutive days every 4 weeks because of reports of increased toxicity, including toxic deaths. CAMPTOSAR should be used as recommended in Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

5.8	Increased Toxicity in Patients With Performance Status 2

In patients receiving either irinotecan/5-FU/LV or 5-FU/LV in the clinical trials, higher rates of hospitalization, neutropenic fever, thromboembolism, first-cycle treatment discontinuation, and early deaths were observed in patients with a baseline performance status of 2 than in patients with a baseline performance status of 0 or 1.

5.9	Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, CAMPTOSAR can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, intravenous administration of irinotecan during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal mortality and teratogenicity in pregnant animals at exposures lower than the human exposure based on area under the curve (AUC) at the clinical dose of 125 mg/m2. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.

Advise female patients of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant and to use highly effective contraception during treatment with CAMPTOSAR and for 6 months after the final dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment and for 3 months after the final dose of CAMPTOSAR [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), (8.3) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

### Procalcitonin-guided use of antibiotics for lower respiratory tract infection [^69260c9a]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

The effect of procalcitonin-guided use of antibiotics on treatment for suspected lower respiratory tract infection is unclear.

Methods

In 14 U.S. hospitals with high adherence to quality measures for the treatment of pneumonia, we provided guidance for clinicians about national clinical practice recommendations for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections and the interpretation of procalcitonin assays. We then randomly assigned patients who presented to the emergency department with a suspected lower respiratory tract infection and for whom the treating physician was uncertain whether antibiotic therapy was indicated to one of two groups: the procalcitonin group, in which the treating clinicians were provided with real-time initial (and serial, if the patient was hospitalized) procalcitonin assay results and an antibiotic use guideline with graded recommendations based on four tiers of procalcitonin levels, or the usual-care group. We hypothesized that within 30 days after enrollment the total antibiotic-days would be lower - and the percentage of patients with adverse outcomes would not be more than 4.5 percentage points higher - in the procalcitonin group than in the usual-care group.

Results

A total of 1656 patients were included in the final analysis cohort (826 randomly assigned to the procalcitonin group and 830 to the usual-care group), of whom 782 (47.2%) were hospitalized and 984 (59.4%) received antibiotics within 30 days. The treating clinician received procalcitonin assay results for 792 of 826 patients (95.9%) in the procalcitonin group (median time from sample collection to assay result, 77 minutes) and for 18 of 830 patients (2.2%) in the usual-care group. In both groups, the procalcitonin-level tier was associated with the decision to prescribe antibiotics in the emergency department. There was no significant difference between the procalcitonin group and the usual-care group in antibiotic-days (mean, 4.2 and 4.3 days, respectively; difference, -0.05 day; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.6 to 0.5; P = 0.87) or the proportion of patients with adverse outcomes (11.7% [96 patients] and 13.1% [109 patients]; difference, -1.5 percentage points; 95% CI, -4.6 to 1.7; P < 0.001 for noninferiority) within 30 days.

Conclusions

The provision of procalcitonin assay results, along with instructions on their interpretation, to emergency department and hospital-based clinicians did not result in less use of antibiotics than did usual care among patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection.

### Recurrent life-threatening pneumonitis in a 37-year-old woman [^a59040dc]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 37-year-old previously healthy and athletic woman presented to the ED in October 2018 with acute-onset high fever, dyspnea, and productive cough. Chest radiograph showed bilateral infiltrates that correlated with multifocal ground glass opacities in a thoracic CT scan (Fig 1). The patient was severely hypoxemic and required intensive care and oxygen administration via a high-flow nasal cannula. On admission, leucocyte counts were 23.3 k/μL; platelet counts were 518 k/μL; hemoglobin level was 12 g/dL; C-reactive protein was 83 mg/L, and procalcitonin was 0.7 μg/L. An auto-antibody panel that included antinuclear antibodies, extractable nuclear antigen (including anti-centromere-antibodies), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and myositis- and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor-antibodies was negative, as was the rheumatoid factor. Immunoglobulins that included IgG1-4 and IgA and renal function were normal. Sicca symptoms like xerophthalmia and xerostomia were negated. The patient fully recovered after empiric administration of antibiotics and glucocorticoids (initially 500 mg methylprednisolone daily over 3 days with consecutive tapering).

### Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for evaluating new fever in adult patients in the ICU [^8aed056f]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for fever in the ICU, more specifically with respect to inflammatory markers, IDSA/SCCM 2023 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining procalcitonin, in addition to bedside clinical evaluation, if the probability of bacterial infection is deemed low-to-intermediate in critically ill patients with new fever and no clear focus of infection. Avoid obtaining procalcitonin to rule out bacterial infection if the probability of bacterial infection is deemed high.

### Clinical pathway for early diagnosis of COVID-19: updates from experience to evidence-based practice [^604a8577]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic is a significant global event in the history of infectious diseases. The SARS-CoV-2 appears to have originated from bats but is now easily transmissible among humans, primarily through droplet or direct contact. Clinical features of COVID-19 include high fever, cough, and fatigue which may progress to ARDS. Respiratory failure can occur rapidly after this. The primary laboratory findings include lymphopenia and eosinopenia. Elevated D-dimer, procalcitonin, and CRP levels may correlate with disease severity. Imaging findings include ground-glass opacities and patchy consolidation on CT scan. Mortality is higher in patients with hypertension, cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and COPD. Elderly patients are more susceptible to severe disease and death, while children seem to have lower rates of infection and lower mortality. Diagnostic criteria and the identification of persons under investigation have evolved as more data has emerged. However, the approach to diagnosis is still very variable from region to region, country to country, and even among different hospitals in the same city. The importance of a clinical pathway to implement the most effective and relevant diagnostic strategy is of critical importance to establish the control of this virus that is responsible for more and more deaths each day.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^09ab9114]. VA/DoD (2021). High credibility.

VA/DoD COPD guideline — antibiotics for outpatient exacerbations states: "There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of antibiotics for outpatient COPD exacerbations (C-reactive protein guided or not). (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New-replaced)". An SR suggested decreased risk for treatment failures "up to one month following the initiation of treatment", but also "found no significant difference between antibiotic treatment and placebo in re-exacerbations in 2–6 weeks, median time to next exacerbation up to 12 months, and all-cause mortality up to two years after starting antibiotic treatment". Safety signals include that "one SR and two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggests an increase in diarrhea with antibiotic therapy compared with placebo from four weeks to two years post commencement of antibiotics", and "No significant difference was found in harms between shorter and longer durations of broad spectrum antibiotics". For biomarker-guided prescribing, "the use of C-reactive protein (CRP) point-of-care testing guided antibiotic prescription compared to usual care, had no clinically important difference in adverse effects… at six months", and "The Work Group did not review evidence on other specific biomarkers, such as procalcitonin". Clinically, "Based on clinical judgment, antibiotic therapy may be warranted and beneficial on a case-by-case basis", with examples including "a moderate exacerbation, increased dyspnea and increased sputum volume/purulence, fever/chills, and leukocytosis with radiographic evidence of pneumonia". The Work Group's confidence in the evidence was stated as low.

### How to: implement procalcitonin testing in my practice [^2df94de1]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Adding procalcitonin (PCT) to antibiotic stewardship algorithms may improve antibiotic use. However, PCT protocols need to be adapted to clinical settings and patient populations.

Objectives

To review PCT use in different medical settings and patient populations.

Sources

Most recent trials and meta-analyses investigating PCT for antibiotic stewardship were reviewed.

Content

Several trials found PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship to reduce antibiotic exposure and associated side-effects among patients with respiratory infection and sepsis. Decisions regarding antibiotic use in an individual patient are complex and should be based on the pre-test probability for bacterial infection, the severity of presentation and the results of PCT. In the context of a low pre-test probability for bacterial infections and a low-risk patient, a low PCT level helps to rule out bacterial infection and empiric antibiotic therapy can be avoided. In the context of a high pre-test probability for bacterial infections and/or a high-risk patient with sepsis, monitoring of PCT over time helps to track the resolution of infection and decisions regarding early stop of antibiotic treatment. Although these concepts have been successful in several respiratory infection and sepsis trials, some studies failed to show an added benefit of PCT due to factors such as low protocol adherence and relying on single rather than repeat PCT measurements.

Implication

As an adjunct to other clinical and laboratory parameters, PCT provides information about risk for bacterial infection and resolution of infection, and improves antibiotic stewardship decisions, thereby offering more individualized treatment courses with overall reduced antibiotic exposure.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for evaluating new fever in adult patients in the ICU [^fc061dcb]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in adult ICU patients are discussed for diagnostic accuracy and antibiotic stewardship. The diagnostic accuracy and specificity of PCT are higher than those of CRP, although further studies are needed to define the optimal cutoff points for PCT and CRP and the diagnostic indexes in different disease stages. Several RCTs have demonstrated that PCT-based algorithms safely reduce antibiotic use in stable, low-risk patients with respiratory infections, and in ICU patients with suspected sepsis, clinicians should not initially withhold antibiotics, but PCT levels of less than 0.5 μg/L or levels that decrease by greater than or equal to 80% from peak levels may guide antibiotic discontinuation once patients stabilize. The Stop Antibiotics on Procalcitonin Guidance Study demonstrated a reduction in both antibiotic exposure and mortality in critically ill patients, and a meta-analysis of 11 RCTs involving 4,482 patients reported that PCT-guided antibiotic treatment in ICU patients with infection and sepsis patients resulted in improved survival and lower antibiotic treatment duration. The latest and largest systematic review and meta-analysis to date of 16 studies and greater than5000 patients showed that PCT-guided antibiotic discontinuation appeared to decrease antibiotic utilization by 1 day and improve mortality, but support for their findings was tempered by low-certainty evidence and the majority of the PCT trials excluded severely immunocompromised patients. In summary, PCT and CRP provide only supportive and complementary information to clinical assessment, and decisions on initiating, altering, or discontinuing antimicrobial therapy should not be made solely based on changes in PCT or CRP levels.

### International ERS / ESICM / ESCMID / ALAT guidelines for the management of hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia: guidelines for the management of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) / ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) of the European Respiratory Society (ERS), European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases (ESCMID) and asociación latinoamericana del Tórax (ALAT) [^61d5c556]. The European Respiratory Journal (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding inpatient care for hospital-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to laboratory monitoring, ALAT/ERS/ESCMID/ESICM 2017 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining serial measurements of procalcitonin levels together with clinical assessment in the following clinical circumstances with the aim of reducing antibiotic treatment duration:

- initially inappropriate antibiotic therapy

- severely immunocompromised patients (such as neutropenia or stem cell transplant)

- highly antibiotic-resistant pathogens (P. aeruginosa, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter species, Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae)

- second-line antibiotic therapy (such as colistin and tigecycline).

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^906e176f]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
How and when to define a non-responding pneumonia; a patient is considered a non-responder after at least 48-72h of appropriate antibiotic therapy; the identification of non-response results from an integrated re-evaluation of clinical signs and symptoms, lab results namely biomarkers, microbiologic results and no improvement or further progression of imaging infiltrates (see manuscript)

Table 1
Approach to non-responding pneumonia

ARDS acute respiratory distress syndrome; CRP C-reactive protein; PCT procalcitonin; WBC white blood cell count

The natural history of non-responder ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is similar to sCAP, that is no clinical improvement within the first 72h of receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy (Fig. 1). The most reliable clinical indicator that a patient with VAP is not responding is lack of improvement in the PaO2:FiO2 within the first 3 days (Table 1). Sustained fever is less specific but does indicate an unresolved inflammatory process, one cause of which could be inadequately treated pneumonia. Persistently elevated and/or rising CRP or PCT values after 3–4 days of treatment are also associated with treatment failure. However, a non-decreasing or increasing PCT during antibiotic therapy should not be used to guide antibiotic escalation or intensify diagnostics. A RCT of antimicrobial spectrum escalation in patients with persistently elevated or rising PCT values versus routine care reported that PCT-guided intensification led to more organ-related harm and prolonged ICU length of stay compared to routine care, without improvement in survival rates. Sustained leukocytosis and radiographic infiltrates are features of non-responding pneumonia but are not specific for pneumonia.

### Management of fever in infants and young children [^ead4b8c7]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite dramatic reductions in the rates of bacteremia and meningitis since the 1980s, febrile illness in children younger than 36 months continues to be a concern with potentially serious consequences. Factors that suggest serious infection include age younger than one month, poor arousability, petechial rash, delayed capillary refill, increased respiratory effort, and overall physician assessment. Urinary tract infections are the most common serious bacterial infection in children younger than three years, so evaluation for such infections should be performed in those with unexplained fever. Abnormal white blood cell counts have poor sensitivity for invasive bacterial infections; procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels, when available, are more informative. Chest radiography is rarely recommended for children older than 28 days in the absence of localizing signs. Lumbar puncture is not recommended for children older than three months without localizing signs; it may also be considered for those from one to three months of age with abnormal laboratory test results. Protocols such as Step-by-Step, Laboratory Score, or the Rochester algorithms may be helpful in identifying low-risk patients. Rapid influenza testing and tests for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be of value when those diseases are circulating. When empiric treatment is appropriate, suggested antibiotics include ceftriaxone or cefotaxime for infants one to three months of age and ampicillin with gentamicin or with cefotaxime for neonates. For children three months to three years of age, azithromycin or amoxicillin is recommended if pneumonia is suspected; for urinary infections, suggested antibiotics are cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Choice of antibiotics should reflect local patterns of microbial resistance.

### Our recommendations for acute management of COVID-19 [^146c0c8f]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic is currently spreading worldwide; in particular, Italy and our region (Lombardy) have been facing the largest European outbreak since February 21st. We here share our practical clinical management suggestions, derived from the direct experience of the first 200 patients with acute respiratory failure, of which 75 were finally admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) to undergo mechanical ventilation:
Suggestive clinical picture includes upper airways disease, with cough, fever and flu-like syndrome, evolving to dyspnoea after 2–10 days and presenting with bilateral chest infiltrates. Blood gas analysis initially shows moderate hypoxaemia, metabolic acidosis with/without respiratory compensation, normal lactates and increased anion gap; ketoacids are found in urinary sticks. Blood samples show high C-reactive protein, normal procalcitonin, increased lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, amylases, lipases and hyperglycaemia. A nasal swab for 2019 novel coronavirus is routinely performed in any upper/lower airways disease.
In suggestive clinical pictures, do not trust negative nasal swab: patients may have negative swabs but positive bronchoalveolar lavage. We suggest isolating suspected patients and using personal protective equipment as if positive; eventually, repeat the nasal swab and perform a bronchoalveolar lavage if possible. Rule out other potential aetiologies of acute respiratory failure with microbiological sampling, urinary antigens for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumoniae, serologies for atypical bacterial pneumonia and search of other respiratory viruses.
Increase the number of ICU beds and prepare the wards to provide non-invasive ventilation: once the epidemic starts, patients requiring respiratory support increase exponentially. Organize a shared dataset of patients with non-invasive ventilation in the wards and a daily round by an intensivist, to early identify the failing patients.
Set up specific therapy early in all positive/suspected patients: we systematically introduce hydroxychloroquine 200 mg tid and azithromycin 500 mg per day; prophylaxis is started with trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole 2 vials/day if lymphopaenia, which is frequent. Discuss the potential interest of remdesivir 100 mg/day with infectious disease consultant. Consider introducing empiric antibiotic therapy, to be stopped in case of negative microbiological samples and negative procalcitonin.
Correct metabolic acidosis and hyperglycaemia early to decrease respiratory load with insulin infusion (target glycaemia < 150 mg/dL); if negative base excess persists at blood gas analysis, consider sodium bicarbonate infusion (starting dose 20 mEq/h).
Most of the patients respond to positive end-expiratory pressure: prefer helmet to mask for a continuous positive airway pressure trial to set moderate-high positive end-expiratory pressure (> 8 cmH 2 O), improve patient's tolerance to prolong non-invasive support and prevent droplets' spread. For this same purpose, add a high-efficiency particulate air filter before the positive end-expiratory pressure valve or, better, connect the valve to wall gas aspiration.
Perform early intubation if poor response to continuous positive airway pressure in terms of oxygenation: do not trust patients' relatively good respiratory mechanics and feeling of improved dyspnoea, since these patients may have relatively normal lung compliance and the only clinical sign of fatigue may be high respiratory rate. Connect ventilator expiratory valve to wall gas aspiration to limit droplets' spread.
Once intubated, perform a closed system bronchoalveolar lavage to confirm diagnosis: minimize the use of fiberbronchoscopes to limit airways' opening; we connect a bronchoalveolar lavage test tube to the closed aspiration system — mandatory in these patients — for deep bronchial sampling. Thereafter, repeat the sampling every 7 days for viral charge assessment and bacterial over-infection detection.
After intubation, evaluate basic lung mechanics: it usually shows a respiratory system compliance of 0.5–1 ml/cmH 2 O per kilogramme of predicted body weight with high recruitability at pressure-volume curve and normal resistances. These patients usually show good response to high positive end-expiratory pressure levels; calibrated oesophageal pressure may help its setting. Consider neuromuscular blocking agents if deep sedation does not control the patient's trigger and ventilation is not protective; perform daily a trial of neuromuscular blocking agents stop.
Prefer lung ultrasound to other imaging techniques: it is accurate in interstitial diseases and may show pathological signs before chest X-ray. A basic assessment helps deciding the ventilatory strategy: if diffuse loss of aeration, keep high positive end-expiratory pressure levels; if posterior consolidations, consider pronation. Lung ultrasound may also help in limiting traditional imaging, avoiding patients' transportation to radiology department. It also allows a daily monitoring of clinical evolution, response to treatment and possible complications (pneumothorax, over-infections).
Avoid positive fluid balance: perform fluid challenges and stop fluid resuscitation if no haemodynamic response; use vasoactive drugs instead to optimize tissue perfusion. We accept moderate elevation of creatinine without urinary output impairment to improve the lung status.
Fever is a frequent issue, reaching values as high as 40 °C; we decided to treat it only if > 39 °C, if oxygenation is acceptable. Spontaneous defervescence can be the first sign of clinical improvement.
As soon as possible according to gas exchanges (PaO 2 /FiO 2 > 150 with FiO2 < 50%) and lung ultrasound score (≤ 12), start assisted ventilation with a sigh while maintaining moderate to high positive end-expiratory pressure to prevent derecruitment. Regularly check patient's respiratory drive (P0.1), tidal volume and plateau pressure to keep ventilation safe. Dexmedetomidine may help in the weaning phase.
In patients having received prolonged sedation, we frequently observed prolonged awakening with altered respiratory drive and difficult patient-ventilator interaction; if no prompt awakening is observed, perform early tracheostomy to accelerate the weaning and discharge from ICU. The number of patients requiring intensive care rapidly increases; therefore, rapid discharge is mandatory.
Hyperinflammatory status increases the risk of thrombosis and pulmonary embolism; check for thrombotic complications systematically, mainly in correspondence of central lines.
Communication with families is difficult since patients' relatives are frequently in quarantine and access to the hospital is limited; moreover, while wearing personal protective equipment, physicians' possibility to answer to relatives' phone call is limited. Consider identifying each day one person in charge of phone calls to daily update relatives on clinical conditions.

### Procalcitonin to initiate or discontinue antibiotics in acute respiratory tract infections [^957d0821]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) comprise of a large and heterogeneous group of infections including bacterial, viral, and other aetiologies. In recent years, procalcitonin (PCT), a blood marker for bacterial infections, has emerged as a promising tool to improve decisions about antibiotic therapy (PCT-guided antibiotic therapy). Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the feasibility of using procalcitonin for starting and stopping antibiotics in different patient populations with ARIs and different settings ranging from primary care settings to emergency departments, hospital wards, and intensive care units. However, the effect of using procalcitonin on clinical outcomes is unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane review and individual participant data meta-analysis first published in 2012 designed to look at the safety of PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship.

Objectives

The aim of this systematic review based on individual participant data was to assess the safety and efficacy of using procalcitonin for starting or stopping antibiotics over a large range of patients with varying severity of ARIs and from different clinical settings.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE, and Embase, in February 2017, to identify suitable trials. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov to identify ongoing trials in April 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs of adult participants with ARIs who received an antibiotic treatment either based on a procalcitonin algorithm (PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship algorithm) or usual care. We excluded trials if they focused exclusively on children or used procalcitonin for a purpose other than to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two teams of review authors independently evaluated the methodology and extracted data from primary studies. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and treatment failure at 30 days, for which definitions were harmonised among trials. Secondary endpoints were antibiotic use, antibiotic-related side effects, and length of hospital stay. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using multivariable hierarchical logistic regression adjusted for age, gender, and clinical diagnosis using a fixed-effect model. The different trials were added as random-effects into the model. We conducted sensitivity analyses stratified by clinical setting and type of ARI. We also performed an aggregate data meta-analysis.

Main Results

From 32 eligible RCTs including 18 new trials for this 2017 update, we obtained individual participant data from 26 trials including 6708 participants, which we included in the main individual participant data meta-analysis. We did not obtain individual participant data for four trials, and two trials did not include people with confirmed ARIs. According to GRADE, the quality of the evidence was high for the outcomes mortality and antibiotic exposure, and quality was moderate for the outcomes treatment failure and antibiotic-related side effects. Primary endpoints: there were 286 deaths in 3336 procalcitonin-guided participants (8.6%) compared to 336 in 3372 controls (10.0%), resulting in a significantly lower mortality associated with procalcitonin-guided therapy (adjusted OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.99, P = 0.037). We could not estimate mortality in primary care trials because only one death was reported in a control group participant. Treatment failure was not significantly lower in procalcitonin-guided participants (23.0% versus 24.9% in the control group, adjusted OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.01, P = 0.068). Results were similar among subgroups by clinical setting and type of respiratory infection, with no evidence for effect modification (P for interaction > 0.05). Secondary endpoints: procalcitonin guidance was associated with a 2.4-day reduction in antibiotic exposure (5.7 versus 8.1 days, 95% CI -2.71 to -2.15, P < 0.001) and lower risk of antibiotic-related side effects (16.3% versus 22.1%, adjusted OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.82, P < 0.001). Length of hospital stay and intensive care unit stay were similar in both groups. A sensitivity aggregate-data analysis based on all 32 eligible trials showed similar results.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated meta-analysis of individual participant data from 12 countries shows that the use of procalcitonin to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment results in lower risks of mortality, lower antibiotic consumption, and lower risk for antibiotic-related side effects. Results were similar for different clinical settings and types of ARIs, thus supporting the use of procalcitonin in the context of antibiotic stewardship in people with ARIs. Future high-quality research is needed to confirm the results in immunosuppressed patients and patients with non-respiratory infections.

### Pro-adrenomedullin to predict severity and outcome in community-acquired pneumonia [^e0d5bfdd]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Setting and study population

Data from 302 patients admitted to the emergency department with CAP were analyzed. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate antibiotic duration by procalcitonin guidance compared to standard recommended guidelines. A predefined secondary endpoint was the assessment of prognostic factors and biomarkers in CAP.

Consecutive patients with CAP admitted from November 2003 through February 2005 to the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland, a 950 bed tertiary care hospital, were included. Patients had to be > 18 years of age with a suspected CAP as principal diagnosis on admission. Excluded were patients with cystic fibrosis or active pulmonary tuberculosis, hospital-acquired pneumonia and severely immunocompromised patients. Patients were examined on admission to the emergency department by a resident supervised by a board-certified specialist in internal medicine. Baseline assessment included clinical data and vital signs, comorbid conditions, and routine blood tests. Functional status of the patients was assessed using a visual analogue scale, ranging from 0 (feeling extremely ill) to 100 (feeling completely healthy), and by a quality of life questionnaire for patients with respiratory illnesses.

CAP was defined by the presence of one or several of the following recently acquired respiratory signs or symptoms: cough, sputum production, dyspnea, core body temperature > 38.0°C, auscultatory findings of abnormal breath sounds and rales, leukocyte count > 10 or < 4 × 10 9 cells l -1 and an infiltrate on chest radiograph. The PSI was calculated as described elsewhere. Chest radiographs were screened by the physician in charge and reviewed by a senior radiologist, unaware of clinical and laboratory findings.

The study was approved by the local ethics committee for human studies and written informed consent was obtained from all patients.

Outcome

All patients were followed-up for a mean duration of 6.9 ± 1.9 weeks. At the follow-up visit, outcome was evaluated by clinical, laboratory, radiographic and microbiological criteria. Cure was defined as resolution of clinical, laboratory and radiographic signs of CAP. Improvement was defined as reduction of clinical signs and symptoms, improvement of laboratory findings (for example; CRP, procalcitonin and leukocyte count) and a reduction in the number or intensity of radiographic signs of CAP. Treatment success represented the sum of the rates for cure and improvement. Treatment failure included death, recurrence or persistence of clinical, laboratory and radiological signs of CAP at follow-up.

Patients who survived until follow-up were counted as survivors whereas patients who died within the follow-up period were counted as non-survivors.

Procalcitonin (PCT) in adult ICU patients — test characteristics and kinetics: PCT is described as a precursor hormone of calcitonin produced by parafollicular thyroid and neuroendocrine lung and intestinal cells that may help discriminate bacterial from viral and noninfectious etiologies; however, it may be elevated during severe viral illness including influenza and COVID-19, potentially reducing discriminative power. PCT begins to rise four hours after exposure to bacteria, reaching a maximum level after six to eight hours; serum levels are associated with infection severity and decrease rapidly after antibiotic treatment. Test results are usually available within one hour with point-of-care devices or routine laboratories, and values in healthy individuals are less than 0.05 ng/mL.

### What is the cause of this fever? Malaria with concomitant pneumonia [^0c43bbd3]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 43-year-old Hispanic woman presented to the clinic complaining of fever, chills and cough for 14 days. The patient reported a recent trip to Asia 12 days prior to presenting symptoms. Given her physical examination findings, she was treated empirically for community acquired pneumonia. Since her symptoms worsened despite the antibiotic, she was referred to the Emergency Department for further evaluation. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with pneumonia and malaria. When evaluating patients with history of recent travel, it is important to consider communicable diseases that are endemic to the areas visited, as well as multiple disease aetiologies for complicated and refractory cases.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for sepsis and septic shock, more specifically with respect to evaluation of new fever in the ICU (inflammatory markers), IDSA/SCCM 2023 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining procalcitonin, in addition to bedside clinical evaluation, if the probability of bacterial infection is deemed low-to-intermediate in critically ill patients with new fever and no clear focus of infection. Avoid obtaining procalcitonin to rule out bacterial infection if the probability of bacterial infection is deemed high.

Case presentation

A 26 year old male with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department with complaints of fever, dry cough, difficulty in breathing and chest pain of 15 days duration. Initial assessment showed an averagely built male with body mass index (BMI) 18.8 kg/m 2 (normal: 18.5–24.9 kg/m 2), fever (38.9 °C), tachycardia (heart rate 120/min, regular), tachypnea (respiratory rate 35/min), hypoxia (pulse oximetry: 85% on room air, PaO 2: 55 mm Hg) and normal blood pressure (126/76 mm Hg). Systemic examination was unremarkable other than reduced air entry at both lung bases. Blood investigations revealed an elevated white cell count of 14.2 x 10 9 /L (normal: 4.5–10 x 10 9 /L), predominantly neutrophilic; serum electrolytes, renal function, liver function, coagulation profile were within normal limits; lactate was 2.2 mmol/L (normal: < 2 mmol/L) and procalcitonin was 0.6 ng/mL (normal: < 0.5 ng/mL). Blood cultures, sputum for gram's stain and nasal swab for viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were collected. Chest x-ray showed bilateral middle and lower zone air space opacities (Fig. 1a). After oxygen supplementation via nasal cannula, fluid resuscitation and empirical antimicrobial therapy (ceftriaxone 2 gm i.v. once daily, azithromycin 500 mg i.v. once daily and oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice daily) patient was stabilized (PaO 2 80 mm Hg on oxygen 2 L/min through nasal cannula) and admitted to medical ward.

### Procalcitonin to initiate or discontinue antibiotics in acute respiratory tract infections [^60e79eaa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) comprise a large and heterogeneous group of infections including bacterial, viral and other aetiologies. In recent years, procalcitonin - the prohormone of calcitonin - has emerged as a promising marker for the diagnosis of bacterial infections and for improving decisions about antibiotic therapy. Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the feasibility of using procalcitonin for starting and stopping antibiotics in different patient populations with acute respiratory infections and different settings ranging from primary care to emergency departments (EDs), hospital wards and intensive care units (ICUs).

Objectives

The aim of this systematic review based on individual patient data was to assess the safety and efficacy of using procalcitonin for starting or stopping antibiotics over a large range of patients with varying severity of ARIs and from different clinical settings.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2011, Issue 2) which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to May 2011) and EMBASE (1974 to May 2011) to identify suitable trials.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs of adult participants with ARIs who received an antibiotic treatment either based on a procalcitonin algorithm or usual care/guidelines. Trials were excluded if they exclusively focused on paediatric patients or if they used procalcitonin for another purpose than to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two teams of review authors independently evaluated the methodology and extracted data from primary studies. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and treatment failure at 30 days. For the primary care setting, treatment failure was defined as death, hospitalisation, ARI-specific complications, recurrent or worsening infection, and patients reporting any symptoms of an ongoing respiratory infection at follow-up. For the ED setting, treatment failure was defined as death, ICU admission, re-hospitalisation after index hospital discharge, ARI-associated complications, and recurrent or worsening infection within 30 days of follow-up. For the ICU setting, treatment failure was defined as death within 30 days of follow-up. Secondary endpoints were antibiotic use (initiation of antibiotics, duration of antibiotics and total exposure to antibiotics (total amount of antibiotic days divided by total number of patients)), length of hospital stay for hospitalised patients, length of ICU stay for critically ill patients, and number of days with restricted activities within 14 days after randomisation for primary care patients. For the two co-primary endpoints of all-cause mortality and treatment failure, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using multivariable hierarchical logistic regression. The hierarchical regression model was adjusted for age and clinical diagnosis as fixed-effect. The different trials were added as random-effects into the model. We fitted corresponding linear regression models for antibiotic use. We conducted sensitivity analyses stratified by clinical setting and ARI diagnosis to assess the consistency of our results.

Main Results

We included 14 trials with 4221 participants. There were 118 deaths in 2085 patients (5.7%) assigned to procalcitonin groups compared to 134 deaths in 2126 control patients (6.3%) (adjusted OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.23). Treatment failure occurred in 398 procalcitonin group patients (19.1%) and in 466 control patients (21.9%). Procalcitonin guidance was not associated with increased mortality or treatment failure in any clinical setting, or ARI diagnosis. These results proved robust in various sensitivity analyses. Total antibiotic exposure was significantly reduced overall (median (interquartile range) from 8 (5 to 12) to 4 (0 to 8) days; adjusted difference in days, -3.47, 95% CI -3.78 to -3.17, and across all the different clinical settings and diagnoses.

Authors' Conclusions

Use of procalcitonin to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with ARI was not associated with higher mortality rates or treatment failure. Antibiotic consumption was significantly reduced across different clinical settings and ARI diagnoses. Further high-quality research is needed to confirm the safety of this approach for non-European countries and patients in intensive care. Moreover, future studies should also establish cost-effectiveness by considering country-specific costs of procalcitonin measurement and potential savings in consumption of antibiotics and other healthcare resources, as well as secondary cost savings due to lower risk of side effects and reduced antimicrobial resistance.

### Use of serum C reactive protein and procalcitonin concentrations in addition to symptoms and signs to predict pneumonia in patients presenting to primary care with acute cough: diagnostic study [^afab5aa7]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

As in most multicentre studies, individual patient data were likely to be clustered within the 12 different countries, which could affect the association of the diagnostic variables with the outcome. We accounted for such possible non-random differences within countries (clusters) using multilevel logistic regression techniques. We used a random effect for the intercept (to adjust for differences in baseline prevalence of pneumonia per cluster) as well as for each candidate variable (to adjust for differences in the associations between variable and outcome per cluster). After we rounded the results, this multilevel analysis identified the same intercept, odds ratios (associations), and confidence intervals as the standard multivariable logistic regression analysis, and therefore we used results from the latter for all further analysis. All 14 preselected diagnostic predictors from history taking and physical examination were entered in a multivariable logistic regression model. We explicitly did not select items based on univariate results as this often leads to unstable models. With backward selection, with P < 0.10 for the likelihood ratio test, we fitted a reduced diagnostic "symptoms and signs" model and computed the ROC area and calibration plot.

Procalcitonin-guided discontinuation of antimicrobials — evidence and recommendation: In patients with sepsis, direct evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials (n = 4,499 patients) assessed procalcitonin to guide treatment duration and a meta-analysis showed improved mortality with procalcitonin versus control (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.99) with no effect on length of stay; antibiotic exposure was consistently lower with procalcitonin, although in many trials the total duration was still 7 days or longer, algorithms and thresholds varied, and the overall quality of evidence was judged low; undesirable effects were considered minimal, cost data are limited with one single-center study reporting decreased hospital costs with PCT-guided antibiotic, and testing may not be available in all settings, including LMICs; based on apparent benefit and no obvious undesirable effects, we suggest using procalcitonin along with clinical evaluation to decide when to discontinue antimicrobials in adults with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control, if the optimal duration of therapy is unclear and if procalcitonin is available.

Case presentation

Case 1

In September 11, 2019, a 39-year-old woman was hospitalized for coughing, difficulty breathing, and a low-grade fever (38.0 °C) that persisted for 25 days, and a persistent sputum discharge 3 days before admission. During the course of the disease, there were no other symptoms (e.g. dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or weight loss). Her medical records included two cesarean sections but no other history of illness, and she was not taking any hormones or immunosuppressive agents. The patient did have a history of working for months in an unventilated office.

Diagnoses

On admission to the hospital, the patient's body temperature was 38.1 °C. In addition, the patient had developed symptoms of shortness of breath (35 bpm) and severe hypoxemia (PaO 2, 62 mmHg; FiO 2, 0.80). During auscultation, the patient had good air sounds in both lungs and medium moist rales. Hematological results showed normal white blood cell counts (6.6 × 10 9 /L), while neutrophil counts were slightly higher, accounting for 78.7% granulocytes (or neutrophils) (Additional file 1: Fig. 1); C-reactive protein at 102 mg/L was 13.7 times higher than normal; and there were fibrinogen in the plasma. The proteinogen level was 4.46 g/L. There were a large number of Gram-positive bacteria in the sputum smear, but no bacterial growth was observed in the culture. Procalcitonin and fungal-glucan levels were normal. The respiratory virus test was negative. Computed tomography of the lungs showed multiple bilateral pneumonia (Fig. 1 A, a, B, b).

### Beyond the usual suspects: neonatal fever and desaturation [^197dce70]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Case Presentation

On the day of admission, the patient was a 31‐day‐old baby girl born to a Ukrainian mother from an unmonitored pregnancy with a birth weight of 2350 g. Gestation age was unknown.

The infant was admitted to the local hospital for the first time during the third week of life with a confirmed diagnosis of Influenza A. This diagnosis was made using PCR testing of the infant as well as her mother, and the infant's recovery was successful once she was discharged from hospital.

Two weeks later, the infant was readmitted to the hospital with a cough, dyspnea and fever. The laboratory parameters of inflammation were elevated (CRP 188 mg/L; C‐reactive protein, range [0–5 mg/L]; PCT‐I 1.01 ug/L; procalcitonin, range [0.05–0.5 ug/L]; WBC 26; white blood cells, range [5–19.5 10 9 /L]). The presence of bilaterally oriented opacities, suggestive of pneumonia, was evidenced on the chest X‐ray. (Figure 1). Empirical antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam has been initiated. From a clinical perspective, the most prominent symptoms were tachypnoea (70 breaths per min) and signs of increased respiratory effort. The patient experienced apnoeic episodes accompanied by cyanosis and bradycardia, prompting the initiation of high‐flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNO) and transfer to the intensive care unit.

FIGURE 1
A: initial chest X‐ray.

Despite the provision of HFNO ventilatory support, there was progression of the respiratory insufficiency, as evidenced by the blood gases and lactate levels which were determined using the Astrup technique (pH 7.062 range [7.34–7.46], pCO₂ 9.65 kPa range [3.6–5.4 kPa], pO₂ 6.8 kPa range [9.5–14 kPa], lactate 8.7 mmol/L range [0.5–3 mmol/L]). These findings, coupled with persistent tachypnoea and marked overall deterioration mandate further interventions. These included endotracheal intubation and the commencement of mechanical ventilation.

### Procalcitonin and lung ultrasonography point-of-care testing to determine antibiotic prescription in patients with lower respiratory tract infection in primary care: pragmatic cluster randomised trial [^89b7805c]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Trial design and setting

This three group, open label, pragmatic, cluster randomised superiority trial was conducted from September 2018 to March 2020, in accordance with a previously published protocol. We chose a cluster design, with randomisation at the general practitioner level, to reduce contamination between groups. The trial initially recruited patients from 42 general practices in western and central-western Switzerland. Owing to slow recruitment, 18 additional practices included patients from August 2019, bringing the total of general practitioners to 60. The Swiss ethics committees of cantons Vaud and Bern approved the protocol (2017–01246). All study participants gave their written consent. An external independent monitoring board supervised the trial.

Randomisation, participants, and trial interventions

We randomly allocated practices to a study group with a 1:1:1 ratio with variable block sizes, according to a computer generated randomisation list.

General practitioners were eligible if they did not use point-of-care procalcitonin nor point-of-care lung ultrasonography for the diagnosis of pneumonia. General practitioners screened for inclusion all consecutive patients aged 18 or older presenting with an acute cough (≤ 21 days). General practitioners included patients with clinical pneumonia, defined as an acute cough and at least one of the following signs or symptoms: history of fever of more than 4 days, dyspnoea, tachnypnoea (> 22 cycles/min), or abnormal focal lung auscultation. Exclusion criteria are available in the supplementary material (table S1).

The study team trained general practitioners and medical assistants before participation in the study. Details of the curriculum are available in the supplementary material (section 3).

UltraPro group

The UltraPro algorithm combines the results of point-of-care procalcitonin with point-of-care lung ultrasonography in a sequential manner to guide antibiotic prescription. The medical assistant measured procalcitonin, using the portable BRAHMS PCT direct point-of-care test (Thermo-Fischer Scientific). This immunoassay has a measuring range of 0.22–10 μg/L and provides a quantitative result in 20 minutes using 20 μL of venous whole blood.

For any elevated concentrations of procalcitonin (≥ 0.25 μg/L), general practitioners did lung ultrasonography using a portable L12-4 convex transducer (Philips Lumify). The algorithm recommended prescribing antibiotics only in the presence of both an elevated procalcitonin and a lung consolidation (fig S1).

### How to use… procalcitonin [^3ed6f0e8]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnosing bacterial infection in the unwell or febrile child is a common challenge faced by all paediatricians. Despite the advent of novel molecular techniques, there is ongoing need for diagnostic assays with adequate performance and turnaround time to facilitate safe clinical decision-making when bacterial sepsis is suspected, such as whether to commence empirical treatment with antibiotics. Procalcitonin is an established marker of infection that has a potential role in the diagnosis and exclusion of serious or invasive bacterial infection in neonates and children. Although enthusiastically adopted in many countries and institutions, national guidance in the UK does not yet support its routine use. This article reviews the relevant literature on the use of procalcitonin measurement in common paediatric clinical scenarios.

Society of Critical Care Medicine and Infectious Diseases Society of America adult ICU new fever biomarkers guidance states that in critically ill patients with a new fever and no clear focus of infection, when the probability of bacterial infection is low to intermediate, we suggest measuring procalcitonin (PCT) in addition to bedside clinical evaluation versus bedside clinical evaluation alone (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence) and we suggest measuring C-reactive protein (CRP) in addition to bedside clinical evaluation versus bedside clinical evaluation alone (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). When the probability is high, we suggest not measuring PCT to rule out bacterial infection (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence) and we suggest not measuring CRP to rule out bacterial infection (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For low to intermediate probability, we suggest measuring either serum PCT or CRP to rule out bacterial infection (Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Biomarkers such as PCT and CRP deployed with rapid turnaround times, have been used as adjuncts in the early diagnosis of sepsis while awaiting microbiologic culture results, major guidelines recommend against routine use of biomarkers in the setting of sepsis and septic shock, out of respect for uncertain benefit and cost and availability issues, and in the setting of fever and lower likelihood of infection, however, there may be a role in obtaining a baseline value to assist in the discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy.

Case presentation

Patient 1

A 57-year-old Hispanic woman with asthma, hypertension and obesity (BMI 36 kg/m 2) presented to the emergency department with 17 days of severe cough and progressive shortness of breath. She tested positive for COVID-19 via RT-PCR. She was saturating 93% on 4 L/min nasal cannula (NC). Her chest X-ray (CXR) showed bibasilar interstitial airspace disease. Initial laboratory workup revealed the following: WBC 5.7 thous/uL, platelets 212 thous/uL, procalcitonin 0.12 ng/mL, C-reactive protein 94 mg/L, fibrinogen 706 mg/dL, d dimer 541 ng/dL FEU, lactate dehydrogenase 459 U/L, and ferritin 1204 ng/mL. A five-day course of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), zinc sulfate, and azithromycin was initiated, along with intravenous methylprednisolone 40 mg every 12 h and enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis. She continued to require increasing levels of supplemental oxygen and was placed on 15 L/min high flow nasal cannula (HFNC). A CXR performed on day ten showed pneumomediastinum, small bilateral apical pneumathorax, and subcutaneous emphysema (Fig. 1). A follow-up chest computed tomography (CT) revealed pneumopericardium and progression of multifocal interstitial opacities (Fig. 2). Her respiratory status continued to worsen and was intubated on day 16. Significant worsening of the subcutaneous emphysema was noted post-intubation. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted and no acute intervention was recommended, as the patient had stable blood pressure and the pneumomediastinum was not believed to be a significant contributor to her respiratory deterioration. he continued to require increasing levels of oxygen and was subsequently flown to a tertiary care center for higher level of care. There, she was placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and subsequently required bilateral chest tubes for enlarging pneumothoraces. Over the course of the next month, she could not wean off of ECMO and developed septic shock with profound lactic acidemia. Care was withdrawn per the request of her family and the patient expired immediately.

### Control of SARS-CoV-2 infection in rituximab-treated neuroimmunological patients [^70554c4a]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Here, we report on two individuals with underlying neuroimmunological diseases who were under stable rituximab therapy — a B cell-depleting monoclonal antibody — when confirmed COVID-19 developed. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 was verified in both cases by PCR.

Patient 1 was a 44-year-old woman with a history of breast carcinoma, which was treated by breast-conserving surgery in 2010 and a relapsing–remitting MS (diagnosed 1999; EDSS 2.0) that has been treated with rituximab since 2013 (last infusion in January 2020). She was admitted with malaise, muscle ache, cough, fever and mild dyspnea, which first developed during a ski-trip in a high-risk area on March 14th, 2020 and she was tested positive ten days later. On the day of admission, she showed elevated inflammatory biomarkers (CRP 34 mg/L, interleukin-6 371.9 ng/L, ferritin 292.7 µg/L), cardiac biomarkers (proBNP 253 ng/L) and D-dimers (0.61 mg/L) but normal procalcitonin (< 0.02 µg/L) and negative blood cultures. Radiologic findings of bilateral infiltrations indicated atypical pneumonia. On the second day of admission SARS-CoV-2 RNA was only detectable in pharyngeal swabs in low concentrations close to detection limit (Ct 37.4). Immunologically, she had normal lymphocyte counts (1.12 billion/mL) but absent B cells (not detectable, Supplementary Table 1). Serologically, we could not detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 IgG. The patient was clinically and serologically stable and was discharged after four days of inpatient symptomatic treatment against fever into home quarantine. Four weeks later, she electively visited our outpatient clinic and her PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab was now negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Clinically, she was completely asymptomatic, and we did not observe neurological deterioration. Serologically, she was still negative for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 IgG (Fig. 1 a). A control X-ray of the chest showed a strong regression of pre-diagnosed bilateral pneumonic infiltrates.

### A proposal for a comprehensive approach to infections across the surgical pathway [^1e690ad3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 17. What is the role of the biomarkers in surgery?

Statement 17.1. C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) can help clinicians to diagnose surgical infections.

Statement 17.2. PCT can help clinicians in early discontinuation of antibiotics in critically ill patients and in patients undergoing intervention for acute peritonitis.

Although more than a hundred biomarkers have been studied, only a limited number of them became routinely available in clinical practice. CRP and PCT are the more frequently studied and used biomarkers.

Serum CRP is an acute-phase protein synthesized exclusively in the liver. Its secretion is initiated 4 to 6 h after an inflammatory insult (effect mediated by cytokines namely interleukin-6), and its concentration doubles every 8 h with a peak at 36–50 h. The sole determinant of CRP plasmatic levels is its synthesis rate, which is proportional to the intensity of the inflammatory insult. Its production and elimination are not influenced by renal replacement therapy or immunosuppression (both systemic steroids and neutropenia). It has a sensitivity of 68–92% and a specificity of 40–67% as a marker of bacterial infection. Its low specificity and inability to differentiate bacterial infections from non-infectious causes of inflammation make CRP of limited diagnostic value. The available assays for CRP measurement are reliable, stable, reproducible, rapid, inexpensive, and present an acceptable limit of detection (0.3–5 mg/L). CRP has been analyzed in multiple clinical contexts, but only a small number of studies have focused on its use for optimizing antibiotic therapy. In primary care, CRP improves the assessment of the severity of infection and extent of inflammation and performs better in predicting the diagnosis of pneumonia than any individual or combination of clinical signs and symptoms. A Cochrane review demonstrated reduced antibiotic prescription with CRP testing, which led to its incorporation in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for the diagnosis of pneumonia. CRP has been reported to be useful in the diagnosis of appendicitis; however, it lacks specificity. Multiple studies have examined the sensitivity of CRP level alone for the diagnosis of appendicitis in patients selected to undergo appendectomy. Gurleyik et al. noted a CRP sensitivity of 96.6% in 87 of 90 patients with a histologically proven disease. Similarly, Shakhatreh found a CRP sensitivity of 95.5% in 85 of 89 patients with histologically proven appendicitis. Asfar et al. reported a CRP sensitivity of 93.6% in 78 patients undergoing appendectomy.

### Effectiveness and safety of procalcitonin evaluation for reducing mortality in adults with sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock [^63509d5c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Serum procalcitonin (PCT) evaluation has been proposed for early diagnosis and accurate staging and to guide decisions regarding patients with sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock, with possible reduction in mortality.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of serum PCT evaluation for reducing mortality and duration of antimicrobial therapy in adults with sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock.

Search Methods

We searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 7); MEDLINE (1950 to July 2015); Embase (Ovid SP, 1980 to July 2015); Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS via BIREME, 1982 to July 2015); and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; EBSCO host, 1982 to July 2015), and trial registers (ISRCTN registry, ClinicalTrials.gov and CenterWatch, to July 2015). We reran the search in October 2016. We added three studies of interest to a list of 'Studies awaiting classification' and will incorporate these into formal review findings during the review update.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing PCT-guided decisions in at least one of the comparison arms for adults (≥ 18 years old) with sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock, according to international definitions and irrespective of the setting.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors extracted study data and assessed the methodological quality of included studies. We conducted meta-analysis with random-effects models for the following primary outcomes: mortality and time spent receiving antimicrobial therapy in hospital and in the intensive care unit (ICU), as well as time spent on mechanical ventilation and change in antimicrobial regimen from a broad to a narrower spectrum.

Main Results

We included 10 trials with 1215 participants. Low-quality evidence showed no significant differences in mortality at longest follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.01; I² = 10%; 10 trials; N = 1156), at 28 days (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.31; I² = 0%; four trials; N = 316), at ICU discharge (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.11; I² = 49%; three trials; N = 506) and at hospital discharge (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.27; I² = 0%; seven trials; N = 805; moderate-quality evidence). However, mean time receiving antimicrobial therapy in the intervention groups was -1.28 days (95% CI to -1.95 to -0.61; I² = 86%; four trials; N = 313; very low-quality evidence). No primary study has analysed the change in antimicrobial regimen from a broad to a narrower spectrum.

Authors' Conclusions

Up-to-date evidence of very low to moderate quality, with insufficient sample power per outcome, does not clearly support the use of procalcitonin-guided antimicrobial therapy to minimize mortality, mechanical ventilation, clinical severity, reinfection or duration of antimicrobial therapy of patients with septic conditions.

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^a5481c17]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline — adult cough classification and management suggestions state: For adult patients complaining of cough, we suggest that acute cough be defined as being < 3 weeks in duration (Grade 2C). For adult patients complaining of cough, we suggest that subacute cough be defined as being between 3 and 8 weeks in duration (Grade 2C). For adult patients complaining of cough, we suggest that chronic cough be defined as being > 8 weeks in duration (Grade 2C). For adult patients seeking medical care complaining of cough, we suggest that estimating the duration of cough is the first step in narrowing the list of potential diagnoses (Grade 2C). For adult patients around the globe complaining of cough, we suggest that the cough be managed using evidence-based guidelines that are based upon duration of cough (Grade 2C).

### Synthesis and meta-analysis of 3 randomized trials conducted in burkina faso, Ghana, and Uganda comparing the effects of point-of-care tests and diagnostic algorithms versus routine care on antibiotic prescriptions and clinical outcomes in ambulatory patients [^4a08c340]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

When used for acute respiratory infections in primary care settings (mostly in high-income countries), the use of CRP testing produced a reduction in antibiotic prescriptions over routine care at the time of consultation (RR, 0.79 [95% CI,.7–.9]; number needed to test to benefit, 8) but also generating significantly more reconsultations within 30 days (number needed to test to harm, 27); in our study we did not follow up patients up beyond day 7. Another systematic review showed consistent results in ambulatory care services (RR, 0.81 [95% CI,.71–.92]), with improvements in effects when guidance on antibiotic prescribing was provided (0.68 [.63–.74] in adults and 0.56 [.33–.95] in children).

These results are consistent with a previous Cochrane systematic review that found an RR of 0.78 (95% CI,.66–.92) for antibiotic prescriptions with CRP testing versus routine care overall but no significant effect when restricting the analysis to randomized trials (RR 0.90, 95% CI.80–1.02). In a context closer to our study conditions, ie, in children < 5 years of age with acute febrile illness in an outpatient clinic in Tanzania, CRP testing in combination with procalcitonin and other tests (as directed by an electronic algorithm) produced a 43% reduction in clinical failure and a reduction in antibiotic use (RR,.39 [95% CI,.33–.45]) compared with the use of an electronic algorithm derived from the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness guidelines. However, it should be noted that antibiotic prescription rates in this study were much lower than in our settings (11.5% and 29.5%, respectively, in the 2 arms). Yet even in the groups where significant gains were obtained, antibiotic prescriptions in the 3 studies remain considerably higher than expected based on CRP levels — 8 patients in 10 overall had CRP levels < 20 mg/L, and 7 in 10 had levels < 10 mg/L, which would normally indicate a nonbacterial infection, thus not requiring antibiotics.

CHEST guideline — recommendation development used a structured consensus-based modified Delphi approach, and for a recommendation or suggestion to be approved by the Expert Cough Panel, "75% of the eligible panel members had to vote, and 80% of those voting had to strongly agree or agree with the statement". Within this framework, "a strong recommendation applies to almost all patients, whereas a weak recommendation is conditional and applies to only some patients", with strength "based on consideration of three factors: balance of benefits to harms, patient values and preferences, and resource considerations", where harms can include "convenience or lack of convenience, difficulty of administration, and invasiveness", resource considerations "go beyond economics and should also factor in time and other indirect costs", and a patient representative "provided patient-centered input".

Evidence profiles and grading — evidence profiles were produced using the GRADE profiler software customized specifically for CHEST, and the CHEST-modified software ranked the quality of the body of evidence using high, moderate, and low categories as opposed to GRADE's high, moderate, low, and very low, with assessment based on risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency or heterogeneity across studies, indirectness relative to the PICO question, and reporting or publication bias. Generally, RCTs begin as high-level evidence but can be downgraded based on these criteria, and observational studies start as lower level evidence but can be upgraded if not deficient in other areas, there is a large magnitude of effect, there is a statistically significant effect even with bias, or there is a dose-response gradient; evidence profiles include a quality assessment table and a summary of findings table with relative and absolute effects for each critically important outcome.

### Adult outpatients with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia or influenza: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^f60354b2]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Acute cough outpatients — PICO question 1 (chest radiograph plus clinical judgment vs clinical judgment alone) — the search retrieved 43 publications and identified 19 studies for full‑text review, but no studies met all criteria and no articles directly addressed the question. One randomized controlled trial (RCT) partially addressed it: patients had chest radiographs and the treating team was randomly assigned as to whether they received the chest radiograph result; overall, the provision of chest radiograph results did not lead to better patient outcomes or significantly different treatment strategies. Among patients for whom a chest radiograph would not be ordered routinely, approximately 2% had an infiltrate. The authors concluded that it is safe to not obtain a chest radiograph for all patients with acute cough illness and recommended limiting chest radiographs to situations in which the history and physical examination suggest the need for antibiotic treatment and a chest radiograph would alter this decision; in a small subset of patients, a chest radiograph provides added diagnostic value in addition to clinical judgment in the management of adults with acute cough.

### Effect of point-of-care C-reactive protein testing on antibiotic prescription in febrile patients attending primary care in Thailand and Myanmar: an open-label, randomised, controlled trial [^d60bad27]. The Lancet: Global Health (2019). High credibility.

The risk of serious bacterial infection in patients in primary care without clear clinical danger signs is low, and the majority of patients in the trial had low CRP concentrations on day 0 (< 20 mg/L in 72% of patients and < 40 mg/L in 86%; appendix). As CRP is known to be of high sensitivity but only moderate specificity in the detection of bacterial infections, the higher threshold of 40 mg/L is likely to be appropriate for these settings, and stricter adherence to test results at this threshold would generate larger reductions in prescribing, as shown in the per-protocol analysis (> 20% reduction for the primary outcome between group B and the control group; appendix). This reduction in prescribing might be achieved in scale-up programmes driven by local health authorities supported by high-level policy change. Integrating CRP testing into clinical guidelines could also enhance prescribers' confidence, as might electronic user-friendly algorithms that strengthen the consistency of fever management. Clinical and communication skills training could also enhance compliance with these algorithms.

A systematic review of studies on biomarker testing in febrile children in emergency departments, all in high-income settings, concluded that CRP testing could be diagnostically useful, recommending a low threshold of 5 mg/L to rule out serious infection and a threshold of 80 mg/L to suggest the presence of serious infection. A cluster randomised trial in Belgium concluded that CRP testing in primary care should be targeted at children at high risk of severe infection after clinical assessment. This targeting could also avoid medicalisation of minor ailments. A multicountry European study showed enhanced pneumonia prediction in patients in primary care presenting with acute cough when CRP testing was added to a clinical algorithm based on symptoms alone. This risk stratification relied on the availability of experienced clinicians. In Thailand, which has a well-developed public health sector, such strategies could be relevant, with adequate supervision of health-care providers' clinical skills combined with clear referral and follow-up systems to ensure patient safety. The low number of prescriptions in the Thai control group suggests that reductions in prescribing could be attained with better training, supervision, or financial incentives, with CRP testing offering modest additional gains.

### New biomarkers for respiratory infections [^9804feba]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although pneumonia, either community or hospital-acquired, is the most frequent severe respiratory infection, it is an infection difficult to diagnose. At present, the diagnosis of pneumonia relies on a combination of clinical, radiologic, and microbiologic criteria. However, these criteria are far from perfect leading to uncertainty in the diagnosis, risk stratification, and choice of antibiotic therapy. Biomarkers have been used to bring additional information in this setting.

Recent Findings

The aim of this review is to provide a clear overview of the current evidence for biomarkers to distinguish between patients in several clinical scenarios: to exclude pneumonia in order to withhold antibiotics, to identify the causative pathogen to target antimicrobial treatment, to identify phenotypes of inflammatory response to facilitate adjunctive treatments, to stratify the risk of severe pneumonia and provide the adequate level of care, and to monitor treatment response and de-escalate antibiotic therapy.

Summary

In recent years the number of new biomarkers increased markedly in different areas like pathogen identification or host response. Although far from the ideal, there are several promising areas that could represent true evolutions in the management of pneumonia, in the near future.

There were bilateral interscapular crackles and chest X-ray evidence of bilateral mid and lower zone non-homogeneous opacity. The patient's pulmonary function test (PFT) showed moderate restrictions and desaturation. CT was suggestive of organising pneumonia and drug administration was stopped. The patient was treated with steroids in tapering doses, which led to improvements. The drug was restarted with the probability of other aetiologies for interstetial lung disease (ILD). It was also considered the superior efficacy of ribociclib in managing breast cancer. But due to evidence indicating the reappearance of organising pneumonia following drug administration, it was again stopped, and steroid use was restarted for treatment. The patient showed improvements in subsequent follow-ups.

Assessment of clinical signs and symptoms — Acute Q fever in adults occurs symptomatically in approximately half of infected persons and, after an incubation period of 2–3 weeks, most commonly presents as a nonspecific febrile illness that might occur with pneumonia or hepatitis. In North America in the 1980s, among 1,306 hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia cases, 30 cases (2.3%) were acute Q fever, and cough is often nonproductive in 50% of patients. Fever in untreated patients lasts a median of 10 days (range: 5–57 days), with the majority defervescing within 72 hours of doxycycline; duration increases with age, with 60% of patients aged > 40 years having fever > 14 days compared with 29% aged < 40 years. Rash occurs in 5%–21% of patients. Mortality is < 2%, and during the Netherlands outbreak of approximately 4,000 reported cases up to 50% of acute Q fever patients were hospitalized. Common diagnostic coding in one U.S. military series included fever, not otherwise specified (780.6); pneumonia, organism unspecified (486); and viral infection, not otherwise specified (079.99).

Results

Patients' characteristics

During three winters (October to April) from 2007 to 2010, 294 general practitioners initially recruited 3106 adult patients. Recruitment of each participant and baseline assessments took about half an hour. Hence, in the busiest periods, time pressures resulted in only a portion of the potentially eligible patients being screened and limited completion of non-recruitment logs. The main reason reported by general practitioners for not screening was "lack of time" (rated first by 44/48, 92%), with only three (6%) reporting that individual clinical considerations limited recruitment. The population had similar clinical characteristics to the previous observational cohort recruited in these primary care networksand other cohorts with lower respiratory tract infection in primary care: the mean age of patients was 50 (SD 17) and 40% were men (table 1). A follow-up of 28 days showed no mortality, and 11 patients (0.5%) were admitted to hospital. Patients who were excluded because radiography was not performed (n = 258) or was of insufficient quality (n = 28) (fig 1) were no different, apart from age (see appendix 2).

Fig 1 Recruitment and flow of participants with acute cough to determine diagnosis of pneumonia

Prevalence of pneumonia

Of the 2820 participants, 140 had pneumonia (5%). After reassessment, the diagnosis of presence or absence of pneumonia was concordant in 1571 of 1675 patients (94%). The positive agreement (49%) was much lower than negative agreement (97%). Cohen's unweighted κ was 0.45 (moderate agreement) (95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.54). Other diagnoses on chest radiography were "acute bronchitis" in 217 patients (8%) and "other diagnosis" in 462 patients (16%), of which chronic bronchitis/emphysema, cardiomegaly, atelectasis, fibrotic changes (such as old tuberculosis), and aortic changes were most commonly reported. The chest radiograph was reported as normal for 2023 (72%) patients. Most (2555, 91%)) patients underwent chest radiography within five days, and the mean duration between the first consultation for acute cough and chest radiography was 1.6 days (SD 2.6). There was no correlation between the time until radiography and presence of radiographic pneumonia (P = 0.63).

C-reactive protein (CRP) in adult ICU patients — test characteristics and kinetics: Plasma CRP levels start to rise 12 — 24 hours after an acute inflammatory or infectious insult, reaching a maximum value after 48 hours. Levels of CRP are typically below 5 mg/L and the typical cutoff for CRP is 10 mg/L. Like PCT, results are available within minutes with point-of-care assays or within an hour with laboratory-based assays; laboratory assays are quantitative and suitable for serial monitoring. Unlike PCT, CRP concentrations can be affected by neutropenia, immunodeficiency, and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Respiratory:

CHRONIC, SUBACUTE, OR ACUTE PULMONARY HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS MAY OCCUR. CHRONIC PULMONARY REACTIONS MAY OCCUR GENERALLY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE RECEIVED CONTINUOUS TREATMENT FOR SIX MONTHS OR LONGER. MALAISE, DYSPNEA ON EXERTION, COUGH, AND ALTERED PULMONARY FUNCTION ARE COMMON MANIFESTATIONS WHICH CAN OCCUR INSIDIOUSLY. RADIOLOGIC AND HISTOLOGIC FINDINGS OF DIFFUSE INTERSTITIAL PNEUMONITIS OR FIBROSIS, OR BOTH, ARE ALSO COMMON MANIFESTATIONS OF THE CHRONIC PULMONARY REACTION. FEVER IS RARELY PROMINENT.

THE SEVERITY OF CHRONIC PULMONARY REACTIONS AND THEIR DEGREES OF RESOLUTION APPEAR TO BE RELATED TO THE DURATION OF THERAPY AFTER THE FIRST CLINICAL SIGNS APPEAR. PULMONARY FUNCTION MAY BE IMPAIRED PERMANENTLY, EVEN AFTER CESSATION OF THERAPY. THE RISK IS GREATER WHEN CHRONIC PULMONARY REACTIONS ARE NOT RECOGNIZED EARLY.

In subacute pulmonary reactions, fever and eosinophilia occur less often than in the acute form. Upon cessation of therapy, recovery may require several months. If the symptoms are not recognized as being drug-related and nitrofurantoin therapy is not stopped, the symptoms may become more severe.

Acute pulmonary reactions are commonly manifested by fever, chills, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltration with consolidation of pleural effusion on x-ray, and eosinophilia. Acute reactions usually occur within the first week of treatment and are reversible with cessation of therapy. Resolution often is dramatic. (See WARNINGS .)

### Impact of procalcitonin on the management of children aged 1 to 36 months presenting with fever without source: a randomized controlled trial [^820057da]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of procalcitonin (PCT) measurement on antibiotic use in children with fever without source.

Method

Children aged 1 to 36 months presenting to a pediatric emergency department (ED) with fever and no identified source of infection were eligible to be included in a randomized controlled trial. Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups as follows: PCT+ (result revealed to the attending physician) and PCT- (result not revealed). Patients from both groups also had complete blood count, blood culture, urine analysis, and culture performed. Chest radiography or lumbar puncture could be performed if required.

Results

Of the 384 children enrolled and equally randomized into the PCT+ and PCT- groups, 62 (16%) were diagnosed with a serious bacterial infection (urinary tract infection, pneumonia, occult bacteremia, or bacterial meningitis) by primary ED investigation. Ten were also found to be neutropenic (< 500 x 10(6)/L). Of the remaining undiagnosed patients, 14 (9%) of 158 received antibiotics in the PCT+ group vs 16 (10%) of 154 in the PCT- group (Delta -2%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -8 to 5). A strategy to treat all patients with PCT of 0.5 ng/mL or greater with prophylactic antibiotic in this group of patients would have resulted in an increase in antibiotic use by 24% (95% CI, 15–33).

Conclusion

Semiquantitative PCT measurement had no impact on antibiotic use in children aged 1 to 36 months who presented with fever without source. However, a strategy to use prophylactic antibiotics in all patients with abnormal PCT results would have resulted in an increase use of antibiotics.

### Efficacy and safety of procalcitonin guidance in reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment in critically ill patients: a randomised, controlled, open-label trial [^1847d899]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

In critically ill patients, antibiotic therapy is of great importance but long duration of treatment is associated with the development of antimicrobial resistance. Procalcitonin is a marker used to guide antibacterial therapy and reduce its duration, but data about safety of this reduction are scarce. We assessed the efficacy and safety of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment in patients in intensive care units (ICUs) in a health-care system with a comparatively low use of antibiotics.

Methods

We did a prospective, multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label intervention trial in 15 hospitals in the Netherlands. Critically ill patients aged at least 18 years, admitted to the ICU, and who received their first dose of antibiotics no longer than 24 h before inclusion in the study for an assumed or proven infection were eligible to participate. Patients who received antibiotics for presumed infection were randomly assigned (1:1), using a computer-generated list, and stratified (according to treatment centre, whether infection was acquired before or during ICU stay, and dependent on severity of infection [ie, sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock]) to receive either procalcitonin-guided or standard-of-care antibiotic discontinuation. Both patients and investigators were aware of group assignment. In the procalcitonin-guided group, a non-binding advice to discontinue antibiotics was provided if procalcitonin concentration had decreased by 80% or more of its peak value or to 0·5 μg/L or lower. In the standard-of-care group, patients were treated according to local antibiotic protocols. Primary endpoints were antibiotic daily defined doses and duration of antibiotic treatment. All analyses were done by intention to treat. Mortality analyses were completed for all patients (intention to treat) and for patients in whom antibiotics were stopped while being on the ICU (per-protocol analysis). Safety endpoints were reinstitution of antibiotics and recurrent inflammation measured by C-reactive protein concentrations and they were measured in the population adhering to the stopping rules (per-protocol analysis). The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01139489, and was completed in August, 2014.

Findings

Between Sept 18, 2009, and July 1, 2013, 1575 of the 4507 patients assessed for eligibility were randomly assigned to the procalcitonin-guided group (761) or to standard-of-care (785). In 538 patients (71%) in the procalcitonin-guided group antibiotics were discontinued in the ICU. Median consumption of antibiotics was 7·5 daily defined doses (IQR 4·0–12·7) in the procalcitonin-guided group versus 9·3 daily defined doses (5·0–16·6) in the standard-of-care group (between-group absolute difference 2·69, 95% CI 1·26–4·12, p < 0·0001). Median duration of treatment was 5 days (3–9) in the procalcitonin-guided group and 7 days (4–11) in the standard-of-care group (between-group absolute difference 1·22, 0·65–1·78, p < 0·0001). Mortality at 28 days was 149 (20%) of 761 patients in the procalcitonin-guided group and 196 (25%) of 785 patients in the standard-of-care group (between-group absolute difference 5·4%, 95% CI 1·2–9·5, p = 0·0122) according to the intention-to-treat analysis, and 107 (20%) of 538 patients in the procalcitonin-guided group versus 121 (27%) of 457 patients in the standard-of-care group (between-group absolute difference 6·6%, 1·3–11·9, p = 0·0154) in the per-protocol analysis. 1-year mortality in the per-protocol analysis was 191 (36%) of 538 patients in the procalcitonin-guided and 196 (43%) of 457 patients in the standard-of-care groups (between-group absolute difference 7·4, 1·3–13·8, p = 0·0188).

Interpretation

Procalcitonin guidance stimulates reduction of duration of treatment and daily defined doses in critically ill patients with a presumed bacterial infection. This reduction was associated with a significant decrease in mortality. Procalcitonin concentrations might help physicians in deciding whether or not the presumed infection is truly bacterial, leading to more adequate diagnosis and treatment, the cornerstones of antibiotic stewardship.

### Bacterial complications of respiratory tract viral illness: a comprehensive evaluation [^4a438e1f]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Respiratory tract infection is one of the most common reasons for hospitalization among adults, and recent evidence suggests that many of these illnesses are associated with viruses. Although bacterial infection is known to complicate viral infections, the frequency and impact of mixed viral-bacterial infections has not been well studied.

Methods

Adults hospitalized with respiratory illness during 3 winters underwent comprehensive viral and bacterial testing. This assessment was augmented by measuring the serum level of procalcitonin (PCT) as a marker of bacterial infection. Mixed viral-bacterial infection was defined as a positive viral test result plus a positive bacterial assay result or a serum PCT level of ≥ 0.25 ng/mL on admission or day 2 of hospitalization.

Results

Of 842 hospitalizations (771 patients) evaluated, 348 (41%) had evidence of viral infection. A total of 212 hospitalizations (61%) involved patients with viral infection alone. Of the remaining 136 hospitalizations (39%) involving viral infection, results of bacterial tests were positive in 64 (18%), and PCT analysis identified bacterial infection in an additional 72 (21%). Subjects hospitalized with mixed viral-bacterial infections were older and more commonly received a diagnosis of pneumonia. Over 90% of hospitalizations in both groups involved subjects who received antibiotics. Notably, 4 of 10 deaths among subjects hospitalized with viral infection alone were secondary to complications of Clostridium difficile colitis.

Conclusions

Bacterial coinfection is associated with approximately 40% of viral respiratory tract infections requiring hospitalization. Patients with positive results of viral tests should be carefully evaluated for concomitant bacterial infection. Early empirical antibiotic therapy for patients with an unstable condition is appropriate but is not without risk.

A moderate recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and the quality of evidence is good but not excellent (or is unobtainable)", implying "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a moderate recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". A weak recommendation (based on low-quality evidence) is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa), but the quality of evidence is weak", with the implication "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a weak recommendation but should remain alert to new information and very sensitive to patient preferences". A weak recommendation (based on balance of benefits and harms) is defined as "Weak recommendation is provided when the aggregate database shows evidence of both benefit and harm that appear to be similar in magnitude for any available courses of action", implying "Clinicians should consider the options in their decision-making, but patient preference may have a substantial role".
