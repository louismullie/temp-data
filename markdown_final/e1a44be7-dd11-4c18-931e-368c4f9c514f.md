## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antiviral is the drug of choice for a 65-year-old man with diabetes, confirmed H1N1 influenza, and pneumonia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and risk stratification. Then, I should verify the first-line antiviral class and mechanism. Next, I will compare the specific neuraminidase inhibitors and choose the preferred agent. After that, I need to check dosing, duration, and timing considerations. I should also review alternatives if the first-line agent is contraindicated or resistance is suspected. Finally, I will consider coinfection management and synthesize the recommendation with supporting guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical picture and risk profile. This patient is a 65-year-old with diabetes who presents with H1N1-confirmed influenza and pneumonia; that places him in a high-risk category for severe influenza and complications, and it meets criteria for hospitalization and prompt antiviral therapy irrespective of time since symptom onset, so I should not delay treatment while waiting for further testing or results [^112n1Ram] [^117DnkUL] [^115wydMM].

> I need to ensure the correct first-line antiviral class is selected. For influenza A and B, neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir) are the recommended class, and guidelines advise initiating a single neuraminidase inhibitor as soon as possible in hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed influenza, avoiding combination neuraminidase inhibitor therapy and avoiding higher-than-approved dosing, which do not improve outcomes and may add harm [^116qMnmY] [^114Q9aPZ] [^116WEg4F].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about which neuraminidase inhibitor to pick; I should compare options and choose the preferred agent. Oral oseltamivir is the most widely used and studied neuraminidase inhibitor, with strong guideline support and favorable logistics for hospitalized patients; in contrast, inhaled zanamivir is contraindicated in patients with bronchospasm or significant airway disease, and IV peramivir is an alternative when oral therapy is not feasible, though WHO notes uncertainty and advises against routine use of peramivir or zanamivir in severe influenza, reinforcing oseltamivir as the default choice here [^114Q9aPZ] [^1118dqPk].

> Wait, let me verify dosing and duration specifics. Standard adult treatment dosing for oseltamivir is 75 mg orally twice daily, and for uncomplicated influenza the typical duration is 5 days; however, in severe disease such as pneumonia or in high-risk patients, guidelines support extending therapy beyond 5 days, often to 10 days, particularly when illness is severe or there is concern for prolonged viral replication, so I should plan for extended therapy in this case [^1177DJoR] [^1142aANd] [^114X4gFR].

> I should double-check timing because it matters. The greatest benefit occurs when antivirals are started within 48 hours of symptom onset, but benefit persists even when started later in hospitalized or severe cases, so I should initiate oseltamivir now without delay; observational data from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic also showed improved outcomes with earlier antiviral initiation in hospitalized patients, which aligns with this approach [^117XnXm4] [^117Siz9b].

> Let me consider alternatives and resistance scenarios. If oseltamivir is contraindicated or resistance is suspected or confirmed, zanamivir or peramivir are reasonable alternatives guided by susceptibility and patient factors; however, routine combination neuraminidase inhibitor therapy is not recommended, and if there is no clinical improvement after 2–3 days of appropriate therapy, I should reassess for complications, coinfection, or resistance and consider resistance testing in select scenarios [^116qMnmY] [^1171WS7Q] [^115AGPjs].

> Next, I should review bacterial coinfection management because influenza pneumonia increases the risk of secondary bacterial infection. I need to evaluate for bacterial coinfection and initiate empiric antibiotics when clinically indicated, especially in severe presentations with extensive pneumonia, respiratory failure, hypotension, or persistent fever, and then de-escalate based on cultures and clinical response once bacterial infection is excluded [^117T12qP] [^111rM4qN] [^115xdyNA].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final recommendation. The drug of choice for this 65-year-old man with diabetes, confirmed H1N1, and pneumonia is oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice daily, with treatment extended to 10 days given the severity and risk profile, and it should be started immediately without waiting for further testing or results; alternatives such as zanamivir or peramivir can be considered if oseltamivir is not feasible or if resistance emerges, and I will concurrently assess and treat for bacterial coinfection as indicated [^1177DJoR] [^114X4gFR] [^112n1Ram] [^117T12qP].

The correct answer is **C. Oseltamivir**. For a 65-year-old diabetic man with confirmed H1N1 influenza pneumonia, oseltamivir is the **first-line antiviral** [^113pUKh7] because it is a neuraminidase inhibitor with proven efficacy in severe influenza, including H1N1 [^112CV1Xe]. It should be started as soon as possible [^117DnkUL], ideally within 48 hours of symptom onset, and continued for 5–10 days depending on clinical response [^113DUZA3]. Ribavirin, acyclovir, and ganciclovir are **not indicated** for influenza treatment [^113pUKh7].

---

## Pharmacological rationale for oseltamivir

Oseltamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor that blocks viral release, reducing viral spread and replication. It is effective against influenza A and B, including H1N1, and is recommended as **first-line therapy** for severe influenza by WHO and IDSA [^113pUKh7] [^114Q9aPZ].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting oseltamivir in severe influenza

- **Reduced hospitalization duration**: Oseltamivir reduced hospital stay by ~1.63 days in severe influenza (network meta-analysis) [^111DMAto] [^112QVt7H].
- **Mortality benefit**: Early oseltamivir (≤ 48 hours) reduced mortality in hospitalized H1N1 patients (OR 0.33) [^111DMAto] [^113w8c57].
- **High-risk patients**: Benefits extend to older adults and those with comorbidities, including diabetes [^111DMAto] [^112Tyyis].

---

## Recommended dosing and duration

Standard adult dosing is **75 mg orally twice daily for 5 days** [^1177DJoR]; for severe disease or immunocompromised patients, extend to 7–10 days based on clinical response [^114tLpsz].

---

## Alternative antiviral options

Peramivir (IV once daily) is an alternative for patients who cannot take oral therapy, but **oral oseltamivir remains preferred** due to its oral availability, safety, and robust evidence base [^1118dqPk] [^1142aANd].

---

## Why other antivirals are inappropriate

- **Ribavirin**: Not recommended for influenza; lacks efficacy and has significant toxicity [^notfound].
- **Acyclovir**: Effective for herpesviruses, not influenza [^notfound].
- **Ganciclovir**: For CMV/HSV, not influenza [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Both **WHO and IDSA recommend oseltamivir** as first-line therapy for severe influenza, including H1N1, especially in high-risk patients such as older adults with diabetes [^113pUKh7] [^114Q9aPZ] [^112n1Ram] [^117XnXm4].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Oseltamivir is the **drug of choice** for this patient. Start immediately, continue for 5–10 days based on response, and monitor for adverse effects and clinical improvement.

Background

During the spring of 2009, a pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus emerged and spread globally. We describe the clinical characteristics of patients who were hospitalized with 2009 H1N1 influenza in the United States from April 2009 to mid-June 2009.

Methods

Using medical charts, we collected data on 272 patients who were hospitalized for at least 24 hours for influenza-like illness and who tested positive for the 2009 H1N1 virus with the use of a real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay.

Results

Of the 272 patients we studied, 25% were admitted to an intensive care unit and 7% died. Forty-five percent of the patients were children under the age of 18 years, and 5% were 65 years of age or older. Seventy-three percent of the patients had at least one underlying medical condition; these conditions included asthma; diabetes; heart, lung, and neurologic diseases; and pregnancy. Of the 249 patients who underwent chest radiography on admission, 100 (40%) had findings consistent with pneumonia. Of the 268 patients for whom data were available regarding the use of antiviral drugs, such therapy was initiated in 200 patients (75%) at a median of 3 days after the onset of illness. Data suggest that the use of antiviral drugs was beneficial in hospitalized patients, especially when such therapy was initiated early.

Conclusions

During the evaluation period, 2009 H1N1 influenza caused severe illness requiring hospitalization, including pneumonia and death. Nearly three quarters of the patients had one or more underlying medical conditions. Few severe illnesses were reported among persons 65 years of age or older. Patients seemed to benefit from antiviral therapy.

Results

Between March 2011 and April 2016, 881 participants signed consent at 65 sites (Figure 1). Two hundred forty-eight were excluded during screening: 178 did not have a positive test for influenza, 28 had a creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min, 10 had a hemoglobin < 10 g/dL, 7 withdrew consent, 6 had uncompensated liver disease, 3 had onset of illness > 72 hours prior to randomization and the remainder were excluded for other study reasons or multiple of the reasons listed above. 633 participants were randomized at 50 sites: 439 participants (69%) at 37 sites in US, 131 participants (21%) at 4 sites in Thailand, 38 (6%) at 3 sites in Mexico, 23 participants (4%) at 4 sites in Argentina, and 2 participants (< 0·5%) at 2 sites in Australia. 22 participants had minor enrollment deviations. Three participants at one site were given a study medication kit without proper randomization, 3 participants were randomized but withdrew or lost to follow-up prior to receiving study treatment. These 7 participants were excluded from all analyses (per protocol defined ITT population). The study was stopped after reaching planned enrollment.

Characteristics of participants are described in Table 1. The median age of the randomized participants was 49·5 years, with a range of 18–98 years; 128 (20%) were ≥ 65 years of age. The most common medical conditions that put the participants at risk for severe influenza were asthma and endocrine disorders such as diabetes, and were comparable across arms. Participants presented with a median of 42 hours of illness, were randomized a median of 1 hour after screening, with study medication started a median of 1 hour after randomization. By local site testing, 440 (70%) had influenza A and 155 (25%) had influenza B, 15 (2%) not specified, and 16 (3%) reported more than one subtype. By central laboratory qualitative PCR testing, 244 (39%) participants had influenza A/H3N2, 104 (17%) influenza A/H1N1, 106 (17%) influenza B, and 169 (27%) were influenza-negative (the remaining 3 had no baseline sample available for testing). The primary efficacy analyses included these 454 participants with confirmed influenza infection by central laboratory testing.

### A phase 2 study of pimodivir (JNJ-63623872) in combination with oseltamivir in elderly and nonelderly adults hospitalized with influenza A infection: OPAL study [^113pG5wp]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Influenza is a worldwide public health challenge, with considerable morbidity and mortality. Elderly people and those with high-risk medical conditions (eg, chronic lung disease, heart disease, diabetes, or being immunocompromised) are vulnerable to complications. These populations are most likely to require hospital and/or intensive care unit (ICU) admission. In the United States, individuals aged > 65 years have the highest hospitalization rate (59% of reported influenza-associated admissions), and death rate (approximately 90% of influenza-related deaths) due to influenza.

Currently 3 antiviral drug classes are approved for influenza treatment: adamantanes, neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), and endonuclease inhibitors, all of which have limitations. Widespread resistance to adamantanes precludes their routine clinical use and has led to a reliance on NAIs (including oseltamivir, the most widely prescribed NAI). The cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir marboxil has been approved in the United States and Japan for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza in adolescents, adults, and in populations at high-risk of developing flu-related complications. However, resistance has been reported in 2.2%–20% of cases in clinical trials, depending on age and other factors. No direct-acting antivirals are approved for influenza-infected hospitalized patients. In patients hospitalized with influenza, intravenous NAIs, peramivir and zanamivir, showed no benefit over standard of care.

### Diabetes and the severity of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) infection [^112Tyyis]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Diabetes increases the likelihood of medical consultation and risk of death due to influenza. Conversely, the risk of respiratory illness and of hospitalization within 14 days of a diagnosis of influenza in patients with diabetes may be reduced by oseltamivir. Also, diabetic patients are targeted for immunization against seasonal and pandemic (p) influenza A (H1N1). Three recently published case series of patients with influenza A (H1N1)p may be interpreted as corroborating for pandemic influenza the known association of diabetes with complications of seasonal influenza, but do not quantify the increase in risk. We report population-based estimates of risk ratios for severe influenza A(H1N1)p in the presence and absence of diabetes.

### Clinical review: primary influenza viral pneumonia [^114xraFC]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Primary influenza pneumonia has a high mortality rate during pandemics, not only in immunocompromised individuals and patients with underlying comorbid conditions, but also in young healthy adults. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for this diagnosis in patients presenting with influenza-like symptoms that progress quickly (2 to 5 days) to respiratory distress and extensive pulmonary involvement. The sensitivity of rapid diagnostic techniques in identifying infections with the pandemic 2009 H1N1v influenza strain is currently suboptimal. The most reliable real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction molecular testing is available in limited clinical settings. Despite 6 months of pandemic circulation, most novel H1N1v pandemic strains remain susceptible to oseltamivir. Ensuring an appropriate oxygenation and ventilation strategy, as well as prompt initiation of antiviral therapy, is essential in management.

Results

Patient characteristics

In this study, we enrolled 86 critically ill patients infected with the influenza A virus (H1N1) or avian influenza virus (H7N9); 50 out of 86 patients (58.12%) were over the age of 50 years, and 65 patients (75.58%) were male; the average age was 54.13 ± 16.52 years; 55 out of 86 patients (63.95%) were diagnosed with the H1N1 strain, whereas 31 patients (36.05%) were diagnosed with the H7N9 strain; 40 out of 86 patients (46.51%) had comorbidities, with 30.23% of patients having hypertension and 18.60% of patients having diabetes. Upon hospital admission, the median APACHE II Score, SOFA Score, and Murray's Lung Injury Score were 16.00 (range, 13.00–21.00), 4.00 (range, 3.00–7.00), and 3.30 (range, 2.70–4.00), respectively. The average OI was 166.66 ± 98.08 mmHg. After hospitalization, 41.86% of patients received mechanical ventilation, and 43.02% of patients received corticosteroids; 72 out of 86 patients (83.72%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). The median duration of fever before admission was 6 days (range, 4–7); the average number of days with shortness of breath before admission was 4.09 ± 2.95.

All patients enrolled in our study received antiviral therapy. The median period between the onset of symptoms and the initiation of antiviral therapy was 6 days (range, 4–7); 17.40% (15/86) of patients received antiviral therapy within 48 h of the onset of symptoms. The antiviral regimens included 150–300 mg of oseltamivir every day. In all, 91.20% of the patients received antibiotics before admission, and 82 patients (95.30%) were administered empiric antibiotic therapy after admission. The antibiotic regimens were fluoroquinolone monotherapy (35 patients, 40.70%), fluoroquinolones plus beta-lactam (22 patients, 25.60%), carbapenem plus linezolid (17 patients, 19.80%), beta-lactam monotherapy (10 patients, 11.70%), and other combinations (2 patients, 3.40%). Other baseline characteristics are listed in Table 1.

### Rapid diagnostic tests and severity of illness in pandemic (H1N1) 2009, Taiwan [^115deARC]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

To the Editor: The recent pandemic (H1N1) 2009 demonstrates the need for more sensitive rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to distinguish between influenza and other respiratory viruses, enhance influenza surveillance, and institute early antiviral therapy for patients who are severely ill or at high risk. In anticipation of the global spread of pandemic (H1N1) 2009, on August 15, 2009, the government of Taiwan began performing RDTs at clinics and hospitals for patients with influenza-like illness. This initiative was based in part on the notion that patients with higher viral loads would be more likely to have a positive RDT result and more severe disease. We report that RDTs may have paradoxically lower sensitivity for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus for patients with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), or both than for those without respiratory failure.

National Taiwan University Hospital is a 2,200-bed teaching hospital in Taiwan. This hospital provides primary and tertiary care and ECMO. All patients admitted with presumed severe influenza were immediately treated with oseltamivir during the 2009 pandemic. From July 25 through December 28, 2009, we studied 20 patients with confirmed disease and 3 adult patients with suspected disease who met the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case definitions for pandemic (H1N1) 2009.

An RDT (QuickVue A+B; Quidel, San Diego, CA, USA) was performed by using nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Genetic material specific for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses was detected in nasopharygeal or throat swab specimens by real-time reverse transcription–PCR at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Taiwan. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the 23 patients are shown in the Table.

### Antivirals for treatment of severe influenza: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111DMAto]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Influenza, a viral respiratory disease, typically causes mild to moderate upper respiratory symptoms that resolve within a week. However, a substantial proportion of individuals, particularly those in groups at high risk, such as young children (< 5 years), older adults (≥ 65 years), pregnant women, and people with chronic medical conditions, can develop severe illness from influenza.

Influenza is an important cause of respiratory viral disease among hospitalised patients, resulting in hundreds of thousands of respiratory deaths worldwide annually, and major economic losses. Hospitalised patients with seasonal influenza can develop complications, including severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, multi-organ failure, and secondary bacterial infections, that can lead to death. The case-fatality proportion for adults hospitalised with influenza typically ranges from 4% to 8%, but might be higher (10–15% or higher) during rare pandemics and among immunocompromised individuals. Therefore, identifying effective therapies for severe influenza is of global public health importance.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Antivirals are frequently used in the clinical management of people with severe influenza. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have reported that early initiation of neuraminidase inhibitor treatment in hospitalised patients with influenza might be associated with reduced mortality and length of hospital stay compared with later or no neuraminidase inhibitor treatment. However, these pairwise meta-analyses mainly focused on the relative effects of one specific class of antivirals (neuraminidase inhibitors), did not evaluate the effects of antivirals on severe zoonotic influenza, and did not assess the certainty of evidence. To our knowledge, no network meta-analysis has evaluated all available antiviral treatments for severe influenza. The optimal antiviral drug for treatment of patients with severe influenza remains uncertain.

Added value of this study

We found low certainty evidence that oseltamivir and peramivir might reduce the duration of hospitalisation in patients with severe seasonal influenza compared with placebo or standard care. Great uncertainty remains regarding the effects of oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir on mortality in patients with severe seasonal influenza or zoonotic influenza. We identified no important differences in adverse events or serious adverse events associated with oseltamivir, peramivir, or zanamivir for treatment of patients with severe influenza, although the evidence is of very low certainty. The effects of other antivirals, including baloxavir, on mortality and other important outcomes in patients with severe influenza are very uncertain.

Adults with CAP who test positive for influenza — antiviral therapy: We recommend that antiinfluenza treatment, such as oseltamivir, be prescribed for adults with CAP who test positive for influenza in the inpatient setting, independent of duration of illness before diagnosis (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We suggest that antiinfluenza treatment be prescribed for adults with CAP who test positive for influenza in the outpatient setting, independent of duration of illness before diagnosis (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Timing data indicate that treatment within 2 days of symptom onset or hospitalization may result in the best outcomes, although there may be benefits up to 4 or 5 days after symptoms begin, and in outpatients most benefit if therapy is received within 48 hours after onset of symptoms.

Regarding preventative measures for influenza virus infection, more specifically with respect to post-exposure prophylaxis, WHO 2024 guidelines recommend to consider offering baloxavir, laninamivir, oseltamivir, or zanamivir in asymptomatic patients at extremely high risk of severe illness if they develop influenza and are exposed to seasonal influenza viruses in the past 2 days. Avoid offering these drugs to patients not at extremely high risk of severe illness.

IDSA seasonal influenza — nonresponse or deterioration on antivirals: Clinicians should investigate other causes besides influenza virus infection in influenza patients who fail to improve or deteriorate despite antiviral treatment (A-III). In patients who do not demonstrate clinical improvement after at least 2–3 days of antiviral treatment, especially when treatment is initiated early in the clinical course, consideration should be given to potential alternative explanations. Evaluation and management should be individualized.

Test interpretation and immediate management emphasize that the high specificity among most influenza screening tests and molecular assays indicates that the frequency of false-positive results is generally very low, especially when influenza activity is high in the patient population tested, but the potential for a false-positive result is higher when influenza activity is very low and a positive influenza test result in a person without known exposure to influenza during low influenza periods (low positive predictive value) could be a false positive. Collection of additional respiratory specimens for testing of influenza viruses by molecular assays should be considered for outpatients who are at high risk for influenza complications and hospitalized patients with suspected influenza, and antiviral treatment should be started promptly while molecular assay results are pending. Persons who receive live attenuated influenza virus vaccine for intranasal administration can shed influenza vaccine virus strains in the upper respiratory tract for up to 7 days after intranasal vaccination and can test positive during this period. Clinicians should also consider that a positive influenza test result does not exclude bacterial coinfection, and evaluation of the potential need for antibiotics, especially in patients with pneumonia, should be considered.

Seasonal influenza — evidence base and investigational strategies for resistant virus management note that there are no randomized trials to guide optimal care. Two studies in 2008–2009 when H275Y H1N1 variants circulated suggested that zanamivir or laninamivir led to superior clinical outcomes compared to oseltamivir. Most clinical data come from case reports and case series where patients on oseltamivir were switched late to other antivirals; the best outcomes appear to be associated with early changes to an agent with in vitro activity against the oseltamivir-resistant virus. Combination antiviral therapy with 2 or more active agents with different mechanisms of action is described as investigational and may reduce additional de novo resistance in immunocompromised and other higher-risk patients.

IDSA 2018 seasonal influenza — testing and empiric treatment during community circulation: Confirmation of influenza virus infection by diagnostic testing is not required for decisions to prescribe antiviral medication, and initiation of empiric antiviral treatment should not be delayed while influenza testing results are pending; antiviral treatment is clinically most beneficial when started as close to illness onset as possible. All hospitalized patients with suspected influenza should be tested, and influenza testing may be used to inform decisions on use of antibiotics or continuation of antiviral medication, on need for further diagnostic tests, on consideration for home care, or on recommendations for ill persons living with others who are at high risk for influenza complications; influenza testing may be useful in order to inform decisions in infection control practices. Antiviral treatment is recommended for outpatients with suspected influenza who are at high risk for complications or those with progressive disease not requiring hospital admission, and antiviral treatment of outpatients who are not at high risk can be considered based upon clinical judgment if presenting within 2 days of illness onset.

IDSA 2018 seasonal influenza — specimen collection for diagnostic testing includes the following directives: Respiratory tract specimens should be collected as close to illness onset as possible, preferably within 4 days of symptom onset (A-II). Nasopharyngeal specimens should be collected over other upper respiratory tract specimens to increase detection of influenza viruses (A-II). If nasopharyngeal specimens are not available, nasal and throat swab specimens should be collected and combined together for influenza testing over single specimens from either site (particularly over throat swabs) to increase detection of influenza viruses (A-II). Mid-turbinate nasal swab specimens should be collected over throat swab specimens to increase detection of influenza viruses (A-II). Flocked swab specimens should be collected over nonflocked swab specimens to improve detection of influenza viruses (A-II). Clinicians should collect nasopharyngeal (optimally, as for outpatients), mid-turbinate nasal, or combined nasal–throat specimens from hospitalized patients without severe lower respiratory tract disease for influenza testing as soon as possible (A-II). Clinicians should collect endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens from hospitalized patients with respiratory failure receiving mechanical ventilation, including patients with negative influenza testing results on upper respiratory tract specimens, for influenza testing as soon as possible (A-II).

### Influenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus and HIV [^1115CLb7]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

For HIV-infected patients who meet case definitions for confirmed, probable, or suspected pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection, CDC recommends empiric antiviral drug treatment. There are no known contraindications for co-administration of oseltamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor, with antiretroviral medications; no interactions have been demonstrated.

Although clinical signs and treatment of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 are similar for patients with and without HIV infection, HIV-infected patients with suspected pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus symptoms should be treated as soon as possible. CDC recommends the use of influenza antiviral drugs, but this recommendation might change as additional data on this therapy for HIV-infected patients become available. At this time, however, we strongly recommend use of antiviral drugs for HIV-infected patients with suspected pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus.

Seasonal influenza — antiviral treatment recommendations (IDSA 2018) specify that clinicians should start antiviral treatment as soon as possible with a single neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) — oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, or intravenous peramivir — and not use a combination of NAIs (A-I); clinicians should not routinely use higher doses of FDA-approved NAI drugs for the treatment of seasonal influenza (A-II); clinicians should treat uncomplicated influenza in otherwise healthy ambulatory patients for 5 days with oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir, or a single dose of intravenous peramivir (A-I); and clinicians can consider longer duration of antiviral treatment for patients with a documented or suspected immunocompromising condition or patients requiring hospitalization for severe lower respiratory tract disease (including pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]), as influenza viral replication may be prolonged (C-III).

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^114tLpsz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Seasonal influenza (IDSA 2018) — immunocompromised patients: Influenza viral replication, including asymptomatic shedding, can be prolonged and resistant variants during or after antiviral treatment can occur more frequently than in immunocompetent patients. Retrospectively collected data suggest treatment can safely extend to 10 days or longer, and rebound viral replication has been observed in some patients treated for 5 days; longer duration is advisable if disease is severe and influenza viral RNA remains detectable. There are no data to support the use of higher doses of oseltamivir in this population. Early initiation of antiviral therapy is associated with the best outcomes, although clinical benefit has been reported when starting treatment > 48 hours after symptom onset.

Selection of studies

Types of studies

We included randomised controlled trials testing the effects of oseltamivir for treatment, prophylaxis, and post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza. Treatment was the use of oseltamivir in people showing signs of influenza-like illness that might be caused by influenza A and B viruses. Prophylaxis was the mode of use of oseltamivir when there was expectation of possible exposure to influenza in the near future. Post-exposure prophylaxis was the use of oseltamivir after probable exposure to influenza but before symptoms developed. Studies which were open label, and those not involving naturally occurring influenza were excluded.

Because of discrepancies between published and unpublished reports of the same trials, we decided to include only those trials for which we had unabridged clinical study reports. Two authors (PD and TJ) reapplied inclusion criteria for the full clinical study reports received in 2013 and resolved disagreements through discussion.

Types of participants

Randomised controlled trials had to be in children and adults who either were healthy before exposure to respiratory agents or had a chronic illness (such as asthma, diabetes, hypertension) but excluding people whose immune system had been affected by diseases such as malignancy or HIV infection. Exposure had to be naturally occurring influenza, with or without symptoms.

We analysed the intention to treat and safety populations, as our previous review had discovered compelling evidence that the intention to treat influenza infected subpopulation deemed to be influenza infected was not balanced between treatment groups in the oseltamivir trials. In addition, estimates from the intention to treat population are generalisable to clinical practice where routine testing for influenza is not common in many countries (and even where used, remains of variable accuracy).

Types of interventions

We included trials of neuraminidase inhibitors administered by any route compared with placebo during the period in which treatment was assumed and during the follow-up ("on-treatment" and "off-treatment") periods.

Types of outcomes

We divided the outcomes of clinical interest into primary and secondary by indication:

Primary outcome measures for treatment studies — symptom relief, admission to hospital, complications, and harms.

Secondary outcome measures for treatment studies — symptom relapse after finishing treatment, drug resistance, viral excretion, and mortality.

Primary outcome measures for prophylaxis studies — influenza (symptomatic and asymptomatic, always with laboratory confirmation) and influenza-like illness, admission to hospital, complications, interruption of transmission (in its two components, reduction of viral spread from index cases and prevention of onset of influenza in contacts), and harms.

Secondary outcome measures for prophylaxis studies — drug resistance, viral excretion, and mortality.

### Update: influenza activity – United States, September 28, 2014-February 21, 2015 [^1138R71n]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

CDC recommends that antiviral treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after illness onset (ideally within 48 hours of symptom onset) for any patient with confirmed or suspected influenza who is hospitalized, has severe, complicated, or progressive illness, or is at high risk for influenza-associated complications, including children aged < 2 years and adults aged ≥ 65 years. However, even when started after 48 hours of illness onset, antiviral treatment might still be beneficial in patients with severe, complicated, or progressive illness and in hospitalized patients. Antiviral treatment decisions should not be delayed awaiting laboratory confirmation of influenza.

Influenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted online weekly and are available at. Additional information regarding influenza viruses, influenza surveillance, influenza vaccine, influenza antiviral medications, and novel influenza A infections in humans is available at.

What is already known on this topic?

CDC collects, compiles, and analyzes data on influenza activity year-round in the United States. The timing and severity of circulating influenza viruses can vary by geographic location and season.

What is added by this report?

Influenza activity in the United States began to increase in mid-November, remained elevated through February 21, 2015, and is expected to continue for several more weeks. This has been an especially severe season for adults aged ≥ 65 years; this group has the highest recorded influenza-associated hospitalization rate and accounts for the majority of pneumonia and influenza–associated deaths this season. During September 28, 2014–February 21, 2015, influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated. Characterization data indicate that most of the influenza A (H3N2) viruses have antigenically or genetically drifted and are different from the influenza A (H3N2) component of the 2014–15 Northern Hemisphere vaccines. The vast majority of currently circulating influenza viruses are sensitive to oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Although vaccine effectiveness is reduced this season, influenza vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent influenza illness. Antiviral medications are more important than usual as an adjunct to vaccination in the treatment and prevention of influenza. Early antiviral treatment is recommended for patients with severe, complicated, or progressive influenza illness and those at higher risk for influenza complications, including adults aged ≥ 65 years.

### Deaths from bacterial pneumonia during 1918–19 influenza pandemic [^117U2Gnw]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Given highly variable colonization and drug-sensitivity patterns across populations and locations, stockpiles of antibacterial drugs should be tailored to their intended uses. Plans for providing medical care should include evidence-based triage and treatment algorithms and home-care treatment guidelines (including prepackaged antiviral and antibacterial drugs) to minimize hospitalizations and maximize home care. Perhaps most important, pandemic-related research activities (including laboratory animal studies, statistical models, and clinical trials) should elucidate the determinants and effects of bacterial pneumonias that occur secondary to influenza. Ultimately, research activities should determine the most effective uses of antibacterial drugs and bacterial vaccines (e.g. indications, agents, doses, and timing for prophylaxis and treatment) in preparation for and during pandemic influenza, particularly for medically underserved and other high-risk populations.

### Influenza pneumonia: a descriptive study [^1144Cjt5]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the clinical features and complications of patients hospitalized with influenza during the 1999–2000 influenza season.

Methods

We reviewed all cases of patients with influenza admitted to a large metropolitan referral hospital during the 1999–2000 season.

Results

Thirty-five adult patients (15 men and 20 women) tested positive for influenza A by direct enzyme immunoassay. A fourfold to sevenfold increase in the number of influenza cases was observed over previous years. Most patients had serious comorbid illnesses (88%), such as diabetes and chronic respiratory and heart disease. Seventeen patients developed pneumonia; these patients tended to be older (mean ± SD, 63 ± 13 years vs 51 ± 19 years, respectively; p = 0.04) and had a higher incidence of chronic lung disease (41% vs 6%, respectively; p = 0.02) than the patients without pneumonia. Shortness of breath was the only symptom that distinguished patients with pneumonia from those with an upper respiratory tract illness alone. Antiviral treatment was begun 4 ± 3 days from initiation of symptoms in patients with pneumonia and consisted of oseltamivir (35.2%), rimantadine (5.8%), or a combination of both (17.6%). Respiratory and/or blood culture results were positive in five patients (29%), Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in five patients, and Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated in one patient. Ten of the patients with pneumonia (58.8%) were admitted to the ICU, and 5 patients (29%) died. The length of ICU stay and mechanical ventilation were 28 ± 26 days and 21.5 ± 20.5 days, respectively. Death in most pneumonia patients was attributed to respiratory failure.

Conclusion

The recognized number of hospital admissions for influenza increased fourfold to sevenfold over previous years, most likely due to the implementation of rapid diagnostic tests for influenza. Patients with signs and symptoms of influenza and shortness of breath should undergo chest radiography. Hospitalization of patients with influenza pneumonia occurred in both previously healthy and immunocompromised patients and had a high mortality. S aureus was the most common bacterial isolate in patients with influenza pneumonia. Empiric antibiotics with staphylococcal activity should be used pending culture results in patients with influenza pneumonia. The effectiveness of oseltamivir and rimantadine in treating patients with influenza pneumonia remains to be determined.

Influenza diagnostic testing — indications and test selection: Influenza testing should be performed when the results are anticipated to influence clinical management or public health response, and the decision to test is related to suspicion for influenza, local influenza activity, and the sensitivity and specificity of available influenza tests. The appropriate respiratory tract specimen depends on the approved specimens for the specific test used, patient acceptability, and disease severity, and the choice of test depends on the clinical setting and test performance; clinicians should be aware of the prevalence of influenza viruses in the tested population to inform pretest probability, understand test limitations, and properly interpret results, particularly negative results. Molecular assays that detect influenza virus nucleic acids have the best performance characteristics.

### The use of antiviral agents for the management of severe influenza [^112CV1Xe]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The clinical course of pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza can be severe, particularly in the very young and patients with comorbidities. Pandemic H1N1 2009 is sensitive to the antiviral agents oseltamivir and zanamivir but is resistant to the M2 inhibitors. Although few clinical data are yet available, treatment of pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza in hospital settings with oseltamivir or zanamivir appears to be beneficial. In hospitalized patients with severe influenza treated with oseltamivir, mortality and length of stay are significantly reduced, and viral load is reduced more quickly than in untreated patients. In patients at high risk treated with oseltamivir or zanamivir, reductions in the risk of complications and mortality after treatment have been demonstrated with oseltamivir and zanamivir, although there are fewer data on the latter. There is no evidence yet that other antiviral agents are effective in severe or pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza. Current World Health Organization guidance strongly recommends the use of oseltamivir for severe or progressive infection with pandemic H1N1 2009, with zanamivir as an alternative if the infecting virus is oseltamivir-resistant. Very little resistance to oseltamivir has been found to date.

Major developments during the past 5 years concerning influenza prevention by vaccination and treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors are reviewed. These have been accompanied by increased media interest in related issues: pressures on hospital admissions, ethical concerns and controls on prescribing limiting professional autonomy. The new live attenuated influenza vaccines, adjuvanted vaccines and the emerging recombinant DNA vaccines are discussed. Recent information on neuraminidase inhibitor antivirals, surveillance for resistant viruses, the prospects for near patient tests (i.e. tests that can be used near the patient to improve immediate patient management or in the laboratory to give rapid feedback for physicians) and the clinical significance of other respiratory viruses are highlighted. The benefits of recent advances provide challenges for health care delivery and public acceptance as great as those involved in their scientific development.

### Monitoring and characterization of oseltamivir-resistant pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, Japan, 2009–2010 [^114571WU]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Patient Treatment History and Epidemiologic Background

Of 4,307 case-patients, 516 had oseltamivir treatment, 103 had zanamivir treatment, 1,088 were NAI-untreated, and the treatment history of 2,600 was unknown. Of the 61 cases of OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009, 45 were associated with oseltamivir treatment, 10 with postexposure prophylaxis, and 6 occurred in NAI-untreated patients; thus, oseltamivir treatment and prophylaxis likely accelerated emergence of OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009. The relationship between time of sampling (days after oseltamivir treatment) and OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 detection showed that OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 was generally detected at least 4 days after oseltamivir treatment (Table 1).

Influenza testing in adults with CAP — when influenza is circulating, molecular testing is preferred, with selective testing during low activity. "When influenza viruses are circulating in the community, we recommend testing for influenza with a rapid influenza molecular assay (i.e., influenza nucleic acid amplification test), which is preferred over a rapid influenza diagnostic test (i.e., antigen test) (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)". The guideline adds, "During periods of low influenza activity, testing can be considered but may not be routinely performed". Supporting context notes, "Rapid influenza tests have become increasingly available, moving from earlier antigen-based detection tests to nucleic acid amplification tests".

### Influenza and viral pneumonia [^116KCb7J]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Influenza and other respiratory viruses are commonly identified in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, and in immunocompromised patients with pneumonia. Clinically, it is difficult to differentiate viral from bacterial pneumonia. Similarly, the radiological findings of viral infection are in general nonspecific. The advent of polymerase chain reaction testing has enormously facilitated the identification of respiratory viruses, which has important implications for infection control measures and treatment. Currently, treatment options for patients with viral infection are limited but there is ongoing research on the development and clinical testing of new treatment regimens and strategies.

IDSA 2018 seasonal influenza — antiviral timing and hospital admission management — Greatest clinical benefit was reported when antiviral treatment was started within 2 days of illness onset, but benefit was noted even when started in most patients 4–5 days and up to 7 days after illness onset, including when NAI treatment was started > 48 hours after illness onset; a meta-analysis in hospitalized A(H1N1)pdm09 cases suggested that antiviral treatment within 48 hours of illness onset was associated with lower mortality compared to later or no treatment. Early antiviral treatment of influenza in outpatients reduces the likelihood of antibiotic use or physician-diagnosed complications and may reduce secondary bacterial coinfection. For patients being admitted with suspected influenza, we recommend starting empiric antiviral treatment as soon as possible without waiting for influenza testing results.

### Antivirals for treatment of severe influenza: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112QVt7H]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

The optimal antiviral drug for treatment of severe influenza remains unclear. To support updated WHO influenza clinical guidelines, this systematic review and network meta-analysis evaluated antivirals for treatment of patients with severe influenza.

Methods

We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Global Health, Epistemonikos, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomised controlled trials published up to Sept 20, 2023, that enrolled hospitalised patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed influenza and compared direct-acting influenza antivirals against placebo, standard care, or another antiviral. Pairs of coauthors independently extracted data on study characteristics, patient characteristics, antiviral characteristics, and outcomes, with discrepancies resolved by discussion or by a third coauthor. Key outcomes of interest were time to alleviation of symptoms, duration of hospitalisation, admission to intensive care unit, progression to invasive mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation, mortality, hospital discharge destination, emergence of antiviral resistance, adverse events, adverse events related to treatments, and serious adverse events. We conducted frequentist network meta-analyses to summarise the evidence and evaluated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42023456650.

Findings

Of 11 878 records identified by our search, eight trials with 1424 participants (mean age 36–60 years for trials that reported mean or median age; 43–78% male patients) were included in this systematic review, of which six were included in the network meta-analysis. The effects of oseltamivir, peramivir, or zanamivir on mortality compared with placebo or standard care without placebo for seasonal and zoonotic influenza were of very low certainty. Compared with placebo or standard care, we found low certainty evidence that duration of hospitalisation for seasonal influenza was reduced with oseltamivir (mean difference –1·63 days, 95% CI –2·81 to –0·45) and peramivir (–1·73 days, –3·33 to –0·13). Compared with standard care, there was little or no difference in time to alleviation of symptoms with oseltamivir (0·34 days, –0·86 to 1·54; low certainty evidence) or peramivir (–0·05 days, –0·69 to 0·59; low certainty evidence). There were no differences in adverse events or serious adverse events with oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir (very low certainty evidence). Uncertainty remains about the effects of antivirals on other outcomes for patients with severe influenza. Due to the small number of eligible trials, we could not test for publication bias.

Interpretation

In hospitalised patients with severe influenza, oseltamivir and peramivir might reduce duration of hospitalisation compared with standard care or placebo, although the certainty of evidence is low. The effects of all antivirals on mortality and other important patient outcomes are very uncertain due to scarce data from randomised controlled trials.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^114Q9aPZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

IDSA 2018 seasonal influenza — antiviral agent and duration: Clinicians should start antiviral treatment as soon as possible with a single neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) (either oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, or intravenous peramivir) and not use a combination of NAIs (A-I), and clinicians should not routinely use higher doses of US Food and Drug Administration–approved NAI drugs for the treatment of seasonal influenza (A-II). Clinicians should treat uncomplicated influenza in otherwise healthy ambulatory patients for 5 days with oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir, or a single dose of intravenous peramivir (A-I). Clinicians can consider longer duration of antiviral treatment for patients with a documented or suspected immunocompromising condition or patients requiring hospitalization.

### Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 surveillance and prevalence of seasonal influenza, Singapore [^114Gn5Vo]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Two thirds of the patients with influenza-positive PCR results met the criteria for influenza-like illness (ILI) as defined by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Patients who met these criteria were more likely than those who did not to have influenza-positive PCR results (odds ratio [OR] 8.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.6–14.3, p = 0.0001). Compared with contacts who had no recent travel, travelers returning from North America were less likely to have influenza-positive PCR test results (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.06–0.27, p = 0.0001).

To enhance detection of pandemic (H1N1) 2009, we obtained nasal and throat swab samples on May 2 and 3, 2009, from all hospitalized patients with clinically suspected pneumonia, regardless of their travel history. The samples were tested by PCR for influenza. A total of 146 patients were screened, of whom 21 (14.4%) were positive for influenza; 10.3% of the 146 patients had H3N2, 1.4% had seasonal H1N1, and 2.7% had influenza B. The median age of these patients was 67 years (range 20–95 years), and their median hospital stay at screening was 1 day (range 0–17 days). Of the patients, 52% were male, and 86% had other illnesses. At the time of admission, 90% of patients had a fever, 76% had a cough, 24% had a sore throat, 52% had rhinorrhea, 24% had myalgia, and 19% had headache. Findings on chest radiographs were abnormal for 10 patients (48%), of whom 5 had findings consistent with pneumonia. All but 1 patient were treated with antimicrobial drugs; none was given antiviral drug therapy. The median hospital stay was 5 days (range 1–38 days). Two patients died; both had multiple illnesses.

### Antivirals for treatment of severe influenza: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^117KW853]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

The optimal antiviral drug for treatment of severe influenza remains unclear. To support updated WHO influenza clinical guidelines, this systematic review and network meta-analysis evaluated antivirals for treatment of patients with severe influenza.

Methods

We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Global Health, Epistemonikos, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomised controlled trials published up to Sept 20, 2023, that enrolled hospitalised patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed influenza and compared direct-acting influenza antivirals against placebo, standard care, or another antiviral. Pairs of coauthors independently extracted data on study characteristics, patient characteristics, antiviral characteristics, and outcomes, with discrepancies resolved by discussion or by a third coauthor. Key outcomes of interest were time to alleviation of symptoms, duration of hospitalisation, admission to intensive care unit, progression to invasive mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation, mortality, hospital discharge destination, emergence of antiviral resistance, adverse events, adverse events related to treatments, and serious adverse events. We conducted frequentist network meta-analyses to summarise the evidence and evaluated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42023456650.

Findings

Of 11878 records identified by our search, eight trials with 1424 participants (mean age 36–60 years for trials that reported mean or median age; 43–78% male patients) were included in this systematic review, of which six were included in the network meta-analysis. The effects of oseltamivir, peramivir, or zanamivir on mortality compared with placebo or standard care without placebo for seasonal and zoonotic influenza were of very low certainty. Compared with placebo or standard care, we found low certainty evidence that duration of hospitalisation for seasonal influenza was reduced with oseltamivir (mean difference -1·63 days, 95% CI -2·81 to -0·45) and peramivir (-1·73 days, -3·33 to -0·13). Compared with standard care, there was little or no difference in time to alleviation of symptoms with oseltamivir (0·34 days, -0·86 to 1·54; low certainty evidence) or peramivir (-0·05 days, -0·69 to 0·59; low certainty evidence). There were no differences in adverse events or serious adverse events with oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir (very low certainty evidence). Uncertainty remains about the effects of antivirals on other outcomes for patients with severe influenza. Due to the small number of eligible trials, we could not test for publication bias.

Interpretation

In hospitalised patients with severe influenza, oseltamivir and peramivir might reduce duration of hospitalisation compared with standard care or placebo, although the certainty of evidence is low. The effects of all antivirals on mortality and other important patient outcomes are very uncertain due to scarce data from randomised controlled trials.

### First case in Italy of acquired resistance to oseltamivir in an immunocompromised patient with influenza A / H1N1v infection [^112EbxV4]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2010). Low credibility.

A pandemic influenza A/H1N1v strain with the neuraminidase H274Y mutation was detected in nasal secretions of a 2-year-old leukemic patient with influenza-like illness after 18 days of treatment with oseltamivir. At baseline, no drug-resistant virus was found, while 4 days after treatment initiation a mixture of wild-type and mutated virus was detected. After treatment interruption, the wild type influenza virus re-emerged and became prevalent in nasal secretions after a few days, suggesting the lower fitness of the mutated virus strain. The patient slowly improved concurrently with a decrease in virus load, which resulted negative 42 days after diagnosis. No other drug-resistant influenza A/H1N1v virus strains have been detected in Italy (up to the end of November 2009) since the first case of the novel A/H1N1v virus was identified in the country (May 2009).

### The management of community-acquired pneumonia in infants and children older than 3 months of age: clinical practice guidelines by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115dub8i]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, antiviral therapy, IDSA/PIDS 2011 guidelines recommend to do not delay antiviral therapy until confirmation of positive influenza test results. Do not exclude influenza disease conclusively in case of negative results of influenza diagnostic tests, especially rapid antigen tests. Consider initiating treatment after 48 hours of symptomatic infection in patients with more severe disease, as it may still provide clinical benefit.

### Oseltamivir-resistant influenza viruses A (H1N1), Norway, 2007–08 [^1162fGLK]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Information about use of antiviral drugs was obtained for 237 patients. No patients had received antiviral treatment in the 14 days before the onset of symptoms, and none had been in close contact with others known to have used antiviral drugs. Oseltamivir was received after sampling by 7 patients, 5 of whom were infected with an oseltamivir-resistant virus. Of 225 patients, 9 had traveled abroad in the week before symptom onset; 4 were infected with a resistant virus. Of all 272 patients, 2 had been vaccinated against influenza and were both infected with a resistant virus.

We received information about predisposing disease for 213 patients. Having a predisposing disease more than doubled the risk for complications (RR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2–5.4) but was not clearly associated with being infected with a resistant virus (RR 1.4, 95% CI 0.6–3.2). Information about clinical symptoms was obtained for 252/272 patients; most frequently reported were fever (229/242) and dry cough (182/218). Resistant virus infection was not associated with any particular symptom (Table 2). Of 241 patients, 58 (24.1%) had > 1 complications recorded, but no difference was observed between those infected with a resistant virus and those infected with a susceptible virus (Table 2). Bronchitis and pneumonia were the most frequent complications, reported for 22 and 17 patients, respectively. The age of the 17 patients who had pneumonia ranged from 8 months to 65 years (mean 29 years): 2 (12.5%) were 0–4 years of age, 5 (31.3%) were 5–14 years of age, 2 (12.5%) were 15–24 years of age, 4 (25.0%) were 25–59 years of age, and 3 (18.8%) were > 59 years of age. Of the 17 patients with pneumonia, 15 were infected with a resistant virus. The attack rates of pneumonia and of sinusitis were higher for those infected with a resistant virus than for those infected with a susceptible virus, although the risk ratios were not statistically significant after adjusting for age, gender, and predisposing disease (pneumonia RR 3.2, 95% CI 0.7–13.7; sinusitis RR 1.7, 95% CI 0.4–7.5) (Table 2). Of 264 patients, 45 had been hospitalized, 28 and 17 infected with a resistant and a susceptible virus, respectively. No deaths were reported for patients included in the study.

### Three patients with COVID-19 and pulmonary tuberculosis, wuhan, China, January-February 2020 [^117VvCNf]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Patient 2 was a 44-year-old man who became ill with fever, fatigue, headache, and dry cough on January 16. Chest CT scan showed bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities and pleural effusion (Appendix). On February 14, a chest CT scan showed signs of cavitation, which according to the patient's medical records were new, and a throat swab sample tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. At admission, the patient had tachycardia. A TB purified protein derivative skin test showed an induration of 7 × 10 mm. Rivalta test was positive for pleural effusion, which contained elevated concentrations of C-reactive protein, LDH, and ADA (35.1 U/L) and was infiltrated with lymphocytes. Sputum and pleural effusion AFB smears were negative. The clinical diagnosis was active pulmonary TB, tuberculous pleuritis, and pleural effusion. While hospitalized, the patient received antiviral drugs and a fixed-dose combination of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol. After admission, the patient was found to have type 2 diabetes mellitus, for which acarbose and metformin were prescribed. His signs and symptoms improved after treatment, and he was discharged on March 3 with anti-TB treatment to be continued.

Patient 3 was a 57-year-old man with a 3-year history of diabetes mellitus who on January 16 became ill with cough. In 2001, pulmonary TB had been diagnosed and considered cured. On January 27, 2020, according to the patient's medical records, a chest CT scan showed signs of TB. On February 3, another CT scan showed bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities (Appendix). On February 5, the patient was transferred to Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan, China, where a test for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. At admission, the patient had tachypnea and a peripheral capillary oxygen saturation of 90%. His sputum was positive for M. tuberculosis DNA. The diagnosis was severe COVID-19 pneumonia and latent pulmonary TB. While hospitalized, the patient received antibiotics, antiviral drugs, corticosteroids, and oxygen support. On February 7, a chest CT scan showed progression of the ground-glass opacities. Immunoglobulin was administered. Additional CT scans showed gradual improvement, and the patient was discharged on March 2.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115mMXga]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Inpatient setting — adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and corticosteroids: We recommend not routinely using corticosteroids in adults with nonsevere CAP (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). We suggest not routinely using corticosteroids in adults with severe CAP (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence) and suggest not routinely using corticosteroids in adults with severe influenza pneumonia (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). We endorse the Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommendations on the use of corticosteroids in patients with CAP and refractory septic shock. Risk considerations note that the risk of corticosteroids in the dose range up to 240 mg of hydrocortisone equivalent per day for a maximum of 7 days is predominantly hyperglycemia, with concerns about greater complications in the following 30 to 90 days.

IDSA 2018 seasonal influenza — who should receive antivirals: Clinicians should start antiviral treatment as soon as possible for adults and children with documented or suspected influenza, irrespective of influenza vaccination history, who meet the following criteria: persons of any age who are hospitalized with influenza, regardless of illness duration prior to hospitalization (A-II); outpatients of any age with severe or progressive illness, regardless of illness duration (A-III); outpatients who are at high risk of complications from influenza, including those with chronic medical conditions and immunocompromised patients (A-II); children younger than 2 years and adults ≥ 65 years (A-III); and pregnant women and those within 2 weeks postpartum (A-III). Clinicians can consider antiviral treatment for adults and children who are not at high risk of influenza complications, with documented or suspected influenza, irrespective of influenza vaccination history, who are either outpatients with illness onset ≤ 2 days before presentation (C-I), symptomatic outpatients who are household contacts of persons at high risk of developing complications from influenza, particularly those who are severely immunocompromised (C-III), or symptomatic healthcare providers who are household contacts of persons at high risk of developing complications from influenza, particularly those who are severely immunocompromised (C-III).

### Neuraminidase inhibitors: who, when, where? [^113w8c57]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Although the neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs), oseltamivir and zanamivir were first licensed in 1999, their clinical effectiveness is still hotly debated. Two rigorous systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the data from clinical trials conducted in community settings against relatively benign influenza, both suggest that reductions in symptom duration are extremely modest, under one day. Whilst one of these reviews could find no evidence of reductions in complications, the most recent review reported clinically meaningful and statistically significant reductions in the likelihood of requiring antibiotics (44%) and hospitalizations (63%) in adult patients with confirmed influenza, treated with oseltamivir. A further meta-analysis of observational data from the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic suggested that, in hospitalised patients, NIs significantly reduced mortality in adults by 25% overall, and by 62% if started within 48 hours of symptom onset, compared with no treatment. But, the effectiveness of NIs in children is far less clear. Taken together, these data suggest that NIs should be reserved for patients with influenza who are at high-risk of complications, or when clinically assessed found to be markedly unwell, or rapidly deteriorating. In such patients, treatment should be initiated empirically, as soon as possible, preferably with follow-on virological confirmation.

Clinicians should investigate and empirically treat bacterial coinfection in patients who deteriorate after initial improvement, particularly in those treated with antivirals (A-III). Clinicians can consider investigating bacterial coinfection in patients who fail to improve after 3–5 days of antiviral treatment (C-III).

### Emerging oseltamivir resistance in seasonal and pandemic influenza A / H1N1 [^111xTC6y]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2011). Low credibility.

The emergence of oseltamivir resistance in seasonal and pandemic influenza A/H1N1 has created challenges for diagnosis and clinical management. This review discusses how clinical virology laboratories have handled diagnosis of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 and what we have learned from clinical studies and case series. Immunocompetent patients infected with oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 have similar outcomes as patients infected with oseltamivir-susceptible H1N1. However, immunocompromised patients infected with oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 experience potentially more risks of complication and transmissibility with few therapeutic options.

### SHEA statement on antibiotic stewardship in hospitals during public health emergencies [^114KF1a7]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

When should antibiotics be considered for patients during respiratory viral pandemics and epidemics?

Recommendations

It is important for HCP to identify patients who require empiric antibiotic treatment, despite low rates of coinfection on admission for the COVID-19 and prior respiratory viral pandemics.
If treated at the time of hospital admission, HCP should prescribe antibiotics recommended in guidelines for CAP for patients presenting from the community with coinfection. Antibiotics for pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, seen more typically in healthcare-associated infection, are not recommended.
HCP may consider coinfection with other viruses, such as influenza. If influenza is diagnosed, addition of therapy, such oseltamivir, may be indicated.
HCP may consider antibiotics, including broad-spectrum coverage, for patients hospitalized for > 48 hours who are at greater risk for HAIs and MDROs, when there are new clinical signs that are consistent with healthcare-associated bacterial or fungal infection.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^1127aTvn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Outpatients (including emergency department patients) during influenza activity (defined as the circulation of seasonal influenza A and B viruses among persons in the local community) have the following testing recommendations: Clinicians should test for influenza in high-risk patients, including immunocompromised persons who present with influenza-like illness, pneumonia, or nonspecific respiratory illness (eg, cough without fever) if the testing result will influence clinical management (A-III). Clinicians should test for influenza in patients who present with acute onset of respiratory symptoms with or without fever, and either exacerbation of chronic medical conditions (eg, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], heart failure) or known complications of influenza (eg, pneumonia) if the testing result will influence clinical management (A-III). Clinicians can consider influenza testing for patients not at high risk for influenza complications who present with influenza-like illness, pneumonia, or nonspecific respiratory illness and who are likely to be discharged home if the result will influence antiviral treatment decisions or reduce use of unnecessary antibiotics, further diagnostic testing, and time in the emergency department, or if results might influence treatment or chemoprophylaxis decisions for high-risk household contacts (C-III).

### Pneumonia [^1145TpAm]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria, and less commonly by other microorganisms. Identifying the responsible pathogen can be difficult. Diagnosis is often based on symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-rays, blood tests, and culture of the sputum may help confirm the diagnosis. The disease may be classified by where it was acquired, such as community- or hospital-acquired or healthcare-associated pneumonia. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Pneumonia believed to be due to bacteria is treated with antibiotics. If the pneumonia is severe, the affected person is generally hospitalized. Oxygen therapy may be used if oxygen levels are low. Signs and symptoms People with infectious pneumonia often have a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate of breathing. In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.

Most patients had no detectable pathogens in their sample, and unexpectedly, respiratory viruses were detected more frequently than bacteria. Specifically, 23% had one or more viruses, 11% had one or more bacteria, 3% had both bacterial and viral pathogens, and 1% had a fungal or mycobacterial infection. "The most common pathogens were human rhinovirus, influenza virus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae". The use of acid-suppressing medications – such as proton-pump inhibitors or H2 blockers – is associated with an increased risk of pneumonia. Approximately 10% of people who require mechanical ventilation develop ventilator-associated pneumonia, and people with a gastric feeding tube have an increased risk of developing aspiration pneumonia. Moreover, the misplacement of a feeding tube can lead to aspiration pneumonia. 28% of tube malposition results in pneumonia.

Mechanisms Pneumonia frequently starts as an upper respiratory tract infection that moves into the lower respiratory tract. It is a type of pneumonitis. The normal flora of the upper airway give protection by competing with pathogens for nutrients. In the lower airways, reflexes of the glottis, actions of complement proteins and immunoglobulins are important for protection. Microaspiration of contaminated secretions can infect the lower airways and cause pneumonia. The progress of pneumonia is determined by the virulence of the organism; the amount of organism required to start an infection; and the body's immune response against the infection. Bacteria can also spread via the blood. Once in the lungs, bacteria may invade the spaces between cells and between alveoli, where the macrophages and neutrophils attempt to inactivate the bacteria. The neutrophils also release cytokines, causing a general activation of the immune system.

This leads to the fever, chills, and fatigue common in bacterial pneumonia. The neutrophils, bacteria, and fluid from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli, resulting in the consolidation seen on chest X-ray. Diagnosis Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray. In recent years, however, the role of lung ultrasonography has gained prominence, with substantial evidence demonstrating that, in expert hands, it surpasses radiography in accuracy. In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely. However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause. The overall impression of a physician appears to be at least as good as decision rules for making or excluding the diagnosis.

### Pathophysiology… [^114GXFNA]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

Viral pneumonia is a pneumonia caused by a virus. Pneumonia is an infection that causes inflammation in one or both lungs. The pulmonary alveoli fill with fluid or pus making it difficult to breathe. Pneumonia can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites. Viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in children, while in adults bacteria are a more common cause. Signs and symptoms Symptoms of viral pneumonia include fever, productive cough, runny nose, chest pain and systemic symptoms. Different viruses cause different symptoms. Diagnosis Diagnosis, like with any infection, relies on the detection of the infectious cause. With viral pneumonia, samples are taken from the upper and/or lower respiratory tracts. The samples can then be run through polymerase chain reaction, allowing for amplification of the virus as that allows better detection if present in the sample.

Other ways for a diagnosis to be obtained is by ordering a chest X-ray, blood tests, pulse oximetry, and a medical/family history to see if there are any known risks or previous exposures to a person with viral pneumonia. If the person is in serious condition and in the hospital there are more invasive studies that can be run to diagnose the person. Cause Common causes of viral pneumonia are:

- Influenza virus A and B
- Respiratory syncytial virus
- Human parainfluenza viruses
- Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Rarer viruses that commonly result in pneumonia include:

- Adenoviruses
- Metapneumovirus
- Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
- Middle East respiratory syndrome virus
- Hantaviruses.

Viruses that primarily cause other diseases, but sometimes cause pneumonia include:

- Herpes simplex virus, mainly in newborns or young children
- Varicella-zoster virus
- Measles virus
- Rubella virus
- Cytomegalovirus, mainly in people with immune system problems
- Smallpox virus
- Dengue virus. The most commonly identified agents in children are respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and parainfluenza viruses. History In the pre-antibiotic age, pneumonias had been treated with specific anti-serums of highly variable therapeutic effect and undesirable side-effects. Viral pneumonia was first described by Hobart Reimann in 1984, in an article published by JAMA, An Acute Infection of the Respiratory Tract with Atypical Pneumonia: a disease entity probably caused by a filtrable virus.

Reimann, Chairman of the Department of Medicine at Jefferson Medical College, had established the practice of routinely typing the pneumococcal organism in cases where pneumonia presented. Out of this work, the distinction between viral and bacterial strains was noticed. Pathophysiology Viruses must invade cells in order to reproduce. Typically, a virus will reach the lungs by traveling in droplets through the mouth and nose with inhalation. There, the virus invades the cells lining the airways and the alveoli. This invasion often leads to cell death either through direct killing by the virus or by self-destruction through apoptosis. Further damage to the lungs occurs when the immune system responds to the infection. White blood cells, in particular lymphocytes, are responsible for activating a variety of chemicals which cause leaking of fluid into the alveoli.

### Pneumocystis pneumonia… [^115xAWAh]. Wikipedia (2001). Low credibility.

Pneumocystis specimens are commonly found in the lungs of healthy people although it is usually not a cause for disease. However, they are a source of opportunistic infection and can cause lung infections in people with a weak immune system or other predisposing health conditions. PCP is seen in people with HIV/AIDS, those using medications that suppress the immune system, and people with cancer, autoimmune or inflammatory conditions, and chronic lung disease. Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms may develop over several days or weeks and may include: shortness of breath and/or difficulty breathing, fever, dry/non-productive cough, weight loss, night sweats, chills, and fatigue. Uncommonly, the infection may progress to involve other visceral organs.
- Cough
- typically dry/non-productive because sputum becomes too viscous to be coughed up.

The dry cough distinguishes PCP from typical pneumonia. Complications Pneumothorax is a well-known complication of PCP. Also, a condition similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome may occur in patients with severe Pneumocystis pneumonia, and such individuals may require intubation. Pathophysiology The risk of PCP increases when CD4-positive T-cell levels are less than 400 cells/μL. In these immunosuppressed individuals, the manifestations of the infection are highly variable. The disease attacks the interstitial, fibrous tissue of the lungs, with marked thickening of the alveolar septa and alveoli, leading to significant hypoxia, which can be fatal if not treated aggressively. In this situation, lactate dehydrogenase levels increase and gas exchange is compromised. Oxygen is less able to diffuse into the blood, leading to hypoxia, which along with high arterial carbon dioxide levels, stimulates hyperventilatory effort, thereby causing dyspnea.

In addition, in symptomatic cases of P. jirovecii pneumonia, the overgrowth of the fungus is associated to a co-infection with trichomonads, unicellular flagellated parabasalid protist of the family Trichomonadidae. These parasites exhibit an amoeboid form, without flagellum, which makes it difficult to identify them under the microscope. Diagnosis The diagnosis can be confirmed by the characteristic appearance of the chest X-ray and an arterial oxygen level that is strikingly lower than would be expected from symptoms. Gallium 67 scans are also useful in the diagnosis. They are abnormal in about 90% of cases and are often positive before the chest X-ray becomes abnormal. Chest X-ray typically shows widespread pulmonary infiltrates. CT scan may show pulmonary cysts.
- Chest X-ray of increased opacification in the lower lungs.
- These chest radiographs are of two patients. Both show ground glass opacities. The left X-ray shows a much more subtle ground-glass appearance while the right X-ray shows a much more gross ground-glass appearance mimicking pulmonary edema. The diagnosis can be definitively confirmed by histological identification of the causative organism in sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage. Staining with toluidine blue, silver stain, periodic acid-Schiff stain, or an immunofluorescence assay shows the characteristic cysts. The cysts resemble crushed ping-pong balls and are present in aggregates of two to eight. A lung biopsy would show thickened alveolar septa with fluffy eosinophilic exudate in the alveoli.

### Aspiration pneumonia [^116PSbPw]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

Aspiration pneumonia is a type of lung infection that is due to a relatively large amount of material from the stomach or mouth entering the lungs. Signs and symptoms often include fever and cough of relatively rapid onset. Complications may include lung abscess, acute respiratory distress syndrome, empyema, parapneumonic effusion, and pneumonia Some include chemical induced inflammation of the lungs as a subtype, which occurs from acidic but non-infectious stomach contents entering the lungs. Infection can be due to a variety of bacteria. Risk factors include decreased level of consciousness, problems with swallowing, alcoholism, tube feeding, and poor oral health. Diagnosis is typically based on the presenting history, symptoms, chest X-ray, and sputum culture. Differentiating from other types of pneumonia may be difficult.

Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms of aspiration pneumonia may develop gradually, with increased respiratory rate, foul-smelling sputum, hemoptysis, and fever. Complications may occur, such as exudative pleural effusion, empyema, and lung abscesses. If left untreated, aspiration pneumonia can progress to form a lung abscess. Another possible complication is an empyema, in which pus collects inside the lungs. If continual aspiration occurs, the chronic inflammation can cause compensatory thickening of the insides of the lungs, resulting in bronchiectasis. Causes Most aspiration events occur in patients with a defective swallowing mechanism, such as a neurological disease or as the result of an injury that directly impairs swallowing or interferes with consciousness. Impaired consciousness can be intentional, such as the use of general anesthesia for surgery.

For many types of surgical operations, people preparing for surgery are therefore instructed to take nothing by mouth for at least four hours before surgery. The aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions with a high bacterial load, combined with impaired mechanical, humoral, or cellular defense mechanisms, facilitates the entry of bacteria into the lungs and may lead to the development of aspiration pneumonia.
- **Others**: Age, male sex, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, use of antipsychotic drugs, proton pump inhibitors, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.

Residence in an institutional setting, prolonged hospitalization or surgical procedures, gastric tube feeding, mechanical airway interventions, immunocompromised, history of smoking, antibiotic therapy, advanced age, reduced pulmonary clearance, diminished cough reflex, disrupted normal mucosal barrier, impaired mucociliary clearance, alter cellular and humoral immunity, obstruction of the airways, and damaged lung tissue. Bacteria Bacteria involved in aspiration pneumonia may be either aerobic or anaerobic. Common aerobic bacteria involved include:

- Streptococcus pneumoniae
- Staphylococcus aureus
- Haemophilus influenzae
- Pseudomonas aeruginosa
- **Klebsiella**: often seen in aspiration lobar pneumonia in alcoholics. Anaerobic bacteria also play a key role in the pathogenesis of aspiration pneumonia. They make up the majority of normal oral flora and the presence of putrid fluid in the lungs is highly suggestive of aspiration pneumonia secondary to an anaerobic organism.
