## Question

What is the differential diagnosis for elevated PTH?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis for elevated parathyroid hormone. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the biochemical abnormality and the assay issues. Then, I should categorize by calcium status to separate PTH-dependent hypercalcemia from normocalcemic and hypocalcemic states. Next, I will systematically exclude secondary causes, differentiate key entities such as primary hyperparathyroidism versus familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, review special contexts like medications, CKD, pregnancy, and post-parathyroidectomy PTH elevations, and finally outline pragmatic testing, treatment indications, and follow-up anchored to guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical abnormality, because jumping ahead without verification risks a misdiagnosis. I need a repeat intact PTH using a second- or third-generation assay, an albumin-adjusted total calcium and, when indicated, ionized calcium, plus phosphate, creatinine or eGFR, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D to anchor the interpretation of PTH in its physiologic context [^113LrxeF]. Wait, let me verify assay variability and fragments, especially in CKD, because inter-assay differences and fragment detection can mislead clinical decisions; being explicit about the assay generation and trending values is prudent [^111g74q9]. I should also remember rare assay-detection pitfalls from variant PTH peptides in genetic disorders that can alter immunoassay recognition, so if results and phenotype diverge, I need to check which epitopes the local assay detects [^1117e8wU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; the calcium level dictates the diagnostic fork in the road. In hypercalcemia, an elevated or inappropriately normal PTH indicates PTH-dependent hypercalcemia, whereas suppressed PTH points to PTH-independent etiologies such as malignancy or granulomatous disease; in normocalcemia, I must exclude secondary causes before diagnosing normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism; in hypocalcemia with elevated PTH, I should consider PTH resistance states or severe deficiency states like profound vitamin D deficiency or hypomagnesemia first [^117NS27X] [^111PJEAj].

> If calcium is high and PTH is elevated or inappropriately normal, primary hyperparathyroidism is most likely and usually due to a solitary adenoma, but I should keep multiglandular hyperplasia, multiple adenomas, and rarely parathyroid carcinoma in mind; presentation is often asymptomatic where screening is common, though nephrolithiasis or skeletal involvement may be present even when subtle [^1176xNEt]. Wait a minute, I also need to keep familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, thiazide or lithium effects, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism on the list, because they can mimic the biochemical pattern and change management drastically, including when not to operate [^114DBWVe].

> I will now examine the distinction between PHPT and FHH, because missing FHH leads to unnecessary surgery. Let me check the 24-hour urinary calcium and calculate the calcium/creatinine clearance ratio; a ratio less than 0.01 with a family history or young age strongly suggests FHH and should prompt consideration of CASR-related genetic testing, whereas a higher ratio supports PHPT and surgical cure is typical in experienced hands [^1173ejdr] [^114DBWVe]. But wait, what if the phenotype is early-onset or multiglandular or there is a family history of endocrine tumors; I should verify whether broader genetic testing is indicated, as heritable forms affect surgical planning and family screening [^117MGtsN].

> Let me consider medication effects carefully, because I should confirm reversible contributors before labeling PHPT. Thiazide diuretics reduce urinary calcium and can unmask hypercalcemia, while lithium shifts the CaSR set point and can raise PTH with hypercalcemia; temporarily withholding these agents, when safe, helps clarify the diagnosis and may avert unwarranted surgery [^114DBWVe]. I need to ensure other contributors like immobilization or vitamin A excess are not being overlooked when the story does not fit, even if they are less common [^117NS27X].

> Next, I should review tertiary hyperparathyroidism, but only after confirming a background of long-standing secondary hyperparathyroidism, typically from CKD with sustained hyperphosphatemia and low calcitriol production. In diseased kidneys, reduced 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D synthesis and phosphate retention drive chronic PTH stimulation, and over time autonomous parathyroid function can emerge with frank hypercalcemia despite correction of the inciting factors [^116ZwtS7].

> Hold on, I should verify that in hypercalcemia with suppressed PTH, we pivot to PTH-independent pathways rather than persisting with a PTH-centric differential. Malignancy hypercalcemia is most often mediated by PTHrP or osteolytic cytokines with low PTH, and granulomatous diseases or some tumors can produce calcitriol with elevated 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D; checking PTHrP and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D clarifies the mechanism and directs therapy [^117NS27X] [^111NcUNP] [^116uRQtU]. Let me reconsider GIST and other rare tumors that elevate calcitriol as an alternative mechanism when PTH is suppressed and PTHrP is undetectable but the calcitriol is high, as this changes oncologic and endocrine management priorities [^1168S9UE].

> If calcium is normal and PTH is elevated, I need to ensure secondary causes are excluded before diagnosing true normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism. I should confirm vitamin D sufficiency, adequate calcium intake, normal renal function, absence of malabsorption or post-bariatric physiology, and lack of hypercalciuria or culprit medications, then repeat measurements over time; only persistent PTH elevation with consistently normal total and ionized calcium after correction supports nPHPT [^111PJEAj]. Wait, let me verify that RYGB patients often have elevated PTH despite normal calcium and 25OHD, and simply increasing calcium salts does not reliably normalize PTH, underscoring the importance of addressing multifactorial malabsorption and bone turnover changes rather than assuming primary disease [^112zAuwy]. I should double-check that when nPHPT is confirmed, there can still be kidney stones or skeletal effects akin to hypercalcemic PHPT, which may influence surgical consideration in selected cases [^114L9MaD].

> If calcium is low and PTH is elevated, I should consider PTH resistance and severe deficiency states. Pseudohypoparathyroidism presents with hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and elevated PTH from end-organ resistance; genetic or epigenetic testing can confirm subtypes, and recognizing this prevents inappropriate surgical exploration [^1117cftq]. But wait, profound vitamin D deficiency and advanced CKD can produce hypocalcemia with high PTH too, so I need to check phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, 25OHD, kidney function, and clinical context before concluding PTH resistance, and I should remember that hypomagnesemia can paradoxically blunt or elevate PTH signals depending on severity and duration, so magnesium must be measured and corrected [^114qfj9J] [^111ct6Gh].

> I will now outline the systematic diagnostic workup and the sequence matters. Let me first confirm and replete vitamin D to at least 30 ng/mL, then re-evaluate PTH and calcium, because diagnosing PHPT in the face of deficiency risks over-calling primary disease and missing secondary hyperparathyroidism, and guideline-based testing includes adjusted calcium, ionized calcium when nPHPT is suspected, phosphorus, intact PTH, 25OHD, and creatinine [^113LrxeF] [^111H4sYr]. Next, I should review renal function and obtain a 24-hour urine calcium with stone risk factors as indicated, because kidney disease and hypercalciuria both alter PTH and guide differential and management decisions [^111aZ7bs]. I need to check the medication list, family history for FHH or MEN, and clinical contexts like pregnancy or prior bariatric surgery, as these conditions shape both diagnosis and treatment [^114DBWVe] [^112GUCcN].

> For hypercalcemic patients, let me first confirm the calcium/creatinine clearance ratio and consider genetic testing when age is under 40, there is multiglandular disease, or there is a family history of endocrine tumors or hypercalcemia, because this stratifies the likelihood of heritable disease and avoids futile or misdirected surgery in FHH [^114DBWVe]. I should double-check the AAES recommendation to consider a 24-hour urine calcium and creatinine in anyone undergoing evaluation for possible PHPT, because under-collecting or missing hypercalciuria can misclassify risk and management [^1173ejdr].

> Let me compare key biochemical patterns carefully to avoid anchoring errors. In typical PHPT, calcium is high with elevated or inappropriately normal PTH and low or low-normal phosphate, whereas in FHH, calcium is high, PTH is often non-suppressed, but urinary calcium excretion and clearance ratio are distinctly low; CKD-related SHPT often shows elevated PTH with low or low-normal calcium early, but hold on, I need to correct a common mistake: phosphate is frequently high in CKD SHPT, not low, due to reduced excretion, unlike PHPT where phosphate tends to be low from phosphaturia; persistent PTH elevation with normal calcium after correction of vitamin D deficiency, adequate calcium intake, and normal renal function raises true nPHPT, and hypocalcemia with elevated PTH plus hyperphosphatemia points toward pseudohypoparathyroidism [^113LrxeF] [^114qfj9J] [^1117cftq].

> Next, I should review special postoperative considerations, because eucalcemic PTH elevation after curative parathyroidectomy is common and often benign. Let me verify that transient postoperative PTH elevation peaks by 3–6 months in many series and tends to normalize within 12 months in a substantial fraction, driven by bone remineralization ("bone hunger"), relative vitamin D deficiency, or renal factors rather than early recurrence, but I also need to monitor because a minority will recur over years [^115vm6iU]. I should confirm that risk factors include older age, lower 25OHD, higher intraoperative or 3-month PTH, and larger adenoma weight, and that standardized follow-up with calcium, PTH, and attention to vitamin D and calcium intake resolves many cases without intervention [^1116AQeg] [^112BLtWV]. Hold on, I should verify newer data showing that among patients with elevated PTH at 6 months and normal calcium, roughly half normalize within a year, but a small proportion develop recurrent PHPT, so longitudinal monitoring is warranted [^115wWb6f].

> In pregnancy, I need to ensure maternal-fetal safety and adjust expectations. Mild PHPT can often be managed conservatively with hydration and calcium monitoring, reserving surgery for more severe or refractory cases and timing intervention to minimize fetal risk, while recognizing that physiology of pregnancy alters calcium homeostasis and reference ranges, so interpretation requires obstetric-endocrine coordination [^116eKQaq] [^112GUCcN].

> Let me consider imaging last, not first, because it localizes but does not diagnose PHPT. Ultrasound and nuclear medicine methods guide operative planning, but false negatives occur in multigland disease and secondary hyperparathyroidism, and a restricted field of view can miss ectopic or recurrent glands, so I should verify the biochemical diagnosis before chasing imaging findings [^114wAa5f] [^1173ejdr].

> Finally, I should confirm management pathways aligned with guidelines. Parathyroidectomy is the only curative therapy for PHPT, and I should verify surgical indications such as symptoms, serum calcium more than 1 mg/dL above normal, age 50 years or younger, osteoporosis, nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis, hypercalciuria, or creatinine clearance below 60 mL/min/1.73 m²; when surgery is not an option, cinacalcet lowers serum calcium, while bisphosphonates or denosumab increase bone mineral density and can be combined with cinacalcet as needed, alongside maintaining vitamin D above 30 ng/mL and age-appropriate calcium intake without over-restriction [^1173ejdr] [^114DBWVe] [^1152z3aX] [^113LsBWi] [^116XPDL4] [^111H4sYr] [^111DWHjG] [^111Gy74C].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined sequence: repeat and contextualize PTH with appropriate assays, stratify by calcium status, aggressively exclude secondary causes, distinguish PHPT from FHH and medication or CKD-mediated states, and only then move to localization and definitive therapy; I should double-check that vitamin D repletion and renal assessment are completed before labeling primary disease, and I should remain vigilant because PHPT remains underdiagnosed and undertreated even when both calcium and PTH are elevated, leading to avoidable delays in surgical cure [^111g74q9] [^113LrxeF] [^111Pk86F].

Elevated PTH has a focused differential: **primary hyperparathyroidism** (adenoma, hyperplasia, carcinoma) [^114guUzo], **secondary hyperparathyroidism** (CKD, vitamin D deficiency, malabsorption, hypocalcemia) [^114qfj9J] [^111PJEAj], and **tertiary hyperparathyroidism** (autonomous hyperplasia after prolonged secondary HPT) [^116ZwtS7]. Less common causes include **familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia** (Ca/Cr clearance ratio < 0.01) [^114DBWVe], medications (lithium, thiazides), and PTH resistance syndromes (pseudohypoparathyroidism) [^1117cftq]. Evaluation includes **serum calcium, phosphate, 25(OH)D, creatinine/eGFR, and 24-hour urine calcium** [^113LrxeF] [^111aZ7bs] [^1173ejdr]. Management is cause-specific: **surgery for PHPT** and **medical therapy** for secondary or tertiary HPT [^114guUzo] [^116feLqL].

---

## Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT)

PHPT is characterized by **autonomous PTH secretion** [^114guUzo], most commonly due to a single adenoma (80–85%), multigland hyperplasia (10–15%), or rarely carcinoma (< 1%) [^1176xNEt]. It typically presents with **hypercalcemia** [^114guUzo], elevated or inappropriately normal PTH, and complications such as nephrolithiasis, osteoporosis, and neuropsychiatric symptoms [^115Pc561].

---

## Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT)

SHPT results from chronic hypocalcemia or vitamin D deficiency, leading to **compensatory PTH elevation** [^114qfj9J] [^116feLqL]. Common causes include:

- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Reduced renal activation of vitamin D and phosphate retention cause hypocalcemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism [^114qfj9J] [^111Xjaby].

- **Vitamin D deficiency**: Reduced intestinal calcium absorption leads to hypocalcemia and compensatory PTH elevation [^111PJEAj] [^116feLqL].

- **Malabsorption syndromes**: Conditions such as celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or bariatric surgery can cause calcium and vitamin D malabsorption, leading to SHPT [^116feLqL] [^112zAuwy].

- **Hypocalcemia**: Chronic hypocalcemia from various causes can stimulate PTH secretion [^116ZwtS7].

---

## Tertiary hyperparathyroidism

Tertiary hyperparathyroidism results from prolonged secondary hyperparathyroidism, leading to **autonomous parathyroid hyperplasia** and persistent PTH elevation even after correction of the initial cause (e.g. after renal transplantation) [^116ZwtS7].

---

## Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH)

FHH is a genetic disorder characterized by mild hypercalcemia, elevated or inappropriately normal PTH, and **low urinary calcium excretion** (Ca/Cr clearance ratio < 0.01) [^114DBWVe] [^113LrxeF]. It is caused by mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) gene and typically does not require surgery.

---

## Medications and substances

Certain medications and substances can elevate PTH levels [^114DBWVe]. **Lithium** alters CaSR sensitivity and increases PTH secretion; **thiazide diuretics** reduce renal calcium excretion, which may raise PTH; and calcium-sensing receptor antagonists, though rarely used clinically, also increase PTH.

---

## PTH resistance syndromes

Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) is characterized by **resistance to PTH**, leading to elevated PTH levels despite hypocalcemia. It is a rare genetic disorder with variable clinical manifestations, including skeletal abnormalities and endocrine resistance [^1117cftq] [^113aZHxV].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A comprehensive diagnostic approach includes:

- **Serum calcium (total and ionized)**: To differentiate hypercalcemic from normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism [^113LrxeF].

- **Phosphate levels**: Typically low in PHPT and SHPT [^116ZwtS7].

- **25-hydroxyvitamin D**: To assess vitamin D status [^113LrxeF].

- **Creatinine/eGFR**: To evaluate renal function [^111aZ7bs].

- **24-hour urinary calcium**: To differentiate PHPT from FHH [^1173ejdr].

- **Imaging**: Neck ultrasound, sestamibi scan, or 4D-CT for localization of parathyroid lesions [^114wAa5f].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **PHPT**: Parathyroidectomy is the definitive treatment. Medical management includes cinacalcet to lower calcium [^1152z3aX] and bisphosphonates or denosumab to improve bone density [^113LsBWi].

- **SHPT**: Address underlying causes (e.g. vitamin D supplementation, phosphate binders, calcimimetics) [^116feLqL] [^114qfj9J].

- **Tertiary hyperparathyroidism**: Parathyroidectomy or medical management with calcimimetics [^116ZwtS7].

- **FHH**: Typically requires no treatment [^114DBWVe].

- **PTH resistance syndromes**: Calcium and active vitamin D supplementation [^1117cftq].

---

Elevated PTH levels arise from multiple causes — including primary, secondary, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism; familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia; medications; and PTH resistance syndromes. Accurate diagnosis and management require a **comprehensive evaluation** of calcium, phosphate, vitamin D, renal function, and urinary calcium excretion [^113LrxeF].

### Zemplar [^114qfj9J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by an elevation in parathyroid hormone (PTH) associated with inadequate levels of active vitamin D hormone. The source of vitamin D in the body is from synthesis in the skin as vitamin D3 and from dietary intake as either vitamin D2 or D3. Both vitamin D2 and D3 require two sequential hydroxylations in the liver and the kidney to bind to and activate the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The endogenous VDR activator, calcitriol [1,25(OH)2D3], is a hormone that binds to VDRs present in the parathyroid gland, intestine, kidney, and bone to maintain parathyroid function and calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, and to VDRs found in many other tissues, including the prostate, endothelium, and immune cells. VDR activation is essential for the proper formation and maintenance of normal bone. In the diseased kidney, the activation of vitamin D is diminished, resulting in a rise of PTH, subsequently leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and disturbances in calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. Decreased levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 have been observed in the early stages of chronic kidney disease. The decreased levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 and resultant elevated PTH levels, both of which often precede abnormalities in serum calcium and phosphorus, affect bone turnover rate and may result in renal osteodystrophy.

- **Mechanism of action**: Paricalcitol is a synthetic, biologically active vitamin D2 analog of calcitriol. Preclinical and in vitro studies have demonstrated that paricalcitol's biological actions are mediated through binding to VDRs.

### Elevated PTH with normal serum calcium level: a structured approach [^111PJEAj]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism is a common biochemical finding, typically identified during assessments of bone or renal health. *To accurately assess the condition*, hypercalcemia must be considered by calculating adjusted calcium levels, and a thorough history should be taken to evaluate dietary calcium intake and the potential for malabsorption syndromes.

Important diagnostic steps include measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and supplementation if necessary.

The management plan for the patient is influenced by the context in which calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) were measured. In this brief review, we describe the assessment of a patient with normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism.

### Parathyroid disorders [^116feLqL]. American Family Physician (2022). Low credibility.

Parathyroid disorders are most often identified incidentally by abnormalities in serum calcium levels when screening for renal or bone disease or other conditions. Parathyroid hormone, which is released by the parathyroid glands primarily in response to low calcium levels, stimulates osteoclastic bone resorption and serum calcium elevation, reduces renal calcium clearance, and stimulates intestinal calcium absorption through synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.

Primary hyperparathyroidism, in which calcium levels are elevated without appropriate suppression of parathyroid hormone levels, is the most common cause of hypercalcemia and is often managed surgically. **Indications for parathyroidectomy**: Presence of symptoms, age 50 years or younger, serum calcium level more than 1 mg per dL above the upper limit of normal, osteoporosis, creatinine clearance less than 60 mL per minute per 1.73 m², nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and hypercalciuria.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is caused by alterations in calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D regulation that result in elevated parathyroid hormone levels. It most commonly occurs with chronic kidney disease and vitamin D deficiency, and less commonly with gastrointestinal conditions that impair calcium absorption. **Management of secondary hyperparathyroidism**: Calcium and vitamin D replacement and reduction of high phosphate levels. There is limited evidence for the use of calcimimetics and vitamin D analogues for persistently elevated parathyroid hormone levels.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^114guUzo]. Nature Reviews. Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

In this review, we describe the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) with a focus on recent advances in the field. PHPT is a common endocrine disorder characterized by hypercalcemia and elevated or inappropriately normal serum levels of parathyroid hormone. Most often, the presentation of PHPT is asymptomatic in regions of the world where serum levels of calcium are routinely measured. In addition to mild hypercalcemia, PHPT can manifest with osteoporosis and hypercalciuria as well as vertebral fractures and nephrolithiasis, both of which can be asymptomatic. Other clinical forms of PHPT, such as classical disease and normocalcemic PHPT, are less common.

Parathyroidectomy, the only curative treatment for PHPT, is recommended in patients with symptoms and those with asymptomatic disease who are at risk of progression or have subclinical evidence of end-organ sequelae. Parathyroidectomy results in an increase in bone mineral density (BMD) and a reduction in nephrolithiasis. Various medical therapies can increase BMD or reduce serum levels of calcium, but no single drug can do both. More data are needed regarding the neuropsychological manifestations of PHPT and the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to sporadic PHPT, as well as risk factors for complications of the disorder. Future work that advances our knowledge in these areas will improve the management of the disorder.

### Evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism: Summary statement and guidelines from the fifth international workshop [^114DBWVe]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for primary hyperparathyroidism, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, PHPT-IW-5 2022 guidelines recommend including the following in the differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia and elevated levels of PTH:

- **Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia**: In younger patients with a urinary Ca/Cr clearance ratio < 0.01 and/or a family history of hypercalcemia.

- **Thiazide diuretics and lithium**: Consider these medications.

- **Ectopic secretion of PTH**: Although very rare, it should be considered.

### Diagnosis and management of pseudohypoparathyroidism and related disorders: First international consensus statement [^1117cftq]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

PHP and related disorders are primarily clinical diagnoses. Identification of the molecular cause should be performed to confirm the clinical diagnosis and allow the characterization of the subtype of the disease (A++).

- **Testing for genetic or epigenetic causes**: This should be based on the clinical characteristics, local access to genetic testing, and the most likely identified causes of the disease at the time of analysis according to the algorithm [see Molecular diagnosis section] (A++).

The experts have highlighted that administration of exogenous PTH (modified Ellsworth–Howard test) is not necessary but might be helpful in research settings. Assessment of Gₛ α bioactivity is usually not required for the clinical diagnosis of PHP and related disorders.

- **Main clinical components**: In the majority of patients with PHP, the most important clinical manifestation is symptoms of hypocalcaemia due to PTH resistance (45–80%). Periods of rapid growth and the associated increased calcium requirement, or nutritional calcium or vitamin D deficiency, might trigger or intensify symptoms.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^117MfMgy]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Mild pHPT is often overtly asymptomatic but can cause silent organ damage, which progresses over time. It is known that some patients will suffer progressive hypercalcemia or organ damage. However, even today, there is no way of predicting which patients with biochemically mild pHPT will benefit from surgery. Therefore, it is important to evaluate every indication for treatment, even in patients with mild pHPT.

A study in a North American specialist clinic reported the same frequency of nephrolithiasis in normocalcemic patients as in those with hypercalcemia. However, bone density was higher in the normocalcemic patients. In a group consisting of 52 patients with pHPT, but not meeting any indications for treatment at baseline, 27% of conservatively managed patients developed at least one indication for surgery over a 10-year period.

Surgery had the same effect on normalizing serum calcium and PTH as well as on self-reported symptoms, regardless of whether patients were normocalcemic or hypercalcemic before surgery. One study reported that the effect of parathyroidectomy on the quality of life in patients with mild pHPT was at least as good as in hypercalcemic patients.

Based on these facts, international guidelines recommend careful investigation of possible organ damage and symptoms after considering differential diagnoses and establishing the diagnosis of pHPT. Selected cases should be offered surgery, and for those not meeting indications for treatment, regular checks of serum calcium and development of organ damage should be offered.

### Further insights into the pathogenesis of primary hyperparathyroidism: a nested case-control study [^1143HsSs]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is largely unknown. The objective of the study was to ascertain the plasma levels of calcium, PTH, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) as measured prior to a clinical diagnosis of PHPT.

Within three population-based cohorts, participants diagnosed with PHPT after their inclusion were identified. Cases (n = 117) were compared with age, gender, and season-matched controls (n = 233).

The time from inclusion until a diagnosis of PHPT had a median of 5.6 years. Parathyroidectomy was performed in 97% of the cases. At the cohort inclusion, undiagnosed PHPT was present in 63% of the cases. Among those without PHPT at inclusion (n = 43), 55% had normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism (vs. 21% in the matched controls, P < 0.01), and 31% had normoparathyroid hypercalcemia. Overall, 25OHD levels were lower in the cases. Compared with their matched controls, 25OHD levels were lower in normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism but not in normoparathyroid hypercalcemia. An adenoma was removed from 78% of the cases with normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism, whereas 39% of the cases with normoparathyroid hypercalcemia had parathyroid hyperplasia (P = 0.02). Overlap performance showed a positive predictive value for later PHPT of 95% for plasma calcium levels greater than 2.52 mmol/liter. Excluding cases with vitamin D insufficiency, the positive predictive value for later PHPT was 83% for PTH levels greater than 5.0 pmol/liter.

Years prior to a clinical diagnosis of PHPT, calcium homeostasis shows signs of perturbations.

### Clinical guidelines and PTH measurement: Does assay generation matter [^111g74q9]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

PTH is an important regulator of calcium and phosphate homeostasis and bone remodeling. It is metabolized into PTH fragments, which are measured to different extents by PTH assays of different generations due to differences in fragments recognized and a lack of assay standardization. PTH is measured in the workup of several conditions, and clinical guidelines provide recommendations concerning these measurements.

This review provides an overview of the impact of differences between PTH assays, applying distinct clinical guidelines for primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism and perioperative use of PTH measurements. Guidelines address PTH measurement in different ways, recommending either trend monitoring, the use of a fold increase of the upper reference limit, or an absolute PTH cutoff value.

For classic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), the type of PTH assay used does not affect diagnosis or management because the precise concentration of PTH is less relevant. In chronic kidney disease, the guideline recommends treating secondary hyperparathyroidism when there is a twofold to ninefold PTH increase, which results in different clinical decisions depending on the assay used. For patients after bariatric surgery, guidelines state absolute cutoff values for PTH; however, the impact of different generation assays is unknown since direct comparison of PTH assays has never been performed.

During parathyroid surgery, PTH measurements with a third-generation assay reflect treatment success more rapidly than second-generation assays. Increased awareness among clinicians regarding different PTH assay generations is essential for accurate diagnosis and management.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^113dWWvX]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to review primary hyperparathyroidism and the key issues that are relevant to the practicing endocrinologist.

- **Methods**: The latest information on the presentation, diagnosis, and traditional and nontraditional aspects of primary hyperparathyroidism is reviewed.

- **Results**: The diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism is straightforward when the traditional hypercalcemic patient is documented to have an elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. Commonly, patients are identified who have normal serum calcium levels but elevated PTH levels in whom no secondary causes for hyperparathyroidism can be confirmed. Traditional target organs of primary hyperparathyroidism — the skeleton and the kidneys — continue to be a focus in the patient evaluation. Bone mineral density shows a typical pattern of involvement with the distal one-third radius being selectively reduced compared with the lumbar spine, in which bone mineral density is generally well maintained. Neurocognitive and cardiovascular aspects of primary hyperparathyroidism, while a focus of recent interest, have not been shown to definitively aid in the decision for, or against surgery. The recommendation for surgery in primary hyperparathyroidism is based on guidelines that focus on the serum calcium level, renal function, bone mineral density, and age. In patients who do not meet guidelines, a nonsurgical management approach has merit.

- **Conclusions**: Primary hyperparathyroidism is continuing to show changes in its clinical profile, with normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism being a topic of great interest.

Hypercalcaemia is commonly seen in the context of parathyroid dysfunction and malignancy and, when severe, can precipitate life-threatening sequelae. The differential diagnosis of hypercalcaemia is broad and can be categorized based on parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. The acute management of severe hypercalcaemia is discussed, along with a brief review of therapeutic advances in the field.

A 27-year-old woman was initially diagnosed and treated for depression with suicide ideation. Thirteen months later, kidney stones, an elevated parathyroid hormone, and elevated calcium levels led to a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. The patient was treated for hyperparathyroidism by resection of the superior right parathyroid gland. When the calcium levels were regulated, the patient's moods, concentration, and memory returned to baseline.

### Eucalcemic parathyroid hormone elevation after parathyroidectomy for primary sporadic hyperparathyroidism: Risk factors, trend, and outcome [^1116AQeg]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Although primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) remains a relatively uncommon endocrine disease among Asian countries, with an incidence ranging between 0.5 and 1 per 3000 of the general population, it has been increasing over the last decade. This increase is related to better patient education, increased disease awareness, and more frequent serum calcium screening. Similar to the West, parathyroidectomy proves to be a cost-effective and curative treatment for the majority of pHPT patients. In experienced hands, the surgical cure rate approaches 95%–100% with minimal morbidity. However, despite attaining postoperative normocalcemia, parathyroid hormone (PTH) elevation is not uncommonly observed after surgery.

In the literature, this phenomenon of eucalcemic parathyroid hormone elevation (ePTH) has been well described and studied, although the exact etiology remains poorly understood. Several explanations or causes have been suggested. These include relative postoperative hypocalcemia/vitamin D deficiency leading to secondary HPT, chronic renal impairment, renal leak of calcium, bone remineralization or bone hunger, changes in the calcium-sensing receptors, decreased vitamin D 1-alpha-hydroxylation, and PTH receptor downregulation as a response to the high preoperative PTH level. Our clinical experience indicates that ePTH tends to concern referring physicians and treating surgeons alike. Furthermore, the natural history of postoperative ePTH and the optimal testing schedule following parathyroidectomy remains not entirely defined. More importantly, some authors have suggested that perhaps

### New parathyroid function index for the differentiation of primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism: a case-control study [^111pqKGW]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

The symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) are mainly attributable to an elevated calcium concentration. However, many PHPT patients are asymptomatic. This phenomenon is partly explained by a decrease in serum calcium concentrations due to vitamin D deficiency. In previous studies, a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was observed in both healthy individuals and PHPT patients. Thus, the third International Workshop guidelines recommended the exclusion of vitamin D deficiency-induced secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) prior to the diagnosis of PHPT. It would be better to make a final diagnosis after correcting the vitamin D deficiency, as noted previously. Vitamin D repletion requires a period of 2–3 months. A parathyroid function index (PFindex) greater than 34 could avoid this additional waiting time and allow the arrangement of advanced tests for PHPT, such as parathyroid ultrasound and radionuclide imaging. Patients with suspected hyperparathyroidism and a PFindex greater than 34 could proceed with further diagnostic evaluation immediately. The positive predictive value of this PFindex in the population was reported as 72.5%, while the negative predictive value was 40.2%.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for primary hyperparathyroidism, specifically concerning diagnosis, the PHPT-IW-5 2022 guidelines recommend diagnosing hypercalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism based on an elevated serum calcium level adjusted for albumin. This should be in conjunction with an elevated or inappropriately normal intact PTH level, using either a second or third generation assay, on two occasions at least two weeks apart.

### Pth — a particularly tricky hormone: why measure it at all in kidney patients [^114ggsGk]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations are commonly measured in the context of chronic kidney disease (CKD), as elevated PTH levels are typical in this clinical context. Much has been inferred from this tendency for raised PTH concentrations, both about the state of skeletal integrity and health and also the potential clinical outcomes for patients. However, reliance on PTH concentrations alone is considered a dangerous substitute for searching for and using more precise and reliable biomarkers. In this article, we explore these arguments, bringing together patient-level and analytical considerations for the first time.

### Calcitonin: Current concepts and differential diagnosis [^112632Xm]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Elevated serum calcitonin (CT) levels are associated with various causes and controversies.

- **Overproduction**: Endogenous CT secretion can be increased as a physiological consequence of excessive stimuli, such as hypercalcemia and hypergastrinemia. Primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy are the most common causes of hypercalcemia, accounting for approximately 90% of cases. Chronic hypercalcemia is a rare cause of CT elevation. Oral calcium administration can elicit diverse hormonal responses that assist in the differential diagnosis of these conditions. Thyroid parafollicular cells can express a calcium-sensing receptor similar to that on the parathyroid gland. In contrast to parathyroid hormone (PTH), binding of this receptor stimulates CT release. Hypergastrinemia can arise from conditions like achlorhydria, such as pernicious anemia, atrophic gastritis, and the use of antacids, or from Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. CT can also be elevated in situations where its precursors are elevated, such as pancreatitis, bacterial inflammation, sepsis, or use of CGRP inhibitors for migraine treatment.

Overproduction of CT may also occur primarily, not just as a response to CT secretagogues. While not pathognomonic, elevated CT is most commonly associated with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), serving as a diagnostic and prognostic tool. However, MTC is not the only thyroid pathology that can present with hypercalcitoninemia.

- **Clinical relevance**: C-cell hyperplasia (CCH) has been linked to slight increases in both basal (10–30 mg/dl) and stimulated serum CT levels (< 560 mg/dl).

### Hyperparathyroidism, humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, and the anabolic actions of parathyroid hormone and parathyroid hormone-related protein on the skeleton [^111NcUNP]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2002). Low credibility.

What have we learned from the Takeuchi case? It has been 80 years since malignancy-associated hypercalcemia was described. It has been 45 years since HHM was first described. It has been 15 years since PTHrP was identified, and 12 years since PTHrP immunoassays became available for clinical research. We now know almost everything about HHM in pathophysiological terms, and we can reproduce the cardinal features of the syndrome in laboratory animals and humans. The Takeuchi case reminds us that we still have a few things to learn about HHM.

Specifically, "Why is the regulation of 1,25(OH)2D different in patients with HHM and HPT?" and "Why is normal osteoblast-osteoclast coupling dysregulated in HHM?" or more fundamentally, "What regulates osteoblast-osteoclast coupling, and why is it deranged in HHM?" Given the rate of accumulation of new information about HHM, the anabolic effects of PTH and PTHrP, and osteoblast-osteoclast coupling over the past 10 years, there is reason to be optimistic that the answers to these questions will soon become clear.

### Relationship between parathyroid mass and parathyroid hormone level in hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism [^111s5HVb]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Since the sensitivity of imaging procedures has been reported to be lower in secondary hyperparathyroidism than in primary hyperparathyroidism, even with the use of combined neck ultrasonography and parathyroid scintigraphy, bilateral surgical exploration with identification of all glands is required. Moreover, since the relatively small size of missed adenomatous glands could always lead to a high rate of re-operation in patients where major anesthesia risks are frequent, surgeons need to obtain a general preoperative assessment not only about the localization but also the influence of parathyroid mass on PTH secretion.

The relationship between the parathyroid gland and the parathyroid hormone level remains uncertain. Inaba et al. reported that serum bio-PTH, but not intact PTH, correlated significantly in a positive manner with the maximal diameter of the parathyroid gland. Takatoshi et al. also demonstrated that the secretion of PTH solely depends on the size of the parathyroid glands. However, some evidence suggests that the parathyroid mass is less important for PTH secretion than the 'quality' of the parathyroid mass. The 'content' of the different nodules in severe parathyroid hyperplasia determines the PTH secretion. Since the mass of the parathyroid gland was usually determined by ultrasonography in those studies, it should be noted that ultrasonography tests are typically heavily operator-dependent and exhibit wide variability. In our study, we evaluated the mass by directly measuring the three dimensions of the resected parathyroid glands during operation.

### Calcium intake and risk of primary hyperparathyroidism in women: Prospective cohort study [^114UDfQR]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Calcium intake could have a role in the pathogenesis of primary hyperparathyroidism by influencing the production of parathyroid hormone. The monoclonal nature of the single parathyroid adenoma that causes the large majority of cases of primary hyperparathyroidism suggests a neoplasm that originates from single cells with a growth-conferring mutation. Because factors that cause parathyroid hyperplasia, such as lower calcium intake, increase the probability that a parathyroid cell will undergo a somatic mutation and subsequent clonal proliferation, such factors could increase the risk for developing primary hyperparathyroidism. The peak disease incidence occurring later in life also suggests that risk factors for primary hyperparathyroidism could be due to a chronic stimulus over time. Future research should examine other environmental and lifestyle risk factors that could chronically stimulate the parathyroid gland and thereby affect subsequent development of primary hyperparathyroidism.

### Approach to the patient: Management of parathyroid diseases across pregnancy [^112GUCcN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Parathyroid disorders during pregnancy are relatively rare and are characterized by disturbances in calcium and mineral metabolism. In primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), elevated or inappropriately high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels increase serum calcium concentrations, while in hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT), reduced or inadequately low PTH levels lead to hypocalcemia. PHPT is a common endocrine disease with a female predominance and an age-dependent increase in prevalence, whereas HypoPT is a rare condition mainly caused by anterior neck surgery.

Management of parathyroid disorders during pregnancy can be challenging and significantly differs in various ways from nonpregnant patients. Scientific evidence from systematic evaluations regarding this issue is very limited, particularly concerning maternal management and fetal outcomes. Clinicians caring for pregnant patients with parathyroid disorders require sufficient knowledge of the pathophysiology of the diseases themselves, as well as the physiology of pregnancy, which induces fundamental changes in bone and mineral metabolism during pregnancy and lactation.

### Natpara (parathyroid hormone) [^112Euznm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any signs and symptoms of high or low blood calcium levels.

Natpara is a prescription parathyroid hormone (PTH) used with calcium and vitamin D to control low blood calcium (hypocalcemia) in people with low PTH blood levels (hypoparathyroidism). It is only for individuals who do not respond well to treatment with calcium and active forms of vitamin D alone, as it may increase the possible risk of bone cancer (osteosarcoma). Natpara has not been studied in individuals with hypoparathyroidism due to calcium-sensing receptor mutations or those who develop sudden hypoparathyroidism after surgery.

The safety and effectiveness of Natpara for children 18 years of age and younger is not known. It should not be used in children and young adults whose bones are still growing.

Do not use Natpara if you are allergic to parathyroid hormone or any of the ingredients in Natpara. Please refer to the end of the Medication Guide for a complete list of ingredients in Natpara.

Before you start using Natpara, inform your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:

### Rare genetic disorders that impair parathyroid hormone synthesis, secretion, or bioactivity provide insights into the diagnostic utility of different parathyroid hormone assays [^1117e8wU]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). High credibility.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is the major peptide hormone regulator of blood calcium homeostasis. Abnormal PTH levels can be observed in patients with various congenital and acquired disorders, including chronic kidney disease (CKD). This review focuses on rare human diseases caused by PTH mutations that have provided insights into the regulation of PTH synthesis and secretion, as well as the diagnostic utility of different PTH assays.

Over the past years, numerous diseases affecting calcium and phosphate homeostasis have been defined at the molecular level that are responsible for reduced or increased serum PTH levels. The underlying genetic mutations impair parathyroid gland development, involve the PTH gene itself, or alter the function of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) or its downstream signaling partners that contribute to the regulation of PTH synthesis or secretion. For instance, mutations in the pre-sequence of the mature PTH peptide can impair hormone synthesis or intracellular processing. Additionally, amino acid substitutions affecting the secreted PTH(1–84) can impair PTH receptor (PTH1R) activation or cause defective cleavage of the pro-sequence, resulting in the secretion of a pro-PTH with much reduced biological activity. Mutations affecting the secreted hormone can alter detection by different PTH assays, thus requiring detailed knowledge of the utilized diagnostic test.

Rare diseases affecting PTH synthesis and secretion have offered helpful insights into parathyroid biology and the diagnostic utility of commonly used PTH assays.

### Diagnosis and management of hypophosphatemic disorders [^116heeBC]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Phosphate, in addition to being an essential component of the mineralized skeleton, plays a role in various physiological and cellular functions. Several mineral-regulating hormones, including 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, and fibroblast-growth factor 23, modulate serum phosphate levels predominantly at the level of the bone, kidney, and intestine. Impaired serum phosphate levels can lead to non-specific symptoms, and serum phosphate levels are not routinely measured in laboratory analyses. Therefore, disorders of hypophosphatemia are often overlooked during patient evaluations.

In the past few decades, significant progress has been made in identifying the genetic causes of and novel therapies for hypophosphatemic disorders. This review will discuss the regulation of phosphate homeostasis, clinical presentation, work-up, disorders, and treatment of hypophosphatemia.

### Eucalcemic parathyroid hormone elevation after parathyroidectomy for primary sporadic hyperparathyroidism: Risk factors, trend, and outcome [^1174VN9S]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

The change in mean postoperative serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was analyzed on Day 1, at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 2 years after parathyroidectomy in those with a normal PTH level at 6 months (group A) and those with elevated PTH at 6 months (group B). The blue line represents group A (n = 98) while the yellow line represents group B (n = 63).

- **Multivariable analysis of preoperative and perioperative factors**:
	- This analysis identifies the five most statistically significant preoperative and perioperative risk factors for elevated PTH 6 months after parathyroidectomy. Specifically, adenoma weight, instead of total parathyroid weight, was considered. After adjusting for preoperative PTH, creatinine level, and adenoma weight, it was found that advanced age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.042) and low 25OHD₃ (OR = 1.043) are independent preoperative factors for elevated PTH 6 months post-surgery.

	- PTH: Parathyroid hormone, 25OHD₃: 25-hydroxyvitamin D₃

- **Multivariable analysis of operative and postoperative factors**:
	- The examination of the five most statistically significant operative and postoperative risk factors for elevated PTH 6 months post-parathyroidectomy revealed significant findings. Factors beyond the 6-month mark were excluded from the model; only the 10-minute intraoperative PTH (IOPTH) measurement was considered. Adjustments were made for surgical approach, postoperative Day 0 calcium (Ca) level, and Day 1 Ca level. It was concluded that a high 10-minute IOPTH level (OR = 1.015) and a high postoperative 3-month PTH (OR = 1.048) are independent postoperative factors for elevated PTH 6 months after the surgery.

- **Results**: Table 1 shows a comparison of patient demographics, preoperative biochemical profile, and bone mineral density (BMD) between groups A and B. Group B was significantly older at the time of parathyroidectomy (P = 0.003), had higher preoperative calcium levels (P = 0.020), higher parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (P < .001), higher creatinine levels (P = 0.015), and lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D₃ (25OHD₃) levels (P = 0.007) than group A. However, preoperative serum alkaline phosphatase and 24-hour urine calcium daily excretion were similar between the two groups. Of the 137 patients (85.1%) who had BMD measured less than four months before surgery, the BMD at the forearm, femoral neck, and lumbar spine were significantly lower in group B than in group A.

- **Table 1 caption**: Comparison of patient demographics, preoperative biochemical profile, and bone mineral density between those who had normal PTH level six months after parathyroidectomy (group A) and those who had elevated PTH six months after parathyroidectomy (group B).

PTH refers to parathyroid hormone, and 25OHD 3 refers to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3.

a. Available in 121 patients
b. Available in 137 patients

- **Table 2**: Shows a comparison of operative findings between groups A and B. Group B had significantly heavier mean total parathyroid tissue excised (1467.5 ± 1946.0 mg vs 937.5 ± 2113.9 mg, P < .001) and adenoma (1461.1 ± 1947.9 mg vs 924.4 ± 2118.2 mg, P < .001) than group A. Although group B had significantly more focused or unilateral parathyroid exploration (92.1% vs 79.6%, P = 0.044), the number of parathyroid glands excised and total operating time were similar in the two groups. Consistent with the higher preoperative PTH level, the intraoperative PTH (IOPTH) level at induction, 0 min, and subsequent measures were analyzed.

### Hypercalcemia secondary to gastrointestinal stromal tumors: Parathyroid hormone-related protein independent mechanism [^1168S9UE]. Endocrine Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a common paraneoplastic manifestation of many malignancies like breast, ovarian, and squamous-cell cancers of the head and neck; however, there have been only a few case reports of hypercalcemia associated with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). We report a case of GIST presenting with hypercalcemia without any osseous metastasis and provide a literature review regarding the mechanisms of hypercalcemia and therapeutic strategies.

- **Methods**: We present a report of the case and a review of the relevant literature.

- **Results**: A 52-year-old woman with a history of localized breast cancer in remission and a pelvic 13 × 12 cm GIST with peritoneal, liver, and lung metastases presented with hypercalcemia of 14.3 mg/dL (8.5–10.5 mg/dL). Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) was undetectable, intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) was appropriately low at 1 pg/mL (10–65 pg/mL), and 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D (1,25 OH2 vit D) was elevated at 131 pg/mL (18–78 pg/mL) with normal renal function. Calcium responded transiently to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy and bisphosphonates, but within a year, she expired due to tumor progression.

- **Conclusion**: GIST is a rare cause of hypercalcemia. In addition to PTHrP expression, direct tumor production of 1,25(OH)2 vit D or 1-α hydroxylase enzyme resulting in activation of 25-hydroxy vitamin D may be an alternative mechanism in GIST-related hypercalcemia. Therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and bisphosphonates is recommended, though prognosis is poor. Further investigations are needed to characterize the etiology and management.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^113fus1j]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), the most common cause of hypercalcemia, is most often identified in postmenopausal women. The clinical presentation of PHPT has evolved over the past 40 years to include three distinct clinical phenotypes, each of which has been studied in detail and has led to evolving concepts about target organ involvement, natural history, and management.

- **Methods**: In the present review, I provide an evidence-based summary of this disorder as it has been studied worldwide, citing key concepts and data that have helped to shape our concepts about this disease.

- **Results**: PHPT is now recognized to include three clinical phenotypes: overt target organ involvement, mild asymptomatic hypercalcemia, and high PTH levels with persistently normal albumin-corrected and ionized serum calcium values. The factors that determine which of these clinical presentations is more likely to predominate in a given country include the extent to which biochemical screening is used, vitamin D deficiency is present, and whether parathyroid hormone levels are routinely measured in the evaluation of low bone density or frank osteoporosis. Guidelines for parathyroidectomy apply to all three clinical forms of the disease. If surgical guidelines are not met, parathyroidectomy can also be an appropriate option if no medical contraindications are present. If either the serum calcium or bone mineral density is of concern and surgery is not an option, pharmacological approaches are available and effective.

- **Conclusions**: Advances in our knowledge of PHPT have guided new concepts in its management and understanding.

### Pseudohypoparathyroidism: A rare but important cause of hypocalcaemia [^113aZHxV]. BMJ Case Reports (2013).

We present a 46-year-old Caucasian lady with symptomatic hypocalcaemia. Investigations revealed markedly raised parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels with vitamin D deficiency. A number of conditions causing secondary hyperparathyroidism were ruled out from her medical history and initial investigations. The main differential diagnoses were vitamin D deficiency and PTH resistance (pseudohypoparathyroidism, PHP). With high-normal serum phosphate and normal alkaline phosphatase, and a lack of symptoms associated with osteomalacia, vitamin D deficiency alone was unlikely to be the cause of hypocalcaemia. Given a normal physical appearance, genetic testing was arranged and confirmed the diagnosis of PHP type Ib. She is currently taking activated vitamin D to maintain calcium homeostasis. PTH resistance is the hallmark of PHP, a rare complex genetic disorder, which can be easily missed resulting in potentially serious consequences.

### Molecular and clinical spectrum of primary hyperparathyroidism [^117MGtsN]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Recent data suggest an increase in the overall incidence of parathyroid disorders, with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) being the most prevalent parathyroid disorder. PHPT is associated with morbidities, such as fractures, kidney stones, and chronic kidney disease, and carries an increased risk of mortality. The symptoms of PHPT can be nonspecific, potentially delaying diagnosis. Approximately 15% of patients with PHPT have an underlying heritable form that may be associated with extraparathyroidal manifestations, necessitating active surveillance, as observed in multiple endocrine neoplasia types 1 and 2A.

Genetic testing for heritable forms should be offered to patients with multiglandular disease, recurrent PHPT, early-onset PHPT (age ≤ 40 years), and those with a family history of parathyroid tumors. Nonetheless, the genetic cause in the majority of patients with heritable forms of PHPT remains unidentified. Differentiation between sporadic and heritable forms of PHPT is critical for surgical planning of parathyroidectomy and has implications for family members. Currently known genes associated with heritable forms of PHPT account for roughly half of sporadic parathyroid tumors, yet the genetic cause in about half of sporadic parathyroid tumors remains unknown. Furthermore, there is no systemic therapy for parathyroid carcinoma, a rare but potentially fatal cause of PHPT. An improved understanding of the molecular characteristics of parathyroid tumors will facilitate the identification of biomarkers for diagnosis and the development of novel therapeutic targets.

### Hyperparathyroidism [^114NPRLk]. Lancet (2018). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common endocrine disorder of calcium metabolism characterized by hypercalcemia and elevated or inappropriately normal concentrations of parathyroid hormone. Almost always, primary hyperparathyroidism is due to a benign overgrowth of parathyroid tissue, either as a single gland (80% of cases) or as a multiple gland disorder (15–20% of cases). Primary hyperparathyroidism is generally discovered when asymptomatic, but the disease always has the potential to become symptomatic, resulting in bone loss and kidney stones. In countries where biochemical screening tests are not common, symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism tends to predominate. Another variant of primary hyperparathyroidism has been described, in which the serum calcium concentration is within the normal range, but parathyroid hormone is elevated in the absence of any obvious cause. Primary hyperparathyroidism can be cured by removal of the parathyroid gland or glands, but identification of patients who are best advised to have surgery requires consideration of the guidelines that are regularly updated. Recommendations for patients who do not undergo parathyroid surgery include monitoring of serum calcium concentrations and bone density.

### Is parathyroid hormone measurement useful for the diagnosis of renal bone disease [^111Xjaby]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

The non-invasive diagnosis of bone turnover in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains difficult compared with bone histomorphometry, which is considered the gold standard. Most clinicians rely on surrogate markers, mainly serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) and total alkaline phosphatases, in conjunction with serum calcium and phosphorus. Although very high serum PTH levels generally support the diagnosis of high bone turnover, slight elevations, normal, or low values do not allow for a reliable distinction between normal and low turnover.

### Persistent elevation of parathyroid hormone after curative parathyroidectomy: A risk factor for recurrent hyperparathyroidism [^115wWb6f]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Up to 45% of patients may have persistently elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels after curative parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), although the clinical significance is unclear. We aimed to assess the long-term clinical significance of persistently elevated PTH early after parathyroidectomy.

- **Methods**: A prospectively collected institutional database was queried for patients who underwent parathyroidectomy for sporadic PHPT between 12/99 and 6/22 and had normal serum calcium levels at 6 months postoperatively. Demographic and clinical data were collected, including diagnoses associated with secondary HPT (gastrointestinal malabsorptive diseases, kidney disease, and vitamin D deficiency). Patients were divided into two groups: normal PTH or elevated PTH at 6 months postoperatively. The rate of persistently elevated PTH, average time to PTH normalization, and time to recurrence were determined.

- **Results**: The final cohort included 1,146 patients; 849 (91%) had normal PTH levels and 194 (17%) had early postoperative normocalcemia with elevated PTH at 6 months postoperatively. Among 194 patients (mean follow-up: 50 ± 53 months), 14 (7.2%) developed rePHPT, and 86 (44.3%) had normalization of PTH levels (median time to normalization: 12 months) (IQR: 9 and 15). There was no difference in the presence of diagnoses associated with secondary HPT between patients who had rePHPT, normalization of PTH levels, or remained normocalcemic with persistently elevated PTH levels. The median time to recurrence was 22 months (IQR: 11 and 48).

### Failure to diagnose and treat hyperparathyroidism among patients with hypercalcemia: Opportunities for intervention at the patient and physician level to increase surgical referral [^111Pk86F]. The Oncologist (2019). Low credibility.

Hyperparathyroidism is both underdiagnosed and undertreated; however, the reasons for these deficiencies have not been described. The purpose of this study was to identify reasons for underdiagnosis and undertreatment of hyperparathyroidism that could be addressed by targeted interventions.

- **Materials and methods**: We identified 3,200 patients with hypercalcemia (serum calcium > 10.5 mg/dL) who had parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels evaluated at our institution from 2011 to 2016. We randomly sampled 60 patients and divided them into three groups based on their PTH levels. Two independent reviewers examined clinical notes and diagnostic data to identify reasons for delayed diagnosis or referral for treatment.

- **Results**: The mean age of the patients was 61 ± 16.5 years, 68% were women, and 55% were white. Fifty percent of patients had ≥ 1 elevated calcium level that was missed by their primary care provider. Hypercalcemia was frequently attributed to causes other than hyperparathyroidism, including diuretics (12%), calcium supplements (12%), dehydration (5%), and renal dysfunction (3%). Even when both calcium and PTH were elevated, the diagnosis was missed or delayed in 40% of patients. For 7% of patients, a nonsurgeon stated that surgery offered no benefit; 22% of patients were offered medical treatment or observation, and 8% opted not to see a surgeon. Only 20% of patients were referred for surgical evaluation, with a median wait of 16 months before seeing a surgeon.

- **Conclusion**: To address common causes for delayed diagnosis and treatment of hyperparathyroidism, we must identify specific barriers and implement strategies at both the patient and physician levels.

### Bone in parathyroid diseases revisited: Evidence from epidemiological, surgical and new drug outcomes [^112noYiG]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a main regulator of calcium and phosphate metabolism. Calcium levels (Ca²⁺) are tightly controlled through the action of PTH and 1,25(OH)₂D₃ (calcitriol). Calcium-sensing receptors (CaSRs) are localized on the parathyroid cell membrane and detect changes in the serum Ca 2+ concentrations. Hypocalcemia triggers the release of PTH by the parathyroid cells; conversely, hypercalcemia suppresses the release of PTH. PTH stimulates bone resorption, which increases serum calcium and phosphate (PO₄³⁻) levels. In the kidney, PTH stimulates the reabsorption of calcium and promotes phosphate excretion. PTH promotes the conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) to calcitriol in the kidney, the active form of vitamin D responsible for increased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. All these well-orchestrated steps restore calcium levels to the normal range (8.5–10.5 mg/dL) and, via actions of PTH and other hormones, such as fibroblast growth factor 23, in the kidney, restore the phosphate levels within the normal range (2.5–4.5 mg/dL).

### Bone in parathyroid diseases revisited: Evidence from epidemiological, surgical and new drug outcomes [^1127xQKH]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

The equilibrium between new bone formation and bone resorption determines the total net effect of PTH on bone remodeling. When Ca²⁺ in the extracellular space decreases, PTH secretion responds immediately to maintain normal calcium levels by increasing bone resorption more than formation. On the other hand, PTH deficiency results in low bone remodeling, leading to increased BMD, although data regarding fracture risk remain unclear. Overall, these features confirm that PTH plays a pivotal role in regulating bone remodeling. The bone abnormalities caused by endogenous PTH alterations in the context of common parathyroid disorders are detailed later.

### Relationship of vitamin D deficiency and intraoperative parathyroid hormone elevation in completion and total thyroidectomy [^111qRund]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to quantify how frequently intraoperative parathyroid hormone levels increase during thyroid surgery and to explore a possible relationship between secondary hyperparathyroidism due to vitamin D deficiency and elevation in intraoperative parathyroid hormone.

- **Study design**: Case series with chart review.

- **Setting**: Tertiary academic center.

- **Subjects and methods**: A total of 428 consecutive patients undergoing completion and total thyroidectomy by the senior author over a 7-year period were included for analysis. All patients had baseline and postexcision intraoperative parathyroid hormone levels as well as vitamin D levels from the same laboratory. Institute of Medicine criteria were employed for vitamin D stratification (> 30, normal; 20–29.9, insufficient; < 20, deficient). Other data analyzed include sex, age, neck dissection status, and parathyroid autotransplantation.

- **Results**: A total of 118 patients (27.6%) had an intraoperative parathyroid hormone elevation above baseline. Patients with vitamin D deficiency were significantly more likely to experience hormone elevation (P = 0.04). When parathyroid hormone rose, it did so by a mean 32.1 pg/mL. Patients with vitamin D deficiency demonstrated significantly larger hormone increases (P = 0.03).

- **Conclusion**: Elevation in intraoperative parathyroid hormone levels above baseline after completion and total thyroidectomy occurs in over one-fourth of cases and is significantly associated with vitamin D deficiency. This study is the first to report this observation. We hypothesize that vitamin D deficiency in these patients contributes to intraoperative parathyroid hormone elevation.

### Bone in parathyroid diseases revisited: Evidence from epidemiological, surgical and new drug outcomes [^115bL7zz]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

PTH is a key regulator of calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. Parathyroid glands synthesize PTH as a precursor peptide, storing it as a cleaved bioactive molecule (PTH 1–84). Parathyroid cells have the capacity to sense minute fluctuations in extracellular calcium through the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). CaSR is a G protein-coupled receptor that mediates signaling through activation of phospholipase C, leading to the generation of diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate.

This signaling pathway results in an increase in intracellular calcium and inhibition of PTH release. PTH is excreted in response to low serum ionized calcium levels (Ca²⁺), whereas PTH gene transcription and stability are inhibited by increased Ca²⁺. Chronic hypocalcemia promotes cellular replication, leading to hyperplasia of the parathyroid glands. PTH actions aim to restore serum calcium levels, directly affecting bone and kidney mineral metabolism and indirectly affecting intestinal mineral absorption.

In a normal state, these interactions strictly maintain Ca²⁺ levels within a narrow range (1.1–1.3 mmol/L). Precise homeostasis of Ca 2+ is requisite not only for bone metabolism but also for many other physiological processes, such as cell signaling and neuromuscular function.

### Effect of calcium citrate vs calcium carbonate on elevated parathyroid hormone after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. A double-blinded, randomized trial [^112zAuwy]. Clinical Endocrinology (2018). High credibility.

Following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels that are potentially harmful to bone health are commonly observed. Due to assumed superior absorption, calcium citrate is often recommended over calcium carbonate following RYGB for the treatment of elevated PTH. We aimed to investigate the impact of either calcium carbonate or calcium citrate (1200 mg elementary calcium) in patients with elevated PTH levels following RYGB.

This study was a clinical, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial of a 12-week duration at a Danish University Hospital. Thirty-nine RYGB-operated patients with elevated PTH levels (PTH > 6.9 pmol/L) and normal plasma levels of calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were randomized to either calcium carbonate or calcium citrate (1200 mg elementary calcium daily). We assessed the change in PTH as the primary outcome.

The effect of the two calcium formulations on the change in PTH was comparable and neutral: -1.9% for patients taking calcium citrate versus +0.9% for patients taking calcium carbonate (P = 0.680). Compared to the carbonate-treated group, the following bone turnover markers decreased significantly in the citrate-treated group: procollagen I N-terminal propeptide (-16.6% vs -3.2%, P = 0.021), osteocalcin (-17.2% vs -4.3%, P = 0.007), and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (-5.9% vs 3.7%, P = 0.027), and these remained significantly decreased after multivariable adjustment.

Increasing the dose of calcium supplementation in RYGB-operated patients with slightly elevated PTH levels does not normalize PTH levels.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^114rcog5]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2016). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common disorder characterized by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) from one or more of the four parathyroid glands. In most cases, a single benign parathyroid adenoma is the cause. However, multiglandular disease is not rare and is typically observed in familial PHPT syndromes. The genetics of PHPT tend to be monoclonal when a single gland is involved and polyclonal in cases of multiglandular disease. The implicated genes include proto-oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes.

Hypercalcemia is the biochemical hallmark of PHPT. The concentration of PTH is typically increased but can remain within the normal range, which is abnormal in the context of hypercalcemia. Normocalcemic PHPT is a recognized variant where the serum calcium level remains persistently normal, but PTH levels are increased without an obvious inciting stimulus.

The clinical presentation of PHPT varies from asymptomatic cases (common in countries where biochemical screening is routine) to classic symptomatic disease, where renal and/or skeletal complications are evident. Recent management guidelines have been revised to assist clinicians in deciding between parathyroidectomy and non-surgical interventions.

This primer addresses these areas, with a focus on the epidemiology, clinical presentations, genetics, evaluation, and updated management guidelines for PHPT.

### Etiology and pathophysiology of hypoparathyroidism: A narrative review [^1137UZxH]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Low credibility.

The kidney is a target organ often damaged in patients with hypoparathyroidism. Under normal conditions, PTH is critical to sustain renal distal tubular reabsorption of filtered Ca and, therefore, to maintain the extracellular Ca concentrations. When PTH is absent, less Ca is reabsorbed, and the extracellular Ca level is not maintained within the normal range. However, the absolute amount of urinary Ca is not usually high because there is a reduced filtered load in untreated patients. Similarly, insufficient PTH secretion causes a larger proximal tubular reabsorption of filtered P resulting in hyperphosphatemia. Lack of PTH action impairs 1,25-(OH)₂D production. Low 1,25-(OH)₂D contributes to reduced distal tubular Ca reabsorption and intestinal Ca and P absorption, as suggested by animal studies.

Conversely, renal complications are found in patients with hypoparathyroidism treated with active vitamin D and/or Ca. Three main complications have been reported: nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Activation of the CaSR inhibits distal tubular Ca reabsorption and enhances urinary Ca excretion. These problems are especially frequent in patients with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia 1 caused by activating mutations in CASR. Nephrolithiasis is reported to be a complication in up to 36% of patients with hypoparathyroidism. Nephrocalcinosis is reported to complicate the course of hypoparathyroidism in up to 38% of patients, depending on the population.

### Bone in parathyroid diseases revisited: Evidence from epidemiological, surgical and new drug outcomes [^116ZwtS7]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT, THPT) are conditions reflecting a compensatory rise in PTH levels intended to rectify the lower bioavailability of calcium and/or vitamin D. PTH plays a crucial role in calcium homeostasis by aiming to restore serum calcium levels during hypocalcemia through renal, intestinal, and bone actions. The failure of one or more components of the calcium homeostatic mechanisms may lead to SHPT. Although kidney disease is the most common cause, any disorder that results in hypocalcemia or vitamin D deficiency can cause elevated PTH levels, such as reduced calcium intake or absorption, reduced absorption, synthesis or function of vitamin D and its active metabolites, hepatic failure, and impaired function of PTH.

The diagnosis of SHPT is supported by a detailed clinical history and examination, along with laboratory evaluation of calcium metabolism indices: serum albumin-adjusted calcium and ionized calcium, phosphate, PTH, 25OH-hydroxyvitamin D, and ALP. Hyperparathyroidism, by definition, is characterized by increased levels of PTH. Distinguishing between primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and SHPT usually relies on serum calcium levels, with high levels indicating PHPT and low/low-normal levels indicating SHPT. Because of the phosphaturic impact of PTH, both PHPT and SHPT are typically linked to low-normal serum phosphate levels with intact renal function. However, biochemical values may differ depending on the underlying cause of SHPT. Although most signs and symptoms experienced by patients with SHPT are related, the clinical presentation can vary significantly.

### Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and genetics of primary hyperparathyroidism [^116SAsJ3]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Low credibility.

More details about the clinical features of classical PHPT and other aspects of the disease are found in the accompanying article. The cardinal biochemical finding in PHPT is hypercalcemia. Clonally dysregulated overgrowth of one or more parathyroid glands, accompanied by a reduced expression of the CaSR in that tissue, is the most common pathophysiologic basis for this finding. Thus, there is both a mass effect, with a net increase in the amount of PTH being secreted, as well as an altered set-point for calcium-mediated suppression of PTH secretion.

Perhaps because of these dual pathophysiologic mechanisms, serum levels of PTH do not correlate particularly well with the size of the adenoma in typical cases of PHPT. Even when such a correlation has been reported, gland size has been found to vary widely with a given level of circulating PTH, especially when the PTH value is mildly to moderately elevated. Extreme elevations in PTH do, however, raise the specter of parathyroid carcinoma.

### Hypercalcemia and cancer: Differential diagnosis and treatment [^116uRQtU]. CA (2018). Low credibility.

Incidentally detected hypercalcemia usually presents in an indolent manner and is most commonly caused by primary hyperparathyroidism. In contrast, hypercalcemia in a patient with a history of cancer presents in a wide range of clinical settings and may be severe enough to warrant hospitalization. This form of hypercalcemia is usually secondary to hypercalcemia of malignancy and can be fatal. Hypercalcemia of malignancy is most commonly mediated by tumoral production of parathyroid hormone-related protein or by cytokines activating osteoclast degradation of bone. The initial workup, differential diagnoses, confirmatory laboratory testing, imaging, and medical and surgical management of hypercalcemia are described in the patient with cancer.

### Associations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D with circulating PTH, phosphate and calcium in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism [^114osHtk]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Despite NIH clinical recommendations, many clinicians are reluctant to replace vitamin D in patients with hypercalcaemia with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHP) due to concerns over aggravating hypercalcaemia. Furthermore, the optimum level of vitamin D replacement in PHP remains unclear.

- **Methods**: We performed a large retrospective study to determine whether a relationship exists between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, calcium, and other important biochemical markers in patients with PHP. Serum, plasma, and urinary biochemical measurements were collected from 251 patients with hypercalcaemia diagnosed with PHP.

- **Results**: When examining overall mean circulating levels during clinical follow-up, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D correlated highly significantly with plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) (r = -0.23, P = 0.0003) and serum phosphate (r = 0.16, P = 0.0119). No significant relationship was observed between serum calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (r = 0.002, P = 0.98). Mean plasma PTH during clinical follow-up was 51% lower in patients with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D > 60 nm when compared with patients who had 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 20 nm (P = 0.0006). Patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D > 60 nm have significantly reduced PTH hypersecretion when compared with patients with deficient vitamin D levels, without exhibiting worse hypercalcaemia.

### Eucalcemic parathyroid hormone elevation after parathyroidectomy for primary sporadic hyperparathyroidism: risk factors, trend, and outcome [^115vm6iU]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Comparison of postoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH), adjusted calcium levels, follow-up period, and recurrence rate between those who had normal PTH levels 6 months after parathyroidectomy (group A) and those who had elevated PTH 6 months after parathyroidectomy (group B) was detailed in the text. Figure 1 illustrates the change in mean postoperative PTH level on Day 1, and at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 2 years after parathyroidectomy in both groups.

In both groups, there was a significant rise in PTH from postoperative Day 1 to 3 months. However, after 6 months, there were no significant changes in PTH in group A, whereas there was a significant drop in group B. Postoperative PTH elevation appeared to peak at 3–6 months in group B.

In the first 2 postoperative years, only 78 patients (48.4%) maintained normal postoperative PTH levels over the entire cohort. Additionally, 75 patients (46.6%) had elevated PTH levels on at least one occasion, and 8 (5.0%) had persistently elevated PTH on all occasions. Upon further analysis, in group B, 26 of 55 patients (47.3%) showed normalized PTH at 12 months, while in group A, 10 of 86 patients (11.6%) had elevated PTH at 12 months.

Overall, the proportion of patients with normalized PTH increased from 62.5% at 6 months to 78.7% at 2 years. Although at 2 years, the difference in PTH levels was still significant between the two groups.

### Significance of elevated parathyroid hormone after parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism [^112BLtWV]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

To provide a clinical update on persistent parathyroid hormone (PTH) elevation after surgical resection for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and to suggest a schedule for follow-up monitoring and strategies for future study, we reviewed the literature focusing on studies with a detailed analysis of biochemical parameters before and after parathyroidectomy for PHPT. We concentrated on potential etiologies and currently available outcome data.

PTH elevation with eucalcemia after parathyroidectomy for PHPT occurs in 12% to 43% of patients. The underlying etiology is likely multifactorial, with possible causes including bone hunger, vitamin D deficiency, inadequate calcium intake or absorption, reduced peripheral sensitivity to PTH, underlying chronic kidney disease, and/or a renal leak of calcium. No consensus exists on how to follow up and treat these patients.

Most patients with PTH elevation after parathyroidectomy will experience normalization of PTH levels with time and/or calcium and vitamin D supplementation. However, this finding may be an early indicator of autonomous parathyroid secretion in a small number of patients. Patients with persistent PTH elevation should be monitored over time for recurrence of PHPT and other potential complications. A standardized follow-up protocol is necessary to better study and elucidate the clinical significance of elevated PTH after parathyroidectomy.

False-negative results in choline/methionine studies may occur in cases of moderate hypercalcemia and non-elevated PTH serum levels (so-called "abnormally normal serum PTH level"). In the case of MGD, one or several hyperplastic glands may be missed, particularly in sHPT or MEN. False-negative results may also be caused by a too restricted field of view, in particular in case of recurrence after parathyroidectomy.

### CKD-mineral and bone disorder and risk of death and cardiovascular hospitalization in patients on hemodialysis [^1131MdQ3]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Parathyroid hormone, calcium, and phosphate have been independently associated with cardiovascular event risk. Because these parameters may be on the same causal pathway and have been proposed as quality measures, an integrated approach to estimating event risks is needed.

- **Design, setting, participants, and measurements**: Prevalent dialysis patients were followed from August 31, 2005, to December 31, 2006. A two-stage modeling approach was used. First, the 16-month probabilities of death and the composite endpoint of death or cardiovascular hospitalization were estimated and adjusted for potential confounders. Second, patients were categorized into one of 36 possible phenotypes using average parathyroid hormone, calcium, and phosphate values over a 4-month baseline period. Associations among phenotypes and outcomes were estimated and adjusted for the underlying event risk estimated from the first model stage.

- **Results**: Of 26,221 patients, 98.5% were in 22 groups with at least 100 patients, and 20% were in the reference group defined using guideline-based reference ranges for parathyroid hormone, calcium, and phosphate. Within the 22 most common phenotypes, 20% of patients were in groups with significantly (P < 0.05) higher risk of death, and 54% were in groups with significantly higher risk of the composite endpoint relative to the in-target reference group. Increased risks ranged from 15% to 47% for death and from 8% to 55% for the composite. More than 40% of all patients were in the three largest groups with elevated com.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: What is the role of parathyroid surgery [^114L9MaD]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is an endocrine condition resulting from inappropriate parathyroid hormone (PTH) hypersecretion. Traditionally, the biochemical profile of PHPT is characterized by elevated serum calcium (> 2.6 mmol/l) with elevated or 'inappropriately normal' PTH, which may result in multi-system complications, including fractures and nephrolithiasis. However, an increasingly common biochemical profile is of raised PTH in the context of normal serum calcium (total and ionised), vitamin D, and renal function — recognized as normocalcaemic PHPT (nPHPT). This biochemical picture is largely being discovered in patients through osteoporosis screening. Whilst the reported prevalence of nPHPT varies significantly within the literature (0.1–8.9%), a recent retrospective study of 6,280 patients by Schini et al. reported a prevalence of 0.18%.

### Hypercalcemia: A review [^117NS27X]. JAMA (2022). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia affects approximately 1% of the worldwide population. Mild hypercalcemia, defined as total calcium of less than 12 mg/dL (3.5 mmol/L) or ionized calcium of 10 mg/dL or greater (≥ 2.5 mmol/L) or that develops rapidly over days to weeks, can cause nausea, vomiting, dehydration, confusion, somnolence, and coma.

- **Observations**: Approximately 90% of people with hypercalcemia have primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) or malignancy. Additional causes of hypercalcemia include granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis, endocrinopathies such as thyroid disease, immobilization, genetic disorders, and medications such as thiazide diuretics and supplements such as calcium, vitamin D, or vitamin A. Hypercalcemia has been associated with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 protein inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, denosumab discontinuation, SARS-CoV-2, ketogenic diets, and extreme exercise, but these account for less than 1% of causes. Serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) is the most important initial test to evaluate hypercalcemia, as it distinguishes PTH-dependent from PTH-independent causes. In a patient with hypercalcemia, an elevated or normal PTH concentration is consistent with PHPT, while a suppressed PTH level (< 20 pg/mL depending on the assay) indicates another cause.

### Age-related increases in parathyroid hormone may be antecedent to both osteoporosis and dementia [^112W3biP]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Numerous studies have reported that age-induced increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) plasma levels are associated with cognitive decline and dementia. However, little is known about the correlation that may exist between neurological processing speed and bone density in cases of hyperparathyroidism or elevated PTH. The latency of the P300 auditory evoked potential, which measures processing speed and has been shown to accurately predict memory impairment, has only been studied with PTH levels in chronic renal failure. The last work on this topic, to our knowledge, was published in 1983.

PTH is anabolic in bone, but when secreted in excess, it is catabolic. Its levels increase with age in both genders, paralleling the incidence of osteopenia and osteoporosis. Recombinant human PTH 1–34 (teriparatide) is now being used as a treatment for osteoporosis, and its administration has been shown to stimulate bone formation and increase bone mineral density. Interestingly, it has recently been discovered that intermittent administration of teriparatide inhibits endogenous PTH production, possibly via negative feedback. So far, there has not yet been any published research on teriparatide administration for hyperparathyroidism-induced osteoporosis.

Our greater understanding of PTH has led to the lowering of the reference ranges. In 2003, the American Kidney Foundation recommended that levels should be kept between 35 and 70 pg/ml for stage 3 chronic kidney disease, which is characterized by a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m².

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for primary hyperparathyroidism, more specifically with respect to vitamin D and calcium supplementation, the CTFH 2017 guidelines recommend correcting any vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. This helps lower serum PTH without further elevating serum calcium. They further advise correcting serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels to greater than 50 nmol/L.

### Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: new issues and new questions — bridging the past with the future [^11266dkG]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2002). Low credibility.

The earliest clinical descriptions of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) pointed to an inexorably progressive disorder. However, in many asymptomatic individuals who do not meet any surgical guidelines for intervention, PHPT in general does not seem to be progressive. Most asymptomatic patients remain asymptomatic over many years of observation.

For patients with major clinical manifestations, nephrolithiasis is by far the most common. In these cases, surgery is clearly indicated. Bone densitometry is an indispensable component of evaluation and monitoring because there is evidence of bone involvement in most patients. This contrasts with skeletal X-rays, which are invariably negative. Nevertheless, patients with PHPT can show a bone mass measurement, either at the cortical or cancellous skeleton, that is more than 2 standard deviations below age- and sex-matched control subjects.

Bone density, serum calcium concentration, and/or urinary calcium excretion can show evidence of progression in as many as 25% of patients with asymptomatic PHPT. Newer pharmacologic approaches to PHPT are the subject of intense investigation, with bisphosphonates and calcimimetics showing particular promise.

Unanswered questions include whether the lower bone density in milder patients will increase substantially as in those who undergo successful parathyroidectomy, and whether fracture risk would therefore be reduced. Can medical therapy reduce serum calcium, parathyroid hormone levels, and other biochemical indices of PHPT? Can medical therapy improve bone density without the need for surgery?

### Parathyroid disorders [^111ct6Gh]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Disorders of the parathyroid glands most commonly present with abnormalities of serum calcium. Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, the most common cause of hypercalcemia in outpatients, are often asymptomatic or may have bone disease, nephrolithiasis, or neuromuscular symptoms. Patients with chronic kidney disease may develop secondary hyperparathyroidism with resultant chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder. Hypoparathyroidism most often occurs after neck surgery; it can also be caused by autoimmune destruction of the glands and other less common problems.

Evaluation of patients with abnormal serum calcium levels includes a history and physical examination, repeat measurement of serum calcium level, and measurement of creatinine, magnesium, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone levels. The treatment for symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism is parathyroidectomy. Management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism includes monitoring symptoms, serum calcium and creatinine levels, and bone mineral density. Patients with hypoparathyroidism require close monitoring and vitamin D (e.g. calcitriol) replacement.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism and the kidney: Biochemical and clinical spectrum [^115Pc561]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2002). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism manifests biochemically as a disturbance in serum calcium homeostasis. The central organ setting serum calcium level is the kidney, which not only has the highest rate of active calcium transport but also modulates serum calcium homeostasis through its endocrine role in 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D secretion. Receptors for PTH are widely expressed throughout the renal tubule and are involved in both calcium transport and endocrine function. Biochemical manifestations of primary hyperparathyroidism by the kidney include increased tubular reabsorption of calcium, decreased reabsorption of phosphate and bicarbonate, and hypercalciuria.

A reduction in glomerular filtration may occur in some patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, which perturbs the diagnostic relationships among biochemical variables and induces further increases in PTH secretion. Parathyroidectomy rapidly restores the biochemical abnormalities to normal, apart from chronic reduced glomerular filtration. Clinical manifestations include nephrolithiasis, which is common, and nephrocalcinosis, which is uncommon. Nephrocalcinosis may occur with or without nephrolithiasis. Risk factors for nephrolithiasis are oversaturation of urine with calcium phosphate and calcium oxalate. Risk factors for nephrocalcinosis are not clearly defined. Parathyroidectomy greatly reduces the incidence of nephrolithiasis but has little effect on nephrocalcinosis.

### Hyperparathyroidism [^1176xNEt]. Lancet (2018). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on primary hyperparathyroidism:

- **Definition**: Primary hyperparathyroidism is an endocrine disorder of calcium metabolism resulting from an abnormal increase in the secretion of PTH from one or more of the parathyroid glands.

- **Pathophysiology**: It is primarily caused by solitary parathyroid adenoma (80%), four-gland hyperplasia (10–15%), multiple adenomas (5%), and parathyroid cancer (< 1%).

- **Epidemiology**: The average incidence of primary hyperparathyroidism in men and women in the US is 24.7 and 65.5 cases per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The age-adjusted prevalence in men and women is 85.2 and 232.7 per 100,000 individuals, respectively.

- **Disease course**: Primary hyperparathyroidism can present with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic biochemical abnormalities to overt end-organ complications. In developed countries, approximately 85% of patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis, identified incidentally through routine biochemical screening, while around 20% present with renal manifestations (such as nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis), skeletal complications (including fractures, osteitis fibrosa cystica, or bone pain), or symptomatic hypercalcemia. In contrast, the majority of patients in developing countries present with symptomatic disease. Symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism is associated with overt skeletal and renal complications and may also include cardiovascular and neurocognitive symptoms.
