## Question

What are the antibiotics of choice for copd exacerbation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about which antibiotics are recommended for treating COPD exacerbations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether antibiotics are indicated at all using validated criteria. Then, I should stratify by severity and care setting. Next, I will select empiric agents based on local resistance patterns and patient risk factors. After that, I need to determine duration and route. Finally, I should consider stewardship, special populations, and follow-up, while double-checking areas of controversy and aligning with guideline strength of evidence.

> Let me first confirm the indication threshold, because I need to ensure we are not overusing antibiotics. The most consistently endorsed approach is the Anthonisen criteria: treat when there is increased sputum purulence plus increased sputum volume and/or dyspnea, or when the patient requires mechanical ventilation, as this profile increases the likelihood of bacterial infection and improves the chance of benefit from antibiotics [^116VjHs8] [^117KVkjS]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — benefit is modest in outpatients and stronger in severe disease, so I should verify severity and symptoms before prescribing [^111ashKS] [^113QQbbj].

> Next, I should review severity and care setting, because the magnitude of benefit varies with illness severity. For ICU patients with very severe exacerbations, antibiotics confer large reductions in treatment failure and mortality, so I should not delay therapy there [^112f7miJ]. For inpatients with severe exacerbations, evidence is mixed but generally supportive of antibiotics reducing treatment failure, though mortality effects are uncertain, so I should individualize based on clinical judgment and risk of poor outcomes [^112f7miJ] [^116HxxRh]. For outpatients with mild to moderate disease, benefits are smaller and heterogeneous; antibiotics can reduce treatment failure in some analyses, but I should confirm that at least two Anthonisen criteria are present before treating, and consider watchful waiting if only one is present [^112f7miJ] [^116VjHs8].

> I will now examine empiric antibiotic selection, and I need to ensure I match spectrum to likely pathogens and local resistance. Common outpatient pathogens include Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, so reasonable first-line choices include amoxicillin/clavulanate, a macrolide such as azithromycin, or a tetracycline such as doxycycline, selected according to local antibiograms and patient factors [^116VjHs8] [^114fCEFT]. Wait, let me verify macrolide resistance locally — high macrolide resistance may push me toward amoxicillin/clavulanate or doxycycline instead of azithromycin in many regions [^116VjHs8].

> For inpatients and those with risk factors for poor outcomes, I should confirm whether broader coverage is warranted. In severe disease, frequent exacerbations, or when Pseudomonas risk is present, I should obtain sputum cultures and consider anti-pseudomonal coverage such as piperacillin-tazobactam or a respiratory fluoroquinolone like levofloxacin, while acknowledging that routine empiric fluoroquinolone use should be reserved due to resistance and adverse effects [^112d2K2o]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not overextending quinolones; yes, guidelines advise reserving them for selected cases given collateral damage risks [^112d2K2o].

> Let me think about duration, because shorter effective courses reduce harm. I should confirm that 5 days is sufficient for most patients; indeed, GOLD and ACP endorse a 5-day course for exacerbations with bacterial features, and VA/DoD explicitly recommends 5 days for outpatients when antibiotics are used [^115KNG56] [^1159Zckd] [^114ARoyi]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said 7–10 days out of habit — older practice favored longer, but contemporary evidence supports 5 days for uncomplicated cases, with longer only if response is suboptimal or complications arise [^115KNG56].

> I need to check the route of administration and ensure it aligns with absorption and clinical status. Oral therapy is preferred when feasible given similar efficacy and fewer complications than IV, with IV reserved for inability to take oral medications, severe illness, or when pharmacokinetics demand it, such as in ICU settings or with certain agents [^114fCEFT]. Let me reconsider whether IV improves outcomes in stable inpatients — no, unless there is a specific indication, oral therapy is appropriate and safer [^114fCEFT].

> Next, I should review stewardship and special populations, and I need to ensure I am not missing allergies or comorbidities. In penicillin allergy, I should avoid amoxicillin/clavulanate and consider doxycycline, a macrolide, or TMP-SMX depending on severity and local patterns, while remembering macrolides can prolong QT and affect hearing, especially in older adults or those on interacting drugs [^1176f4Jn] [^116VjHs8]. I should double-check for prior macrolide use if considering long-term prophylaxis, as resistance emerges and macrolides are not interchangeable for acute treatment and prevention indications [^114C293u] [^116PnJLP].

> I should confirm whether biomarkers can safely reduce unnecessary antibiotics. CRP-guided strategies in primary care can reduce antibiotic prescribing without increasing treatment failure, and sputum color can be used pragmatically — white or clear sputum supports withholding antibiotics, whereas green purulence increases bacterial probability and supports treatment in the right clinical context [^117KVkjS]. Hold on, I should verify procalcitonin — evidence is mixed and not sufficient to recommend routine procalcitonin-guided decisions in COPD exacerbations at this time, so I should not rely on it outside of protocols [^117KVkjS].

> Let me synthesize practical choices by scenario, and I will double-check each against guidelines. For a typical outpatient with increased dyspnea, sputum volume, and purulence, amoxicillin/clavulanate 875/125 mg twice daily for 5 days is a solid first-line choice, with azithromycin 500 mg day 1 then 250 mg daily days 2–5 or doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 5 days as alternatives if local resistance or allergy dictates [^116VjHs8] [^1159Zckd]. For a hospitalized patient without Pseudomonas risk, I would continue first-line oral options if stable, but if severe or not improving, I should obtain cultures and escalate to an IV beta-lactam with broader coverage while awaiting results, reassessing at 48–72 hours [^114fCEFT]. For ICU patients or those needing ventilation, I should start broad-spectrum therapy promptly, typically an anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam or a respiratory fluoroquinolone, and de-escalate based on cultures and clinical response [^114fCEFT].

> But wait, what if the patient has only one Anthonisen feature or is very mild — should I prescribe anyway? I should pause and consider watchful waiting with close follow-up, because overtreatment is common and drives resistance; if no improvement in 3–5 days, then antibiotics can be added, aligning with stewardship principles and the modest, heterogeneous benefit seen in outpatients [^116VjHs8] [^112f7miJ]. I need to ensure the patient understands red flags for deterioration and has a clear return plan if symptoms worsen [^115rviYR].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up and reassessment. Clinical success is typically judged within 3–5 days by improvement in dyspnea, cough, and sputum characteristics. Lack of improvement should prompt reconsideration of the diagnosis, adherence, obstruction, or resistant pathogens, and may warrant culture-directed therapy or imaging for pneumonia [^116ZsM2N]. I should double-check for adverse effects such as diarrhea and C. difficile, especially with broader-spectrum agents, and document the rationale for any escalation or de-escalation to support antimicrobial stewardship [^116HxxRh] [^116VjHs8].

The antibiotics of choice for COPD exacerbations are **amoxicillin-clavulanate, macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin), or doxycycline** for most patients, selected based on local resistance patterns and patient factors [^114fCEFT] [^116VjHs8]. Use **fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin)** only for patients with severe disease, frequent exacerbations, or risk factors for Pseudomonas or multidrug-resistant organisms [^1176f4Jn] [^112d2K2o]. Antibiotics are indicated for patients with increased sputum purulence plus increased sputum volume and/or dyspnea, or those requiring mechanical ventilation [^116VjHs8] [^115KNG56]. The recommended duration is **5 days** for most patients, with 7–10 days reserved for severe cases or complications [^115KNG56] [^1159Zckd].

---

## Indications for antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are **not indicated for all COPD exacerbations**; they are recommended for patients with the following clinical features:

- **Increased sputum purulence**: Yellow or green sputum indicating bacterial infection [^116VjHs8] [^117KVkjS].

- **Increased sputum volume**: More sputum production than usual [^116VjHs8].

- **Increased dyspnea**: Worsening shortness of breath [^116VjHs8].

- **Mechanical ventilation**: Patients requiring invasive or non-invasive ventilation [^116VjHs8] [^115KNG56].

---

## First-line antibiotic choices

The following antibiotics are recommended as **first-line therapy** for COPD exacerbations:

| **Antibiotic class** | **Examples** | **Indications** |
|-|-|-|
| Aminopenicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitor | - Amoxicillin-clavulanate | - First-line choice for most patients <br/> - Effective against common pathogens (Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae) [^113ZAecG] |
| Macrolides | - Azithromycin <br/> - Clarithromycin | - Alternative first-line option <br/> - Effective against common pathogens <br/> - Useful in patients allergic to penicillin [^notfound] |
| Tetracyclines | - Doxycycline | - Alternative first-line option <br/> - Effective against common pathogens <br/> - Useful in patients allergic to penicillin [^notfound] |

---

## Second-line antibiotic choices

Second-line antibiotics are reserved for patients with **severe disease, frequent exacerbations, or risk factors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa or multidrug-resistant organisms**:

- **Fluoroquinolones**: Levofloxacin or moxifloxacin are recommended for patients with severe airflow obstruction, frequent exacerbations, or recent antibiotic use [^112d2K2o].

- **Pseudomonas coverage**: Piperacillin-tazobactam or ceftazidime are recommended for patients with risk factors for Pseudomonas infection [^1118ak9k].

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

The recommended duration of antibiotic therapy for COPD exacerbations is **5 days** for most patients, which has been shown to be as effective as longer courses and reduces the risk of antibiotic resistance and adverse effects [^115KNG56] [^1159Zckd]. For severe exacerbations or complications, a **7–10 day course** may be necessary [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing antibiotic selection

Antibiotic selection should be **individualized** based on the following factors:

- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, comorbidities, severity of airflow obstruction, previous exacerbation history, and antibiotic allergies [^114fCEFT] [^112d2K2o].

- **Local resistance patterns**: Antibiotic choice should be guided by local bacterial resistance data [^114fCEFT] [^116VjHs8].

- **Previous antibiotic use**: Recent antibiotic exposure increases the risk of resistance and may necessitate broader-spectrum antibiotics [^117NBcsi] [^112d2K2o].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with antibiotic therapy

Antibiotic therapy in COPD exacerbations has been shown to:

- **Reduce treatment failure**: Antibiotics significantly reduce the risk of treatment failure, particularly in patients with severe exacerbations [^112f7miJ] [^116HxxRh].

- **Shorten recovery time**: Antibiotics shorten the time to recovery and reduce the risk of early relapse [^1139DjP8].

- **Reduce hospitalization duration**: Antibiotics reduce the length of hospital stay and healthcare costs [^1139DjP8].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Antibiotic therapy in COPD exacerbations is associated with several potential risks and adverse effects, including **antibiotic resistance** — which is a significant concern, particularly with frequent or inappropriate antibiotic use [^114F6Nuc] — and common adverse effects such as gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, and allergic reactions [^111ECBZt]. Clostridioides difficile infection is a serious complication, particularly with broad-spectrum antibiotics [^notfound].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from GOLD, ATS/ERS, and VA/DoD recommend antibiotic therapy for COPD exacerbations based on clinical features and severity. GOLD 2025 recommends antibiotics for patients with increased sputum purulence plus increased sputum volume and/or dyspnea, or those requiring mechanical ventilation [^116VjHs8] [^115KNG56]. The **ATS/ERS 2017** guideline advises considering antibiotics in ambulatory patients with COPD exacerbations [^116MgriJ]. The **VA/DoD 2021** guideline recommends a 5-day course of antibiotics for outpatients with COPD exacerbations [^114ARoyi].

Antibiotics are indicated for COPD exacerbations with increased sputum purulence plus increased sputum volume and/or dyspnea, or for those requiring mechanical ventilation [^116VjHs8]. First-line choices include **amoxicillin-clavulanate, macrolides, or doxycycline**, with fluoroquinolones reserved for severe cases or specific risk factors [^1176f4Jn]. The recommended duration is **5 days** for most patients, with 7–10 days for severe cases or complications [^115KNG56].

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations — antibiotic indications and duration: Antibiotics should be given to patients with exacerbations of COPD who meet cardinal symptom criteria or require mechanical ventilation (invasive or noninvasive). A metanalysis demonstrated that ≤ 5 days of antibiotic treatment had the same clinical and bacteriological efficacy as longer conventional treatment in outpatients, and We recommend a duration of ≤ 5 days of antibiotic treatment for outpatient treatment of COPD exacerbations. Based on conflicting data, we cannot recommend at this time the use of procalcitonin-based protocols to decide on antibiotic use in COPD exacerbations.

### Sputum colour charts to guide antibiotic self-treatment of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: the colour-COPD RCT [^117NBcsi]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic condition affecting 2 million people in the UK, causing over 140 000 hospital admissions and 1.7% of UK hospital bed days per year. Each year around half of all patients with COPD have frequent exacerbations (acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD; ≥ 2 per year), and in the UK 44%–85% of patients with this AECOPD rate were hospitalised again within 12 months. Exacerbations are defined by 'worsening of respiratory symptoms beyond normal day-to-day variations and leading to a change in medication'. Cardinal symptoms include altered sputum volume and/or colour and worsening dyspnoea. A systematic review in 2012 found bacteria in just 46% of exacerbations, suggesting antibiotics will effectively manage only half of AECOPD episodes — nevertheless they are used in the majority of events. Inappropriate antibiotic use or overuse increases the long-term risk of antibiotic resistanceand reducing antibiotic resistance through appropriate stewardship is a recognised priority. In hospitalised AECOPD patients' resistance occurs in up to 66% of cases and relates to past antibiotic use, suggesting those with prior hospitalisation or frequent antibiotic courses are a key group to target for interventions aimed at reducing resistance.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has raised many questions about the management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and whether modifications of their therapy are required. It has raised questions about recognizing and differentiating coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from COPD given the similarity of the symptoms. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Science Committee used established methods for literature review to present an overview of the management of patients with COPD during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear whether patients with COPD are at increased risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2. During periods of high community prevalence of COVID-19, spirometry should only be used when it is essential for COPD diagnosis and/or to assess lung function status for interventional procedures or surgery. Patients with COPD should follow basic infection control measures, including social distancing, hand washing, and wearing a mask or face covering. Patients should remain up to date with appropriate vaccinations, particularly annual influenza vaccination. Although data are limited, inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting bronchodilators, roflumilast, or chronic macrolides should continue to be used as indicated for stable COPD management. Systemic steroids and antibiotics should be used in COPD exacerbations according to the usual indications. Differentiating symptoms of COVID-19 infection from chronic underlying symptoms or those of an acute COPD exacerbation may be challenging. If there is suspicion for COVID-19, testing for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered. Patients who developed moderate-to-severe COVID-19, including hospitalization and pneumonia, should be treated with evolving pharmacotherapeutic approaches as appropriate, including remdesivir, dexamethasone, and anticoagulation. Managing acute respiratory failure should include appropriate oxygen supplementation, prone positioning, noninvasive ventilation, and protective lung strategy in patients with COPD and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Patients who developed asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 should be followed with the usual COPD protocols. Patients who developed moderate or worse COVID-19 should be monitored more frequently and accurately than the usual patients with COPD, with particular attention to the need for oxygen therapy.

### Where is the supporting evidence for treating mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations with antibiotics? A systematic review [^1123J9Qb]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Randomised trials comparing different drugs head-to-head are extremely valuable for clinical decision-making. However, it is scientifically and ethically sensible to demand strong evidence that a drug is effective by showing superiority over a placebo before embarking on head-to-head comparisons of potentially ineffective drugs. Our aim was to study the evolvement of evidence from placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials on the effects of antibiotics for the treatment of mild to moderate exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Methods

We conducted a historical systematic review. Through electronic databases and hand-searches, we identified placebo-controlled and head-to-head antibiotic trials for the treatment of mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations. We compared the numbers of patients recruited in placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials between 1957 and 2005. Using cumulative meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials, we determined when, if ever, placebo-controlled trials had shown convincing evidence that antibiotics are effective in preventing treatment failure in patients with mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations.

Results

The first head-to-head trial was published in 1963. It was followed by another 100 trials comparing different antibiotics in a total of 34,029 patients with mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations. Over time, the cumulative odds ratio in placebo-controlled trials remained inconclusive throughout with odds ratios ranging from 0.39 (95% confidence intervals 0.04–4.22) to the most recent estimate (1995) of 0.81 (95% confidence intervals 0.52–1.28, P = 0.37).

Conclusion

Placebo-controlled trials do not support the use of antibiotics in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with mild to moderate exacerbations. Conducting head-to-head trials is, therefore, scientifically and ethically questionable. This underscores the requirement to perform or study systematic reviews of placebo-controlled trials before conducting head-to-head trials.

### The problems of meta-analysis for antibiotic treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a heterogeneous disease: a commentary on puhan et al [^114HTN8X]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Recent American College of Physicians/American College of Chest Physicians guidelines for COPD exacerbations state for future research priorities: 'Our first research objectives must include untangling the questions surrounding selection of patients for antibiotic and corticosteroid treatment, identifying optimal dosing and durations for these agents, and determining the degree to which broad- and narrow-spectrum antibiotics have similar efficacy'. Undoubtedly, as stated by Puhan et al, we need to enlarge our evidence base for the treatment of exacerbations with placebo-controlled trials. However, as highlighted in this commentary, these trials should use contemporary end-points so that we do not miss important, clinically relevant benefits of antibiotics, not assessed by traditional end-points.

Until such studies are completed, how should we treat outpatient 'mild to moderate' exacerbations? Lack of evidence is not the same as lack of efficacy. As discussed above, the heterogeneity of severity and patients among outpatient exacerbations demonstrates that grouping them all together is perhaps not the best course of action. 'Moderate' exacerbations, such as those included in the Anthonisen trial, should receive antibiotics. The choice of initial antibiotics in these patients should be based on a 'risk stratification' approach. 'Mild' exacerbations, such as those included in the Sachs trial, likely do not need antibiotics, especially if they do not have purulent sputum. These are the patients that should be included in placebo-controlled trials with contemporary end-points.

### Antibiotic therapy and treatment failure in patients hospitalized for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116HxxRh]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

Context

Guidelines recommend antibiotic therapy for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but the evidence is based on small, heterogeneous trials, few of which include hospitalized patients.

Objective

To compare the outcomes of patients treated with antibiotics in the first 2 hospital days with those treated later or not at all.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Retrospective cohort of patients aged 40 years or older who were hospitalized from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2007, for acute exacerbations of COPD at 413 acute care facilities throughout the United States.

Main Outcome Measures

A composite measure of treatment failure, defined as the initiation of mechanical ventilation after the second hospital day, inpatient mortality, or readmission for acute exacerbations of COPD within 30 days of discharge; length of stay, and hospital costs.

Results

Of 84,621 patients, 79% received at least 2 consecutive days of antibiotic treatment. Treated patients were less likely than nontreated patients to receive mechanical ventilation after the second hospital day (1.07%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06%-1.08% vs 1.80%; 95% CI, 1.78%-1.82%), had lower rates of inpatient mortality (1.04%; 95% CI, 1.03%-1.05% vs 1.59%; 95% CI, 1.57%-1.61%), and had lower rates of readmission for acute exacerbations of COPD (7.91%; 95% CI, 7.89%-7.94% vs 8.79%; 95% CI, 8.74%-8.83%). Patients treated with antibiotic agents had a higher rate of readmissions for Clostridium difficile (0.19%; 95% CI, 0.187%-0.193%) than those who were not treated (0.09%; 95% CI, 0.086%-0.094%). After multivariable adjustment, including the propensity for antibiotic treatment, the risk of treatment failure was lower in antibiotic-treated patients (odds ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.82–0.92). A grouped treatment approach and hierarchical modeling to account for potential confounding of hospital effects yielded similar results. Analysis stratified by risk of treatment failure found similar magnitudes of benefit across all subgroups.

Conclusion

Early antibiotic administration was associated with improved outcomes among patients hospitalized for acute exacerbations of COPD regardless of the risk of treatment failure.

### Global initiative for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive lung disease. the 2020 GOLD science committee report on COVID-19 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113WJRRc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics

Antibiotic treatment for a COPD exacerbation is indicated if patients have at least two of the three cardinal symptoms, including increased sputum purulence, or if the patient requires mechanical ventilation.

Bacterial coinfections have been reported infrequently in COVID-19. However, the risk of coinfections increases with the severity of COVID-19. Bacterial coinfections have been detected by multiplex PCR testing in up to 46% of samples collected in a small cohort of patients with COVID-19 admitted to an ICU. Diagnosing coinfection in patients with COVID-19 may be difficult, particularly in critically ill subjects, as the clinical presentation, biomarkers, and imaging data may be unhelpful. In practice, most hospitalized patients, particularly the severe ones, have been prescribed empirical antibiotic therapy. Current World Health Organization guidelines recommend broad-spectrum antibiotics in patients with severe COVID-19, guided by the local/national guidelines and in milder COVID-19 infections when there is clinical suspicion of a bacterial infection. In the absence of specific studies, these general considerations would also apply to patients with COPD infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Antibiotics should be used in COPD exacerbations according to the usual indications whether or not there is evidence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly as patients with COPD who develop COVID-19 are reported, to more frequently develop bacterial or fungal coinfections.

### Molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection [^112eeWn5]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a prevalent respiratory condition projected to become the fourth leading cause of death globally by 2060, accounting for an estimated 5.4 million deaths annually. COPD imposes a significant burden on healthcare systems and is associated with high rates of early mortality. Patients who experience frequent exacerbations suffer from reduced quality of life, accelerated decline in lung function, as measured by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and increased mortality. A history of previous exacerbations remains the strongest predictor of future episodes.

Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are often complicated by respiratory infections, which can intensify inflammation and contribute to progressive airway damage. A systematic review indicated that bacterial infections are present in approximately 50% of exacerbation cases. However, current preventive strategies outlined in the GOLD guidelines are limited to one antibiotic, azithromycin, and two vaccines, leaving a significant gap in effective prophylactic therapies. The complex interplay of factors that trigger exacerbations suggests that more comprehensive management strategies are needed.

### Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: when are antibiotics indicated? A systematic review [^113jxYWq]. Respiratory Research (2007). Low credibility.

Background

For decades, there is an unresolved debate about adequate prescription of antibiotics for patients suffering from exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The aim of this systematic review was to analyse randomised controlled trials investigating the clinical benefit of antibiotics for COPD exacerbations.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of randomised, placebo-controlled trials assessing the effects of antibiotics on clinically relevant outcomes in patients with an exacerbation. We searched bibliographic databases, scrutinized reference lists and conference proceedings and asked the pharmaceutical industry for unpublished data. We used fixed-effects models to pool results. The primary outcome was treatment failure of COPD exacerbation treatment.

Results

We included 13 trials (1557 patients) of moderate to good quality. For the effects of antibiotics on treatment failure there was much heterogeneity across all trials (I² = 75%) Meta-regression revealed severity of exacerbation as significant explanation for this heterogeneity (p = 0.038) Antibiotics did not reduce treatment failures in outpatients with mild to moderate exacerbations (pooled odds ratio 1.81, 95% CI 0.55–1.18, I(2) = 13%) Inpatients with severe exacerbations had a substantial benefit on treatment failure rates (pooled odds ratio of 0.25, 95% CI 0.16–0.39, I² = 0%; number-needed to treat of 4, 95% CI 3–5) and on mortality (pooled odds ratio of 0.20, 95% CI 0.06–0.62, I² = 0%; number-needed to treat of 14, 95% CI 12–30).

Conclusion

Antibiotics effectively reduce treatment failure and mortality rates in COPD patients with severe exacerbations. For patients with mild to moderate exacerbations, antibiotics may not be generally indicated and further research is needed to guide antibiotic prescription in these patients.

### Research opportunities in the management of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114jFyVs]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are a common problem in the emergency department. Despite considerable research involving the management of this disease over the past decade, much remains unclear from an emergency medicine perspective. Increased research would better guide the management of these complex patients from the perspectives of the patient, the caregiver, and society. The major areas of research can be divided into diagnosis, therapy, and education. The reliability and validity of different definitions of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease need to be assessed. The utility and performance characteristics of diagnostic testing need to be determined for this difficult patient population. Specific diagnostic tests include measures of dyspnea, spirometry and exercise tolerance, measures of gas exchange, airway inflammation, and chest imaging. It remains unclear which patient-specific therapies (oxygen, bronchodilators, corticosteroids, antibiotics, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, and methylxanthines) should be used and monitored. Finally, the utility of education of both health care providers and patients and how it may be applied to the acute setting need to be addressed.

### Antibiotics for COPD exacerbations: does drug or duration matter? A primary care database analysis [^111xu8Fw]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

The risk of treatment failure without antibiotics needs to be balanced with antimicrobial resistance, contributed to by inappropriate and non-evidence based prescribing, and adverse drug effects, including Clostridium difficile infection. Primary care is an optimal environment to improve antibiotic use since 74% of all UK antibiotics are prescribed here and around three-quarters of patients presenting in primary care with an acute COPD exacerbation receive antibiotics. Moreover, a European-wide COPD audit of hospitalised patients demonstrated that antibiotics were more likely to be continued during admissions and after discharge if they had already been received in primary care.

Guidelines on antibiotics for COPD exacerbations are not specific and based only on moderate evidence. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guidelines for the study period suggest using an aminopenicillin, macrolide or tetracycline but give no indication on duration. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease advises 5–7 days duration but no antibiotic class. A recent meta-analysis presented dirithromycin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin as having the best cure and side-effect profiles, yet these are not used routinely in clinical practice.

In this study, we characterised patterns of antibiotic prescribing for COPD exacerbations via a retrospective observational analysis of primary care data from 2010 to 2015. We explored the factors associated with the risk of further antibiotic prescription, which may form the basis for future comparative interventional studies, such as clinical trials comparing different antibiotic durations, or first-line drugs in specific patient groups.

### Antibiotics for treatment of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a network meta-analysis [^114pFmBK]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is the most common reason for the hospitalization and death of pulmonary patients. The use of antibiotics as adjuvant therapy for AECOPD, however, is still a matter of debate.

Methods

In this study, we searched the PubMed, EmBase, and Cochrane databases for randomized controlled trials published until September 2016 that evaluated the use of antibiotics for AECOPD treatment. The major outcome variables were clinical cure rate and adverse effects. The microbiological response rate, relapse of exacerbation, and mortality were also analysed. A random-effect network was used to assess the effectiveness and tolerance of each antibiotic used for AECOPD treatment.

Results

In this meta-analysis, we included 19 articles that assessed 17 types of antibiotics used in 5906 AECOPD patients. The cluster ranking showed that dirithromycin had a high clinical cure rate with a low rate of adverse effects. Ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole had high clinical cure rates with median rates of adverse effects. In terms of the microbiological response rate, only doxycycline was significantly better than placebo (odds ratio (OR), 3.84; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.96–7.54; p < 0.001). There were no other significant results with respect to the frequency of recurrence or mortality.

Conclusions

Our study indicated that dirithromycin is adequate for improving the clinical cure rate of patients with AECOPD with few adverse effects. Ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are also recommended for disease treatment. However, caution should still be exercised when using antibiotics to treat AECOPD.

End-points in exacerbation trials

Analysis of any study should critically examine if its end-points were adequate to demonstrate the potential benefits of the intervention being tested and were clinically relevant. Unfortunately, in the studies evaluated by Puhan et al, as well as in the vast majority of antibiotic comparison trials in exacerbations of COPD, end-points used favor the demonstration of equivalence rather than differences among the arms (Table 2). Partly, this is the result of mandates (now obsolete) by regulatory agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These end-points assessed at 2 to 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms and the initiation of therapy miss differences in therapeutic effect earlier during the course of treatment. In addition, these end-points have minimal relevance to clinical practice. In clinical practice, most physicians and patients expect clinical improvement in their exacerbation at 3 to 5 days after initiation of treatment. In fact, with insufficient improvement in that timeframe, therapy is often altered or expanded. Allegra et al did conduct a placebo-controlled trial where they used a 5-day time-point, showing a substantial benefit of antibiotics, which was excluded from the analysis by Puhan et al.

Limitations of published placebo-controlled antibiotic trials in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

The adequacy of the traditional goals of treatment of an exacerbation, recovery to baseline clinical status and the prevention of complications, are being questioned because of several new observations. These include realization of the importance of exacerbations in the course of COPD, the role of infection in exacerbations, the high rates of relapse with an adequate initial clinical response, and the role played by chronic infection in the pathogenesis of COPD. Today, confining our goal in the treatment of COPD exacerbations to short-term resolution of symptoms would be analogous to treating acute myocardial infarction with the only aim being resolution of chest pain.

Table 3 lists several other important goals of treatment, both clinical and biological, that should be considered. In fact, the FDA wants precise symptom measurement with a patient-reported outcome measure as the major end-point of future studies of antibiotics in exacerbations. Practical application of the biological goals of treatment of exacerbations should be feasible in the future with ongoing development of simple, rapid and reliable measurements of inflammation and infection.

### Antibiotics for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114eN7Wy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Most patients with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are treated with antibiotics. However the value of their use remains uncertain. Some controlled trials of antibiotics have shown benefit (Berry 1960; Pines 1972) while others have not (Elmes 1965b; Nicotra 1982).

Objectives

To conduct a systematic review of the literature estimating the value of antibiotics in the management of acute COPD exacerbations.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2005); MEDLINE (1966 to December 2005); EMBASE (1974 to December 2005); Web of Science (December 2005), and other electronically available databases.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with acute COPD exacerbations comparing antibiotic (for a minimum of five days) and placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were analysed using Review Manager software. Continuous data were analysed using weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Relative risks (RR) (and 95% CI) were calculated for all dichotomous data. Where appropriate, number needed to treat to benefit (NNT) and 95% CI were calculated.

Main Results

Eleven trials with 917 patients were included. Ten trials used increased cough, sputum volume and purulence diagnostic criteria for COPD exacerbation. Eight-hundred and fifty-seven patients provided data for outcomes including mortality, treatment failure, increased sputum volume, sputum purulence, PaCO(2), PaO(2), peak flow and adverse events. Antibiotic therapy regardless of antibiotic choice significantly reduced mortality (RR 0.23; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.52 with NNT of 8; 95% CI 6 to 17), treatment failure (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.62 with NNT of 3; 95% CI 3 to 5) and sputum purulence (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.77 with NNT of 8; 95% CI 6 to 17). There was a small increase in risk of diarrhoea with antibiotics (RR 2.86; 95% CI 1.06 to 7.76). Antibiotics did not improve arterial blood gases and peak flow.

Authors' Conclusions

This review shows that in COPD exacerbations with increased cough and sputum purulence antibiotics, regardless of choice, reduce the risk of short-term mortality by 77%, decrease the risk of treatment failure by 53% and the risk of sputum purulence by 44%; with a small increase in the risk of diarrhoea. These results should be interpreted with caution due to the differences in patient selection, antibiotic choice, small number of included trials and lack of control for interventions that influence outcome, such as use of systemic corticosteroids and ventilatory support. Nevertheless, this review supports antibiotics for patients with COPD exacerbations with increased cough and sputum purulence who are moderately or severely ill.

### Antibiotic treatment in acute exacerbation of COPD: patient outcomes with amoxicillin vs. amoxicillin / clavulanic acid-data from 43, 636 outpatients [^113ZAecG]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute exacerbations (AECOPD) of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) contribute to high morbidity and mortality. Key symptoms are breathlessness, increased sputum volume and purulence. The treatment involves the use of bronchodilators, oxygen treatment, systemic corticosteroids and often antibiotics. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections, shorten the course of the disease, prevent further deterioration of lung function, and prolong the period between exacerbations. A quick recovery and longer interval between hospitalizations are important, as both the patient's life and healthcare costs are influenced by the severity and the number of AECOPD. The largest and most recent meta-analysis on treatment of AECOPD concludes in line with earlier meta-analyses, that for serious exacerbations (requiring hospital admission) there is moderate evidence that antibiotic treatment improves outcomes compared to placebo. For mild to moderate cases (outpatients), the conclusion is less clear, although it is observed, that the risk of treatment failure, defined as no resolution or deterioration of symptoms, is higher among patients who do not receive antibiotics. No effect was found regarding all-cause mortality or re-exacerbations within 2 to 6 weeks. The conclusion was based on pooled data from studies with different antibiotics, and where various doses were used. When using antibiotics, GOLD recommends that the choice is based on local resistance patterns. Today amoxicillin (AMX) 750 mg three times daily (TID) is recommended as first choice empirical treatment of AECOPD in Denmark in mild to moderate cases, however many clinicians prefer amoxicillin with clavulanic acid (AMC) 500/125 mg TID, as recommended in the previous guideline, referring to the fact that AMC is effective against Moraxella catarrhalis. A bacterial pathogen is believed to be accountable for around half of the deteriorations, where Haemophilus influenzae are most commonly found, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis. AMX has a narrow spectrum of activity compared to AMC. Apart from Staphylococcus aureus and M. catarrhalis, most pathogens that cause community acquired pneumonia and AECOPD that are sensitive to AMC are also sensitive to AMX. The use of AMX instead of AMC in exacerbations in patients with severe COPD has not yet been investigated in a sufficiently large patient population and with clinically important endpoints like pneumonia hospitalization and death. The aim of this study was to determine which of these regimens is associated with better outcomes. On one hand, AMC has a broader spectrum of activity, and on the other hand, AMX is most often administered at a higher dose of amoxicillin (750 mg vs. 500 mg), which may increase the time above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for many pathogenic bacteria. Additionally, side effects may be more frequent when using AMC. The main analysis compares the risk of death or hospitalization due to pneumonia or AECOPD in the 30 days following a first AMX/AMC prescription.

Depending on the severity of an exacerbation and/or the severity of the underlying disease, an exacerbation can be managed in either the outpatient or inpatient setting. More than 80% of exacerbations are managed on an outpatient basis with pharmacological therapies including bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics.

### Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: when are antibiotics indicated? A systematic review [^111Koq5T]. Respiratory Research (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our systematic review informs the debate about appropriate prescription of antibiotics for COPD exacerbations. As long as exacerbations remain an ill-defined event, the distinction between in- and outpatient treatment may serve as simple guidance to decide for or against antibiotics. Patients with severe exacerbations requiring hospital admission benefit substantially from antibiotics. In outpatients with mild to moderate exacerbations, antibiotics appear to offer no benefits in general. Further research will show how the subgroup of patients with mild to moderate exacerbations, who might benefit from antibiotics, can be identified.

### Severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: does the dosage of corticosteroids and type of antibiotic matter? [^112ajs61]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are significant events that result in substantial morbidity and mortality. Antibiotic therapy and systemic corticosteroids are important treatments for patients with severe AECOPD. The objective of this review is to summarize the most recent evidence concerning antibiotic and corticosteroid therapy, with a focused evaluation on the contribution of antibiotic type and corticosteroid dosage on patient outcomes.

Recent Findings

Macrolides should be considered the antibiotic of choice for prevention of AECOPD in patients who qualify for therapy. Macrolides, fluoroquinolones, and beta-lactams are all reasonable treatment options for severe AECOPD and the decision to use one over the other should be based upon patient characteristics and institutional or regional antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. The best available evidence now suggests that higher-dose corticosteroids are not superior to treatment with lower-dose corticosteroids in patients with severe AECOPD. Additionally, longer durations of systemic corticosteroid therapy do not improve clinical outcomes.

Summary

Several antibiotic options are efficacious in the management of severe AECOPD and drug selection should be patient-specific. Recent studies suggest that lower dosages and shorter durations of corticosteroid treatment may be prudent.

### Acute exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: should we use antibiotics and if so, which ones? [^113QQbbj]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute exacerbations are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with evidence suggesting at least 50% of exacerbations involve bacteria that benefit from antibiotic treatment. Here, we review the most relevant data regarding the use of antibiotics in exacerbations of COPD and provide insights on the selection of initial antibiotic therapy for their treatment.

Recent Findings

Identification of bacterial exacerbations still relies on clinical assessment rather than laboratory biomarkers. Several recent studies, including a meta-analysis and placebo-controlled trials, demonstrate improved outcomes with antibiotics in all but mild exacerbations of COPD, including both inpatient and outpatient. A broader antibiotic regimen should be used for patients who have risk factors for poor outcomes. A risk-stratification approach can guide antibiotic choice, although the stratification algorithm still needs to be validated in a randomized controlled trial.

Summary

The use of antibiotics for the treatment of moderate-to-severe suspected bacterial exacerbations in COPD is supported by published trials and evidence-based systematic reviews. Recent trials also show differences in outcomes based on antibiotic choice. More research is necessary to evaluate risk stratification approaches when selecting initial antibiotic therapy.

### Role of antimicrobial therapy in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111GwtFk]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To define the role of antimicrobial therapy in the treatment of acute bronchitic exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) through review of placebo-controlled clinical trials. Specificalty, to determine the benefit of antimicrobial therapy on patient outcome.

Data Sources

Placebo-controlled dinical trials identified by MEDLINE search (1957-December 1999).

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All placebo-controlled clinical trials that included COPD patients with no evidence of pneumonia or underlying asthma were included in the evaluation.

Data Synthesis

The role of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD is controversial. Patients with COPD are often chronically colonized with bacteria, and many exacerbations are due to nonbacterial causes. Four placebo-controlled clinical trials and a meta-analysis have demonstrated significant improvements in outcome for patients treated with an antibiotic versus placebo. In contrast, six studies failed to demonstrate statistical differences, possibly due to the small sample size and the subjectivity of outcome measures. Overall, the data suggest that the benefit of antimicrobial therapy in acute exacerbations of COPD may be related to exacerbation severity.

Conclusions

Antimicrobial agents may have a beneficial effect in the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD in certain patients. Pending further research in this area, we recommend antimicrobial therapy only for COPD patients with acute bronchitic exacerbations characterized by increased dyspnea, sputum volume, and purulence.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation management — key points (Figure 4.6) state that short-acting inhaled beta2-agonists, with or without short-acting anticholinergics, are recommended as the initial bronchodilators to treat an acute exacerbation (Evidence C). Systemic corticosteroids can improve lung function (FEV1), oxygenation and shorten recovery time and hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should not normally be more than 5 days (Evidence A). Antibiotics, when indicated, can shorten recovery time, reduce the risk of early relapse, treatment failure, and hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should normally be 5 days (Evidence B). Methylxanthines are not recommended due to increased side effect profiles (Evidence B). Non-invasive mechanical ventilation should be the first mode of ventilation used in COPD patients with acute respiratory failure who have no absolute contraindication because it improves gas exchange, reduces work of breathing and the need for intubation, decreases hospitalization duration and improves survival (Evidence A).

### Antibiotics for COPD exacerbations: does drug or duration matter? A primary care database analysis [^116MfTZj]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are globally the most common infectious cause of morbidity. Despite this prevalence, observed duration of antibiotic treatment for LRTI varies greatly, and there is disagreement between guidelines on the optimal duration. Effective first-line treatment for non-pneumonic LRTI in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients ('infective exacerbations') is an area of particular uncertainty.

COPD is a common cause of disability, and estimated to become the third leading cause of death worldwide in 2030. Exacerbations form a large part of the disease burden and can lead to a cough with discoloured phlegm irrespective of causation. Over £250 million is spent on treating COPD exacerbations annually in the UK, and recurrent exacerbations are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

Up to half of all COPD exacerbations are thought to be caused by bacteria, the remainder by viruses or environmental irritants. The most common pathogens are Haemophilus influenza e, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Initial studies suggested that the administration of antibiotics was associated with a lower risk of symptom persistence. However, a Cochrane review concluded that a statistically significant improvement in treatment failure rate was only seen in severe exacerbations, with more adverse events in the antibiotic group. Hence, the European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society and international guidelines advise, based on moderate evidence, the prescription of antibiotics for ambulatory patients 'if clinically indicated'. However, our understanding of the success of real-life prescribing practices is limited.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^117KGC3t]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations — pharmacological treatment and bronchodilator delivery specify that the three classes of medications most commonly used are bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics. For bronchodilators, it is recommended that short-acting inhaled beta2-agonists, with or without short-acting anticholinergics, are the initial bronchodilators for acute treatment of a COPD exacerbation. A systematic review of the route of delivery of short-acting bronchodilators found no significant differences in FEV1 between using metered dose inhalers (MDI) (with or without a spacer device) or nebulizers to deliver the agent, although the latter may be an easier delivery method for sicker patients. It is recommended that patients do not receive continuous nebulization but use the MDI inhaler one or two puffs every one hour for two or three doses and then every 2–4 hours based on the patient's response. Although there are no clinical studies that have evaluated the use of inhaled long-acting bronchodilators with or without ICS during an exacerbation, we recommend continuing these treatments during the exacerbation or to start these medications as soon as possible before hospital discharge. Intravenous methylxanthines (theophylline or aminophylline) are not recommended to use in these patients due to significant side effects. If a nebulizer is chosen to deliver the bronchodilator agent, air-driven bronchodilator nebulization is preferable to oxygen-driven in acute exacerbations of COPD.

### Bacteria, antibiotics and COPD [^114p4c9d]. The European Respiratory Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Bacterial infection is one of several important causes of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that may coexist. COPD is a heterogeneous condition and the incidence of bacterial infection is not uniform; mucus hypersecretion may be an important risk factor. The bacteriology of infections varies depending on the severity of the underlying airway disease. There is now a much better understanding of the pathogenesis of bacterial infections of the respiratory mucosa. Lower airway bacterial colonization may be a stimulus for chronic inflammation and may influence the interval between exacerbations. Antibiotic resistance has increased in all the major pathogens. Antibiotics are an important part of the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD and the decision about whether to give an antibiotic can be made on clinical grounds. It is more difficult to decide, on the available evidence, whether patient characteristics and the risk of antibiotic resistance should influence choice of empiric antibiotic treatment. Most new antibiotics are modifications of existing structures, suggesting that every effort should be made to conserve the sensitivity of current antibiotics by using them appropriately.

### Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: when are antibiotics indicated? A systematic review [^111ashKS]. Respiratory Research (2007). Low credibility.

Meaning of the study

We quantified the influence of severity of exacerbations on the effects of antibiotics using the Operational Classification of Severity of the European Respiratory and American Thoracic Society. The major advantage of this classification over earlier ones is that it is simple to apply. But one needs to consider that severity of exacerbations is not the only determinant for hospital admission and that co-morbidity and social circumstances also play an important role. As long as the mechanisms of exacerbations are not fully understood and cannot be assessed in detail by pathophysiological variables, the Operational Classification of Severity may describe exacerbations most comprehensively. This simplification comes at the price of not discriminating between different forms of exacerbations that can be treated on an outpatient base. It is, however, unclear, whether this distinction is necessary in general. Even if there is an effect of antibiotics in more severe exacerbations of outpatients it is likely to be small. The four ongoing trials, that all include outpatients, may inform us in this regard.

The results of our systematic review may have important implications for clinical practice and help to inform discussions that are ongoing for decades. Most patients with COPD exacerbations who do not need hospital admission may not benefit from immediate antibiotic treatment. The most prudent choice for these patients might be to withhold antibiotics at first while first line management should include bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, patient instruction to use medications correctly as well as follow-up visits. If patients do not recover or show further worsening of health status, antibiotics might still be considered after 3 to 5 days of first line treatment. Thereby, a substantial amount of antibiotics could be spared with positive consequences for the patient and society (adverse effects, antibiotic resistance and costs.)

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for COPD exacerbations… [^114MrvaQ]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Are prophylactic antibiotics effective in reducing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations. Evidence-Based Answer Prophylactic antibiotics may be used to reduce the overall rate of COPD exacerbations and delay their onset. However, the appropriate antibiotic regimen and target population are unclear. 1 The trials compared prophylactic oral antibiotics with placebo over three to 36 months. Five trials studied continuous prophylaxis with oral macrolide antibiotics vs. placebo. Two trials studied pulsed prophylaxis with oral moxifloxacin or azithromycin vs. placebo. Continuous prophylaxis with macrolides resulted in a decrease in the number of patients with one or more exacerbations. Pulsed prophylaxis with moxifloxacin did not reduce the risk of exacerbations compared with placebo. Continuous prophylaxis with macrolide antibiotics resulted in a significant reduction in the rate of COPD exacerbations per patient-year. One trial of azithromycin found that macrolide resistance was significantly higher in the treatment group. Patients in the azithromycin group also delayed their median time to first exacerbation compared with the placebo group.

The ranking of treatments based on SUCRA probability scores is presented in Fig. 5. In terms of efficacy, ofloxacin (79.1%) was the most likely to be the best antibiotic in AECOPD treatment followed by ciprofloxacin (70.4%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (68.1%). In terms of tolerability, dirithromycin (88.4%) was most likely to be the best drug followed by azithromycin (81.4%) and amoxicillin (68.6%; Fig. 6). After we performed a comprehensive analysis of the efficacy and tolerability, the cluster ranking showed that dirithromycin had a high clinical cure rate with a low rate of adverse effects. Ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole had high clinical cure rates with median rates of adverse effects (Fig. 7). There was no publication bias in the comparison-adjusted funnel plot (Additional file 4: Figure S1).

### Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: when are antibiotics indicated? A systematic review [^113DWkzL]. Respiratory Research (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The use of antibiotics in exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains controversial. It is unclear which patients should receive antibiotics. The uncertainty arises from a complex clinical situation where the cause of the exacerbation is often unidentifiable. Around 40–50% of exacerbations may be attributed to bacteria while other causes include viral infections or environmental irritants. Even if bacteria are identified, it is uncertain whether they actually caused the exacerbation or whether they were present as part of the flora before the exacerbation.

Diagnostic tests cannot reliably distinguish between bacterial, viral or other origins of exacerbations. As a consequence, many physicians decide to be on the "safe" side and prescribe antibiotics. The uncertain role of antibiotics is reflected by current guidelines that insufficiently inform physicians about adequate prescription of antibiotics. Guidelines suggest adding an antibiotic if sputum is purulent, if sputum volume is increased and/or if fever is present. However, evidence supporting this suggestion is not based on randomised trials. There are no randomised trials where prescription of antibiotics was guided by purulence of sputum or other criteria. In addition, the extent of symptom worsening is difficult to standardise and utility of sputum assessment is controversial.

A systematic review of randomised, placebo-controlled trials could inform the debate about the role of antibiotics substantially. Eleven years ago, a meta-analysis suggested a small improvement of lung function by antibiotics in COPD patients with an exacerbation, but the review was limited by the restriction to articles in English and its focus on lung function. A recent systematic review considered patient-important outcomes but missed some studies and included a non-randomised trial. Inclusion of all available trials is, however, crucial to avoid selection bias and to study factors modifying the effects of antibiotics such as severity of exacerbation. Therefore, our aim was to review all randomised placebo-controlled trials that assessed the effects of antibiotics on patient-important outcomes in COPD patients suffering from exacerbations.

COPD exacerbations — antibiotics and decision aids: Although infectious causes can be viral or bacterial, the use of antibiotics in exacerbations remains controversial, yet there is evidence supporting the use of antibiotics when patients have clinical signs of a bacterial infection such as increased sputum purulence. Observed sputum color can safely modulate antibiotic therapy with no adverse effects if sputum is white or clear, and observed sputum purulence has 94.4% sensitivity and 52% specificity for high bacterial load. A systematic review of placebo-controlled studies showed that antibiotics reduce short-term mortality by 77%, treatment failure by 53% and sputum purulence by 44%, supporting treatment of moderately or severely ill patients with COPD exacerbations and increased cough and sputum purulence with antibiotics. In an outpatient RCT, adding doxycycline to oral corticosteroid did not prolong time to next exacerbation. Point-of-care C-reactive protein (CRP) strategies reduced antibiotic prescriptions without impaired outcomes in UK primary care outpatients, and another trial in hospitalized patients found similar results (reduced antibiotic use with no increase in treatment failure); data indicate antibiotic usage can be safely reduced from 77.4% to 47.7% when CRP is low. Procalcitonin has been studied to determine antibiotic use in COPD exacerbations, but the efficacy of this biomarker is controversial.

### When should acute exacerbations of COPD be treated with systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics in primary care: a systematic review of current COPD guidelines [^115XW5nu]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) occur frequently in the course of COPD. They can differ in severity and many require hospitalisation, but the majority of mild to moderate AECOPD can be managed in primary care. Antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids are beneficial treatment options that are often used. However, the benefit of antibiotics in mild to moderate AECOPD remains controversial, and their overuse can contribute to the development of bacterial resistance. Systemic corticosteroids bear the risk of adverse side effects, especially in patients with co-morbidities. Inappropriate use of either treatment should be avoided, and targeting patient treatment requires careful patient assessment. Clinical practice guidelines are intended to assist treatment decisions, based on the best available evidence. A critical appraisal of 15 COPD guidelines found variations in the content and between recommendations on several management strategies for COPD, and concluded that these were rather a result of 'selective experience' than based on scientific evidence. Consequently, we designed this study to identify recommended assessment strategies for treating AECOPD patients with systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics in COPD guidelines. Furthermore, we aimed to evaluate the quality of guideline development and the applicability of underlying evidence to primary care.

### Variability of antibiotic prescribing in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a cohort study [^113V8865]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This study supports the need for a randomised trial to establish the role of antibiotics in treating mild or moderate COPD exacerbation, and ensure prescribing is evidence based rather than reliant on prescriber preference. A pragmatic trial using routinely collected EHR data appears feasible, as the COPD patients with exacerbation records were demographically representative of the COPD population overall, and disease severity recorded by the GP was strongly associated with both exacerbations and mortality.

### Standard versus newer antibacterial agents in the treatment of severe acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a randomized trial of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus ciprofloxacin [^112EWEoy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND. Although the use of antibiotics in the treatment of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is largely accepted, controversy remains regarding whether the choice of antibiotic has any impact on outcome. Our aim was to compare the effects of the combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin in patients treated for severe COPD exacerbation requiring mechanical ventilation. METHODS. In a randomized, double-blind trial, we included 170 patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD requiring mechanical ventilation. Enrolled patients received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (n = 85) or ciprofloxacin (n = 85) for 10 days. Main outcomes were hospital death and need for an additional course of antibiotics. Secondary outcomes were duration of mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, and exacerbation-free interval. RESULTS. Combined hospital death and additional antibiotic prescription rates were similar in the 2 groups (16.4% vs 15.3% for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs ciprofloxacin group; difference, 1.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -9.8% to 12.0%; p = 0.832). Hospital death occurred in 7 patients (8.2%) receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and 8 patients (9.4%) receiving ciprofloxacin (difference, -1.2%; 95% CI, -9.7 to 7.3; p = 0.90). The need for an additional antibiotic course was observed in 8 patients in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group and 5 patients in the ciprofloxacin group (difference, 2.3%; 95% CI, -5.4 to 10.0; p = 0.549). The mean exacerbation-free interval (± standard deviation) was similar in both treatment groups (83 ± 25 vs 79 ± 22 for the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs ciprofloxacin group; difference, 4 days; 95% CI, -15 to 19 days; p = 0.41). Duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay was not significantly different between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS. In patients with acute exacerbation of COPD requiring mechanical ventilation, efficacy of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was not inferior to ciprofloxacin. Trial registration. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00791505.

### Pharmacological strategies to reduce exacerbation risk in COPD: a narrative review [^115mqp89]. Respiratory Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The consequences of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation are many. Adverse effects of an exacerbation include a negative impact on patient quality of life, an effect on symptoms and lung function that are associated with a lengthy recovery, an accelerated rate of decline in lung function and hospital admissions. Moreover, exacerbations may result in significant mortality, particularly in cases that require hospitalization and are associated with a high socioeconomic burden, with exacerbations accounting for most of total COPD healthcare expenditure. Therefore, any COPD exacerbation should not be underestimated given their detrimental impact, and their prevention is a key goal of COPD treatment. It is useful to consider that exacerbations are heterogeneous events and the nature of exacerbations is likely to differ between different subgroups of patients with COPD, such as patients with chronic bronchitis or severe emphysema.

This narrative review focuses on identifying and managing patients with COPD according to their risk and type of exacerbation and discusses current and evolving preventative strategies. Selection of the studies included in the 'Pharmacologic therapies to prevent COPD exacerbations' section of this paper were identified via a PubMed search [details provided in Additional file 1]. Given the nature of this review, the studies referred to herein did not need to adhere to any pre-specified exacerbation definition.

Identifying patients at risk of COPD exacerbations

How do we define an exacerbation of COPD?

Although most guidelines define exacerbations similarly, there are differences in the exact definition used [see Additional file 1: Table S1, which provides a non-comprehensive list of exacerbation definitions used within a selection of societal guideline documents]. Variations in the definition of exacerbations within clinical studies also exist. Clinical trials use event-based definitions of exacerbation, which necessitate an increase in symptoms and the use of healthcare resources, and grade exacerbations based on their severity, e.g. moderate exacerbations as those requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids/antibiotics and severe exacerbations as those necessitating hospitalization. In an attempt to establish a uniform definition of exacerbations to be used as an outcome measure in clinical trials, the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) task force defined an exacerbation as an increase in respiratory symptoms over baseline that usually requires a change in therapy. It is relevant to note that many exacerbations go unreported and untreated.

Antibiotic selection for COPD exacerbations — empiric choices, cultures, and route: The choice of the antibiotic should be based on the local bacterial resistance pattern, and initial empirical treatment is an aminopenicillin with clavulanic acid, macrolide, tetracycline or, in selected patients, quinolone. For patients with frequent exacerbations, severe airflow obstruction, and/or exacerbations requiring mechanical ventilation, cultures from sputum or other lung materials should be performed because gram-negative bacteria or resistant pathogens may be present. The route of administration (oral or intravenous) depends on the patient's ability to eat and antibiotic pharmacokinetics, although it is preferable that antibiotics be given orally, and improvements in dyspnea and sputum purulence suggest clinical success.

### Is one exacerbation enough to modify therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? [^114oCwQm]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality globally. The current Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) strategy for how COPD is diagnosed and managed emphasizes the importance of assessing both respiratory symptoms and exacerbations in the classification of COPD. The threshold for exacerbations to move from a less severe (Category A or B) to a more severe (Category E) group is one severe exacerbation or two or more moderate exacerbations. This threshold is the subject of the study by Vanfleteren and colleagues (pp.) that appears in this issue of the Journal.

Although acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPDs) are common and critically important events, several questions surround their definition. The standard definition for AECOPD is a post hoc definition that is based on utilization: Exacerbations that are treated in an outpatient setting with corticosteroids and/or antibiotics are classified as moderate, and those that result in hospitalization are classified as severe. This concept has been challenged, however, with the concept that physiologic measures should be used to classify exacerbations. Although this approach may work with hospitalized patients, for whom the physiologic data needed to classify exacerbations are available, it will not work with outpatients, for whom a range of exacerbation severity is also likely. Additional questions related to AECOPDs include when the exacerbations actually begin and end and optimal prevention strategies, as well as the question addressed in this paper: whether one moderate exacerbation is more similar to two moderate exacerbations or no moderate exacerbations.

### When should acute exacerbations of COPD be treated with systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics in primary care: a systematic review of current COPD guidelines [^116rAGqK]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

A systematic literature review was conducted in Web of Science, SCOPUS, SveMed+, PubMed, Embase, Cihnal (EBsco) and Ovid MD to identify COPD guidelines. Throughout the entire search, 'COPD' as Mesh-term was used whenever applicable. If a database did not support Mesh-terms, 'COPD' was searched in keywords, abstract and title. 'COPD' was combined with the search phrases 'guideline' and 'recommendation'. The search string used throughout the search was as follows:
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease AND (Guideline OR Recommendation).

Our initial search was performed with a time limit set for publications between 2003 and 2013. It was then extended to 8 May 2014 to ensure the inclusion of any new publications during our work on this project. Eligibility assessment was conducted by the first and the last author, and the approach from the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses statement was followed(Figure 1). To avoid overlooking documents that were published elsewhere than in the searched databases, a supplemental search was conducted in the guideline databases UpToDate, Best Practice, National Guideline Clearinghouse, Cochrane Library, Guidelines International Network and websites of the Canadian Medical Association, and American College of Physicians. Furthermore, websites of national health authorities (Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Austria, Switzerland, and Netherlands) were searched for eligible guidelines. This search was not repeated after 2013. Only guidelines and published documents with recommendations on adults with AECOPD and/or infectious diseases of the lungs when containing AECOPD were included in this study. They also had to be published in English, German, Dutch, or a Scandinavian language. The most recent guideline from each country was included. The included guidelines were analysed in terms of guideline development by applying criteria from the AGREE II tool (Appraisal of guidelines for research and evaluation II). The criteria applied belonged to the domains 2 (stakeholder involvement), 3 (rigor of development), and 6 (editorial independence). We extracted recommendations about patient assessment for treatment with systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics. If recommendations were given separately for inpatients and outpatients, only those for outpatients were considered. Evidence explicitly linked to the recommendations, as described in domain 3 of the AGREE II tool, was obtained, and randomised controlled trials published in scientific medical journals were assessed in terms of study setting, study design, and inclusion and exclusion criteria. Furthermore, we decided to add the trials included in the latest versions of the Cochrane reviews about treating AECOPD with systemic corticosteroidsand antibiotics, although not directly referred to in the guidelines.

### Four patients with a history of acute exacerbations of COPD: implementing the CHEST / Canadian Thoracic Society guidelines for preventing exacerbations [^116Dczbq]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Managing the presenting problem. Is it a COPD exacerbation?

A COPD exacerbation is defined as 'an acute event characterised by a worsening of the patient's respiratory symptoms that is beyond normal day-to-day variation and leads to change in medications'. The worsening symptoms are usually increased dyspnoea, increased sputum volume and increased sputum purulence. All these symptoms are present in our patient who experiences an exacerbation triggered by a viral upper respiratory tract infection — the most common cause of COPD exacerbations. Apart from the management of the acute exacerbation that could include antibiotics, oral steroids and increased use of short-acting bronchodilators, special attention should be given to his on-going treatment to prevent future exacerbations. Short-term use of systemic corticosteroids and a course of antibiotics can shorten recovery time, improve lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁)) and arterial hypoxaemia and reduce the risk of early relapse, treatment failure and length of hospital stay. Short-acting inhaled β₂-agonists with or without short-acting anti-muscarinics are usually the preferred bronchodilators for the treatment of an acute exacerbation.

Reviewing his routine treatment

One of the concerns about this patient is that his COPD is inadequately treated. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) suggests that COPD management be based on a combined assessment of symptoms, GOLD classification of airflow limitation, and exacerbation rate. The modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea scoreor the COPD Assessment Tool (CAT)could be used to evaluate the symptoms/health status. History suggests that his breathlessness has begun to interfere with his lifestyle, but this has not been formally asssessed since the diagnosis 6 years ago. Therefore, one would like to be certain that these elements are taken into consideration in future management by involving other members of the health care team. The fact that he had two to three exacerbations per year puts the patient into GOLD category C–D (see Figure 1) despite the moderate airflow limitation. Our patient is only being treated with short-acting bronchodilators; however, this is only appropriate for patients who belong to category A. Treatment options for patients in category C or D should include long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) or long-acting β₂-agonists (LABAs), which will not only improve his symptoms but also help prevent future exacerbations. Used in combination with LABA or LAMA, inhaled corticosteroids also contribute to preventing exacerbations.

### Antibiotics for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease… [^114F6Nuc]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Details for This Review Study Population: Patients older than 40 years with mild to very severe exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Efficacy End Points: Treatment failure measured between seven days and one month, length of hospital stay, and mortality Harm End Points: Diarrhea. Narrative: Prescription of antibiotics for treatment of COPD exacerbations is controversial because of the variety of etiologies that induce a flare-up, including viral, bacterial, and environmental causes. 1 Approximately one-half of exacerbations are thought to be bacterial in origin. 2 Antibiotics continue to be widely prescribed. 3 Adverse effects are often minor, and benefits may appear to outweigh harms. However, the most important argument against antibiotic use is antibiotic overuse and the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria.
4. This Cochrane review included 19 randomized controlled trials with 2, 663 patients.

5 Eleven trials evaluated outpatients, seven trials evaluated inpatients, and one trial evaluated patients in the intensive care unit. In the outpatient setting, low-quality evidence showed that antibiotics statistically and significantly reduced the risk of treatment failure with a number needed to treat of 12. When restricted to the seven trials that included currently used antibiotics, low-quality evidence suggested a similar effect with an NNT of
12. There was no mortality benefit. In the general inpatient setting, antibiotics did not have a statistically significant effect on preventing treatment failure, decreasing the length of stay, or preventing mortality. This was also true when restricted to the four studies that involved currently used antibiotics.
5. The clinical severity of the COPD exacerbations across the studies was difficult to classify.

Trials did not use uniform definitions for severity of exacerbation, and definitions of COPD have changed with time. Bias was also introduced because treatment failure was defined differently by the trials. Other influencing factors, including concurrent medication use, comorbidities, severity of COPD at baseline, and season, could not be assessed because details were reported inconsistently across trials. Additionally, the issue of antibiotic overuse and emerging multidrug-resistant bacteria remains an open concern that was not directly addressed by this review.

### Antibiotics for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111ECBZt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Many patients with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are treated with antibiotics. However, the value of antibiotics remains uncertain as systematic reviews and clinical trials have shown conflicting results.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics in the management of acute COPD exacerbations on treatment failure as observed between seven days and one month after treatment initiation (primary outcome) and on other patient-important outcomes (mortality, adverse events, length of hospital stay).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and other electronically available databases up to September 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people with acute COPD exacerbations comparing antibiotic therapy and placebo with a follow-up of at least seven days.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened references and extracted data from trial reports. We kept the three groups of outpatients, inpatients and patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) separate for benefit outcomes and mortality because we considered them to be clinically too different to be summarised in one group. We considered outpatients to have a mild to moderate exacerbation, inpatients to have a severe exacerbation and ICU patients to have a very severe exacerbation. Where outcomes or study details were not reported we requested missing data from the authors of the primary studies. We calculated pooled risk ratios (RR) for treatment failure, Peto odds ratios (OR) for rare events (mortality and adverse events) and weighted mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes using fixed-effect models. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

Sixteen trials with 2068 participants were included. In outpatients (mild to moderate exacerbations), there was evidence of low quality that antibiotics did statistically significantly reduce the risk for treatment failure between seven days and one month after treatment initiation (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.94; I² = 35%) but they did not significantly reduce the risk when the meta-analysis was restricted to currently available drugs (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.01; I² = 33%). Evidence of high quality showed that antibiotics statistically significantly reduced the risk of treatment failure in inpatients with severe exacerbations (ICU not included) (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.91; I(2) = 47%) regardless of whether restricted to current drugs. The only trial with 93 patients admitted to the ICU showed a large and statistically significant effect on treatment failure (RR 0.19; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.45; high-quality evidence). Evidence of low-quality from four trials in inpatients showed no effect of antibiotics on mortality (Peto OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.37 to 2.79). High-quality evidence from one trial showed a statistically significant effect on mortality in ICU patients (Peto OR 0.21; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.72). Length of hospital stay (in days) was similar in the antibiotics and placebo groups except for the ICU study where antibiotics statistically significantly reduced length of hospital stay (mean difference -9.60 days; 95% CI -12.84 to -6.36 days). One trial showed no effect of antibiotics on re-exacerbations between two and six weeks after treatment initiation. Only one trial (N = 35) reported health-related quality of life but did not show a statistically significant difference between the treatment and control group. Evidence of moderate quality showed that the overall incidence of adverse events was higher in the antibiotics groups (Peto OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.03 to 2.27). Patients treated with antibiotics experienced statistically significantly more diarrhoea based on three trials (Peto OR 2.62; 95% CI 1.11 to 6.17; high-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotics for COPD exacerbations showed large and consistent beneficial effects across outcomes of patients admitted to an ICU. However, for outpatients and inpatients the results were inconsistent. The risk for treatment failure was significantly reduced in both inpatients and outpatients when all trials (1957 to 2012) were included but not when the analysis for outpatients was restricted to currently used antibiotics. Also, antibiotics had no statistically significant effect on mortality and length of hospital stay in inpatients and almost no data on patient-reported outcomes exist. These inconsistent effects call for research into clinical signs and biomarkers that help identify patients who benefit from antibiotics and patients who experience no effect, and in whom downsides of antibiotics (side effects, costs and multi-resistance) could be avoided.

### Antibiotics for treatment and prevention of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114VuTEe]. The Journal of Infection (2013). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations (AE) can be recurrent problems for patients with moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) increasing morbidity and mortality. Evidence suggests that ≥ 50% of acute exacerbations involve bacteria requiring treatment with an antibiotic which should have high activity against the causative pathogens. However, sputum analysis is not a pre-requisite for antibiotic prescription in outpatients as results are delayed and patients are likely to be colonised with bacteria in the stable state. Clinicians rely on the clinical symptoms, sputum appearance and the patient's medical history to decide if an AE-COPD should be treated with antibiotics. This article reviews the available data of antibiotic trials in AE-COPD. Management of frequent exacerbators is particularly challenging for physicians. This may include antibiotic prophylaxis, especially macrolides because of anti-inflammatory properties; though successful in reducing exacerbations, concerns about resistance development remain. Inhalation of antibiotics achieves high local concentrations and minimal systemic exposure; therefore, it may represent an attractive alternative for antibiotic prophylaxis in certain COPD patients. Inhaled antibiotic prophylaxis has been successfully used in other respiratory conditions such as non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis which itself might be present in COPD patients who have chronic bacterial infection, particularly with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

### Discriminate use of antibiotics for exacerbation of COPD [^1176GESC]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The relevance of antibiotics in the treatment of acute exacerbation has been a matter of debate for several years. Although expert recommendations may vary, there is general agreement about the fact that not all patients will equally experience benefit from antibiotics: apart from decreasing costs, discriminate use of antibiotics is capable of significantly reducing subsequent colonization or infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

Recent Findings

Several meta-analyses support the concept that patients with increased dyspnea, increased sputum volume, and increased sputum purulence will benefit from antimicrobial therapy. Evidence from randomized trials substantiates the prescription of antibiotics in patients receiving mechanical ventilation and the avoidance of antibiotics in those admitted with low serum procalcitonin levels.

Summary

Most of the proposed criteria for prescribing or withholding antibiotics for acute exacerbation have been analyzed in different retrospective study designs. Patients requiring ICU care and mechanical ventilation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation should receive antibiotics. Conversely, antibiotics can be withheld in patients admitted to the emergency department with low serum procalcitonin levels. Patients with type I Anthonisen exacerbation and those with severe functional impairment are likely to benefit from antibiotics. Further investigations are needed to compare long-term outcome in patients treated according to clinical and functional criteria.

### Antibiotics for treatment of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a network meta-analysis [^116xqhT5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

This network meta-analysis was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews guidelines.

Data search strategy

We systematically searched the PubMed, EmBase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases using the following keywords for results published through September 2016 in the English language: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, exacerbation, antibiotic, antimicrobial, and random*. The detail if search strategy in PubMed are presented in Additional file 1. The references of relevant reviews were also checked to ensure that no relevant studies were omitted.

Data selection and extraction

The literature search was undertaken independently by 2 authors and any inconsistencies were settled by group discussion until a consensus was reached. A study was eligible for inclusion if it met the following criteria: 1. it was a randomised controlled trial (RCT); 2. it included patients with exacerbations of COPD but not stable COPD or prophylactic treatment for exacerbations; 3. it investigated a specific antibiotic treatment; 4. one of the outcomes included was the rate of clinical cure (success), microbiological response, relapse of exacerbations, adverse effects, or mortality. The exclusion criteria included the following: 1. it was not a RCT, such as retrospective cohort study; 2. it included another type of disease; 3. it assessed the effects of different usage strategies of only one type of antibiotic; 4. it did not include the desired results. Review articles, conference presentations, secondary research reports, letters, editorials, and basic research articles were also excluded.

We extracted the first author, publication year, country, sample size, gender ratio, experimental intervention, comparison intervention, outcome assessment, and follow-up data. We also assessed the methodological quality of the included trials using a risk of bias approach, as described by the Cochrane Collaboration.

In our analysis, the major efficacy outcome was clinical cure (success) rate and the major tolerance outcome was the rate of adverse effects. Secondary outcomes included microbiological response rate, relapse of exacerbations, and mortality. For the efficacy outcome analysis, we used data with the intention of treating a population comprised of randomized patients who received a study agent.

### The problems of meta-analysis for antibiotic treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a heterogeneous disease: a commentary on puhan et al [^115PTo5q]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchitis is among the most common reasons for antibiotic prescription worldwide. This diagnosis includes two distinct entities, acute bronchitis in the absence of underlying lung disease and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Acute bronchitis is predominantly a viral disease with good evidence that antibiotics are not of benefit in its management. Exacerbations of COPD, on the other hand, can be of bacterial, viral or mixed etiology, with bacterial infection currently estimated to contribute up to 50% of exacerbations. Furthermore, in contrast to acute bronchitis, these exacerbation episodes are not benign events, as they have consequences ranging from days lost from work, deterioration of health status, progression of airflow obstruction and even death. Therefore, appropriate management of COPD exacerbations is crucial.

Antibiotics are often used in the management of COPD exacerbations. It is estimated that more than 80% of COPD exacerbations are treated on an outpatient basis, which can be regarded as mild to moderate exacerbations. The article published by Puhan et al this month in BMC Medicine makes the argument that there is a lack of evidence for antibiotic benefit in mild to moderate exacerbations of COPD and that additional placebo-controlled trials are required. Their argument is based on a meta-analytic approach where they identified five placebo-controlled randomized trials in the literature, which were confined to 'mild to moderate' exacerbations of COPD. With this approach, although all but one of the trials favor antibiotics, the combined odds ratio is not statistically significant.

Although their conclusions based on the analysis are not erroneous, their approach to this question highlights a number of issues that make it difficult to resolve this argument; these include the heterogeneity of exacerbations, patients and antibiotics in these trials. Another major issue is the acceptance of the results of these trials without critically examining the limitations of the end-points used in these studies. The 'devil is in the details' in these trials, and these details are often overlooked in a meta-analytic approach.

### Moxifloxacin for the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113yTf57]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

The significant impact of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is now recognized. This recognition has led to increased efforts to provide evidence-based, appropriate treatment of AECOPD, to minimize its negative impact. This article reviews the bacterial etiology of AECOPD and clinical trials (both placebo-controlled and antibiotic comparison trials) that support the use of antibiotics for AECOPD, with an emphasis on the role of newer fluoroquinolones for the treatment of patients with this condition. A discussion of patient stratification that permits identification of those who require initial aggressive antibiotic therapy is presented.

Main Findings

Among the treatment modalities for exacerbations, the role and choice of antibiotics is hotly debated. Current evidence supports the use of antibiotics in the treatment of AECOPD, because bacterial pathogens cause approximately half the exacerbations, and because empirical antibiotics have a significant benefit in most exacerbations. Several recent investigations have aided in the development of a rational antibiotic strategy for AECOPD. These include outcome studies that have identified patients who are likely to have a poor outcome of their exacerbation and, therefore, are candidates for aggressive initial antibiotic therapy. Studies of the new fluoroquinolone agents have shown superior short- and long-term clinical results among patients with AECOPD who are at risk of a poor outcome.

Conclusions

Theoretical concerns about the emergence of resistance to the fluoroquinolones dictate not only the appropriate use of these drugs but, also, the use of the most-potent agents available in this class, to sustain their usefulness over time. Such selected use of the new fluoroquinolones balances individual benefit with societal concerns regarding the use of these agents for the treatment of AECOPD.

### Antimicrobial therapies for prevention of recurrent acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD): beyond the guidelines [^113q98qa]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Global Initiative for Chronic Lung Disease (GOLD) annual report is the most commonly used COPD guideline in clinical practice and is based on the appraisal of the best current scientific evidence. Whilst evidence-based guidelines can standardise and improve care for a number of patients, the margins of benefit, even in responders, may not be that substantial. COPD is a complex and heterogeneous conditions, a generalised approach to treatment options will result in a medley of outcomes for patients; some may find treatment side-effects intolerable, some may not respond; and, unfortunately, some patients may experience inequitable access to certain treatments recommended.

COPD accounts for a huge burden in terms of health care costs and early mortality. Patients who exacerbate more frequently have a lower quality of life, a more rapid decline in their FEV1 and have a higher mortality. A history of previous exacerbation events is the single largest risk factor for predicting future exacerbations. Multiple risk factors for exacerbations have been shown and many patients will have several predisposing conditions or environmental factors, see Table 1.

Table 1
Co-factors in acute exacerbations of COPD

Specific preventative anti-microbial therapy in the GOLD D guidelines only consists of one antibiotic, azithromycin, and two vaccinations. When compared with the complex milieu of potential insults triggering exacerbations, the GOLD D treatment certainly appears suboptimal given the absence of proven prophylactic anti-exacerbation therapies. Azithromycin reduces exacerbations by about 30% in patients exacerbating in the previous year or in those on long-term oxygen therapy.

Given that many GOLD Class D patients fail to respond to current guideline-directed GOLD recommended care, it is inevitable that clinicians will try other strategies in an attempt to prevent exacerbations. Significant benefits of therapeutic interventions are difficult and challenging to show in even well-conducted RCTs of COPD populations. Given the complexity encountered and inter-patient differences within COPD populations, a negative study does not necessarily preclude a small number of patients with specific characteristics having a significant benefit. For the purposes of this article, we have chosen to concentrate on antimicrobial strategies in GOLD D patients with refractory exacerbations. A search strategy was performed on PUBMED using the terms 'Recurrent Exacerbations', 'COPD', 'Antimicrobial therapies' and 'Microbiome' was performed. Relevant studies that described pathophysiology, microbiome studies and treatment regimes were chosen for discussion.

### Antibiotics for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112f7miJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Many patients with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are treated with antibiotics. However, the value of antibiotics remains uncertain, as systematic reviews and clinical trials have shown conflicting results.

Objectives

To assess effects of antibiotics on treatment failure as observed between seven days and one month after treatment initiation (primary outcome) for management of acute COPD exacerbations, as well as their effects on other patient-important outcomes (mortality, adverse events, length of hospital stay, time to next exacerbation).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and other electronically available databases up to 26 September 2018.

Selection Criteria

We sought to find randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including people with acute COPD exacerbations comparing antibiotic therapy and placebo and providing follow-up of at least seven days.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened references and extracted data from trial reports. We kept the three groups of outpatients, inpatients, and patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) separate for benefit outcomes and mortality because we considered them to be clinically too different to be summarised as a single group. We considered outpatients to have a mild to moderate exacerbation, inpatients to have a severe exacerbation, and ICU patients to have a very severe exacerbation. When authors of primary studies did not report outcomes or study details, we contacted them to request missing data. We calculated pooled risk ratios (RRs) for treatment failure, Peto odds ratios (ORs) for rare events (mortality and adverse events), and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes using random-effects models. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. The primary outcome was treatment failure as observed between seven days and one month after treatment initiation.

Main Results

We included 19 trials with 2663 participants (11 with outpatients, seven with inpatients, and one with ICU patients). For outpatients (with mild to moderate exacerbations), evidence of low quality suggests that currently available antibiotics statistically significantly reduced the risk for treatment failure between seven days and one month after treatment initiation (RR 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 0.94; I² = 31%; in absolute terms, reduction in treatment failures from 295 to 212 per 1000 treated participants, 95% CI 165 to 277). Studies providing older antibiotics not in use anymore yielded an RR of 0.69 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.90; I² = 31%). Evidence of low quality from one trial in outpatients suggested no effects of antibiotics on mortality (Peto OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.49 to 3.30). One trial reported no effects of antibiotics on re-exacerbations between two and six weeks after treatment initiation. Only one trial (N = 35) reported health-related quality of life but did not show a statistically significant difference between treatment and control groups. Evidence of moderate quality does not show that currently used antibiotics statistically significantly reduced the risk of treatment failure among inpatients with severe exacerbations (i.e. for inpatients excluding ICU patients) (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.12; I² = 50%), but trial results remain uncertain. In turn, the effect was statistically significant when trials included older antibiotics no longer in clinical use (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.00; I² = 39%). Evidence of moderate quality from two trials including inpatients shows no beneficial effects of antibiotics on mortality (Peto OR 2.48, 95% CI 0.94 to 6.55). Length of hospital stay (in days) was similar in antibiotic and placebo groups. The only trial with 93 patients admitted to the ICU showed a large and statistically significant effect on treatment failure (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.45; moderate-quality evidence; in absolute terms, reduction in treatment failures from 565 to 107 per 1000 treated participants, 95% CI 45 to 254). Results of this trial show a statistically significant effect on mortality (Peto OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.72; moderate-quality evidence) and on length of hospital stay (MD -9.60 days, 95% CI -12.84 to -6.36; low-quality evidence). Evidence of moderate quality gathered from trials conducted in all settings shows no statistically significant effect on overall incidence of adverse events (Peto OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.63; moderate-quality evidence) nor on diarrhoea (Peto OR 1.68, 95% CI 0.92 to 3.07; moderate-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Researchers have found that antibiotics have some effect on inpatients and outpatients, but these effects are small, and they are inconsistent for some outcomes (treatment failure) and absent for other outcomes (mortality, length of hospital stay). Analyses show a strong beneficial effect of antibiotics among ICU patients. Few data are available on the effects of antibiotics on health-related quality of life or on other patient-reported symptoms, and data show no statistically significant increase in the risk of adverse events with antibiotics compared to placebo. These inconsistent effects call for research into clinical signs and biomarkers that can help identify patients who would benefit from antibiotics, while sparing antibiotics for patients who are unlikely to experience benefit and for whom downsides of antibiotics (side effects, costs, and multi-resistance) should be avoided.

### In-hospital antibiotic use for severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a retrospective observational study [^1118ak9k]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In addition to the decision to initiate antibiotic therapy, the choice of an appropriate antibiotic is of great importance. According to the GOLD 2022 guidelines, the initial empirical therapy could be an aminopenicillin with clavulanic acid, a macrolide or tetracycline, based on the local bacterial resistance pattern. However, GOLD warns for the presence of gram-negative bacterial infections in patients with frequent exacerbations, severe airflow limitation and/or need for mechanical ventilation. The antimicrobial drug recommended by the Belgian Infectiology Guide based on national resistance is amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, but another antibiotic is preferred in case of immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated penicillin allergy (moxifloxacin) or risk factors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection (anti-pseudomonal antibiotic such as piperacillin-tazobactam). The total recommended duration of antibiotic therapy was 5 days and rotation of antibiotics was not recommended.

To the best of our knowledge, studies that investigated the determinants of antibiotic use for AECOPD were performed in primary care, or did not investigate laboratory results such as CRP. Only two retrospective studies investigated the real-life effect of (guideline-recommended) antibiotics in patients hospitalized with AECOPD on outcomes, both performed in the United States. Since data on antibiotic use of severe AECOPD in Belgium are lacking, we aimed to describe the antibiotic use including initial choice of antibiotic in severe AECOPD patients, to analyze determinants of in-hospital antibiotic use, and to investigate its associations with important outcomes such as length of stay (LOS) and in-hospital mortality.

### In-hospital antibiotic use for severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a retrospective observational study [^1156z7Yx]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common lung disease characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation. A major contributor to the overall severity of COPD and the associated burden on health-care systems worldwide, is acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD). AECOPD are episodes of worsening of respiratory symptoms, leading to a change in medication (mild-moderate) or hospitalization (severe). Exacerbations arise as a result of environmental triggers and/or respiratory tract infections, encompassing viral and bacterial infections. A meta-analysis including 118 studies demonstrated that half of the infections in AECOPD patients are bacterial, and might require active antibiotic treatment. However, the use of antibiotics in mild to severe exacerbations remains controversial. Pooled results of four randomized controlled trials in a 2018 Cochrane meta-analysis did not show that the currently used antibiotics significantly reduce the risk of treatment failure, duration of hospital admission or mortality in hospitalized patients, excluding patients in intensive care. Moreover, any antibiotic use, particularly unnecessary or inappropriate use, contributes to the selection of resistant pathogens.

The conflicting evidence called for research in biomarkers which could help in selecting patients who benefit from antibiotic treatment to limit overuse. One of the most frequently discussed markers that can be used to guide antibiotic therapy is sputum purulence. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines recommend antibiotic treatment if patients have at least two of three cardinal symptoms, including increased sputum purulence. This recommendation is based on the results of the historical randomized crossover trial by Anthonisen et al. and is supported by a more recent meta-analysis showing a moderate level of evidence that purulent sputum during AECOPD increased the probability of potentially pathogenic bacteria by two-fold. In Belgium, the Infectiology Guide from the Belgian Society for Infectiology and Clinical Microbiology recommends considering the underlying COPD severity in addition to the Anthonisen criteria. Other studies have indicated the use of C-reactive protein (CRP) to guide antibiotic therapy. A randomized controlled trial including patients hospitalized with an AECOPD reported a significantly lower antibiotic use in the CRP-guided (cut-off ≥ 50 mg/L) group (31.7%) than in the GOLD-guided (increased sputum purulence in combination with dyspnea and/or sputum volume) group (46.2%), without an increase in adverse events. CRP-guided treatment is implemented in the Belgian outpatient guidelines due to a more recent revision in 2021, but not yet in the Belgian inpatient, and GOLD guidelines.

### Variability of antibiotic prescribing in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a cohort study [^1143skUq]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive condition characterised by an obstructive pattern of expiratory airflow limitation which can't be fully reversed. An estimated 3 million people have COPD in the UK with associated annual healthcare costs of £800 million. COPD patients frequently suffer acute exacerbations of the disease, characterised by an increase in dyspnoea, sputum volume or purulence. Exacerbations are often bacterial in origin and antibiotic therapy is appropriate. However, exacerbations may also be due to viral infections of the upper respiratory tract or may be non-infective. The role of antibiotics in treating mild or moderate acute exacerbation is unclear. Most randomised trials evaluating antibiotics for COPD were restricted to patients hospitalised for acute exacerbations. Of the 11 studies included in a recent review only 2 included patients from a GP setting, despite much healthcare for COPD patients being administered in this environment. Also, few of the studies provided details on resource utilisation associated with exacerbations or the effect of prescribing antibiotics on this utilisation.

Databases of electronic health records (EHR), such as those managed by the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), provide the opportunity to conduct a large pragmatic randomised trial evaluating effects of antibiotics in patients with mild or moderate acute COPD exacerbations. Participants can be recruited at the point of care and followed using routinely collected EHR. A key requirement for pragmatic trials is that 'usual conditions' apply to the research setting. The selection and monitoring of patients should ideally mimic the 'real world'. The only difference should be the random allocation of the interventions rather than the investigators deciding how to treat patients. Such a trial is currently being conducted within CPRD, and the present study was initiated in order to provide background information about current medical practice and outcomes of COPD exacerbations. The objectives were to: (i) describe the patient characteristics associated with acute exacerbations amongst a representative COPD population, (ii) explore the relationship between COPD severity and outcomes amongst patients with exacerbations, and (iii) quantify variability by practice in prescribing of antibiotics for exacerbations.

CLINICAL QUESTION Is prophylactic antibiotic treatment associated with fewer exacerbations or improved health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)? BOTTOM LINE Continuous macrolide antibiotic use for prophylaxis was associated with a clinically significant reduction in COPD exacerbations. Pulsed antibiotic use was not associated with benefit. Continuous and pulsed antibiotics were associated with improved HRQOL, but this was not clinically significant.

### When should acute exacerbations of COPD be treated with systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics in primary care: a systematic review of current COPD guidelines [^1173RBCB]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Not all patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) benefit from treatment with systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics. The aim of the study was to identify criteria recommended in current COPD guidelines for treating acute exacerbations with systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics and to assess the underlying evidence. Current COPD guidelines were identified by a systematic literature search. The most recent guidelines as per country/organisation containing recommendations about treating acute exacerbations of COPD were included. Guideline development and criteria for treating acute exacerbations with systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics were appraised. Randomised controlled trials directly referred to in context with the recommendations were evaluated in terms of study design, setting, and study population. A total of 19 COPD guidelines were included. Systemic corticosteroids were often universally recommended to all patients with acute exacerbations. Criteria for treatment with antibiotics were mainly an increase in respiratory symptoms. Objective diagnostic tests or clinical examination were only rarely recommended. Only few criteria were directly linked to underlying evidence, and the trial patients represented a highly specific group of COPD patients. Current COPD guidelines are of little help in primary care to identify patients with acute exacerbations probably benefitting from treatment with systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics in primary care, and might contribute to overuse or inappropriate use of either treatment.

### Controversies in treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111zy4JZ]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic disorder with substantial comorbidity and major effects attributable to the high morbidity and mortality rates. Despite an increasing evidence base, some important controversies in COPD management still exist. The classic way to define COPD has been based on spirometric criteria, but more relevant diagnostic methods are needed that can be used to describe COPD severity and comorbidity. Initiation of interventions earlier in the natural history of the disease to slow disease progression is debatable, there are many controversies about the role of inhaled corticosteroids in the management of COPD, and long-term antibiotics for prevention of exacerbation have had a resurgence in interest. Novel therapeutic drugs are urgently needed for optimum management of the acute COPD exacerbation. COPD is a complex disease and consists of several clinically relevant phenotypes that in future will guide its management.

Results

Literature search

In our study, 478 articles were identified after duplications were removed. After screening the titles and abstracts, 421 of these articles were excluded. The full-text of the remaining 57 articles were assessed and the following articles were excluded: secondary research studies (9), studies of prophylactic antibiotic therapy (6), studies with no desired outcome (6), studies that included other types of patients (5), studies where the type of antibiotic is unclear (4), studies that included comparison of medication strategies (3), studies without an RCT design (2), conference abstracts (2), and protocols (1). Ultimately, 19 articles, published between 1996 and 2016, that assessed 5906 patients were collected for our systematic review (Fig. 1, Table 1). One of the included trials contained four intervention arms.

### Prophylactic antibiotics for adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a network meta-analysis [^1164oRSK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic respiratory condition characterised by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation. Acute exacerbations punctuate the natural history of COPD and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality and disease progression. Chronic airflow limitation is caused by a combination of small airways (bronchitis) and parenchymal destruction (emphysema), which can impact day-to-day activities and overall quality of life. In carefully selected patients with COPD, long-term, prophylactic use of antibiotics may reduce bacterial load, inflammation of the airways, and the frequency of exacerbations.

Objectives

To assess effects of different prophylactic antibiotics on exacerbations, quality of life, and serious adverse events in people with COPD in three separate network meta-analyses (NMAs), and to provide rankings of identified antibiotics.

Search Methods

To identify eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs), we searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials and clinical trials registries. We conducted the most recent search on 22 January 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs with a parallel design of at least 12 weeks' duration evaluating long-term administration of antibiotics prophylactically compared with other antibiotics, or placebo, for patients with COPD.

Data Collection and Analysis

This Cochrane Review collected and updated pair-wise data from two previous Cochrane Reviews. Searches were updated and additional studies included. We conducted three separate network meta-analyses (NMAs) within a Bayesian framework to assess three outcomes: exacerbations, quality of life, and serious adverse events. For quality of life, we collected data from St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Using previously validated methods, we selected the simplest model that could adequately fit the data for every analysis. We used threshold analysis to indicate which results were robust to potential biases, taking into account each study's contributions to the overall results and network structure. Probability ranking was performed for each antibiotic class for exacerbations, quality of life, and serious adverse events.

Main Results

Characteristics of studies and participants Eight trials were conducted at multiple sites that included hospital clinics or academic health centres. Seven were single-centre trials conducted in hospital clinics. Two trials did not report settings. Trials durations ranged from 12 to 52 weeks. Most participants had moderate to severe disease. Mean age ranged from 64 years to 73 years, and more males were recruited (51% to 100%). Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁) ranged from 0.935 to 1.36 L. Most participants had previous exacerbations. Data from 12 studies were included in the NMAs (3405 participants; 16 treatment arms including placebo). Prophylactic antibiotics evaluated were macrolides (azithromycin and erythromycin), tetracyclines (doxycyclines), quinolones (moxifloxacin) and macrolides plus tetracyclines (roxithromycin plus doxycycline). Risk of bias and threshold analysis Most studies were at low risk across domains, except detection bias, for which only seven studies were judged at low risk. In the threshold analysis for exacerbations, all comparisons in which one antibiotic was compared with another were robust to sampling variation, especially macrolide comparisons. Comparisons of classes with placebo were sensitive to potential bias, especially macrolide versus placebo, therefore, any bias in the comparison was likely to favour the active class, so any adjustment would bring the estimated relative effect closer to the null value, thus quinolone may become the best class to prevent exacerbations. Exacerbations Nine studies were included (2732 participants) in this NMA (exacerbations analysed as time to first exacerbation or people with one or more exacerbations). Macrolides and quinolones reduced exacerbations. Macrolides had a greater effect in reducing exacerbations compared with placebo (macrolides: hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.60 to 0.75; quinolones: HR 0.89, 95% CrI 0.75 to 1.04), resulting in 127 fewer people per 1000 experiencing exacerbations on macrolides. The difference in exacerbations between tetracyclines and placebo was uncertain (HR 1.29, 95% CrI 0.66 to 2.41). Macrolides ranked first (95% CrI first to second), with quinolones ranked second (95% CrI second to third). Tetracyclines ranked fourth, which was lower than placebo (ranked third). Contributing studies were considered as low risk of bias in a threshold analysis. Quality of life (SGRQ) Seven studies were included (2237 participants) in this NMA. SGRQ scores improved with macrolide treatment compared with placebo (fixed effect-fixed class effect: mean difference (MD) -2.30, 95% CrI -3.61 to -0.99), but the mean difference did not reach the minimally clinical important difference (MCID) of 4 points. Tetracyclines and quinolones did not improve quality of life any more than placebo, and we did not detect a difference between antibiotic classes. Serious adverse events Nine studies were included (3180 participants) in the NMA. Macrolides reduced the odds of a serious adverse event compared with placebo (fixed effect-fixed class effect: odds ratio (OR) 0.76, 95% CrI 0.62 to 0.93). There was probably little to no difference in the effect of quinolone compared with placebo or tetracycline plus macrolide compared with placebo. There was probably little to no difference in serious adverse events between quinolones or tetracycline plus macrolide. With macrolide treatment 49 fewer people per 1000 experienced a serious adverse event compared with those given placebo. Macrolides ranked first, followed by quinolones. Tetracycline did not rank better than placebo. Drug resistance Ten studies reported drug resistance. Results were not combined due to variation in outcome measures. All studies concluded that prophylactic antibiotic administration was associated with the development of antimicrobial resistance.

Authors' Conclusions

This NMA evaluated the safety and efficacy of different antibiotics used prophylactically for COPD patients. Compared to placebo, prolonged administration of macrolides (ranked first) appeared beneficial in prolonging the time to next exacerbation, improving quality of life, and reducing serious adverse events. No clear benefits were associated with use of quinolones or tetracyclines. In addition, antibiotic resistance was a concern and could not be thoroughly assessed in this review. Given the trade-off between effectiveness, safety, and risk of antibiotic resistance, prophylactic administration of antibiotics may be best reserved for selected patients, such as those experiencing frequent exacerbations. However, none of the eligible studies excluded patients with previously isolated non-tuberculous mycobacteria, which would contraindicate prophylactic administration of antibiotics, due to the risk of developing resistant non-tuberculous mycobacteria.

### Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: when are antibiotics indicated? A systematic review [^1165BHhF]. Respiratory Research (2007). Low credibility.

Unanswered questions and future research

To base this proposed strategy on solid grounds, a randomised, non-inferiority trial comparing the clinical effectiveness and amount of antibiotics used with immediate antibiotic treatment and a watchful-waiting strategy would be highly welcome. Thereby, investigators could show whether a watchful-waiting strategy is clinically not disadvantageous but associated with reduced use of antibiotics.

Factors other than treatment setting that may guide antibiotic treatment also deserve further research. For example, studies showed promising results for procalcitonin guidance of antibiotic treatment in lower respiratory tract infections and might be evaluated for COPD exacerbations as well [42, 43]. Also, a recent study showed that patient-reported sputum purulence was an excellent predictor of positive bacteria cultures [44]. Although the study was too small for multivariable analyses and no patient-important outcomes were assessed, the usefulness of sputum purulence to guide antibiotic treatment should be further studied.

Finally, future studies should explore the long-term effects of antibiotics when given for acute exacerbations. The trials included in this review only assessed the effects on short-term outcomes such as treatment failure or mortality. However, it may be possible that antibiotics eradicate bacteria that could cause exacerbations in the future. Thus antibiotics might prolong the exacerbation-free interval or even reduce the number of exacerbations.

### Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and antibiotics: what studies are still needed? [^114k3YFH]. The European Respiratory Journal (2002). Low credibility.

The use of antibiotics in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECBs) remains the subject of controversy despite considerable medical and socioeconomic implications. First, the contribution of bacterial infection to AECBs is difficult to assess in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are chronically colonized with respiratory pathogens. In addition, several studies suggest a major role of viral infections in AECBs. Secondly, it is unlikely that all COPD patients will benefit from antibiotics during AECBs. In particular, the benefit in mild COPD remains uncertain. Unfortunately, the number of studies complying with evidence-based medicine requirements is too small for definite recommendations in AECBs to be drawn up. Considering the impact of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, as well as the community, and the impact of antibiotic therapy on the development of bacterial resistance, there is an urgent need for the design of appropriate multicentric studies to define the usefulness of this type of treatment in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.

### The problems of meta-analysis for antibiotic treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a heterogeneous disease: a commentary on puhan et al [^116GP5tm]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Exacerbations are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Exacerbations can be of bacterial, viral or mixed etiology, with bacteria involved in 50% of exacerbations. Consequently, current management of exacerbations frequently involves the use of antibiotics. The paper by Puhan et al published this month in BMC Medicine examines the benefit of antibiotics in placebo-controlled trials in mild to moderate outpatient exacerbations. The authors use a meta-analytic approach and rightly conclude that more trials are needed in this area. However, the heterogeneity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and exacerbations and the limited end-points in past trials do not allow firm conclusions to be drawn about antibiotic use in outpatient exacerbations based on this meta-analysis. Future trials need to take into account this heterogeneity as well as incorporate novel end-points to address this important issue.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations — risks and action plans note that COPD exacerbations increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events, with heightened risk in the first 30 days persisting for up to 1–2 years, and that mortality risk may be heightened during spells of cold weather. An updated Cochrane review concluded that COPD exacerbation action plans with a single short educational component, in conjunction with ongoing support, reduced in-hospital healthcare utilization and increased the treatment of COPD exacerbations with corticosteroids and antibiotics.

The diagnosis and treatment of acute exacerbations (AEs) of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is controversial. In this section, we review (1) the epidemiology of this condition; (2) the etiology — many patients with AECOPD are thought to have a combination of viral and bacterial infections, which contribute to their exacerbation. Bacterial organisms are isolated more commonly after viral infections in patients with COPD. The role that bacterial infections play in AECOPD remains a very controversial topic; (3) the use of diagnostic procedures; (4) efficacy of antibiotics; (5) clinical parameters to stratify patients' severity; (6) different groups of antibiotics that can be used; and (7) other therapies, including bronchodilators. We summarize the current literature, with special emphasis on the assessment of the long-term impact of this condition.

Research needs

The studies available to date used the criterion of one or more exacerbations in the past year to define a patient with frequent exacerbations. This criterion is inadequate because there are likely different risks (and different responses to pharmacotherapy) for patients depending on both the number and severity of exacerbations. For example, a patient with less than one exacerbation per year would likely be at low risk, patients with one exacerbation per year may have a moderate risk, and patients with two or more exacerbations per year or those with at least one severe exacerbation requiring hospitalization may be at high risk. Trials using risk stratification of exacerbation risks to more precisely target a treatment response are needed. Evidence is also lacking with regard to the subgroup with no history of exacerbations, and trials are needed to better establish the role of triple therapy in this patient population.

Adequately powered, well-designed effectiveness studies (e.g. pragmatic RCTs and nonrandomized studies of interventions), with larger sample sizes, in the area of triple therapy versus dual therapy should be conducted in real-life situations, such as those involving patients older than 80 years of age, those with multiple chronic health conditions, current smokers, and those with a codiagnosis of COPD and asthma. The results of such trials could provide much-needed robust evidence for optimal personalized clinical management.

In patients with COPD who are receiving triple therapy with ICS/LABA/LAMA, we suggest that the ICS can be withdrawn if the patient has had no exacerbations in the past year (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).

Subgroup analysis

The panel decided a priori that a subgroup analysis would be done for the exacerbation outcome based on patients with a history of one or more COPD exacerbations in the past year requiring treatment with antibiotics or oral steroids or hospitalization versus patients with no exacerbation in the past year requiring treatment with antibiotics or oral steroids or hospitalization.

Critical outcomes

Outcome prioritization by the panel resulted in ranking pneumonia, hospital admissions, exacerbations, all-cause death, ICU admissions, dyspnea, health-related QOL, and physical activity as critical outcomes.

### Comparative effectiveness of macrolides and quinolones for patients hospitalized with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) [^113dpUi9]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Meta-analyses of randomized trials have found that antibiotics are effective in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), but there is insufficient evidence to guide antibiotic selection. Current guidelines offer conflicting recommendations.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of macrolides and quinolones for AECOPD DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using logistic regression, propensity score-matching, and grouped treatment models.

Setting

A total of 375 acute care hospitals throughout the United States.

Patients

Age ≥ 40 years and hospitalized for AECOPD.

Intervention

Macrolide or quinolone antibiotic begun in the first 2 hospital days.

Measurements

Treatment failure (defined as the initiation of mechanical ventilation after hospital day 2, inpatient mortality, or readmission for AECOPD within 30 days), length of stay, and hospital costs.

Results

Of the 19,608 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 6139 (31%) were treated initially with a macrolide and 13,469 (69%) with a quinolone. Compared to patients treated initially with a quinolone, those who received macrolides had a lower risk of treatment failure (6.8% vs. 8.1%; P < 0.01), a finding that was attenuated after multivariable adjustment (odds ratio [OR], 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.78–1.01), and disappeared in a grouped-treatment analysis (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.75–1.35). There were no differences in adjusted length of stay (ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97–1.00) or adjusted cost (ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.99–1.02). After propensity score-matching, antibiotic-associated diarrhea was more common with quinolones (1.2% vs. 0.6%; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Macrolide and quinolone antibiotics are associated with similar rates of treatment failure in AECOPD; however, macrolides are less frequently associated with diarrhea.

### Variability of antibiotic prescribing in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a cohort study [^1135qLu6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The role of antibiotics in treating mild or moderate exacerbations in patients with acute chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is unclear. The aims were to: (i) describe patient characteristics associated with acute exacerbations amongst a representative COPD population, (ii) explore the relationship between COPD severity and outcomes amongst patients with exacerbations, and (iii) quantify variability by general practice in prescribing of antibiotics for COPD exacerbations.

Method

A cohort of 62,747 patients with COPD was identified from primary care general practices (GP) in England, and linked to hospital admission and death certificate data. Exacerbation cases were matched to three controls and characteristics compared using conditional logistic regression. Outcomes were compared using incidence rates and Cox regression, stratified by disease severity. Variability of prescribing at the GP level was evaluated graphically and by using multilevel models.

Results

COPD severity was found to be associated with exacerbation and subsequent mortality (very severe vs. mild, odds ratio for exacerbation 2.12 [95%CI 19.5–2.32]), hazard ratio for mortality 2.14 [95%CI 1.59–2.88]). Whilst 61% of exacerbation cases were prescribed antibiotics, this proportion varied considerably between GP practices (interquartile range, 48–73%). This variation is greater than can be explained by patient characteristics alone.

Conclusions

There is significant variability between GP practices in the prescribing of antibiotics to COPD patients experiencing exacerbations. Combined with a lack of evidence on the effects of treatment, this supports the need and opportunity for a large scale pragmatic randomised trial of the prescribing of antibiotics for COPD patients with exacerbations, in order to clarify their effectiveness and long term outcomes whilst ensuring the representativeness of subjects.

### Antibiotics for acute and chronic respiratory infection in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113MuBN6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Prevention and effective treatment of exacerbations are major objectives in the management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Antibiotics are mainstay treatment for patients with severe COPD with an acute exacerbation that includes increased sputum purulence and worsening shortness of breath. Although such treatment is associated with clinical benefit, treatment failure and relapse rates may be high, particularly in cases of inadequate antibiotic therapy through incomplete resolution of the initial exacerbation and persistent bacterial infection. These aspects have led to recommendations for a stratified approach to antibiotic therapy based on patient characteristics associated with increased risk factors for failure. Patients at greatest risk for poor outcome (i.e., those with severe COPD) are likely to derive greatest benefit from early treatment with antibiotics. Long-term or intermittent antibiotic treatment has been shown to prevent COPD exacerbations and hospitalizations. These effects may be achieved by reducing bacterial load in the airways in stable state and/or bronchial inflammation. Although systemic antibiotics are likely to remain the core treatment for patients with moderate to severe exacerbated COPD, inhaled antibiotics may represent a more optimal approach for the treatment and prevention of COPD exacerbations in the future. Regardless of the route of administration, further studies are required to evaluate the potential long-term adverse events of antibiotics and the development of bacterial resistance.

### WITHDRAWN: antibiotics for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112KPoAW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Most patients with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are treated with antibiotics. However the value of their use remains uncertain. Some controlled trials of antibiotics have shown benefit (Berry 1960; Pines 1972) while others have not (Elmes 1965b; Nicotra 1982).

Objectives

To conduct a systematic review of the literature estimating the value of antibiotics in the management of acute COPD exacerbations.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2005, issue 4) which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialized Register; MEDLINE (1966 to December 2005); EMBASE (1974 to December 2005); Web of Science (December 2005), and other electronically available databases.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with acute COPD exacerbations comparing antibiotic (for a minimum of five days) and placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were analysed using Review Manager software. Continuous data were analysed using weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Relative risks (RR) (and 95% CI) were calculated for all dichotomous data. Where appropriate, number needed to treat to benefit (NNT) and 95% CI were calculated.

Main Results

Eleven trials with 917 patients were included. Ten trials used increased cough, sputum volume and purulence diagnostic criteria for COPD exacerbation. Eight-hundred and fifty-seven patients provided data for outcomes including mortality, treatment failure, increased sputum volume, sputum purulence, PaCO(2), PaO(2), peak flow and adverse events. Antibiotic therapy regardless of antibiotic choice significantly reduced mortality (RR 0.23; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.52 with NNT of 8; 95% CI 6 to 17), treatment failure (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.62 with NNT of 3; 95% CI 3 to 5) and sputum purulence (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.77 with NNT of 8; 95% CI 6 to 17). There was a small increase in risk of diarrhoea with antibiotics (RR 2.86; 95% CI 1.06 to 7.76). Antibiotics did not improve arterial blood gases and peak flow.

Authors' Conclusions

This review shows that in COPD exacerbations with increased cough and sputum purulence antibiotics, regardless of choice, reduce the risk of short-term mortality by 77%, decrease the risk of treatment failure by 53% and the risk of sputum purulence by 44%; with a small increase in the risk of diarrhoea. These results should be interpreted with caution due to the differences in patient selection, antibiotic choice, small number of included trials and lack of control for interventions that influence outcome, such as use of systemic corticosteroids and ventilatory support. Nevertheless, this review supports antibiotics for patients with COPD exacerbations with increased cough and sputum purulence who are moderately or severely ill.

### Antibiotics for treatment of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a network meta-analysis [^115r2MZM]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our study indicated that dirithromycin has a high clinical cure rate with a low rate of adverse effects. Ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole also have high clinical cure rates with median rates of adverse effects. However, caution should still be exercised when using antibiotics to treat acute exacerbations of COPD.

Methods

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotics with placebo or no antibiotics in COPD patients suffering from an acute exacerbation defined as a worsening of a previous stable situation with symptoms such as increased dyspnea, increased cough, increased sputum volume or change in sputum colour. We considered studies if > 90% of patients had a clinical (physician-based) diagnosis of COPD or, ideally, spirometrically confirmed COPD. We excluded studies of patients with acute bronchitis, pneumonia, asthma or bronchiectasis.

We included trials evaluating any antibiotics that were administered orally or parenterally daily for a minimum period of at least three days. We chose three days because this is the minimum duration for which antibiotics are usually prescribed in clinical practice for COPD exacerbations.

The outcome measure of primary interest was treatment failure defined as (1) no resolution of symptoms and signs as reported by patients or physicians or as (2) need for further antibiotics. Outcome measures of secondary interest were duration of hospital admission, admission to an intensive care unit, health-related quality of life, symptoms, mortality, and any adverse events registered during the study period.

Search strategy

The search was carried out by information specialists (Bazian, London, UK) and included searches in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2005 issue 4), PREMEDLINE (1960 to 1965), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2006), EMBASE (1974 to March 2006), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE, March 2006). We entered all included studies into the Pub-med "related articles" function and the science citation index. In addition, we scrutinised the reference lists of included studies and review articles as well the conference proceedings of the international congresses of the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society from 2000 to 2006 since these studies might not have been fully published yet. We also contacted representatives of the pharmaceutical industry for additional published or unpublished data (Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, BoehringerIngelheim, Pfizer and MSD). Finally, we searched international data bases for trial registration to identify ongoing or recently completed trials.

Study selection

Two members of the review team independently assessed the titles and abstracts of all identified citations without imposing any language restrictions. The reviewers then evaluated the full text of articles that seemed potentially eligible by one of the reviewers. Final decisions on in- and exclusion were recorded in the Endnote file and agreement was assessed using chance-adjusted kappa statistics.

Precision medicine in the prevention of exacerbations

Prevention of exacerbations is a crucial therapeutic aim in stable COPD. Most available treatments address this to some extent, as demonstrated by RCTs of unselected patients with COPD and frequent exacerbations (summarised in the ERS/ATS guideline on the prevention of COPD exacerbationsand the GOLD document.

More personalised preventive approaches have not been tested yet. However, there is emerging evidence suggesting a potential role for such interventions. Characteristically, a recent report from the AERIS longitudinal cohort suggested that patients tend to experience either recurrent bacterial or recurrent eosinophilic exacerbations. This group of patients might benefit from different preventive strategies. Consistently, in the Study to understand mortality and morbidity in COPD (SUMMIT) trial, the addition of an ICS (fluticasone furoate) led to a reduction in the frequency of exacerbations that were treated with systemic corticosteroids alone or with both antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids, with treatment being decided by the responsible clinician. On the other hand, fluticasone led to a 12% increase in the frequency of exacerbations treated by antibiotics alone, compared with placebo. Data from the Effect of Indacaterol Glycopyrronium vs. Fluticasone Salmeterol on COPD exacerbations (FLAME) trial showed that the combination of a long-acting beta-agonist (indacaterol) with a long-acting antimuscarinic (glycopyrronium), compared with the combination of a long-acting beta-agonist (salmeterol) and an ICS (fluticasone propionate) significantly reduced the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations treated with antibiotics and those treated with antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids. The impact of the two interventions on exacerbations treated with systemic corticosteroids alone was comparable.

These observations suggest that long-acting bronchodilators are effective in preventing all subtypes of exacerbations. On the other hand, ICSs may be more effective for people with frequent eosinophilic exacerbations but should be avoided in patients experiencing recurrent bacterial exacerbations. Further research is needed to validate these findings and evaluate the role of different medications in the exacerbations' defined patient groups.

### Procalcitonin and antibiotics in moderate-severe acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: to use or not to use [^111Px9Gd]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are major driver for healthcare utilization with each exacerbation begetting the next exacerbation. It is, therefore, important to treat each episode effectively to prevent the next. However, this can be challenging as AECOPD result from complex interactions between host, environment and infective agents. The benefits of starting antibiotics in AECOPD, which are not life-threatening (e.g. not requiring mechanical ventilation) or not complicated by pneumonia remain controversial.

Recent Findings

The use of procalcitonin to guide antibiotic therapy in AECOPD has gained interest in recent years. The main advantage of this approach is a safe reduction in antibiotic use in a large group of patients, which may potentially translate to several other benefits. These include reduced antibiotic-related side-effects, reduced risk of developing antibiotic-resistant organisms and cost savings. This approach is associated with no increase in mortality or morbidity such as treatment failure, re-admission, admission to ICU.

Summary

Procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy in AECOPD is a promising and safe approach, which may be ready for the prime time.

### The problems of meta-analysis for antibiotic treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a heterogeneous disease: a commentary on puhan et al [^116LdoMD]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Severity of exacerbations

Puhan et al have grouped together mild and moderate exacerbations based on the site of treatment, that is, outpatient treatment. This classification is clearly very broad as the site of care will vary among countries and healthcare systems as well as with patient and physician preferences. Furthermore, over time, changes in healthcare delivery and results of outcome studies can change the site of care for the same severity of exacerbation. A 40-year-old smoker without underlying airway obstruction, infrequent exacerbations and free of comorbid conditions would have been included as a 'mild to moderate' exacerbation. On the other hand, a patient with severe COPD, frequent exacerbations and comorbid conditions who does not require hospitalization would also be classified as a 'mild to moderate exacerbation'. In the former patient, it is possible that host immunity can adequately deal with the infection and the exacerbation will spontaneously resolve. In the latter patient, such resolution is less likely and complications are more frequent. Grouping these patients together can lead to confusing and contradictory results.

The severity of an exacerbation is a complicated concept, constituted by at least two factors, the severity of the underlying COPD and the acute change induced by the exacerbation itself. Therefore, a patient with severe underlying COPD will have significant clinical consequences from a relatively small change from the baseline state, while a patient with mild COPD will tolerate a much larger change in symptoms and lung function. It is evident that we need more objective measures of severity of exacerbations. Ongoing developmental efforts in patient-reported outcomes and biomarkers should provide us with such tools in the future, and allow for trials to be pooled as attempted by Puhan et al here.

Results

Identification of studies

Figure 1 summarises the process of identifying eligible clinical trials. We identified 765 citations from electronic databases and selected 35 of them for full text assessment. Together with 30 additional citations from hand-searching we studied 65 publications in detail. We included 13 trials with 1557 COPD patients in the analyses. We excluded most trials because they compared different antibiotics without having a placebo control group. From trial registers, we identified four randomised trials that are still ongoing. The pharmaceutical industry did not provide any unpublished data.
