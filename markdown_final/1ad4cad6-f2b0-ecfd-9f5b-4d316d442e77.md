## Question

What is the workup in outpatient setting?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what constitutes the workup in the outpatient setting. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the universal foundation of history, physical examination, and triage for acuity. Then, I should verify condition-specific pathways for common outpatient presentations like syncope, chest pain, acute cough, abdominal pain, and palpitations. Next, I will examine the role of pre-visit testing and standardized panels. After that, I need to check imaging appropriateness and stewardship. Finally, I will consider special populations, safety netting, and shared decision-making, and I will synthesize a concise, practical framework with citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the universal foundation: every outpatient workup should begin with a focused history, physical examination, and risk stratification to determine acuity and the need for urgent escalation, because this drives disposition and test selection. I should double-check that this principle is consistently emphasized across guidelines and reviews, and indeed it is foundational in syncope, abdominal pain, and general outpatient evaluation frameworks [^983296b9] [^f9b82a48] [^51561508].

> Now, for syncope, I need to ensure I apply the ACC/AHA/HRS algorithm correctly: after the initial evaluation, if a serious medical condition is present, inpatient care is recommended. If not, outpatient management is reasonable for reflex-mediated syncope, and selected patients with suspected cardiac syncope can be managed outpatient in the absence of serious conditions. Hold on, I should verify the disposition classes and evidence strength, and yes, Class I for inpatient with serious conditions, Class IIa for outpatient reflex-mediated syncope, and Class IIb for selected cardiac syncope outpatient, with structured ED observation as an alternative for intermediate risk [^06885ff3] [^56c7222a] [^3c90aeac].

> For chest pain and suspected ACS in the outpatient setting, I initially thought a single high-sensitivity troponin could safely triage patients, but wait, let me verify the current consensus. The evidence shows that while an undetectable hs-troponin plus a nonischemic ECG has a very high negative predictive value in ED cohorts, this has not been validated for non-ED outpatient settings, and outpatient hs-troponin should not be used alone to triage; instead, if used, it must be paired with immediate ED coordination and serial testing rather than standalone decisions, so I should correct that assumption and emphasize ED linkage and serial testing when ACS is suspected [^878a6381].

> For acute cough and suspected pneumonia, I should confirm that chest radiography improves diagnostic accuracy when pneumonia is suspected based on vitals and exam, and that routine microbiologic testing is not recommended unless results would change management. Let me verify the grading and scope, and yes, CHEST suggests chest radiography in suspected pneumonia and advises against routine microbiology in most outpatients, with CRP supporting diagnosis or exclusion when used thoughtfully [^30bbc4e6] [^11e9a602] [^b8d5c6ae].

> For acute abdominal pain, I need to check imaging choices by location and severity. Ultrasonography is first-line for right upper quadrant pain, whereas CT is preferred for right or left lower quadrant pain when serious disease is suspected, and conventional radiography has limited value. Hold on, I should verify stewardship principles and the need to balance diagnostic yield with radiation, and the ACR-aligned guidance supports ultrasound-first in RUQ and CT for RLQ/LLQ when indicated, with attention to dose reduction strategies [^f9b82a48].

> For palpitations, let me think about the stepwise approach: start with history, exam, and ECG. If structural heart disease is suspected, obtain echocardiography. If intermittent arrhythmia is suspected, use ambulatory ECG monitoring, preferably a loop recorder for infrequent events. I should confirm that this aligns with primary care guidance, and yes, this structured approach is recommended to distinguish benign from clinically significant arrhythmias [^7d8b5b24].

> Next, I should review pre-visit laboratory testing. A controlled "on–off" trial showed that standardized pre-visit panels did not shorten overall time to diagnosis but did increase the proportion of correct preliminary diagnoses on day 1 and completion of workup on day 1, albeit with more tests ordered. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and implications, and the NNT to finish on day 1 was about 15, with higher test counts but no increase in downstream utilization, suggesting selective, customized pre-visit panels may be reasonable in some clinics [^d3098520] [^3c799d50] [^ea9cf800].

> I will now examine imaging stewardship and appropriateness. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are a key resource, yet utilization remains low despite potential to reduce low-value imaging. Let me reconsider how to operationalize this: embedding ACR AC into order entry and using clinical decision support can mitigate unnecessary CT, reduce radiation, and align testing with pretest probability, which is especially relevant in acute care transitions and high-volume outpatient settings [^e9e57d6b].

> For special populations, I need to ensure I tailor the workup. In pediatrics, echocardiography appropriateness criteria help avoid low-yield testing. Innocent murmurs and isolated syncope without red flags are rarely appropriate for initial TTE, whereas pathologic murmurs or systemic signs justify imaging. In older adults, syncope workup should have a lower threshold for telemetry or inpatient evaluation given arrhythmic risk. In pregnancy, many diagnostic and therapeutic procedures can be performed safely as outpatient care with obstetric input. And in patients with limited life expectancy or multiple comorbidities, I should avoid low-yield diagnostics and align testing with goals of care [^cde43927] [^9078117e] [^1f390c45] [^467d7c9f] [^11976c73].

> Safety netting and follow-up are critical in outpatient workups. I should confirm that explicit return precautions, reliable follow-up within 24–48 hours for uncertain diagnoses, and clear instructions reduce missed serious disease. Serial re-evaluation is particularly important for abdominal pain and other undifferentiated presentations, and structured pathways after ED visits can reduce unnecessary admissions while maintaining safety [^8d901e85] [^1229a93d].

> Shared decision-making should be integrated, especially when testing has uncertain benefit. Let me verify examples: in suspected Alzheimer's disease, blood-based biomarkers may be appropriate in specialized settings but require discussion of utility, prognosis, and potential harms. Similarly, in palpitations or low-risk chest pain, discussing the risks, benefits, and timing of testing improves alignment with patient preferences and may reduce overuse [^11976c73] [^b1051e69].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical framework: start with history, physical, and acuity triage. Apply condition-specific algorithms for syncope, chest pain, cough, abdominal pain, and palpitations. Use pre-visit testing selectively when it will change first-visit decisions. Employ imaging stewardship with ACR AC. Adapt for special populations. Ensure robust safety netting and follow-up. And engage patients in decisions when testing is low yield or high burden. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with the cited guidance, and yes, this stepwise, reference-aware approach reflects current best practices for outpatient workups [^983296b9] [^30bbc4e6] [^f9b82a48] [^d3098520] [^e9e57d6b].

---

The outpatient workup centers on **history, exam, and targeted testing** to identify serious disease while avoiding unnecessary tests [^51561508]. Start with a focused history and physical, then order labs and imaging based on pretest probability and guideline-based criteria [^0f4229dc]. Use **shared decision-making** to align testing with patient goals and local resources [^b1051e69]. Reserve advanced imaging or specialty referral for unresolved or high-risk cases, and ensure timely follow-up to close the loop on results and adjust the plan [^e5393af3].

---

## Core elements of outpatient workup

### Initial clinical assessment

- **History**: Detailed characterization of symptoms, onset, duration, severity, associated features, and functional impact; review of systems; past medical and surgical history; medications; allergies; family history; social history (smoking, alcohol, occupation, travel) [^6a8cfa38].

- **Physical examination**: Vital signs, general appearance, and targeted organ-system examination based on the chief complaint and history [^6a8cfa38].

- **Risk stratification**: Identify red flags and high-risk features that may necessitate urgent evaluation or escalation of care [^06885ff3].

---

### Diagnostic testing

Testing should be **guided by clinical suspicion** and pretest probability, with attention to cost, availability, and patient preferences [^0f4229dc].

| **Test category** | **Common tests** | **Indications** |
|-|-|-|
| Laboratory tests | - CBC <br/> - CMP <br/> - TSH <br/> - HbA1c <br/> - Lipid panel <br/> - Urinalysis <br/> - Cultures (urine, throat, wound) | - Routine screening <br/> - Suspected infection <br/> - Metabolic disorders <br/> - Endocrine dysfunction [^d2c09b14] |
| Imaging studies | - Chest X-ray <br/> - Ultrasound (abdominal, pelvic, musculoskeletal) <br/> - CT scan (head, chest, abdomen) <br/> - MRI (brain, spine, joints) <br/> - ECG <br/> - Echocardiography | - Suspected pneumonia <br/> - Abdominal pain <br/> - Musculoskeletal injury <br/> - Neurologic symptoms <br/> - Cardiac evaluation [^f9b82a48] [^030ddd58] |
| Specialized tests | - Stress testing <br/> - Ambulatory ECG monitoring <br/> - Pulmonary function tests <br/> - Endoscopy <br/> - Colonoscopy <br/> - Allergy testing | - Suspected coronary artery disease <br/> - Arrhythmias <br/> - Respiratory symptoms <br/> - GI symptoms <br/> - Screening or diagnostic evaluation [^7f82b273] [^910b58cd] |

---

### Follow-up and continuity of care

Follow-up should be **timely** to review results, confirm diagnoses, and adjust management, with clear return precautions and patient education. Continuity of care supports longitudinal management, preventive care, and coordination with specialists [^39b1ab6b].

---

## Condition-specific outpatient workups

### Syncope

- **Initial evaluation**: History, physical exam, and ECG are essential; risk stratify for serious conditions [^6a8cfa38].

- **Outpatient management**: Reasonable for reflex-mediated syncope without serious conditions; selected cardiac syncope may be managed outpatient if low risk [^c0a2a4d8].

- **Advanced testing**: Ambulatory ECG monitoring, echocardiography, or electrophysiology study as indicated [^a8d604d2].

---

### Acute cough and suspected pneumonia

Order a **chest radiograph** when pneumonia is suspected based on abnormal vital signs or clinical findings [^b8d5c6ae]. Routine microbiologic testing is not recommended unless results would change management [^11f7f26f]. Use **CRP** to support diagnosis or exclusion of pneumonia when needed [^30bbc4e6].

---

### Abdominal pain

Use **ultrasound first** for right upper quadrant pain; CT is preferred for right or left lower quadrant pain when serious disease is suspected [^f9b82a48]. Reserve MRI for specific indications or when radiation avoidance is prioritized [^f9b82a48].

---

### Chronic pelvic pain

Start with **transabdominal sonography**, reserving MRI/MRV for selected patients or when initial studies are inconclusive [^91a66891].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Adapt testing to age, developmental stage, and family context; use pediatric-specific guidelines and appropriate use criteria [^030ddd58].

- **Elderly patients**: Consider frailty, comorbidities, and fall risk; tailor testing intensity and follow-up frequency.

- **Resource-limited settings**: Prioritize high-yield, low-cost tests; use clinical judgment to avoid unnecessary imaging or specialty referrals [^e9e57d6b].

---

## Quality improvement and patient safety

- **Diagnostic uncertainty**: Acknowledge and manage uncertainty to avoid overtesting and misdiagnosis [^8622248f].

- **Shared decision-making**: Engage patients in test selection and follow-up planning to improve adherence and satisfaction [^b1051e69].

- **System-level interventions**: Implement clinical pathways, decision support tools, and feedback mechanisms to standardize care and reduce variability [^e9e57d6b].

---

The outpatient workup is a **structured, patient-centered process** that balances diagnostic accuracy with resource stewardship, using history and exam to guide targeted testing, condition-specific algorithms, and timely follow-up to ensure safe, effective care [^51561508].

### Management of chronic hyponatremia in the outpatient setting [^f430c9d4]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

The diagnostic evaluation and management of chronic hyponatremia in outpatients can be challenging for several reasons. First, chronic hyponatremia is often mild, leading to uncertainty about whether it is clinically significant and warrants further diagnostic evaluation and treatment. Second, if the initial diagnostic workup does not identify a clear cause, it becomes uncertain how much further investigation is required. Third, when no clear cause is found or the underlying condition cannot be treated, physicians may struggle to choose the most appropriate treatment approach. This review offers practical guidance to navigate these challenges in managing chronic hyponatremia in the outpatient setting.

### Selecting appropriate diagnostic tools for evaluating the patient with syncope / collapse [^6a8cfa38]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The investigation of syncope is challenging and physicians have an ever-increasing array of diagnostic tools at their disposal. There are two essential goals that drive investigation: risk stratification and identification of etiology. In this review, we outline our approach while providing a synopsis of the available supportive evidence. The key to syncope is in the story as told by the patient and a bystander, since this drives both risk assessment and diagnostic testing. All patients should initially be evaluated with a systematic history and physical examination as well as an ECG. The initial evaluation provides an estimation of risk and directs whether inpatient or outpatient evaluation is appropriate. In a substantial proportion of patients, the etiology will be evident after initial evaluation and no further investigation is required. In the remaining, targeted use of additional investigations in the form of cardiac imaging, provocative testing and/or ambulatory ECG monitoring should be performed. A thoughtful and systematic approach to the investigation of syncope optimizes the diagnostic yield but also ensures efficient usage of limited health care resources.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^8172686c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale

It is essential to understand the accuracy of diagnostic tests including signs and symptoms to identify the best way they can be used in different settings to develop effective diagnostic and management pathways. We are producing a suite of Cochrane 'living systematic reviews', which will summarise evidence on the clinical accuracy of different tests and diagnostic features, grouped according to present research questions and settings, in the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease. Summary estimates of accuracy from these reviews will help inform diagnostic, screening, isolation, and patient management decisions.

New tests are being developed and evidence is emerging at an unprecedented rate during the COVID‐19 pandemic. We will aim to update these reviews as often as is feasible to ensure that they provide the most up‐to‐date evidence about test accuracy.

These reviews are being produced rapidly to assist in providing a central resource of evidence to assist in the COVID‐19 pandemic, summarising available evidence on the accuracy of the tests and presenting characteristics.

### Defining and measuring diagnostic uncertainty in medicine: a systematic review [^8622248f]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Diagnostic uncertainty is inherent in the practice of medicine. Patients often present with undifferentiated symptoms that change over time, making it difficult for clinicians to identify a satisfactory explanation of the patient's presenting problem.–In addition to patient presentation, time constraints of the patient–clinician encounter, complexity of medical science and limitations of diagnostic tests all influence diagnostic decisions in the midst of uncertainty.–Described as analogous to looking for a "snowball in a blizzard," diagnostic decision-making under uncertainty is challenging for clinicians and must be appropriately managed in medical practice.

In previous studies, diagnostic uncertainty has been associated with diagnostic variation (physicians giving different diagnoses to the same patient), over-testing, unnecessary surgeries, more hospitalizations and referrals, and increased health care expenditure.–Inappropriate management of diagnostic uncertainty could contribute to diagnostic errors or excess health care utilization.–Recent estimates suggest that at least 1 in 20 outpatients experience a diagnostic error (missed, delayed or incorrect diagnoses) each year, sometimes with devastating consequences. Additionally, rising costs related to diagnostic testing have led to recommendations for cost-containment, requiring physicians to carefully consider the resources they use and diagnostic decisions they make in the midst of uncertainty.–Thus, inappropriate management of diagnostic uncertainty can impact both system and patient outcomes.,

The "basic science" of diagnostic uncertainty is poorly understood.–To our knowledge, diagnostic uncertainty has yet to be adequately conceptualized in medical practice, and few efforts have been made to measure it in clinical settings.–This knowledge is foundational for the development of interventions to identify and manage it appropriately. To this end, we synthesized existing literature to ascertain how diagnostic uncertainty has been defined in medical practice, and what assessment methods are used for its measurement.

### Critical pathways for post-emergency outpatient diagnosis and treatment: tools to improve the value of emergency care [^1229a93d]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The decision to admit a patient to the hospital after an emergency department (ED) visit is expensive, frequently not evidence-based, and variable. Outpatient critical pathways are a promising approach to reduce hospital admission after emergency care. Critical pathways exist to risk stratify patients for potentially serious diagnoses (e.g., acute myocardial infarction [AMI]) or evaluate response to therapy (e.g., community-acquired pneumonia) within a short time period (i.e., less than 36 hours), to determine if further hospital-based acute care is needed. Yet, such pathways are variably used while many patients are admitted for conditions for which they could be treated as outpatients. In this article, the authors propose a model of post-ED critical pathways, describe their role in emergency care, list common diagnoses that are amenable to critical pathways in the outpatient setting, and propose a research agenda to address barriers and solutions to increase the use of outpatient critical pathways. If emergency providers are to routinely conduct rapid evaluations in outpatient or observation settings, they must have several conditions at their disposal: 1) evidence-based tools to accurately risk stratify patients for protocolized care, 2) systems of care that reliably facilitate workup in the outpatient setting, and 3) a medical environment conducive to noninpatient pathways, with aligned risks and incentives among patients, providers, and payers. Increased use of critical pathways after emergency care is a potential way to improve the value of emergency care.

### Diagnostic imaging of acute abdominal pain in adults [^f9b82a48]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is a common presentation in the outpatient setting and can represent conditions ranging from benign to life-threatening. If the patient history, physical examination, and laboratory testing do not identify an underlying cause of pain and if serious pathology remains a clinical concern, diagnostic imaging is indicated. The American College of Radiology has developed clinical guidelines, the Appropriateness Criteria, based on the location of abdominal pain to help physicians choose the most appropriate imaging study. Ultrasonography is the initial imaging test of choice for patients presenting with right upper quadrant pain. Computed tomography (CT) is recommended for evaluating right or left lower quadrant pain. Conventional radiography has limited diagnostic value in the assessment of most patients with abdominal pain. The widespread use of CT raises concerns about patient exposure to ionizing radiation. Strategies to reduce exposure are currently being studied, such as using ultrasonography as an initial study for suspected appendicitis before obtaining CT and using low-dose CT rather than standard-dose CT. Magnetic resonance imaging is another emerging technique for the evaluation of abdominal pain that avoids ionizing radiation.

### 2017 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline for the evaluation and management of patients with syncope: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^983296b9]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/HRS syncope guideline — determinants of admission and care pathways states that the evaluating provider must decide whether further workup can continue in an outpatient setting or whether hospital-based evaluation is required, and that the purpose of hospital-based evaluation is to expedite the treatment of identified serious conditions or to continue the diagnostic evaluation in the absence of a presumptive cause of syncope. Decision support algorithms may reduce health service use in the evaluation of syncope, although there are currently insufficient data to advocate the use of specific decision support algorithms for making disposition decisions. Specialized syncope evaluation units may lead to reduced health service use and increased diagnostic rates; however, the logistical and financial feasibility in North American settings is unknown, and wider acceptance requires further evidence of improvement in clinical outcomes. Individual risk factors and risk scores are correlated with short- and long-term clinical outcomes, but they are not primary determinants for admission to hospital; presence of ≥ 1 serious medical condition is the key determinant for in-hospital management of patients after syncope.

### Practice pattern of use of high sensitivity troponin in the outpatient settings [^878a6381]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

We describe the outpatient utilization pattern of troponin assays in a large academic medical center in the United States. While there was an increase in outpatient ordering of prior generation troponin assays in the 3 years prior to implementation of the high‐sensitivity assay, the launch of hs‐TnT was associated with a subsequent significant decline in outpatient troponin utilization. Almost one quarter of patients were asymptomatic at the time of hs‐TnT ordering. Higher outpatient hs‐TnT levels were associated with a significantly higher likelihood of ED referral. Among patients sent home from clinic, higher hs‐TnT levels were associated with significantly higher short‐term cardiovascular event rates.

Citing incomplete evidence, current consensus recommendations discourage the use of this assay outside of ACS evaluation in traditional ED and inpatient care settings. Several recent studies have tried to apply potential outpatient strategies to identify patients at low risk of coronary events. A recent meta‐analysis found that a single undetectable hs‐TnT, combined with a non‐ischemic electrocardiogram, has a > 99% negative predictive value for ACS for patients presenting with chest pain in the ED. This approach, however, has not been validated or formally translated into practice guidelines given the heterogeneity in the threshold for the hs‐TnT assay, 7 and the lack of clear guidance on how to manage patients who do not have an initially detectable troponin. Another study identified a patient population (with hsTnT ≤ 50 ng/L and < 5 ng/L increase on repeat measurement) who had similar rates of coronary events whether they were admitted or discharged from the ED, suggesting they may be suitable for outpatient management. 8 None of these patient populations, however, have been studied in non‐ED outpatient settings to date. The practicalities of evaluating ACS in the outpatient settings also remain undefined — for example, there are no guidelines on where and how intensively patients should be monitored while awaiting test results, or whether single or sequential hs‐TnT testing would be required to inform patient triage. Since sequential hs‐TnT testing remains the cornerstone of ACS evaluation, the appropriate workup (including first troponin test) could be initiated in the outpatient settings if time allows, but only while simultaneously coordinating (and prioritizing) immediate transport to the ED — and not using a single hs‐TnT value to inform patient triage. Our findings of declining outpatient troponin utilization since implementation of the high‐sensitivity assay seems supportive of these guidance recommendations, and may be due to clinician unfamiliarity with the assay and appropriate concerns about interpretation of its results.

### Alzheimer's association clinical practice guideline on the use of blood-based biomarkers in the diagnostic workup of suspected Alzheimer's disease within specialized care settings [^7784a504]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

2.7 How to use this guideline

These recommendations are designed to support clinicians, patients, caregivers, policy‐makers, and healthcare decision‐makers in making evidence‐informed decisions, specifically regarding which BBM test(s) to use and whether it/they should be used as a triaging or confirmatory test for AD pathology in specialized care settings. The recommendations are not meant to restrict, limit, delay, or deny clinical use, insurance coverage, or patient access to biomarker testing when deemed appropriate by a qualified healthcare provider. Furthermore, these recommendations do not substitute for clinical judgment nor encompass all possible considerations in the diagnostic and therapeutic evaluation of AD. We advise clinicians to exercise discretion and adapt their approach based on individual patient circumstances and emerging evidence.

### Diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection in the emergency department and outpatient settings [^a4267358]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Emergency physicians encounter urinary tract infections (UTIs) in a wide spectrum of disease severity and patient populations. The challenges of managing UTIs in an emergency department include limited history, lack of follow-up, and lack of culture and susceptibility results. Most patients do not require an extensive diagnostic evaluation and can be safely managed as outpatients with oral antibiotics. The diagnostic approach to and treatment of adults presenting to emergency departments with UTIs are reviewed.

### ACR-SIR-SNIS-SPR practice parameter for the clinical practice of interventional radiology [^39b1ab6b]. SIR (2024). High credibility.

ACR–SIR–SNIS–SPR interventional radiology practice parameter — the outpatient practice highlights clinic accessibility, continuity of care, and duties the interventional radiologist and support staff can perform. The outpatient interventional radiology clinic "should be easily accessible and serve as an avenue through which most patients are evaluated," and the outpatient clinic "is essential for continuation of care, including monitoring for response or disease progression" and "facilitates longitudinal care of patients," supporting patient well-being and practice growth. In this setting, the team "can perform the following duties while providing evaluation and management (E&M) services:" Determining appropriate diagnostic workup; Determining the need for and arranging consultation with other physicians; Scheduling interventional procedures; Obtaining insurance authorization for care; Providing follow-up care, including postprocedure testing; Providing counseling to patients and families; and "Provide a protocol for transferring patients to an inpatient setting if the complexity of the case or urgency of the situation requires it."

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^69127a11]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus and resulting COVID‐19 pandemic present important diagnostic evaluation challenges. These range from, on the one hand, understanding the value of signs and symptoms in predicting possible infection, assessing whether existing biochemical and imaging tests can identify infection and recognise patients needing critical care, and on the other hand, evaluating whether new diagnostic tests can allow accurate rapid and point‐of‐care testing. Also, the diagnostic aims are diverse, including identifying current infection, ruling out infection, identifying people in need of care escalation, or testing for past infection and immunity.

This review is part of a suite of reviews on the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease, and deals solely with the diagnostic accuracy of presenting clinical signs and symptoms.

Target condition being diagnosed

COVID‐19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. The key target conditions for this suite of reviews are current SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, current COVID‐19, and past SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

For current infection, the severity of the disease is important. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can be asymptomatic (no symptoms); mild or moderate (symptoms such as fever, cough, aches, lethargy but without difficulty breathing at rest); severe (symptoms with breathlessness and increased respiratory rate indicative of pneumonia and oxygen need); or critical (requiring intensive support due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock or other organ dysfunction). People with severe or critical disease require different patient management, which makes it important to distinguish between them.

Thus, there are three target conditions for current infection:

SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (asymptomatic or symptomatic of any severity);
mild or moderate COVID‐19;
severe or critical COVID‐19.

In planning review updates, we will consider the potential addition of another grouping (which is a subset of the above):

whether tests exist that identify people requiring respiratory support (SARS or ARDS) or intensive care.

Here we summarise the evidence on signs and symptoms; as a result asymptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 and past SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are out of scope for this review.

### 2017 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline for the evaluation and management of patients with syncope: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^b24472c2]. Circulation (2017). Medium credibility.

Outpatient management for suspected cardiac syncope — It may be reasonable to manage selected patients with suspected cardiac syncope in the outpatient setting in the absence of serious medical conditions. Hospital-based evaluation of syncope of unclear cause, in the absence of other serious identified medical conditions, has not demonstrated an improvement in patient-relevant outcomes, and several observational studies suggest modest diagnostic yield of hospital admission. Patients evaluated for suspected cardiac syncope in outpatient settings are seldom admitted for diagnostic purposes, it may be reasonable to extend a similar approach to emergency departments (EDs) after initial evaluation is completed in the ED, and primary providers can consider expedited referral to specialists with expertise in syncope as an alternative to extended hospital-based evaluation.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^fce91dca]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms to determine if a person presenting in primary care or to hospital outpatient settings, such as the emergency department or dedicated COVID‐19 clinics, has COVID‐19.

Secondary objectives

Where data are available, we investigated diagnostic accuracy (either by stratified analysis or meta‐regression) according to:

days since symptom onset;
population (children, adults, older adults ≥ 65 years);
reference standard;
study design;
setting; and
risk of bias in participant selection (as scored using QUADAS‐2)

Objectives of future updates of this review

This review will no longer be updated in its current form. Objectives of any future updates of this review are:

to look at a broader approach involving a combination of signs and symptoms with other easy‐to‐obtain information, for example, point‐of‐care test results;
to perform the listed stratified analyses;
to explore seasonality;
to investigate people who require respiratory support or intensive care.

Summary of previous review

In the first update of our review, we found 44 relevant studies with 26,884 participants. Prevalence of COVID‐19 disease varied from 3% to 71% with a median of 21%. There were three studies from primary care settings (1824 participants), nine studies from outpatient testing centres (10,717 participants), 12 studies performed in hospital outpatient wards (5061 participants), seven studies in hospitalised patients (1048 participants), 10 studies in the emergency department (3173 participants), and three studies in which the setting was not specified (5061 participants). The studies did not clearly distinguish mild COVID‐19 disease from COVID‐19 pneumonia, so we presented the results for both conditions together.

Fifteen studies had a high risk of bias for selection of participants because inclusion in the studies depended on the applicable testing and referral protocols, which included many of the signs and symptoms under study in the review. Five studies only included participants with pneumonia on imaging, suggesting that this is a highly selected population. In an additional 12 studies, we were unable to assess the risk for selection bias. This makes it very difficult to judge the validity of the diagnostic accuracy of the signs and symptoms from these included studies.

### Challenging patients in an ambulatory setting [^ebac370b]. Anesthesiology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

An increasing number of surgical procedures are now performed on an ambulatory basis. This article reviews these conditions and defines the appropriate preoperative evaluation and perioperative management. Our goal is to define those patients who would benefit in having care in an inpatient setting or those who require more intensive medical evaluation or preparation prior to outpatient surgery.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 disease [^e9cb10b1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and resulting COVID‐19 pandemic present important diagnostic evaluation challenges. These range from, on the one hand, understanding the value of signs and symptoms in predicting possible infection, assessing whether existing biochemical and imaging tests can identify infection and recognise patients needing critical care, and on the other hand, evaluating whether new diagnostic tests can allow accurate rapid and point‐of‐care testing.

This review is part of a cluster of reviews on the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease, and deals solely with the diagnostic accuracy of presenting clinical signs and symptoms for diagnosing COVID‐19 disease.

Target condition being diagnosed

COVID‐19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is diagnosed with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR), which is a test that detects the virus' genetic material, with imaging to identify lung abnormalities and with clinical signs and symptoms.

SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can be asymptomatic (no symptoms); mild or moderate; severe (causing breathlessness and increased respiratory rate indicative of pneumonia and oxygen need); or critical (requiring intensive support due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock or other organ dysfunction). People with COVID‐19 pneumonia (severe or critical disease), require different patient management, which makes it important to distinguish between mild or moderate COVID‐19 disease and COVID‐19 pneumonia.

In this review, we will examine the diagnostic value of signs and symptoms for symptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, which includes mild or moderate COVID‐19 disease and COVID‐19 pneumonia.

In planning review updates, we will consider the potential addition of another grouping, which is a subset of the above:

whether tests exist that identify people requiring respiratory support (SARS or ARDS) or intensive care.

### 2017 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline for the evaluation and management of patients with syncope: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^131b0247]. Circulation (2017). Medium credibility.

Initial evaluation timing and setting — The time interval between the index syncopal event and the initial evaluation can vary significantly according to the medical necessity for evaluation and the patient's effort in seeking evaluation. The clinical setting also varies, and the patient could seek evaluation in an outpatient setting with a generalist or a specialist or in the ED at a hospital; these general principles for the initial evaluation are shown in Figure 1, and additional evaluation is discussed according to the outcomes of initial evaluation or in the presence of specific disease conditions.

### Syncope risk assessment in the emergency department and clinic [^00d8966a]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The initial assessment of patients who present with presumed syncope is challenging. Syncope has many possible causes ranging from relatively benign to potentially life-threatening, and sorting through the possibilities may not be feasible given time limitations in an urgent care setting. Therefore, the physician almost always must determine whether the affected individual needs in-hospital evaluation or can be safely referred to an outpatient syncope evaluation clinic. In instances when the etiology of syncope has been diagnosed with confidence at the initial clinical evaluation, the hospitalization question is readily addressed and the appropriateness of hospitalization versus timely outpatient evaluation (preferably in a dedicated syncope management clinic) is clear. In those cases in which the diagnosis is uncertain, risk stratification schemes such as those summarized in this communication become more essential. However, at present no single risk assessment protocol appears to be satisfactory for universal application. The development of a consensus recommendation is an essential next step.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^cc21ff65]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Alternative test(s)

We are producing a suite of Cochrane 'living systematic reviews', which will summarise evidence on the clinical accuracy of different tests and diagnostic features, grouped according to the present research questions and settings in the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19. Summary estimates of accuracy from these reviews will help inform diagnostic, screening, isolation, and patient‐management decisions.

New tests are being developed and evidence is emerging at an unprecedented rate during the COVID‐19 pandemic. We will aim to update these reviews as often as is feasible to ensure that they provide the most up‐to‐date evidence about test accuracy.

These reviews are being produced rapidly to assist in providing a central resource of evidence to assist in the COVID‐19 pandemic, summarising available evidence on the accuracy of the tests and presenting characteristics.

Other Cochrane diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) reviews in the suite of reviews are addressing the following tests.

Chest imaging (computed tomography (CT), chest X‐ray and ultrasound (Islam 2021)
Routine laboratory testing, such as for C‐reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) (Stegeman 2020)
Antibody tests (Deeks 2020a)
Laboratory‐independent point‐of‐care and near‐patient molecular and antigen tests (Dinnes 2021)
Molecular laboratory tests (in preparation)

Rationale

It is essential to understand the accuracy of diagnostic features and tests to identify the best way they can be used in different settings to develop effective diagnostic and management pathways. For example, the absence of a highly sensitive sign or symptom is good for ruling out COVID‐19, while the presence of a sign or symptom with high specificity is good for ruling in COVID‐19 ('red flag').

Appropriate use criteria for initial transthoracic echocardiography in outpatient pediatric cardiology — this work aimed to establish and evaluate Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) for the initial use of outpatient pediatric echocardiography. Assumptions include that all indications assumed a first-time transthoracic echocardiographic study in an outpatient setting for patients without previously known heart disease, and that definitions for frequently used terminology in outpatient pediatric cardiology were established using published guidelines and standards and expert opinion. These AUC serve as a guide to help clinicians in the care of children with possible heart disease, specifically in terms of when a transthoracic echocardiogram is warranted as an initial diagnostic modality in the outpatient setting.

### Quick diagnosis units – an effective alternative to hospitalization for diagnostic workup: a systematic review [^e5393af3]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

This era of healthcare reform emphasizes improving value of care. Inpatient admissions for diagnostic evaluation put economic pressure on an already strained healthcare system. We conducted a systematic review of effectiveness of quick diagnosis units (QDUs), an established outpatient model for early diagnostic workups in Europe.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE and Embase for studies that focused on implementation of quick/rapid diagnosis units, with relevant Medical Subject Headings terms and keywords. Of 2047 studies, we selected 13 for full-text screening and bibliography review. Of these, 5 studies included at least 2 primary outcomes of interest and were included in our review. These units functioned as outpatient clinics, staffed by internists, nurses, and clerical staff, with expedited scheduling of outpatient diagnostic tests. Our primary outcome measures were final diagnosis, the mean time to final diagnosis, inpatient bed-days saved per patient, and costs saved per patient. We also studied discharge disposition, care preferences, and safety data.

Results

About 18% to 30% of patients were diagnosed with malignancy, with an average time to diagnosis of 6 to 11 days. Inpatient bed-days saved per patient ranged from 4.5 to 7. Savings from fixed costs of hospitalization ranged from $2336(€1764) to $3304(€2514) for each patient enrolled in the protocol. The QDU model was preferred by 88% of patients, and patient satisfaction rates were 95% to 97%.

Conclusions

QDUs seem an effective and cost-saving alternative to inpatient hospitalization, and appear to be a safe approach for diagnostic workup of potentially severe diseases in select patient populations, although there are limited safety data available.

### Do explicit appropriateness criteria enhance the diagnostic yield of colonoscopy? [^910b58cd]. Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

Background and Study Aims

Appropriateness of use of colonoscopy is an important issue in health care in the quest to improve quality of care while at the same time containing costs. This prospective study examined whether detailed and explicit appropriateness criteria significantly improve the diagnostic yield of colonoscopy.

Patients and Methods

Consecutive patients referred for diagnostic colonoscopy at five centers (one university hospital and its outpatient department, two district hospitals, and two gastroenterology practices) were prospectively studied over a 17-month period. The appropriateness of the indications for these colonoscopies was assessed using explicit Swiss criteria developed by the Rand Corporation/University of California at Los Angeles (RAND/UCLA) panel method, and the relationship between appropriateness of use and the presence of clinically relevant endoscopic lesions was analysed.

Results

1188 patients were included in the study. Indications for 1144 (96.3%) of the colonoscopies could be evaluated using explicit criteria; 64.1% of the colonoscopies were judged appropriate, 13.3% uncertain and 22.6% inappropriate. Significant endoscopic lesions were found in 23.8% of the colonoscopies. Colonoscopies judged appropriate or uncertain yielded significantly more relevant lesions than did those judged to be inappropriate (25.6% vs. 17.4%; P = 0.007). Of 51 colon cancers, all but one were found in colonoscopies judged to be appropriate or uncertain. In a multivariate analysis, the diagnostic yield of colonoscopy was significantly influenced by appropriateness, patient gender and treatment setting.

Conclusions

The use of detailed and explicit appropriateness criteria for colonoscopy significantly enhances the identification of relevant lesions and in particular of colon cancer. The use of such criteria could therefore improve patient selection for colonoscopy and thus contribute to efforts aimed at enhancing the quality and efficiency of care.

### Healthcare resource utilization among patients receiving non-invasive testing for coronary artery disease in an outpatient setting: a cohort study reflecting daily practice trends [^7f82b273]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Accurate, early diagnosis and the initiation of appropriate treatment is central to reducing the clinical burden of coronary artery disease (CAD); however, real-world evidence characterizing healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) associated with testing for CAD is lacking.

Methods and Results

Using a non-interventional, retrospective, secondary database analysis, patients aged ≥ 18 years who underwent outpatient non-invasive cardiac diagnostic testing were identified. The primary objective was to gain an understanding of pre- and post-assessment care pathways and the associated interventions for patients who underwent non-invasive testing for CAD in either an outpatient or emergency department setting. Overall, chest pain was the primary reason for the index visit (54.8%), followed by shortness of breath (23.7%), myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery disease (CAD) or congestive heart failure (CHF) (3.8%), and other (46.8%); 3.0% of patients had no apparent reason for testing in the last 45 days. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was the dominant diagnostic testing modality (40.3%). During the 90-day follow-up, 7.3% (n = 22,083) of patients were diagnosed with CAD; among these patients, 19.4% had repeat diagnostic testing, 26.0% of patients had a revascularization procedure, and 65.6% underwent cardiac catheterization. These rates varied by testing modality.

Conclusions

In this study of a large real-world data sample, variability in the use of non-invasive tests and HCRU were evident. These results may assist efforts to optimize system-wide care/diagnostic pathways and value-based treatment decisions for patients.

### Morbidly obese patients – who undergoes bariatric surgery? [^44835caa]. Obesity Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Setting

The Public Healthcare System and Patient Rights

The Norwegian healthcare system is public and usually free of charge for individual patients. In 2004, the Ministry of Health and Care Services acknowledged morbid obesity as an increasingly serious public health problem and instructed the five Regional Health Authorities (RHAs) to provide morbidly obese patients with an appropriate treatment choice; either conservative or surgical. Recently released national guidelines conclude that treatment seeking morbidly obese subjects shall be offered a complete diagnostic workup and startup of therapy, either conservative or surgical, in an obesity clinic based on the multidisciplinary team model.

The Morbid Obesity Center

The MOC is a tertiary care center founded by the South-Eastern Norway RHA, which itself serves close to one million inhabitants in the southern part of Norway. The MOC has implemented the national guidelines referred to above.

Physicians at local hospitals may refer morbidly obese patients who have undergone repeated trials of unsuccessful weight loss. All patients who are referred to the MOC undergo a thorough (up to 6 months) assessment by a multidisciplinary team consisting of an internist, a dietician, a physiotherapist, and a trained "obesity" nurse. During the first visit, the internist establishes a detailed medical history, checks previous diagnostic workups, performs a physical examination, and briefly informs the patient of further investigations and treatment alternatives. At the second visit the doctor reiterates this message, providing complete information about the possible risks and benefits of an operation and also encouraging the patient to incorporate their own values and preferences in the decision-making process. If no contraindication against surgery exists the patient and the physician together agree upon the most appropriate choice of therapy; either surgical or conservative. We perform approximately 200 bariatric operations a year and 90% of these procedures are laparoscopic gastric bypasses. Patients who do not undergo surgery are offered a variety of individual or group-based conservative treatment options, either in our outpatient clinic or at various weight loss camps. These centers have implemented motivation guidance techniques in order to provide a comprehensive intervention program which will increase physical activity and fitness, normalize eating habits and induce a weight loss of at least 5–10% during the first year.

Data from the first consultation at the MOC was extracted from a prospective database on 524 patients enrolled consecutively between November 2005 and February 2007. In order to be included in the database all patients gave written informed consent. All patient records were reviewed within 21–36 months after the first consultation at the MOC in order to assess treatment choice.

### Use of shoulder imaging in the outpatient setting: a pilot study [^ede5815d]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Characterize the clinical utility of diagnostic shoulder imaging modalities commonly used in the outpatient workup of shoulder pain.

Materials/Methods

Retrospective review of adults imaged for outpatient shoulder pain from 1/1/2013 to 9/1/2015. To be categorized as "useful", a study had to meet one of the following criteria: change the clinical diagnosis or treatment plan, provide a final diagnosis, or guide definitive treatment. A utility score was assigned to each study based on the number of utility criteria met (range 0–4). A score of 1 was considered low utility; a score of greater than or equal to 2 was considered high utility. Statistical analysis included binary logistic regression and generalized estimating equations.

Results

210 subjects (65% male); mean age 47 (range 18–84), underwent 302 imaging studies (159 X-ray, 137 MRI, 2 CT, 4 ultrasound) during the study period. 92.1% of all studies met minimum criteria for utility (score > 1). Most commonly, diagnostic studies obtained during the outpatient workup of shoulder pain were found to guide definitive treatment (70.5%) or provide a final diagnosis (53%). Most X-rays were categorized as no or low utility (85.5%). 97.8% of the MRI studies were categorized as useful with most being high utility (73%). Overall, MRI was the most useful modality in all clinical scenarios (P = 0.002) and more likely to be high utility (P < 0.001) compared to X-rays. None of the investigated patient or injury characteristics were significant predictors of useful imaging.

Conclusion

Our study suggests that both radiographs and MRI are useful in the evaluation of adult unilateral shoulder pain in the outpatient setting. MRI appears to be the most useful imaging modality in terms of helping guide diagnosis and treatment selection. This serves as a potential first step towards the development of evidence based imaging algorithms that can be used and tested in future studies.

### Adult outpatients with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia or influenza: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^30bbc4e6]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Adult outpatients with acute cough — conclusions and practice suggestions emphasize that there should be an assessment of clinical symptoms and signs, and those suspected of having pneumonia should undergo chest radiography to improve diagnostic accuracy. Measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) levels strengthens both the diagnosis and exclusion of pneumonia, whereas there was no added benefit of measuring procalcitonin levels in this setting. Microbiological diagnostic testing should be considered when the results may indicate a change in therapy. For outpatient adults with acute cough, we suggest the use of empiric antibiotics when pneumonia is suspected based on epidemiologic and clinical features in settings in which imaging cannot be performed, but where there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, we do not suggest the routine use of antibiotics. There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations for or against specific nonantibiotic, symptomatic therapies. For suspected influenza, we suggest that initiating antiviral treatment within 48 hours of symptoms could be associated with decreased antibiotic use and hospitalization and improved outcomes.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on strategies and criteria for the diagnosis and management of Myocarditis: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^ace1723e]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway — scope, diagnostic framework, and management principles — states that the principal focus is on adults with acute myocarditis, provides new diagnostic criteria, and proposes a new 4-stage classification; management varies by severity, stage, and specific etiology, and identification of specific etiologies is important to allow prompt initiation of appropriate treatment strategies and supportive care. It emphasizes that timely referral of severe myocarditis patients to specialists and medical centers with advanced diagnostic and management capabilities such as transplant and mechanical circulatory support is critically important, and defines indications for referral to allow timely consideration of advanced therapies in high-risk patients. Surveillance strategy, monitoring for recovery, and recommended activity restrictions vary according to severity of presentation, specific etiology, comorbidities, and clinical trajectory, and the document addresses indications for surveillance of recovery and guidance for return to activity. The document also notes that health insurance coverage may not include repeat imaging and/or testing following myocarditis diagnosis or initial testing with advanced imaging in the outpatient setting, even though patients may require repeat diagnostic evaluation to ascertain resolution of previously documented cardiac abnormalities, to define prognosis, and/or for consideration of additional therapies such as guideline-directed management of cardiomyopathy or HF should they develop cardiac dysfunction.

### Challenges of making a diagnosis in the outpatient setting: a multi-site survey of primary care physicians [^51561508]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2012). Medium credibility.

Background

Although misdiagnosis in the outpatient setting leads to significant patient harm and wasted resources, it is not well studied. The authors surveyed primary care physicians (PCPs) about barriers to timely diagnosis in the outpatient setting and assessed their perceptions of diagnostic difficulty.

Methods

Surveys of PCPs practicing in an integrated health system across 10 geographically dispersed states in 2005. The survey elicited information on key cognitive failures (including in clinical knowledge or judgement) for a specific case, and solicited strategies for reducing diagnostic delays. Content analysis was used to categorise cognitive failures and strategies for improvement. The authors examined the extent and predictors of diagnostic difficulty, defined as reporting > 5% patients difficult to diagnose.

Results

Of 1817 physicians surveyed, 1054 (58%) responded; 848 (80%) respondents primarily practiced in outpatient settings and had an assigned patient panel (inclusion sample). Inadequate knowledge (19.9%) was the most commonly reported cognitive factor. Half reported > 5% of their patients were difficult to diagnose; more experienced physicians reported less diagnostic difficulty. In adjusted analyses, problems with information processing (information availability and time to review it) and the referral process were associated with greater diagnostic difficulty. Strategies for improvement most commonly involved workload issues (panel size, non-visit tasks).

Conclusions

PCPs report a variety of reasons for diagnostic difficulties in primary care practice. In this study, knowledge gaps appear to be a prominent concern. Interventions that address these gaps as well as practice level issues such as time to process diagnostic information and better subspecialty input may reduce diagnostic difficulties in primary care.

### How I approach bleeding in hospitalized patients [^f9b771fb]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Acquired bleeding disorders, although rare, can have remarkably severe presentations necessitating hospitalization. Acquired VWD can be associated with lymphoproliferative disorders, severe cardiac/valvular disease, and the use of supportive devices such as a left ventricular assist device and can present with severe bleeding. The incidence of acquired hemophilia increases with age, and although an underlying cause is not determined in approximately half of the patients, it can be associated with autoimmune disorders, malignancy, infection, or pregnancy (usually post partum) and can present with substantial soft tissue or gastrointestinal bleeding.

When assessing a patient who is bleeding, in either the inpatient or outpatient setting, the single most important tool is having a comprehensive bleeding history, which may be best accomplished via a standardized tool, such as the ISTH-Bleeding Assessment Tool. Important factors include any prior history of bleeding, any family history of bleeding, and the type and location of bleeding. Distinguishing between lifelong symptoms, which may have previously gone unrecognized, and truly new symptoms is paramount. Attention to other diagnoses, which may predispose or increase a patient's risk for acquired disorders is also critical.

Laboratory assessments are essential (Figure 1) but must be driven by the use of the bleeding history data. Notably, useful and important assays, such as platelet aggregation studies, may not be available locally and may not be valid in a patient who is ill and hospitalized and receiving multiple medications, adding to the challenge of making a diagnosis. Such testing must be done off medications known to interfere with platelet function and, typically, must be scheduled in the outpatient setting. Often, a patient who is first noted to have bleeding in the inpatient setting ultimately requires finalization of the workup in the outpatient setting, after the initial bleed is controlled.

Figure 1.
Algorithm for evaluation of an adult inpatient with excessive or unexpected bleeding. The first step in evaluation is determining whether bleeding symptoms are new developments. The differential diagnosis is further narrowed, and diagnosis is ultimately made based upon the results of laboratory testing. Congenital disorders are designated in red, and acquired disorders in green. DOAC, direct oral anticoagulant; CBC, complete blood count.

### The hospitalized patient with interstitial lung disease: a hospitalist primer [^6fed4f12]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a diverse group of disorders typically with insidious onset. Diagnosis and management largely occur in the outpatient setting; however, ILD can present acutely necessitating hospitalization. Effective inpatient management requires the clinician to establish an accurate diagnosis and understand the natural history and treatment responsiveness of each ILD subtype. We propose a general framework for approaching the evaluation of hospitalized patients with ILD, and provide focused guidance on key inpatient diagnostic and management decisions.

### The impact of a standardized pre-visit laboratory testing panel in the internal medicine outpatient clinic: a controlled "On-off" trial [^d3098520]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In several settings, a shorter time to diagnosis has been shown to lead to improved clinical outcomes. The implementation of a rapid laboratory testing allows for a pre-visit testing in the outpatient clinic, meaning that test results are available during the first outpatient visit.

Objective

To determine whether the pre-visit laboratory testing leads to a shorter time to diagnosis in the general internal medicine outpatient clinic.

Design

An "on-off" trial, allocating subjects to one of two treatment arms in consecutive alternating blocks.

Participants

All new referrals to the internal medicine outpatient clinic of a university hospital were included, excluding second opinions. A total of 595 patients were eligible; one person declined to participate, leaving data from 594 patients for analysis.

Intervention

In the intervention group, patients had a standardized pre-visit laboratory testing before the first visit.

Main Measures

The primary outcome was the time to diagnosis. Secondary outcomes were the correctness of the preliminary diagnosis on the first day, health care utilization, and patient and physician satisfaction.

Key Results

There was no difference in time to diagnosis between the two groups (median 35 days vs 35 days; hazard ratio 1.03 [0.87–1.22]; p = .71). The pre-visit testing group had higher proportions of both correct preliminary diagnoses on day 1 (24% vs 14%; p = .003) and diagnostic workups being completed on day 1 (10% vs 3%; p < .001). The intervention group had more laboratory tests done (50.0 [interquartile range (IQR) 39.0–69.0] vs 43.0 [IQR 31.0–68.5]; p < .001). Otherwise, there were no differences between the groups.

Conclusions

Pre-visit testing did not lead to a shorter overall time to diagnosis. However, a greater proportion of patients had a correct diagnosis on the first day. Further studies should focus on customizing pre-visit laboratory panels, to improve their efficacy.

### The impact of a standardized pre-visit laboratory testing panel in the internal medicine outpatient clinic: a controlled "On-off" trial [^3c799d50]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In our single-center on-off study, performing a standardized laboratory test panel prior to the first visit to the outpatient clinic did not result in a shorter overall time to diagnosis. However, it did increase the chance of obtaining a final diagnosis during the first visit. The number needed to test in order to finish the diagnostic process on the first day was 15. In our questionnaire, the vast majority of patients preferred receiving their diagnosis on the first day, and at the same time did not object to having more laboratory tests done than necessary.

Ordering standardized laboratory panels is in sharp contrast with advice from several guidelines, including Choosing Wisely recommendations, because of potential overutilization. Overutilization leads to increased costs, as well as potentially more false positive test results.

In this study, patients in the intervention group on average had 7 more laboratory tests performed during the diagnostic process. No other differences in health care utilization were found, which implies that the excess laboratory tests did not lead to significant downstream overutilization.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the effect of the pre-visit laboratory testing on the diagnostic process in the outpatient setting has been studied.

Several possible explanations for the study's negative result can be proposed. First of all, laboratory testing may not be as important for establishing a diagnosis as previously hypothesized. This might be especially true in the setting of a tertiary hospital, which typically has a more complex case mix that requires a more extensive diagnostic workup. This might also explain why the pre-visit testing would have an effect on the number of correct diagnoses on the first day, as in these cases typically no additional diagnostic tests were performed. It might also be argued that the laboratory testing already performed by the referring physician negated the effect of the pre-visit testing, although in that case one would have expected to see an effect in the subgroup without pre-referral testing.

Disposition after initial evaluation — hospital evaluation and treatment "are recommended" for patients with syncope who have a serious medical condition potentially relevant to the cause identified during initial evaluation. It is reasonable to manage patients with presumptive reflex-mediated syncope in the outpatient setting "in the absence of serious medical conditions." In intermediate-risk patients with an unclear cause of syncope, use of a structured emergency department observation protocol "can be effective in reducing hospital admission." It may be reasonable to manage selected patients with suspected cardiac syncope in the outpatient setting "in the absence of serious medical conditions."

### Emergency department use prior to cancer diagnosis and mortality [^a8be557e]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

It is imperative to understand ED use during the diagnostic phase of the cancer trajectory, particularly because of the worse outcomes among patients with ED involvement in cancer diagnosis seen in our study and other studies. While some ED use during the diagnostic phase of cancer may be unavoidable, there are other visits that may be preventable and associated with poor access to care in other ambulatory settings. Delamare Fauvel et aldescribed 3 ways that the ED may play a role in cancer diagnosis: (1) incidental findings of suspected cancer for unrelated complaints, (2) presentation of cancer with acute signs and symptoms requiring emergency care, and (3) acceleration of a cancer diagnosis and further care. In Europe, diagnosis of cancer through the ED is an indicator of diagnostic quality. Therefore, improved access to ambulatory health care, such as primary care, specialist care, and imaging along with ensuring uptake of cancer screening programs is needed to reduce reliance on EDs during diagnosis. The ED is often not the ideal environment to facilitate further cancer workup, given the lack of care continuity, variable management of patients, and the chaotic environment of this setting. Therefore, solutions to reduce the need for ED use during diagnosis are needed.

Given the large proportion of patients who use the ED prior to cancer diagnosis and their worse outcomes, ensuring timely access to follow-up care from the ED to confirm a cancer diagnosis is needed. A recent study reported considerable variation in patient management after an ED visit where cancer is suspected, which is often dependent on local resources available at the hospital or in the community the patient is seen and the type of cancer the patient may have. Qualitative work shows that emergency physicians often find it challenging to determine the appropriate next steps for ensuring timely workup for patients with suspected cancer (personal communication with C. Moore, MSc, email, November 2024). Therefore, system-level solutions are needed to provide equitable and timely access to further cancer workup for patients seen in the ED with suspected cancer diagnosis. These solutions may include rapid diagnostic clinics, which exist for some types of cancer but are not widely available; central intake for referrals; and navigation from the ED. The diagnostic phase of the cancer trajectory has been described as anxiety provoking with many unknowns for patients, including when they will be seen, what treatment will entail, and prognosis. Ensuring patients have access to timely and reliable workup from the ED along with clear information about next steps may help reduce some of these unknowns from the ED during this period.

Pulmonary embolism workup — D-dimer is used in suspected pulmonary embolism; its sensitivity is much greater than specificity and positive predictive value is poor, so its primary value is rapid identification of patients with low probability of pulmonary embolism in outpatient settings, while its negative predictive value is poor in hospitalized patients, especially after several days or in patients older than 60 years of age.

### Imaging of pelvic venous disorders (PeVD); should every patient get an MRI? [^91a66891]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Pelvic venous disease (PeVD) is part of the broad differential diagnosis of chronic pelvic pain with a challenging diagnosis and clinical workup to identify those patients that are most likely to benefit from intervention. Ultrasound, MRI, CT, venography, and intravascular ultrasound can all provide information to aid in the diagnostic algorithm. The purpose of this article is to review imaging as a component of the outpatient workup of patients with chronic pelvic pain to guide appropriate understanding and use of imaging modalities to accurately identify patients suffering from PeVD. A favored approach is to begin with transabdominal sonography with selective use of MRI/MRV in specific patient populations.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Appropriate use criteria for outpatient pediatric transthoracic echocardiography — application principles: The test is performed and interpreted by qualified individual(s) in a facility that is in compliance with national standards for performing pediatric echocardiograms, and AUC is one aspect of quality for imaging procedures occurring at the time of patient selection with several additional factors that should be addressed to support high-quality results; the range of potential indications for echocardiography is quite large and indications are, at times, purposefully broad to cover an array of cardiovascular signs and symptoms and to account for the ordering physician's best judgment, with the expectation that a qualified clinician has obtained a complete clinical history and performed the physical examination so that the clinical status of the patient can be assumed to be valid as stated in the indication; when electrocardiography is referenced, the term abnormal ECG refers to only clinically pertinent ECG findings and criteria for abnormal ECG will be based upon standard published ECG normal values in pediatric patients; if the reason for a test can be assigned to more than one indication, it is classified under the most clinically significant indication, and the term family history in this document refers to first-degree relatives only; cost is considered implicitly and clinical benefits should always be considered first, costs should be considered in relationship to these benefits, and a procedure with moderate clinical efficacy should not be scored as more appropriate than a procedure with high clinical efficacy solely due to its lower cost, although when scientific evidence exists to support clinical benefit, cost efficiency and cost effectiveness should be considered for any indication; for each indication, the rating reflects whether the echocardiogram is reasonable for the patient according to the appropriate use definition, not whether the test is preferred over another modality, and the level of appropriateness also does not consider issues of local availability or skill; the category of May Be Appropriate is used when insufficient data are available or when there is substantial disagreement, and the designation May Be Appropriate should not be used as grounds for denial of reimbursement; this manuscript does not address whether a cardiology consultation is required prior to the echocardiogram unless specified in the indication.

Adult outpatients with acute cough — antibiotic use and imaging constraints: For outpatient adults with acute cough, we suggest the use of empiric antibiotics as per local and national guidelines when pneumonia is suspected in settings where imaging cannot be obtained (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For outpatient adults with acute cough and no clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia (eg, when vital signs and lung exams are normal) we do not suggest the routine use of antibiotics (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). In most settings, the radiographic evidence would be lack of consolidation on a chest radiograph.

Pediatric transthoracic echocardiography AUC — indication categories and common referrals state that indications were finalized after incorporating suggestions by external reviewers, rated independently by the panel, and the median score for each indication became the final rating. In general, indications rated as Appropriate included evaluation of new cardiac symptoms or clinical scenarios known to be associated with congenital or acquired heart disease in the pediatric population; Rarely Appropriate indications clustered around broad systemic diseases and family history of conditions not known to be associated with structural or functional abnormalities detectable by echocardiography; and scenarios rated as May Be Appropriate involved uncertainty or required additional clinical information. In the pediatric outpatient setting, chest pain, syncope and murmur are common reasons for referral; the document presumes clinicians determine whether a murmur is innocent before considering echocardiography, and echocardiographic screening for presumably or clearly innocent murmur has been rated as Rarely Appropriate.

### Standard outpatient re-evaluation for patients not admitted to the hospital after emergency department evaluation for acute abdominal pain [^318f658e]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

Patients presenting with acute abdominal pain at the ED need to be diagnosed correctly and treated accordingly. As the majority of patients will have self-limiting pathology not requiring surgical intervention, most will not require an admission to the hospital. Patients with abdominal pathology requiring surgical treatment, however, should not be missed. To diagnose patients with abdominal pain, many diagnostic modalities can be used to complement the "basic" clinical evaluation of patient history, physical examination, and blood and urine analysis. Diagnostic measures such as US, CT, laparoscopy, and clinical observation have all been reported in the literature. Ultrasound, for example, can assist in the diagnosis of many gastrointestinal causes of acute abdominal pain, and its routine use by surgeons for such patients has been shown to increase diagnostic accuracy. Computer tomography has also been reported to increase diagnostic accuracy and reduce hospital admissions by 24%, and it is said to be the best predictor of the need for an urgent intervention. The use of cross-sectional imaging for all patients presenting with acute abdominal pain, however, is costly, time consuming, and, in the case of CT, exposes patients to ionizing radiation. The last issue is important as the growing use of CT is steadily increasing the collective dose of medical radiation to which patient populations are subjected. Even though the cancer risk from an abdominal CT is small for the individual, the increasing use of the modality may create a future health concern, especially for children. The indications for ordering a CT should therefore always be carefully scrutinized by medical personnel, especially when other diagnostic modalities can attain similar results.

### Cardiac workup of ischemic stroke: can we improve our diagnostic yield? [^22ff364e]. Stroke (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Discovering potential cardiac sources of stroke is an important part of the urgent evaluation of the ischemic stroke patient as it often impacts treatment decisions that are essential for determining secondary stroke prevention strategies, yet the optimal approach to the cardiac workup of an ischemic stroke patient is not known.

Methods

A review of the literature concerning the utility of cardiac rhythm monitoring (ECG, telemetry, Holter monitors, and event recorders) and structural imaging (transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography) was performed.

Results

Data supporting a definitive, optimal, and cost-effective approach are lacking, though some data suggest that appropriate patient selection can improve the diagnostic and therapeutic yield of rhythm monitoring and echocardiography in the evaluation of stroke etiology.

Conclusions

Based on available data, an algorithmic approach for the evaluation of patients with acute ischemic cerebrovascular events that takes into account therapeutic and diagnostic yield as well as cost-efficiency is proposed.

Remarks add that clinicians may discharge patients on the same NIV settings used during hospitalization, the panel could not recommend empiric settings for NIV, in settings where NIV is not available discharging patients on auto-PAP is preferable to no PAP, and discharge on NIV or auto-PAP should not substitute for arranging an outpatient sleep study to appropriately titrate PAP therapy.

### Evaluating acute image ordering for real-world patient cases via language model alignment with radiological guidelines [^e9e57d6b]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ordering diagnostic imaging studies is an increasingly common task in the emergency department (ED) and other acute-care settings, and is associated with high cognitive burden for clinicians –. While diagnostic imaging can play a crucial role in the acute workup of patients, ordering imaging studies with limited clinical utility has raised concerns regarding resource utilization, radiation exposure, and financial burden to both patients and healthcare systems –. Recent estimates suggest that up to 30% of diagnostic imaging studies ordered in the ED setting could be replaced with more appropriate alternatives at the time the order was placed.

Multiple factors contribute to the challenge of ordering appropriate and clinically indicated imaging studies. Importantly, emergency medicine physicians often need to make rapid diagnostic decisions with limited clinical context while simultaneously managing high patient volumes and complex patient presentations. Furthermore, there is considerable variability between healthcare providers in imaging ordering patterns: recent studies have documented significant differences in the utilization rates of different imaging studies between individual emergency physicians, suggesting that factors beyond strict clinical necessity influence imaging decisions –.

To help clinicians make more informed, evidence-based decisions in image ordering and simultaneously address inter-provider variability in imaging practices, the American College of Radiology (ACR) released the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® (ACR AC), which are a set of evidence-based guidelines that assist referring physicians in ordering the most appropriate diagnostic imaging studies for specific clinical conditions. As of June 2024, the ACR AC contains 224 unique imaging topics (i.e. patient scenarios).

However, despite the widespread availability of the ACR AC, low utilization of these guidelines remains a challenge in many emergency departments and inpatient settings. Bautista et al. showed that there is low utilization of the ACR AC by clinicians in practice: less than 1% of physicians interviewed in their study use the ACR AC as a first-line resource when ordering diagnostic imaging studies. The limited usage of the ACR AC may be partly due to how the Appropriateness Criteria are made accessible to clinicians; the evidence-based criteria are dense and can be difficult to interpret even for physician experts — especially in acute healthcare settings such as the emergency department where decision making is both time-sensitive and critical.

### ACC / AAP / AHA / ASE / HRS / SCAI / SCCT / SCMR / SOPE 2014 appropriate use criteria for initial transthoracic echocardiography in outpatient pediatric cardiology: a report of the American college of cardiology appropriate use criteria task force, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Heart Association, American Society of Echocardiography, Heart Rhythm Society, Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography, Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance, and society of pediatric echocardiography [^9078117e]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Pediatric transthoracic echocardiography appropriate use criteria (AUC) — indications for murmurs, chest pain, and syncope are as follows: Pathologic murmurs and presumably innocent murmurs with other signs, symptoms or findings of cardiovascular disease were found to be Appropriate for an echocardiogram. In pediatrics, chest pain and syncope are generally benign and echocardiography has been shown to be low-yield; specifically, syncope with no other symptoms or signs of cardiac disease has been rated as Appropriate in the adult AUC, but rated as Rarely Appropriate for pediatric patients, albeit with additional qualifiers of a benign family history and a normal ECG. Use of echocardiography as a primary screen versus after pediatric cardiology consultation depends on many factors and needs to be given due consideration on a case-by-case basis, and if more than one indication could apply, clinicians need to use their judgment in picking the scenario that most closely fits the individual patient.

### Pediatric appropriate use criteria implementation project: a multicenter outpatient echocardiography quality initiative [^8356111d]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Recently published appropriate use criteria (AUC) for initial pediatric outpatient transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) have not yet been evaluated for clinical applicability.

Objectives

This study sought to determine the appropriateness of TTE as currently performed in pediatric cardiology clinics, diagnostic yield of TTE for various AUC indications, and any gaps in the AUC document.

Methods

Data were prospectively collected from patients undergoing initial outpatient TTE in 6 centers. TTE indications (appropriate [A], may be appropriate [M], or rarely appropriate [R]) and findings (normal, incidental, or abnormal) were recorded.

Results

Of the 2,655 studies ordered by 102 physicians, indications rated A, M, and R were found in 1,876 (71%), 316 (12%), and 319 studies (12%), respectively, and 144 studies (5%) were unclassifiable. Twenty-four of 113 indications (21%) were not used. Innocent murmur and syncope or palpitations with no other indications of cardiovascular disease, a benign family history, and normal electrocardiogram accounted for 75% of indications rated R. Pathologic murmur had the highest yield of abnormal findings (40%). Odds of an abnormal finding in an A or M TTE were 6 times that of R (95% confidence interval [CI]: [2.8 to 12.8]). Abnormal findings were more common in patients < 1 year of age than in those > 10 years of age (odds ratio: 6.4; 95% CI: 4.7 to 8.7). Age was a significant predictor of an abnormal finding after adjusting for indication and site (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Most TTEs ordered in pediatric cardiology clinics were for indications rated A. AUC ratings successfully stratified indications based on the yield of abnormal findings. This study identified differences in the yield of TTE based on patient age and most common indications rated R. These findings should inform quality improvement efforts and future revisions of the AUC document.

### Management of patients with unexplained syncope: derivation and validation of a simplified 2-step diagnostic approach [^a8d604d2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Cardiac syncope is correlated with a poor long‐term prognosis and may be associated with increased risk of sudden cardiac‐arrhythmic death. Implantation of a permanent pacemaker or a defibrillator is a therapeutic option in the management of patients with unexplained syncope., Indeed, there are different levels of recommendations according to the underlying pathophysiologic substrate (atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or sustained supraventricular/ventricular arrhythmia), which can be unmasked during an electrophysiology study (EPS). An implantable loop recorder (ILR) strategy with recognized value in the detection of hidden pathogenetic mechanisms of unexplained syncope is gaining popularity. Nevertheless, despite the high diagnostic yield of ILR, concerns have been raised regarding the prolonged time interval that might be required to identify the cause of syncope and thus the potential clinical risks associated with syncope recurrence, especially in patients with high‐risk ECG features.

European Society of Cardiology Syncope Guidelines and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines along with the Heart Rhythm Society recommend that an EPS may be performed in patients with syncope (with a different class of recommendation and level of evidence) depending on the special pathophysiologic substrate. In addition, the latest European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the prevention of sudden cardiac death recommend EPS in patients with syncope and previous ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), when syncope remains unexplained after noninvasive evaluation (class I recommendation, level of evidence C). Previous studies have reported substantial costs and time‐consuming diagnostic procedures for the evaluation of syncope and have suggested the adoption of a more systematic patient care pathway.

Therefore, the aim of this derivation and validation cohort study was to develop a structured 2‐step approach to be used as a short outpatient workup to identify a subgroup of patients with unexplained syncope who will benefit from permanent pacemaker/implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator (ICD).

### Appropriateness of colonoscopy in the era of colorectal cancer screening: a prospective, multicenter study in a private-practice setting (Berlin colonoscopy project 1, BECOP 1) [^0c9e9102]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

The introduction of reimbursement for screening colonoscopy in Germany more than one year ago raised concerns that the consequent workload might lead to underuse of diagnostic colonoscopy for symptomatic patients. Available appropriateness criteria for diagnostic colonoscopy have been rarely tested in a realistic outpatient setting. This study was designed to test current appropriateness criteria for diagnostic colonoscopy to better select patients and potentially provide more capacity for screening cases. Secondary goals were yield and quality control in both the diagnostic and screening cases.

Methods

A prospective study was initiated in 39 private-practice offices to collect data on consecutive colonoscopies conducted during a 6-day study period. A detailed questionnaire was developed to define indications and symptoms, and all findings at colonoscopy were recorded. Colonoscopies were further analyzed and stratified into a screening and a diagnostic group. In the diagnostic group, indications were assessed according to the current guidelines for appropriateness (American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, European Panel for the Appropriateness of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy), and the results were correlated with the percentage of relevant findings (tumors, inflammatory conditions).

Results

During the study period, 1,397 colonoscopies (57 percent screening, 43 percent diagnostic) were analyzed (male/female ratio = 39/61 percent; mean age, 61 years). Fourteen percent and 37 percent, respectively, of the 605 diagnostic colonoscopies were regarded as inappropriate relative to the criteria of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the European Panel for the Appropriateness of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. However, the percentage of relevant inflammatory and neoplastic findings (polyps, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, benign strictures) was only 5 to 10 percent higher in the appropriate group than in the inappropriate group. On the basis of these data, a hypothetical model for selecting appropriate indications was developed: if patients older than aged 50 years with pain, bleeding, and diarrhea, but not constipation, are regarded as having an appropriate indication, such an approach would save 20 percent of colonoscopies in these main indication groups (bleeding, pain, diarrhea, constipation), with a hypothetical miss rate for relevant findings (as defined above) of 5 percent.

Conclusions

Currently used appropriateness criteria for diagnostic colonoscopy increase the yield of relevant findings but lead to a miss rate for relevant findings in the range of 10 to 15 percent. Simple selection criteria based on age and symptoms could be more suitable and should be tested in a larger group of patients.

### Primary angle-closure disease preferred practice pattern ® [^467d7c9f]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Provider and setting guidance notes that certain diagnostic procedures (e.g., tonometry, perimetry, pachymetry, anterior segment imaging, optic disc imaging, and photography) may be delegated to appropriately trained and supervised personnel, whereas interpretation of results and medical and surgical management require the ophthalmologist's medical training, clinical judgment, and experience. Most diagnostic and therapeutic procedures can be undertaken safely on an outpatient basis, but hospitalization may be indicated for intensive treatment of an AACC so patients can be monitored closely after surgical procedures associated with a high risk of serious short-term postoperative complications, and may also be indicated for surgical complications or special medical or social needs.

Adult outpatients with acute cough — areas for future research include auditing implementation of the proposed suggestions to assess feasibility and cost-effectiveness, developing improved diagnostic algorithms to confirm or refute whether acute cough is due to pneumonia or influenza, conducting randomized controlled trials of pathogen-directed treatment versus standard therapy to determine whether personalizing antibiotic therapy will lead to clinical recovery and narrow the spectrum of antibiotic therapy used, and performing trials to assess nonantibiotic, symptomatic therapies for acute cough due to pneumonia.

### Penicillin allergy testing is cost-saving: an economic evaluation study [^e0cd8538]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Having a penicillin allergy label is associated with the use of less appropriate and more expensive antibiotics and increased healthcare utilization. Penicillin allergy testing results in delabeling most allergy claimants and may be cost-saving. This study aimed to project whether penicillin allergy testing in patients reporting a penicillin allergy is cost-saving.

Methods

In this economic evaluation study, we built decision models to project the economic impact of 2 strategies for a patient with a penicillin allergy label: (1) perform diagnostic testing (drug challenges, with or without skin tests); and (2) do not perform diagnostic testing. The health service perspective was adopted, considering costs with penicillin allergy tests, and with hospital bed-days/outpatient visits, antibiotic use, and diagnostic testing. Twenty-four base case decision models were built, accounting for differences in the diagnostic workup, setting (inpatient vs outpatient) and geographic region. Uncertainty was explored via probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

Results

Penicillin allergy testing was cost-saving in all decision models built. For models assessing the performance of both skin tests and drug challenges, allergy testing resulted in average savings (in United States [US] dollars) of $657 for inpatients (US: $1444; Europe: $489) and $2746 for outpatients (US: $256; Europe: $6045). 75% of simulations obtained through probabilistic sensitivity analysis identified testing as the less costly option.

Conclusions

Penicillin allergy testing was projected to be cost-saving across different scenarios. These results are devised to inform guidelines, supporting the adoption of policies promoting widespread testing of patients with a penicillin allergy label.

### Creation and implementation of an outpatient pathway for atrial fibrillation in the emergency department setting: results of an expert panel [^12e0336a]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation and flutter (AF) is a common condition among emergency department (ED) patients in the United States. Traditionally, ED care for primary complaints related to AF focus on rate control, and patients are often admitted to an inpatient setting for further care. Inpatient care may include further telemetry monitoring and diagnostic testing, rhythm control, a search for identification of AF etiology, and stroke prophylaxis. However, many patients are eligible for safe and effective outpatient management pathways. They are widely used in Canada and other countries but less widely adopted in the United States. In this project, we convened an expert panel to create a practical framework for the process of creating, implementing, and maintaining an outpatient AF pathway for emergency physicians to assess and treat AF patients, safely reduce hospitalization rates, ensure appropriate stroke prophylaxis, and effectively transition patients to longitudinal outpatient treatment settings from the ED and/or observation unit. To support local pathway creation, the panel also reached agreement on a protocol development plan, a sample pathway, consensus recommendations for pathway components, sample pathway metrics, and a structured literature review framework using a modified Delphi technique by a technical expert panel of emergency medicine, cardiology, and other stakeholder groups.

### Appropriate use of point-of-care ultrasonography in patients with acute dyspnea in emergency department or inpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^950f5359]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Values and preferences and public input — evidence sources, panel composition, and prevalence estimation: the review team "searched several databases (MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science) and other sources to identify published studies on values and preferences about the use of POCUS." The development process "included perspectives, values, and preferences of 2 CGC members who represent the public and a 7-member CGC Public Panel, who rated outcomes, provided input on preferences among the intervention options via a direct-choice exercise, and provided comments on the draft guideline and recommendations." For modeling diagnostic impacts, "The CGC and technical expert panel members also estimated the typical prevalence of each specific disease in patients with acute dyspnea and low, medium, or high pretest probability for the disease," and "This information was used to calculate the number of false-positive and false-negative test results from POCUS for each indication of interest."

### Care of the patient with abnormal kidney test results [^d2c09b14]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Blood and urine tests are commonly performed by clinicians in both ambulatory and hospital settings that detect chronic and acute kidney disease. Thresholds for these tests have been established that signal the presence and severity of kidney injury or dysfunction. In the appropriate clinical context of a patient's history and physical examination, an abnormal test result should trigger specific actions for clinicians, including reviewing patient medication use, follow-up testing, prescribing lifestyle modifications, and specialist referral. Tests for kidney disease can also be used to determine the future risk for kidney failure as well as cardiovascular death.

### Clinician-patient communication during the diagnostic workup: the ABIDE project [^b1051e69]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2019). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

This observational clinical-encounter study shows that, overall, clinicians inform their patients about (results of) diagnostic testing. Yet, they show limited behavior to promote understanding of the provided information and to engage patients/caregivers in decisions regarding diagnostic testing. Involving patients more explicitly by means of shared decision-making could benefit the quality of care provided in memory clinics because it allows clinicians to attune the diagnostic workup to the individual patient. Shared decision-making would thus enable a personalized approach to diagnostic care, allowing patients and caregivers to be more actively involved in (future) treatment decisions, health care and disease management.

Research in context

1 Systematic review: The authors reviewed existing literature to find studies relevant to clinician-patient communication and patient engagement in the memory clinic setting. Most studies collected self-reported data using a focus-group or survey approach. These publications are appropriately cited. Yet, empirical data on actual clinician-patient communication during diagnostic care at memory clinics are scarce.
2 Interpretation: Our findings are consistent with the previously published work, and confirm that a two-way flow of information about diagnostic testing is seldom achieved. Clinicians often inform their patients. Yet, they show limited behavior to promote understanding and involve patients/caregivers in the decision-making process. Of note, patients/caregivers seldom express their preferences in the interaction with their clinician.
3 Future directions: Future research should explore ways to improve knowledgeable participation of patients/caregivers during the diagnostic workup for dementia, for example, by developing clinician- and patient/caregiver-targeted interventions that facilitate involvement of patient/caregivers during consultations and shared decision-making about diagnostic testing.

### Indications for outpatient antenatal fetal surveillance: ACOG committee opinion, number 828 [^853773bf]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion 828 — indications and thresholds for outpatient antenatal fetal surveillance — offers guidance about indications for and timing and frequency of antenatal fetal surveillance in the outpatient setting. Antenatal fetal surveillance is performed to reduce the risk of stillbirth. The Committee provides guidance on and suggests surveillance for conditions for which stillbirth is reported to occur more frequently than 0.8 per 1,000 and which are associated with a relative risk or odds ratio for stillbirth of more than 2.0 compared with pregnancies without the condition. Table 1 presents suggestions for the timing and frequency of testing for specific conditions, and shared decision making between the pregnant individual and the clinician is critically important. The guidance should be construed only as suggestions and not as mandates or as all encompassing, and individualization about if and when to offer antenatal fetal surveillance is advised.

### The impact of a standardized pre-visit laboratory testing panel in the internal medicine outpatient clinic: a controlled "On-off" trial [^ea9cf800]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

A shorter time to diagnosis has been shown to lead to improved clinical outcomes in some, but not all health care settings. – Given that the majority of medical decisions rely on a laboratory testing, speeding up access to laboratory results may lead to earlier diagnoses. For instance, faster turnaround times of microbiology tests have been shown to lead to faster initiation of adequate antibiotic therapy and shorter inpatient length of stay.

One way to speed up the diagnostic process is through a pre-visit laboratory testing, in which patients have the laboratory testing done directly prior to their doctor's appointment, and the tests are performed with a short turnaround time at a routine clinical laboratory. By necessity, the pre-visit testing makes use of standardized laboratory test panels, as the patient has not been examined yet so the information from the history and physical examination is not yet available to guide the selection of laboratory tests. Standardized laboratory panels invariably include unnecessary tests, which potentially lead to downstream overutilization.

In the Netherlands, the pre-visit testing is not the currently standard practice in the outpatient clinic, due to the often long turnaround times in the laboratory.

In 2014, the Central Diagnostic Laboratory of the University Medical Centre Utrecht (UMC Utrecht) introduced a rapid testing for a broad panel of routine laboratory tests for clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and endocrinology. This service guarantees that the results of these tests are available within 60 min after the sample arrives at the laboratory. This rapid testing enables the implementation of the pre-visit testing in the outpatient clinic, making the test results available to the treating physician at the time of the visit, as opposed to usual care, in which the treating physician orders laboratory tests during the visit and the test results are only available afterwards, so the patient has to return for another visit.

Consequently, this "on-off" trial was set up to evaluate whether the pre-visit laboratory testing benefits the patient and physician alike, shortening the time to diagnosis in newly referred outpatients, and to evaluate the downstream consequences of potential overutilization.

### Screening tools for malignancy in patients with cryptogenic stroke: systematic review [^6ed991eb]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

If the clinician makes the decision to screen a cryptogenic ischemic stroke patient with high suspect for occult malignancy or also an ischemic stroke with an apparent determined etiology but with high specific malignancy markers, the screening should be guided by the international recommendations for each cancer type. The proposed flowchart offers several advantages over existing scores, primarily due to its simplicity, comprehensiveness, and clinical practicality. Furthermore, it provides a general risk stratification and guidance on how to proceed with the results. The diagnostic timing may depend upon the risk stratification (high vs moderate suspicion). We suggest performing a diagnostic workup during the initial etiology assessment in patients with high suspicion of occult malignancy (see Figure 2). A malignancy screening in these patients could include a low-dose lung CT to screen for lung cancer, a FOB test to screen for colorectal cancer, and a gynecological examination or PSA measurement to screen for breast and other common gynecological cancer types or prostate cancer according to the biological sex of the patient. If one of these test results is positive further diagnostic is required. If a body CT is chosen for logistic reasons as primary screening method in patients with high suspicion of cancer related ischemic stroke, at least a FOB test should be included for screening of colorectal cancer due to the insufficient sensitivity of body CT to detect this most prevalent type of cancer among malignancy associated ischemic strokes. If the initial screening results inconclusive in the first diagnostic assessment but high predictive factors for malignancy are present, a regular follow-up in the outpatient setting should be guaranteed and should comprise all tests to cover the most prevalent cancer types which include gastrointestinal, lung, prostate, and breast cancer as recommended by respective guidelines, especially in the first year after index stroke. In the case of moderate suspicion and intermediate risk, a timely screening diagnostic in the outpatient setting should be recommended, but an immediate assessment seems to be not necessary. Cryptogenic ischemic stroke patients without markers for occult malignancy do not require a malignancy screening and other etiologies such as atrial fibrillation should be repeatedly assessed in the outpatient setting, especially in patients > 75 years in whom the risk for atrial fibrillation is higher.

### Outpatient approach to palpitations [^7d8b5b24]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Palpitations are a common problem seen in family medicine; most are of cardiac origin, although an underlying psychiatric disorder, such as anxiety, is also common. Even if a psychiatric comorbidity does exist, it should not be assumed that palpitations are of a noncardiac etiology. Discerning cardiac from noncardiac causes is important given the potential risk of sudden death in those with an underlying cardiac etiology. History and physical examination followed by targeted diagnostic testing are necessary to distinguish a cardiac cause from other causes of palpitations. Standard 12-lead electrocardiography is an essential initial diagnostic test. Cardiac imaging is recommended if history, physical examination, or electrocardiography suggests structural heart disease. An intermittent event (loop) monitor is preferred for documenting cardiac arrhythmias, particularly when they occur infrequently. Ventricular and atrial premature contractions are common cardiac causes of palpitations; prognostic significance is dictated by the extent of underlying structural heart disease. Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia resulting in hospitalization; such patients are at increased risk of stroke. Patients with supraventricular tachycardia, long QT syndrome, ventricular tachycardia, or palpitations associated with syncope should be referred to a cardiologist.

### Critical review of the appropriate use criteria for amyloid imaging: effect on diagnosis and patient care [^45b032c5]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2016). Low credibility.

4 Discussion

The AUC were developed to help define a clinical cohort of patients most likely to benefit from amyloid PET scans during their diagnostic workup for cognitive decline. The premises for developing these criteria were both scientific and economic. Our study is, to our knowledge, the first outpatient consecutive clinical case series within the United States that serves to evaluate the utility of the AUC in both early- and late-onset cases.

The late-onset AUC-consistent cases had high rates of both diagnostic and treatment changes, strongly arguing for the value of amyloid imaging for diagnostic refinement in this cohort. Our early-onset cases showed very high rate of amyloid positivity and significantly higher rate of therapeutic changes compared with the late-onset cases. The high rate of amyloid positivity could have, at least in part, been the result of selective referral of cases with high likelihood of AD for amyloid PET imaging. One plausible explanation for the high rate of therapeutic changes could be that these difficult-to-diagnose cases are often referred drug-naïve by their private practice physicians. Thus we can conclude that amyloid imaging for these two groups of patients is both meaningful in terms of establishing the underlying etiology and for implementing appropriate therapeutic changes.

Patients with cognitive decline in whom the etiology of AD is deemed to be highly likely are not recommended by the AIT for amyloid PET scanning as it is thought that such patients will likely have amyloid pathology. Yet our data show that amyloid-negative scans are fairly common in the AUC-inconsistent group, with as many as 23% demonstrating SUVRs < 1.17. Proportionately, this rate corresponds well to the documented range of diagnostic sensitivity of 71% to 87% reported in a recent comprehensive analysis of a large data set with postmortem validation. Given that in all such cases our physicians changed their diagnostic considerations and treatment plans, one might conclude that amyloid PET would also be of value in imaging these subjects.

As we compare our results with those of others, we notice several agreements and disagreements. We found significantly greater amyloid-positive rates among early-onset cases as opposed to late-onset cases, in agreement with the work of others. Similar to Dell'Agnello et al. we observed a greater proportion of amyloid-positive cases among the AUC-inconsistent group as opposed to the AUC-consistent group (69% vs. 47% visual read, 77% vs. 60% quantitative read).

### Practical outpatient management of worsening chronic heart failure [^331fb515]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Part II: Identification of patients eligible for intravenous diuretic therapy

The identification of patients with WHF who are more likely to benefit from outpatient treatment with IV diuretics remains insufficiently documented to date. We propose an approach to the use of IV diuretics in an ambulatory setting (Figure 3) along with factors to be considered to select eligible patients (Table 2).,

Figure 3
Framework for ambulatory intravenous (IV) diuretics use. AF, atrial fibrillation; ER, emergency room; GP, general practitioner; HF, heart failure; NYHA, New York Heart Association; PE, pulmonary embolism; WHF, worsening heart failure.

Table 2
Factors to be considered to select patients to be treated with intravenous diuretics in an ambulatory setting

Clinical situations unlikely to fit an ambulatory intravenous diuretic programme

We suggest that patients with severe de novo HF (i.e. patients with markedly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] and New York Heart Association [NYHA] class ≥ III) should be managed in an in‐hospital setting. Indeed, these patients usually require further diagnostic and prognostic workup typically performed in hospital.

Secondly, patients presenting with signs of shock/low cardiac output, low oxygen saturation levels (i.e. peripheral oxygen saturation < 92%) and/or symptoms at rest (NYHA class IV) should be also managed in hospital. The clinical suspect, or identification, of specific and potentially fatal triggers of clinical deterioration, for instance a rapid conduction of supraventricular arrhythmias, pulmonary embolism or acute coronary syndromes, should also prompt in‐hospital management.

Explosive/rapid worsening does not leave an adequate window for intervening in an outpatient setting. Nevertheless, this clinical scenario does not exclude early discharge with subsequent ambulatory IV diuretic management.

ACC/AHA/HRS syncope — principles guiding additional testing state that the selection of a diagnostic test after initial history, physical examination, and baseline ECG is a clinical decision based on the patient's presentation, risk stratification, and understanding of diagnostic and prognostic value, and that broad-based additional testing is costly and often ineffective.

Syncope — healthcare costs of evaluation and management — are substantial across care settings. High healthcare costs are associated with the evaluation and management of syncope. In the U.S. Healthcare Utilization Project, total annual hospital costs exceeded $4.1 billion in 2014 dollars, with a mean cost of $9,400 per admission; for presumptive undiagnosed syncope, total costs were $1.6 billion and costs per admission were $7,200. The cost per informative diagnosis varied widely by test, from postural blood pressure ($50) through telemetry ($1,100) to EEG ($32, 973), and similar high costs per actionable diagnosis occur in children admitted for new-onset syncope; finally, mean costs per diagnostic result were also high in an outpatient ($19,900) specialty clinic for unexplained recurrent syncope.

### Syncope management unit: evolution of the concept and practice implementation [^417be60f]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Syncope, a clinical syndrome, has many potential causes. The prognosis of a patient experiencing syncope varies from benign outcome to increased risk of mortality or sudden death, determined by the etiology of syncope and the presence of underlying disease. Because a definitive diagnosis often cannot be established immediately, hospital admission is frequently recommended as the "default" approach to ensure patient's safety and an expedited evaluation. Hospital care is costly while no studies have shown that clinical outcomes are improved by the in-patient practice approach. The syncope unit is an evolving practice model based on the hypothesis that a multidisciplinary team of physicians and allied staff with expertise in syncope management, working together and equipped with standard clinical tools could improve clinical outcomes. Preliminary data have demonstrated that a specialized syncope unit can improve diagnosis in a timely manner, reduce hospital admission and decrease the use of unnecessary diagnostic tests. In this review, models of syncope units in the emergency department, hospital and outpatient clinics from different practices in different countries are discussed. Similarities and differences of these syncope units are compared. Outcomes and endpoints from these studies are summarized. Developing a syncope unit with a standardized protocol applicable to most practice settings would be an ultimate goal for clinicians and investigators who have interest, expertise, and commitment to improve care for this large patient population.

### Chimeric antigen receptor T-Cell therapy in the outpatient setting: an expert panel opinion from the American society for transplantation and cellular therapy [^37c480aa]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric CAR-T outpatient setting — among children undergoing therapy with commercially available CAR-T constructs, there is no ipso facto reason that this treatment must occur in the inpatient setting, yet the vast majority of pediatric patients included on major clinical trials have received CAR-T cell infusions in the inpatient setting, followed by inpatient monitoring. Although specific studies in children are lacking, in series that include a number of pediatric patients, outpatient CAR-T cell therapy appears to be safe and has not resulted in appreciable delays in presentation for evaluation or in the effective management of toxicities. Most patients included developed CRS (77%), occurring at a median of 3 days after infusion (range 1–22 days), whereas 40% developed neurological complications. The suitability of inpatient versus outpatient management should continue to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. In children who are reliably able to do so (e.g., those 12 or more years of age and of sufficient developmental attainment), the 10-point Immune Effector-Cell associated Encephalopathy (ICE) score is a useful screening measure.

Recommendations for disposition after initial syncope evaluation — classes and levels of evidence: COR I, LOE B-NR — Hospital evaluation and treatment are recommended for patients presenting with syncope who have a serious medical condition potentially relevant to the cause of syncope identified during initial evaluation. COR IIa, LOE C-LD — It is reasonable to manage patients with presumptive reflex-mediated syncope in the outpatient setting in the absence of serious medical conditions. Patients with presumptive vasovagal syncope (VVS) have a long-term risk of death similar to that of risk-matched patients without syncope, and hospital-based evaluation for presumptive VVS is unlikely to improve long-term outcomes, with possible exceptions including frequent recurrent syncope with risk of injury or identified injury related to syncope.
