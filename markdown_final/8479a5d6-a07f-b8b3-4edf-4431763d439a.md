symptoms that warrant covid test

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which symptoms should prompt COVID-19 testing and how to test when those symptoms are present. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core principle that any compatible symptom warrants testing. Then, I should verify which specific symptoms are considered compatible and how their diagnostic value varies. Next, I will review guideline-backed testing strategies, including timing and test selection. After that, I need to consider special populations and pretest probability modifiers. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and note what not to use for diagnosis, like serology, to avoid missteps.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: in current practice, the presence of any symptom compatible with COVID-19 should trigger diagnostic testing, because no single sign or symptom reliably rules in or out SARS-CoV-2 infection and testing is the only way to confirm active disease and guide isolation or treatment decisions [^a3dc006a] [^c51de73e].

> I need to check which symptoms count as "compatible". The CDC and IDSA list fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea; importantly, symptoms can start 2–14 days after exposure and may evolve over time, so new or worsening symptoms should still prompt testing even if earlier testing was negative [^74d54c30] [^fad9e4f4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about symptom specificity. I should verify which symptoms carry more diagnostic weight. Cochrane reviews show that anosmia or ageusia have high specificity and meaningfully increase the likelihood of COVID-19 when present, whereas fever and cough, while more sensitive, are less specific and can be seen with many respiratory illnesses; still, even high-specificity symptoms are not sufficient to diagnose or exclude COVID-19 without testing, so they should be viewed as red flags that lower the threshold for testing rather than replacements for it [^98dcbd69] [^3ff43b6f].

> Next, I should review the testing strategy itself. For symptomatic individuals, IDSA recommends nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT, e.g. PCR) as the preferred diagnostic method because of its superior sensitivity; if NAAT is not available or results will be delayed beyond about a day, antigen testing is acceptable, but a negative antigen test in a symptomatic person with ongoing suspicion should be confirmed with NAAT, ideally within 5 days of symptom onset to maximize yield and align with treatment windows [^a3dc006a] [^54b6a35a] [^40d1ca3c].

> Wait, let me verify the role of repeat testing. If an initial antigen test is negative and clinical suspicion remains high, repeating antigen testing in 24–48 hours or obtaining a NAAT is reasonable; IDSA also advises against routine repeat NAAT after a single negative result unless new symptoms emerge, timing was suboptimal, or specimen quality is questionable, which helps avoid low-yield testing while catching early or low-level infections [^453f20bb] [^3dc7c4e2].

> I should confirm special populations and modifiers of pretest probability. In children, symptom profiles overlap with adults and testing indications are the same; in immunocompromised hosts, testing thresholds should be lower and NAAT preferred given blunted antigen responses; in older adults or those with chronic conditions, the threshold for testing and early treatment consideration should also be lower because of higher risk of severe outcomes [^5a3b2647] [^a3dc006a] [^74d54c30].

> But wait, what if someone is asymptomatic yet had a close exposure? I need to ensure I don't conflate screening with diagnostic testing. For asymptomatic individuals with known exposure, testing is suggested around day 5 after exposure or immediately if symptoms develop, with NAAT preferred over antigen; this is a different question than symptomatic testing, but it reinforces that symptoms are the clearest trigger for immediate diagnostic testing in community settings [^4171d10f] [^882d88ef].

> I should double-check what not to use for acute diagnosis. Serology should not be used to diagnose acute COVID-19, especially within the first 2 weeks of symptoms, because sensitivity is low early and cannot distinguish recent from remote infection or vaccine-induced antibodies; serology has a limited role in late complications or epidemiologic assessment, not in acute diagnostic decision-making [^5dc7adc6] [^9d476869].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. Any new or worsening compatible symptom should prompt COVID-19 testing; prioritize NAAT when available and results will be timely, otherwise use antigen testing with the plan to confirm negative results if suspicion remains; test as early as possible within the first 5 days of symptoms to optimize sensitivity and treatment eligibility; and interpret results in the context of pretest probability, exposure risk, and local prevalence, recognizing that a negative test does not absolutely exclude infection early or with poor sampling [^a3dc006a] [^1d927257] [^74d54c30].

Patients should be tested for COVID-19 when they have **any new symptom** compatible with COVID-19 that is not better explained by another cause, including fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, or diarrhea [^74d54c30] [^fad9e4f4]. Testing is especially important if symptoms are **severe or persistent**, or if the patient is at **high risk for severe disease** (older adults, immunocompromised, or with chronic conditions) [^74d54c30]. Even mild or atypical symptoms warrant testing, particularly with known exposure or in areas of high transmission [^a3dc006a] [^9bf139f5].

---

## Common symptoms warranting COVID-19 testing

The CDC and IDSA provide a comprehensive list of symptoms that should prompt COVID-19 testing [^74d54c30] [^fad9e4f4]:

| **Symptom category** | **Specific symptoms** |
|-|-|
| Respiratory | - Cough <br/> - Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing <br/> - Sore throat <br/> - Congestion or runny nose |
| Systemic | - Fever or chills <br/> - Fatigue <br/> - Muscle or body aches <br/> - Headache |
| Gastrointestinal | - Nausea or vomiting <br/> - Diarrhea |
| Neurological | - New loss of taste or smell |

---

These symptoms typically appear **2–14 days after exposure** to the virus and can vary in severity from mild to severe [^74d54c30] [^fad9e4f4].

---

## Severity and persistence of symptoms

Severity and persistence of symptoms significantly influence the decision to test. Severe or persistent symptoms — such as high fever, severe cough, difficulty breathing, or symptoms lasting more than a few days — should prompt **immediate testing** [^74d54c30]. Even mild or atypical symptoms warrant testing, particularly if there is a known exposure to COVID-19 or if the individual resides in an area with high transmission rates [^a3dc006a] [^9bf139f5].

---

## High-risk populations

Certain populations are at **increased risk** for severe COVID-19 illness and should be tested promptly if they exhibit any symptoms:

- Older adults (≥ 65 years)
- Immunocompromised individuals
- Individuals with chronic medical conditions (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, obesity)
- Pregnant individuals

Testing in these populations is critical because early detection can significantly impact clinical management and outcomes [^74d54c30] [^c51de73e].

---

## Asymptomatic individuals with known exposure

Asymptomatic individuals with known exposure to COVID-19 should also be tested, ideally **5 days after exposure** [^4171d10f]. If symptoms develop before this period, testing should be conducted immediately [^882d88ef]. This approach helps identify asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infections and prevent further transmission [^51e47540].

---

## Special considerations

- **Children**: Children may present with milder or atypical symptoms, including abdominal pain, vomiting, or rash. Testing is recommended if they exhibit any symptoms compatible with COVID-19, especially if there is a known exposure [^5a3b2647].
- **Vaccinated individuals**: Vaccinated individuals can still contract and transmit COVID-19, albeit typically with milder symptoms. Testing is recommended if they develop symptoms compatible with COVID-19 [^notfound].
- **Immunocompromised individuals**: These individuals may have atypical presentations or prolonged viral shedding. Testing is recommended even for mild or atypical symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

In summary, **any new symptom compatible with COVID-19** that is not better explained by another cause should prompt testing. Severity, persistence, and patient risk factors should guide urgency, and asymptomatic individuals with known exposure should be tested around day 5. Early and accurate testing supports timely isolation, treatment, and public health control measures [^dad72b5f].

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: antigen testing (January 2023) [^c211127c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Immunoassays designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 protein antigens (Ag) are commonly used to diagnose COVID-19. The most widely used tests are lateral flow assays that generate results in approximately 15 minutes for diagnosis at the point-of-care. Higher throughput, laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2 Ag assays have also been developed. The number of commercially available SARS-CoV-2 Ag detection tests has increased rapidly, as has the COVID-19 diagnostic literature. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) convened an expert panel to perform a systematic review of the literature and develop best-practice guidance related to SARS-CoV-2 Ag testing. This guideline is an update to the third in a series of frequently updated COVID-19 diagnostic guidelines developed by the IDSA. IDSA's goal was to develop evidence-based recommendations or suggestions that assist clinicians, clinical laboratories, patients, public health authorities, administrators, and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests in both medical and nonmedical settings. A multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists, and experts in systematic literature review identified and prioritized clinical questions related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests. A review of relevant, peer-reviewed published literature was conducted through 1 April 2022. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations. The panel made 10 diagnostic recommendations that address Ag testing in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and assess single versus repeat testing strategies. US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests with Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) have high specificity and low to moderate sensitivity compared with nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). Ag test sensitivity is dependent on the presence or absence of symptoms and, in symptomatic patients, on timing of testing after symptom onset. In most cases, positive Ag results can be acted upon without confirmation. Results of point-of-care testing are comparable to those of laboratory-based testing, and observed or unobserved self-collection of specimens for testing yields similar results. Modeling suggests that repeat Ag testing increases sensitivity compared with testing once, but no empirical data were available to inform this question. Based on these observations, rapid RT-PCR or laboratory-based NAAT remain the testing methods of choice for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, when timely molecular testing is not readily available or is logistically infeasible, Ag testing helps identify individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data were insufficient to make a recommendation about the utility of Ag testing to guide release of patients with COVID-19 from isolation. The overall quality of available evidence supporting use of Ag testing was graded as very low to moderate.

### When should asymptomatic persons Be tested for COVID-19? [^f204b8d3]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

On 24 August 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its website to highlight that asymptomatic individuals, even those with exposure to a COVID-19-positive contact, do not necessarily need to be tested unless they have medical conditions associated with increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19. The CDC subsequently updated its guidance on 19 September 2020 to support testing of asymptomatic persons, including close contacts of persons with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this editorial, the American Society for Microbiology Clinical and Public Health Microbiology Committee's Subcommittee on Laboratory Practices comments on testing of asymptomatic individuals relative to current medical knowledge of the virus and mitigation measures. Specific points are provided concerning such testing when undertaking contact tracing and routine surveillance. Limitations to consider when testing asymptomatic persons are covered, including the need to prioritize testing of contacts of positive COVID-19 cases. We urge the CDC to consult with primary stakeholders of COVID-19 testing when making such impactful changes in testing guidance.

### Interpreting COVID-19 test results in clinical settings: It depends! [^9bf139f5]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Tests for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are intended for a disparate and shifting range of purposes: (1) diagnosing patients who present with symptoms to inform individual treatment decisions; (2) organizational uses such as "cohorting" potentially infected patients and staff to protect others; and (3) contact tracing, surveillance, and other public health purposes. Often lost when testing is encouraged is that testing does not by itself confer health benefits. Rather, testing is useful to the extent it forms a critical link to subsequent medical or public health interventions. Such interventions might be individual level, like better diagnosis, treatment, isolation, or quarantine of contacts. They might aid surveillance to understand levels and trends of disease within a defined population that enables informed decisions to implement or relax social distancing measures. In this article, we describe the range of available COVID-19 tests; their accuracy and timing considerations; and the specific clinical, organizational, and public health considerations that warrant different testing strategies. Three representative clinical scenarios illustrate the importance of appropriate test use and interpretation. The reason a patient seeks testing is often a strong indicator of the pretest probability of infection, and thus how to interpret test results. In addition, the level of population spread of the virus and the timing of testing play critical roles in the positive or negative predictive value of the test. We conclude with practical recommendations regarding the need for testing in various contexts, appropriate tests and testing methods, and the interpretation of test results.

### Interpreting SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests: common questions and answers [^1d927257]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The spectrum of asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 transmission presents challenges for evaluating SARS-CoV-2 test performance for diagnostic or screening purposes and for interpreting test results. Molecular and antigen tests can detect current SARS-CoV-2 infection and are used to diagnose COVID-19. Clinicians should consider a test's characteristics, test timing in relation to symptom onset, and the pretest probability of disease when interpreting results. Molecular and antigen SARS-CoV-2 tests both have high specificity. However, antigen tests generally have lower sensitivity and thus greater potential for false-negative results. Pretest probability of disease should be based on a patient's exposure to someone with a confirmed or probable case, signs or symptoms of COVID-19, local or population-specific COVID-19 prevalence, and presence of an alternative diagnosis. Using a leaf plot is an efficient way to visualize posttest probability of disease based on estimated pretest probability and the test's sensitivity and specificity. A negative molecular or antigen test result might not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection when pretest probability is high, depending on the test's sensitivity. A symptom-based approach is preferred over a test-based approach for discontinuing isolation precautions for most patients with COVID-19 because prolonged shedding of viral RNA does not necessarily correlate with infectivity. Antibody tests might help identify past SARS-CoV-2 infection if performed two to four weeks after symptom onset; however, because of uncertainty about the extent and durability of postinfection or vaccine-induced immunity, they should not yet be used to infer immunity or guide discontinuation of personal protective measures.

### Symptoms of COVID-19-CDC (...) [^74d54c30]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- People with COVID-19 have a wide range of symptoms ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness.
- Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus.
- Symptoms may start as mild, and some people will progress to more severe symptoms. Signs and Symptoms The following list does not include all possible symptoms. Symptoms may change with new COVID-19 variants and can vary depending on vaccination status. Possible symptoms include:
- Fever or chills
- Cough
- Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
- Sore throat
- Congestion or runny nose
- New loss of taste or smell
- Fatigue
- Muscle or body aches
- Headache
- Nausea or vomiting
- Diarrhea CDC will continue to update this list as we learn more about COVID-19. Feeling Sick. Stay home and away from others if you have symptoms that aren't better explained by another cause.

Seek health care promptly for testing and/or treatment if you have risk factors for severe illness; treatment may help lower your risk of severe illness. When to seek emergency help Look for emergency warning signs for COVID 19:
- Trouble breathing
- Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
- New confusion
- Inability to wake or stay awake
- Depending on skin tone, lips, nail beds and skin may appear pale, gray, or blue. If someone is showing any of these signs, call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility. Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19. This list does not include all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you. . Some nucleic acid amplification tests, including PCR tests, can differentiate between flu and COVID-19 at the same time. If one of these tests is not available, many testing locations provide flu and COVID-19 tests separately.

### Estimating the efficacy of symptom-based screening for COVID-19 [^e0299b8c]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

There is substantial interest in using presenting symptoms to prioritize testing for COVID-19 and establish symptom-based surveillance. However, little is currently known about the specificity of COVID-19 symptoms. To assess the feasibility of symptom-based screening for COVID-19, we used data from tests for common respiratory viruses and SARS-CoV-2 in our health system to measure the ability to correctly classify virus test results based on presenting symptoms. Based on these results, symptom-based screening may not be an effective strategy to identify individuals who should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection or to obtain a leading indicator of new COVID-19 cases.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: antigen testing (January 2023) [^a3dc006a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 antigen testing in symptomatic individuals is addressed with the recommendation: test over no test. (strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence) Symptomatic individuals were defined as those with at least 1 of the common symptoms of COVID-19. For optimal performance, Ag tests should be used within 5 days of symptom onset; the panel identified no studies that reported Ag test performance on the first or second day of symptoms. If clinical suspicion for COVID-19 remains high, a negative Ag result should be confirmed by standard NAAT (ie, rapid RT-PCR or laboratory-based NAAT). A single Ag test has high specificity; a positive result can be used to help guide treatment and isolation decisions without confirmation. There were limited data regarding the analytical performance of Ag tests in children, immunocompromised or vaccinated individuals, or in those who had prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. The panel was unable to identify studies that compared the risk of transmission among patients recovering from COVID-19 who were released from isolation based on results of Ag testing versus no testing. We found no direct evidence that assessed patient- or population-centered outcomes of testing versus no testing in symptomatic patients. The reference standard in the included studies was standard NAAT (ie, rapid RT-PCR or laboratory-based NAAT). We identified 65 studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of Ag testing as compared with NAAT as a reference test in symptomatic individuals. The studies included 20 272 individuals for sensitivity.

IDSA COVID-19 serologic testing—diagnosis within 2 weeks and NAAT-negative symptomatic patients: The panel recommends against serologic testing to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first 2 weeks after symptom onset (strong recommendations, low certainty of evidence). Serologic testing should not be used to provide evidence of COVID-19 in symptomatic patients with a high clinical suspicion and repeatedly negative nucleic acid amplification test results (strong recommendation, very low certainty of evidence).

The panel recognizes the lack of evidence supporting therapy for asymptomatic persons and the absence of treatment approved through EUA for asymptomatic COVID-19, and notes that high-risk individuals (e.g., those who have pulmonary conditions or are immunocompromised or those in close contact with immunocompromised individuals) may be considered for testing. Testing should be done at least 5 days after the exposure, and if symptoms develop before 5 days, the exposed individual should get tested immediately.

Supporting evidence identified 19 studies in such patients; PCR-negative/IgG-positive results ranged from 0% to 93%, with most studies reporting this combination in fewer than 50% of samples, and PCR-negative/IgM-positive results ranged from 2% to 83%. The guideline remarks that contemporary populations are more likely to have prior infection or vaccination than the study populations, which could negatively affect pooled specificity calculations.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing—Recommendation 6 states that for individuals who have clinical or epidemiologic reasons that might make testing desirable, the IDSA panel suggests SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing in asymptomatic individuals who are either known or suspected to have been exposed to COVID-19 (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence). Remarks note limited evidence and no EUA-approved therapy for asymptomatic COVID-19 but allow that individual clinical scenarios may lead clinicians toward testing and consideration of treatment, and individuals with high-risk conditions or in close contact with immunocompromised individuals may be considered for testing. Testing should be done at least 5 days after the exposure, and if symptoms develop before 5 days the exposed individual should get tested immediately. Known exposures are defined as close contact for at least 15 minutes over a 24-hour period with someone with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, while suspected exposures may include working or residing in congregate settings experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak. The decision to test asymptomatic persons should depend on availability of testing resources, knowledge of infection can inform appropriate isolation, risk varies by exposure conditions with household contacts especially high-risk, and the recommendation assumes the exposed individual was not wearing appropriate PPE.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: antigen testing (January 2023) [^65b28ab8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Antigen testing versus no testing in asymptomatic exposed individuals—IDSA recommendation and key remarks: For asymptomatic individuals with known exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) panel suggests using a single (ie, one-time) antigen (Ag) test over no testing in specific situations (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence). Testing in the absence of COVID-19–like symptoms should be individualized, and one-time Ag testing may be considered if the test result will impact an individual’s subsequent actions. A negative Ag test result reduces the likelihood of infection, but the longer the time since testing, the more this likelihood reduction wanes; in contrast, a positive test result is associated with a high positive-predictive value. The panel recognizes the lack of evidence supporting therapy in asymptomatic persons and the absence of treatments approved through EUA for asymptomatic COVID-19 but acknowledges that individual clinical scenarios may lead clinicians toward testing and consideration of treatment.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular testing—Recommendation 5 states: The IDSA panel suggests performing a single NAAT and not repeating testing routinely in symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19 whose initial NAAT result is negative (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). The panel considered symptomatic patients to have at least one of the most common symptoms compatible with COVID-19 (Table 1). While the yield of repeat testing is low and therefore repeat testing is not suggested routinely, there may be situations where repeat testing might be considered, such as development of new or worsening symptoms in the absence of alternative explanations, timing of symptom onset that might drive a need for repeat testing, or a poorly collected specimen that could yield a falsely negative result. If performed, repeat testing should generally occur 24-48 hours after initial testing and once the initial NAAT result has returned as negative, and another specimen type, preferably a lower respiratory tract specimen if the patient has signs/symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection, should be considered for repeat testing.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^9d476869]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 serologic testing—first 2 weeks after symptom onset: The IDSA panel recommends against using serologic testing to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first 2 weeks following symptom onset (strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence). Most studies included in this recommendation’s literature review assessed unvaccinated individuals and so the panel’s findings might not apply to individuals who have been vaccinated, especially with respect to specificity, rendering test accuracy worse than presented. Similarly, in today’s population there is a higher likelihood of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection than assessed in the included studies, which could also negatively affect specificity, rendering test accuracy worse than presented. Analogous to other respiratory viruses where nonserologic tests are preferred for diagnosis of acute infection, serologic testing should not be performed routinely for diagnosis of acute COVID-19.

COVID-19 antigen (Ag) testing in symptomatic patients—benefits and harms indicate that within 5 days of symptom onset the false-negative rate ranged from 5 (range: 3 to 8) per 1000 at 5% prevalence to 55 (range: 35 to 85) per 1000 at 50% prevalence, while specificity remained close to 100% regardless of time from symptom onset. After 5 days of symptoms, sensitivity was 54% (95% CI: 44% to 64%), and because of potential harms a negative result in someone with continued suspicion for COVID-19 should be confirmed promptly with a standard NAAT. As currently available therapies are recommended to be started within 5 days of symptoms, Ag testing during this period yielded almost no false-positive results even when prevalence was as low as 5% (range: 0 to 9 false-positive results per 1000 patients tested).

### Review of burden, clinical definitions, and management of COVID-19 cases [^16ff8965]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Our understanding of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), its clinical manifestations, and treatment options continues to evolve at an unparalleled pace. This review sought to summarize the key literature regarding transmission, case definitions, clinical management, and the burden of COVID-19. Our review of the literature showed that SARS-CoV-2 was mainly transmitted via inhalation of respiratory droplets containing the virus and had a mean incubation period of 4-6 days. The commonly reported symptoms were fever (75.3% ± 18.7%) and cough (62.6% ± 17.7%) across the spectrum of clinical disease-mild, moderate, severe, and critical, but with the disease phenotype varying with severity. Categorization of these cases for home care or hospital management needs to be defined, with risk stratification accounting for the age of the patient and the presence of underlying comorbidities. The case definitions varied among countries, which could have contributed to the differences in the case fatality rates among affected countries. The severity and risk of death due to COVID-19 was associated with age and underlying comorbidities. Asymptomatic cases, which constitute 40-80% of COVID-19 cases are a considerable threat to control efforts. The presence of fever and cough may be sufficient to warrant COVID-19 testing, but using these symptoms in isolation will miss a proportion of cases. A clear definition of a COVID-19 case is essential for the management, treatment, and tracking of clinical illness, and to inform the quarantine measures and social distancing that can help control the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

Abstract.

Our understanding of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), its clinical manifestations, and treatment options continues to evolve at an unparalleled pace. This review sought to summarize the key literature regarding transmission, case definitions, clinical management, and the burden of COVID-19. Our review of the literature showed that SARS-CoV-2 was mainly transmitted via inhalation of respiratory droplets containing the virus and had a mean incubation period of 4–6 days. The commonly reported symptoms were fever (75.3% ± 18.7%) and cough (62.6% ± 17.7%) across the spectrum of clinical disease—mild, moderate, severe, and critical, but with the disease phenotype varying with severity. Categorization of these cases for home care or hospital management needs to be defined, with risk stratification accounting for the age of the patient and the presence of underlying comorbidities. The case definitions varied among countries, which could have contributed to the differences in the case fatality rates among affected countries. The severity and risk of death due to COVID-19 was associated with age and underlying comorbidities. Asymptomatic cases, which constitute 40–80% of COVID-19 cases are a considerable threat to control efforts. The presence of fever and cough may be sufficient to warrant COVID-19 testing, but using these symptoms in isolation will miss a proportion of cases. A clear definition of a COVID-19 case is essential for the management, treatment, and tracking of clinical illness, and to inform the quarantine measures and social distancing that can help control the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

### Coronavirus disease case definitions, diagnostic testing criteria, and surveillance in 25 countries with highest reported case counts [^5e841efd]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Case surveillance remains the foundation for national COVID-19 surveillance and plays a vital role in ongoing situational awareness, clarifying the impact and effectiveness of vaccines and informing other public health and social measures. We observed marked heterogeneity in testing eligibility requirements among countries and how countries define COVID-19 cases. Specifically, we observed heterogeneity in eligible clinical symptoms for suspected case definitions, laboratory and diagnostic requirements for probable case definitions, and eligible laboratory assays for confirmed case definitions. Testing eligibility criteria varied from being restricted to populations with exposure and symptoms to all populations being eligible, regardless of exposure and symptoms. Collectively, these issues suggest that efforts to compare and collate COVID-19 case counts across countries require careful interpretation. Improved harmonization of case definitions across countries prospectively for COVID-19, and for other novel infectious diseases that might emerge, warrants consideration.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: antigen testing (January 2023) [^5aa6fddd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 antigen testing guidelines—overview of diagnostic role and evidence: Immunoassays detecting SARS-CoV-2 protein antigens are commonly used, with lateral flow assays generating results in approximately 15 minutes at the point of care. US Food and Drug Administration SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests with Emergency Use Authorization have high specificity and low to moderate sensitivity compared with nucleic acid amplification testing, and sensitivity depends on symptom status and, in symptomatic patients, on timing after symptom onset. In most cases, positive results can be acted upon without confirmation. Results of point-of-care testing are comparable to laboratory-based testing, and observed or unobserved self-collection yields similar results. Modeling suggests repeat antigen testing increases sensitivity compared with testing once, but no empirical data were available. Based on these observations, rapid RT-PCR or laboratory-based NAAT remain the testing methods of choice for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection; when timely molecular testing is not readily available or is logistically infeasible, antigen testing helps identify individuals with infection. The panel used GRADE, reviewed literature through 1 April 2022, and graded the overall quality of evidence as very low to moderate.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19 [^bcaa142b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Accurate molecular diagnostic tests are necessary for confirming a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Direct detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acids in respiratory tract specimens informs patient, healthcare institution and public health level decision-making. The numbers of available SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection tests are rapidly increasing, as is the COVID-19 diagnostic literature. Thus, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recognized a significant need for frequently updated systematic reviews of the literature to inform evidence-based best practice guidance.

Objective

The IDSA's goal was to develop an evidence-based diagnostic guideline to assists clinicians, clinical laboratorians, patients and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests. In addition, we provide a conceptual framework for understanding molecular diagnostic test performance, discuss the nuance of test result interpretation in a variety of practice settings, and highlight important unmet research needs in the COVID-19 diagnostic testing space.

Methods

IDSA convened a multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists, and experts in systematic literature review to identify and prioritize clinical questions and outcomes related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostics. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations.

Results

The panel agreed on 15 diagnostic recommendations.

Conclusions

Universal access to accurate SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing is critical for patient care, hospital infection prevention and the public response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Information on the clinical performance of available tests is rapidly emerging, but the quality of evidence of the current literature is considered low to very low. Recognizing these limitations, the IDSA panel weighed available diagnostic evidence and recommends nucleic acid testing for all symptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19. In addition, testing is recommended for asymptomatic individuals with known or suspected contact with a COVID-19 case. Testing asymptomatic individuals without known exposure is suggested when the results will impact isolation/quarantine/personal protective equipment (PPE) usage decisions, dictate eligibility for surgery, or inform administration of immunosuppressive therapy. Ultimately, prioritization of testing will depend on institutional-specific resources and the needs of different patient populations.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^e89c93b8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The availability of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serologic testing has rapidly increased. Current assays use a variety of technologies, measure different classes of immunoglobulin or immunoglobulin combinations and detect antibodies directed against different portions of the virus. The overall accuracy of these tests, however, has not been well-defined. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) convened an expert panel to perform a systematic review of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) serology literature and construct best practice guidance related to SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing. This guideline is the fourth in a series of rapid, frequently updated COVID-19 guidelines developed by IDSA.

Objective

IDSA's goal was to develop evidence-based recommendations that assist clinicians, clinical laboratories, patients and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests in a variety of settings. We also highlight important unmet research needs pertaining to the use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests for diagnosis, public health surveillance, vaccine development and the selection of convalescent plasma donors.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists and experts in systematic literature review identified and prioritized clinical questions related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations.

Results

The panel agreed on eight diagnostic recommendations.

Conclusions

Information on the clinical performance and utility of SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests are rapidly emerging. Based on available evidence, detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may be useful for confirming the presence of current or past infection in selected situations. The panel identified three potential indications for serologic testing including: 1) evaluation of patients with a high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 when molecular diagnostic testing is negative and at least two weeks have passed since symptom onset; 2) assessment of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children; and 3) for conducting serosurveillance studies. The certainty of available evidence supporting the use of serology for either diagnosis or epidemiology was, however, graded as very low to moderate.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^1e7bad19]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Accurate molecular diagnostic tests are necessary for confirming a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and for identifying asymptomatic carriage of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The number of available SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection tests continues to increase as does the COVID-19 diagnostic literature. Thus, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) developed an evidence-based diagnostic guideline to assist clinicians, clinical laboratorians, patients, and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests. In addition, we provide a conceptual framework for understanding molecular diagnostic test performance, discuss nuances of test result interpretation in a variety of practice settings, and highlight important unmet research needs related to COVID-19 diagnostic testing. IDSA convened a multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists, and experts in systematic literature review to identify and prioritize clinical questions and outcomes related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostics. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations. The panel agreed on 12 diagnostic recommendations. Access to accurate SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing is critical for patient care, hospital infection prevention, and the public health response to COVID-19 infection. Information on the clinical performance of available tests continues to grow, but the quality of evidence of the current literature to support this updated molecular diagnostic guideline remains moderate to very low. Recognizing these limitations, the IDSA panel weighed available diagnostic evidence and recommends nucleic acid testing for all symptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19. In addition, testing is suggested for asymptomatic individuals with known or suspected contact with a COVID-19 case when the results will impact isolation/quarantine/personal protective equipment (PPE) usage decisions. Evidence in support of rapid testing and testing of upper respiratory specimens other than nasopharyngeal swabs, which offer logistical advantages, is sufficient to warrant conditional recommendations in favor of these approaches.

### Guidelines on newly identified limitations of diagnostic tools for COVID-19 and consequences [^bd739e85]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by coronavirus has spread worldwide and has become the deadliest pandemic of the 21st century. Such rapid spread is predominantly attributed to the poor diagnosis and its asymptomatic transmission. In the absence of treatment regime, timely diagnosis is the best available remedy that can restrict its spread. An early diagnosis of COVID-19 is critical for determining the line of treatment and preventing long term complications in the infected subject. Unfortunately, available rapid antigen and antibody kits are known to be erroneous whereas reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction based tests are expensive, viral load dependent and at times inconclusive. In current scenario, the false-negative results imposed a major risk to the individual patient care and also to the efforts for containing the spread at the population level, where as false positives are traumatic for families and can lead to improper treatment resulting in severe complications. In this article, the limitations of available diagnostic procedures have been elaborated and plausible combination approach has been advised.

### COVID-19 pandemic-a focused review for clinicians [^5092e096]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 remains a significant issue for global health, economics and society. A wealth of data has been generated since its emergence in December 2019, and it is vital for clinicians to keep up with this data from across the world at a time of uncertainty and constantly evolving guidelines and clinical practice.

Objectives

Here we provide an update for clinicians on the recent developments in the virology, diagnostics, clinical presentation, viral shedding, and treatment options for COVID-19 based on current literature.

Sources

We considered published peer-reviewed papers and non-peer-reviewed pre-print manuscripts on COVID19 and related aspects with an emphasis on clinical management aspects.

Content

We describe the virological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical course of COVID-19 with an emphasis on diagnostic challenges, duration of viral shedding, severity markers and current treatment options.

Implications

The key challenge in managing COVID-19 remains patient density. However, accurate diagnosis as well as early identification and management of high-risk severe cases are important for many clinicians. For improved management of cases, there is a need to understand test probability of serology, qRT-PCR and radiological testing, and the efficacy of available treatment options that could be used in severe cases with a high risk of mortality.

### Considerations for diagnostic COVID-19 tests [^ba3baee9]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2021). High credibility.

During the early phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, design, development, validation, verification and implementation of diagnostic tests were actively addressed by a large number of diagnostic test manufacturers. Hundreds of molecular tests and immunoassays were rapidly developed, albeit many still await clinical validation and formal approval. In this Review, we summarize the crucial role of diagnostic tests during the first global wave of COVID-19. We explore the technical and implementation problems encountered during this early phase in the pandemic, and try to define future directions for the progressive and better use of (syndromic) diagnostics during a possible resurgence of COVID-19 in future global waves or regional outbreaks. Continuous global improvement in diagnostic test preparedness is essential for more rapid detection of patients, possibly at the point of care, and for optimized prevention and treatment, in both industrialized countries and low-resource settings.

### Suspected cases of COVID-19: study protocol for reporting characteristics and the outcomes [^355c37ff]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

While research and reporting on COVID-19 disease focused on laboratory-confirmed cases, many suspected COVID-19 cases are advised to home isolate based on symptoms and risk factors and not on laboratory test findings. While guidance suggests that primary care physicians must rely on their clinical judgement for evaluation of those cases, there has been no risk stratifying tool that has been reported or validated in this cohort of patients. This reflection note reviews current guidance, identifies gaps in our knowledge and clinical practice and finally provides a rationale for research in this cohort of patients. We propose a research design with detailed descriptions of variables that would be feasible to examine in primary care settings. Primary care research in the characteristics and the outcomes of suspected cases of COVID-19 may provide a different view on the COVID-19 epidemic. We hypothesise that most of the patients with suspected diagnosis and home isolation will have good outcomes. Reporting on the characteristics and the outcomes in this cohort of patients may provide hope to patients and to the international community that receives daily updates on confirmed cases and mortality rates but none on the recovery counts.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19) virus is a member of the coronaviruses, which is closely related to SARS-CoV virus. Common signs on presentation include fever, cough and shortness of breath.Supportive care is the mainstay of treatment with no specific antiviral treatment. While the disease could be asymptomatic or mild in many cases, moderate cases require hospitalisation, and severe cases need the support of vital organ functions.

WHO advised suspecting COVID-19 in patients with acute fever and ≥1 sign or symptom of the respiratory disease combined with a risk factor for exposure. Exposure risk factors included recent travel to infected areas or those who had direct contact with cases within 14 days of the start of their symptoms. The term ‘Probable case’ recently expanded to include a suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason. ‘Confirmed cases’ is a term that is reserved only for those with laboratory confirmation irrespective of the presence or absence of clinical symptoms.

SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing—recommendation strength and clinical use relative to nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT)—uses Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), where recommendations are categorized as “strong” or “conditional,” with “recommend” indicating a strong recommendation and “suggest” indicating a conditional recommendation. Given the superior sensitivity of molecular diagnostics, the panel suggests using standard NAAT over Ag tests if standard NAAT is available and results of testing will be timely; however, rapid Ag testing has value when timely NAAT is unavailable, especially when results are positive, because the high specificity of Ag testing means that positive results are actionable without needing confirmation. In contrast, negative Ag results should be confirmed by standard NAAT when clinical suspicion of COVID-19 is high, and the panel notes treatment options are typically approved for administration within 5 days of symptom onset.

SARS-CoV-2 NAAT testing—recommendation and access considerations: SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) testing is recommended for symptomatic individuals in the community with a compatible clinical syndrome. The very high specificity of standard NAAT, with no predicted false positives at prevalences ranging from 5% to 50%, is noted. Additional considerations state that SARS-CoV-2 testing is generally acceptable to patients and providers, that in the U.S. individuals with health insurance should not pay out-of-pocket costs for COVID-19 testing, and that NAAT can be accessed through programs in some communities at no-cost, although this may change and may impact the likelihood of patients seeking testing.

IDSA COVID-19 antigen testing—For symptomatic patients, the IDSA panel suggests using standard NAAT over rapid antigen (Ag) tests due to higher sensitivity, and because Ag tests have very high specificity a positive result is actionable immediately and does not require routine confirmation; however, if Ag tests are used, a negative Ag test result should be confirmed with a standard NAAT when clinical suspicion remains, and testing within the first 5 days of symptoms optimizes Ag sensitivity with Ag testing done within 5 days of symptom onset to minimize false negatives and to diagnose patients within the treatment eligibility window.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) molecular COVID-19 diagnostic testing guideline—Because EUA submissions require analytical but not clinical performance data, the panel identified few studies reporting clinical performance and based most recommendations on diagnostic test accuracy. Accuracy metrics include sensitivity and specificity, and positive and negative predictive values are essential; calculating predictive values requires prevalence or pre-test probability, yet true community prevalence may be ill-defined or underestimated when testing is limited or results are not reported. Accordingly, the panel varied estimates of prevalence/pre-test probability and assay sensitivity and specificity in analyses using available literature and public dashboards to mirror what may be encountered in clinical practice.

A basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with consideration for additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by the patient's specific symptoms.

Antigen testing in asymptomatic individuals—modeled outcomes and practical considerations: With a 10% prevalence of infection, 63 true positives (95% CI: 56–69) and 37 false negatives (95% CI: 31–44) were detected, and the number of false-positive results was estimated to be 0 with a true prevalence between 1% and 10%; routine confirmation of positive Ag test results does not appear to be necessary in most cases. Additional considerations include that there are currently no treatment options approved through FDA EUA for asymptomatic COVID-19, the panel found no direct evidence that testing for SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic individuals reduces risk of transmission, postexposure monoclonal antibody prophylaxis may be an alternative to testing in high-risk asymptomatic individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 if and when EUA options exist, and education on interpretation of rapid Ag tests is important; the decision to pursue rapid Ag testing versus no testing should be individualized, and antigen testing may be useful in guiding mitigation efforts during an outbreak.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: antigen testing (January 2023) [^64d18a70]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 diagnostics—antigen testing versus standard NAAT in asymptomatic exposure: For asymptomatic individuals with known exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the IDSA panel suggests using a single standard NAAT (ie, rapid RT-PCR or laboratory-based NAAT) over a single rapid Ag test (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence). SARS-CoV-2 testing in the absence of COVID-19–like symptoms should be individualized. A one-time standard NAAT may be considered if the test result will impact an individual’s subsequent actions. Access to timely results of standard NAAT may be unavailable or limited in some settings; in such situations, use of an Ag test can be considered. The panel recognizes the lack of evidence supporting COVID-19 therapy in asymptomatic persons and the absence of treatments approved through FDA EUA for asymptomatic COVID-19 but acknowledges that individual clinical decisions may need to be made and discussed with patients.

In situations where NAAT results are not available in a timely manner and a first Ag test is negative, the IDSA panel suggests repeating Ag testing. To optimize sensitivity, repeat testing should be performed within 5 days of symptom onset; the panel was unable to identify any study that reported results of testing within 2 days of symptom onset. If the first Ag test is positive, there is no need for repeat testing.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^b05f6bd8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing in patients with high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 and repeatedly negative nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) offers low clinical benefit with very low-certainty evidence; reported positivity varied widely (IgM or IgG 11% to 62%; PCR-negative/total antibody-positive 0% to 60%), studies varied by assay and timing (eg, <20 days vs >15 days), and in unvaccinated or previously uninfected individuals the negative predictive value is high when testing is performed more than 2 weeks after symptom onset. In this instance, negative serologic results should prompt further evaluation for alternative etiologies if symptoms persist. Serology cannot distinguish recent from remote infection or vaccine response from infection, and assessing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies provides no added benefit over repeat NAATs for diagnosing acute COVID-19 and may lead to diagnostic uncertainty.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^64a36b77]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 serologic testing—diagnostic accuracy within the first 2 weeks after symptom onset is based on 11 studies comparing serology with reverse transcription PCR, with included sample sizes for sensitivity analyses ranging from 1137 to 5161 and for specificity analyses from 4388 to 22,321; pooled specificity ranged from 98% to 99%. At 1 week after symptom onset, pooled sensitivity was 27% for IgM and 24% for IgG, and at 2 weeks it was 64% for IgM and 66% for IgG; although IgM responses often occur earlier for infections in general, with SARS-CoV-2 there does not appear to be a substantial difference in detection timing between IgM and IgG. If performed within 14 days of symptom onset, low sensitivity can yield many falsely negative results, and despite calculated specificity of 98%–99%, low-specificity assays can produce false-positive results for recent infection leading to incorrect conclusions and unnecessary actions. Serologic testing should not be performed routinely for diagnosis of acute COVID-19.

COVID-19 antigen (Ag) testing—benefits and harms of unobserved self-collection: The potential benefit of unobserved Ag testing is that tests are readily available, and testing may be more likely to be performed and performed faster than if observed testing needed to be arranged, which may particularly benefit individuals without convenient access to a testing facility or those who prefer to avoid healthcare facilities. Observed testing adds cost to patient care. The potential harm of Ag testing is the risk of a false-negative result, which can provide false assurance and facilitate spread, and in symptomatic infected persons may result in failure to treat; harms may be mitigated by clear instructions and understanding that a negative test does not rule out infection and should prompt follow-up testing.

Remarks note that serologic testing should not be routinely performed for diagnosis of acute COVID-19 and that accuracy may be worse in vaccinated or previously infected populations; anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies typically become detectable more than 2 weeks after symptom onset, and serology lacks sufficient sensitivity in the acute phase.

The panel considered symptomatic patients to have at least one of the most common symptoms compatible with COVID-19, and it notes that while repeat testing when the initial test result is negative is not suggested routinely, there may be situations where repeat testing might be considered.

IDSA COVID-19 antigen testing—general remarks for asymptomatic individuals indicate that SARS-CoV-2 testing in the absence of COVID-19–like symptoms should be individualized, and one-time antigen (Ag) testing may be considered if the result will impact actions; a negative Ag test result reduces the likelihood of infection but this likelihood reduction wanes over time, and a positive test result is associated with a high positive-predictive value; the panel also notes a lack of evidence supporting therapy and absence of treatment approved through FDA EUA for asymptomatic COVID-19, while acknowledging that individual scenarios may lead clinicians toward testing and consideration of treatment.

QUESTIONS

We formulated four clearly defined questions regarding “microbiology and laboratory tests, imaging tools, and diagnostic and prognostic modeling”:
1 In LMICs, which specific microbiology tests should be ordered for hospitalized patients to support a diagnosis of COVID-19?
2 In LMICs, which specific laboratory tests could be useful for hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19?
3 In LMICs, what is the role of lung ultrasound in patients with severe COVID-19?
4 In LMICs, are diagnostic and prognostic models useful in patients with severe COVID-19?

In LMICs, which specific microbiology tests should be ordered to support a diagnosis of COVID-19?

Rationale.

The diagnosis of COVID-19 infection can be made by using multiple methods, including detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus in upper respiratory tract samples, such as nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, and lower respiratory tract samples, such as sputum and bronchial lavage samples.The sensitivity and specificity of tests vary according to the type of assays used, site sampled, and timing of specimen collection relative to the symptom onset. It is therefore crucial to recognize individual test characteristics before COVID-19 infection is reliably diagnosed.

In LMICs, COVID-19 diagnosis may be compounded by issues of cost, access, and feasibility of testing. However, there is little literature to guide a specific testing strategy, and the current Surviving Sepsis guidelines for COVID-19 do not recommend a tailored approach to LMICs.In this section, we summarize the existing literature on microbiologic testing with the goal of providing pragmatic and feasible recommendations from an LMIC perspective.

Search results.

MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were searched through the end of October 2020. The search used combinations of medical subject headings (MeSH) terms and free-text words, including “COVID–19,” “coronavirus,” “SARS–CoV–2,” and “testing,” “microbiology,” “NP swab,” “lavage,” “endotracheal aspirate,” “sputum,” “serology,” and “antibody.” The search neither identified any publications from LMICs nor found articles with specific recommendations for LMICs.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^dc9bbca1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing guideline—question generation and search strategy are described as follows: Clinical questions were developed in Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes (PICO) format, with panel members prioritizing patient-oriented outcomes related to SARS-CoV-2 testing and considering the impact of results on infection prevention and public health practices. In this update, the panel retired questions on testing specimens from the upper versus lower respiratory tract in patients with lower respiratory tract disease and on testing of immunocompromised individuals due to absence of relevant data. The evidence search used a highly sensitive search from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), added the term COVID, and queried Ovid Medline, Embase, and Cochrane for studies from 2019 through July 1, 2022, with horizon scans, consultation with field experts, and review of reference lists and panelist-suggested literature; preprints were followed for final publication but were not included unless published.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^1f1f3f2a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 has evolved during the pandemic as seroprevalence in global populations has increased. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) convened an expert panel to perform a systematic review of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) serology literature and construct updated best practice guidance related to SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing. This guideline is an update to the fourth in a series of rapid, frequently updated COVID-19 guidelines developed by IDSA.

Objective

To develop evidence-based recommendations and identify unmet research needs pertaining to the use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests for diagnosis, decisions related to vaccination and administration of monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma in immunocompromised patients, and identification of a serologic correlate of immunity.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists and experts in systematic literature reviewed, identified, and prioritized clinical questions related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations.

Results

The panel recommends against serologic testing to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first two weeks after symptom onset (strong recommendations, low certainty of evidence). Serologic testing should not be used to provide evidence of COVID-19 in symptomatic patients with a high clinical suspicion and repeatedly negative nucleic acid amplification test results (strong recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Serologic testing may assist with the diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (strong recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). To seek evidence for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, the panel suggests testing for IgG, IgG/IgM, or total antibodies to nucleocapsid protein three to five weeks after symptom onset (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). In individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination, we suggest against routine serologic testing given no demonstrated benefit to improving patient outcomes (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence.) The panel acknowledges further that a negative spike antibody test may be a useful metric to identify immunocompromised patients who are candidates for immune therapy.

Conclusions

The high seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 worldwide limits the utility of detecting anti-SARS CoV-2 antibody. The certainty of available evidence supporting the use of serology for diagnosis was graded as very low to low. Future studies should use serologic assays calibrated to a common reference standard.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: antigen testing [^c10a10b8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Immunoassays designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 protein antigens are now commercially available. The most widely used tests are rapid lateral flow assays that generate results in approximately 15 minutes for diagnosis at the point-of-care. Higher throughput, laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2 antigen (Ag) assays have also been developed. The overall accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests, however, is not well defined. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) convened an expert panel to perform a systematic review of the literature and develop best practice guidance related to SARS-CoV-2 Ag testing. This guideline is the third in a series of rapid, frequently updated COVID-19 diagnostic guidelines developed by IDSA.

Objective

IDSA's goal was to develop evidence-based recommendations or suggestions that assist clinicians, clinical laboratories, patients, public health authorities, administrators and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests in both medical and non-medical settings.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists and experts in systematic literature review identified and prioritized clinical questions related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations.

Results

The panel agreed on five diagnostic recommendations. These recommendations address antigen testing in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals as well as assess single versus repeat testing strategies.

Conclusions

Data on the clinical performance of U.S. Food and Drug Administration SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests with Emergency Use Authorization is mostly limited to single, one-time testing versus standard nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) as the reference standard. Rapid Ag tests have high specificity and low to modest sensitivity compared to reference NAAT methods. Antigen test sensitivity is heavily dependent on viral load, with differences observed between symptomatic compared to asymptomatic individuals and the time of testing post onset of symptoms. Based on these observations, rapid RT-PCR or laboratory-based NAAT remain the diagnostic methods of choice for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, when molecular testing is not readily available or is logistically infeasible, Ag testing can help identify some individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The overall quality of available evidence supporting use of Ag testing was graded as very low to moderate.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing [^bdc9dcde]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Accurate molecular diagnostic tests are necessary for confirming a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Direct detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acids in respiratory tract specimens informs patient, healthcare institution and public health level decision-making. The numbers of available SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection tests are rapidly increasing, as is the COVID-19 diagnostic literature. Thus, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recognized a significant need for frequently updated systematic reviews of the literature to inform evidence-based best practice guidance.

Objective

The IDSA's goal was to develop an evidence-based diagnostic guideline to assist clinicians, clinical laboratorians, patients and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests. In addition, we provide a conceptual framework for understanding molecular diagnostic test performance, discuss the nuance of test result interpretation in a variety of practice settings and highlight important unmet research needs in the COVID-19 diagnostic testing space.

Methods

IDSA convened a multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists, and experts in systematic literature review to identify and prioritize clinical questions and outcomes related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostics. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations.

Results

The panel agreed on 17 diagnostic recommendations.

Conclusions

Universal access to accurate SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing is critical for patient care, hospital infection prevention and the public response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Information on the clinical performance of available tests is rapidly emerging, but the quality of evidence of the current literature is considered moderate to very low. Recognizing these limitations, the IDSA panel weighed available diagnostic evidence and recommends nucleic acid testing for all symptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19. In addition, testing is recommended for asymptomatic individuals with known or suspected contact with a COVID-19 case. Testing asymptomatic individuals without known exposure is suggested when the results will impact isolation/quarantine/personal protective equipment (PPE) usage decisions, dictate eligibility for surgery, or inform solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation timing. Ultimately, prioritization of testing will depend on institutional-specific resources and the needs of different patient populations.

### ESCMID COVID-19 guidelines: diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 [^fea9363b]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Scope

The objective of these guidelines is to identify the most appropriate diagnostic test and/or diagnostic approach for SARS-CoV-2. The recommendations are intended to provide guidance to clinicians, clinical microbiologists, other health care personnel, and decision makers.

Methods

An ESCMID COVID-19 guidelines task force was established by the ESCMID Executive Committee. A small group was established, half appointed by the chair and the remaining selected with an open call. Each panel met virtually once a week. For all decisions, a simple majority vote was used. A list of clinical questions using the PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcome) format was developed at the beginning of the process. For each PICO, two panel members performed a literature search focusing on systematic reviews, with a third panellist involved in case of inconsistent results. Quality of evidence assessment was based on the GRADE-ADOLOPMENT (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation - adoption, adaptation, and de novo development of recommendations) approach.

Recommendations

A total of 43 PICO questions were selected that involve the following types of populations: (a) patients with signs and symptoms of COVID-19; (b) travellers, healthcare workers, and other individuals at risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2; (c) asymptomatic individuals, and (d) close contacts of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The type of diagnostic test (commercial rapid nucleic acid amplification tests and rapid antigen detection), biomaterial, time since onset of symptoms/contact with an infectious case, age, disease severity, and risk of developing severe disease are also taken into consideration.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 disease [^2e301a2b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Some people with SARS-CoV-2 infection remain asymptomatic, whilst in others the infection can cause mild to moderate COVID-19 disease and COVID-19 pneumonia, leading some patients to require intensive care support and, in some cases, to death, especially in older adults. Symptoms such as fever or cough, and signs such as oxygen saturation or lung auscultation findings, are the first and most readily available diagnostic information. Such information could be used to either rule out COVID-19 disease, or select patients for further diagnostic testing.

Objectives

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms to determine if a person presenting in primary care or to hospital outpatient settings, such as the emergency department or dedicated COVID-19 clinics, has COVID-19 disease or COVID-19 pneumonia.

Search Methods

On 27 April 2020, we undertook electronic searches in the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the University of Bern living search database, which is updated daily with published articles from PubMed and Embase and with preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID-19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Studies were eligible if they included patients with suspected COVID-19 disease, or if they recruited known cases with COVID-19 disease and controls without COVID-19. Studies were eligible when they recruited patients presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings. Studies including patients who contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection while admitted to hospital were not eligible. The minimum eligible sample size of studies was 10 participants. All signs and symptoms were eligible for this review, including individual signs and symptoms or combinations. We accepted a range of reference standards including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), clinical expertise, imaging, serology tests and World Health Organization (WHO) or other definitions of COVID-19.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of review authors independently selected all studies, at both title and abstract stage and full-text stage. They resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Two review authors independently extracted data and resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias using the QUADAS-2 checklist. Analyses were descriptive, presenting sensitivity and specificity in paired forest plots, in ROC (receiver operating characteristic) space and in dumbbell plots. We did not attempt meta-analysis due to the small number of studies, heterogeneity across studies and the high risk of bias.

Main Results

We identified 16 studies including 7706 participants in total. Prevalence of COVID-19 disease varied from 5% to 38% with a median of 17%. There were no studies from primary care settings, although we did find seven studies in outpatient clinics (2172 participants), and four studies in the emergency department (1401 participants). We found data on 27 signs and symptoms, which fall into four different categories: systemic, respiratory, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular. No studies assessed combinations of different signs and symptoms and results were highly variable across studies. Most had very low sensitivity and high specificity; only six symptoms had a sensitivity of at least 50% in at least one study: cough, sore throat, fever, myalgia or arthralgia, fatigue, and headache. Of these, fever, myalgia or arthralgia, fatigue, and headache could be considered red flags (defined as having a positive likelihood ratio of at least 5) for COVID-19 as their specificity was above 90%, meaning that they substantially increase the likelihood of COVID-19 disease when present. Seven studies carried a high risk of bias for selection of participants because inclusion in the studies depended on the applicable testing and referral protocols, which included many of the signs and symptoms under study in this review. Five studies only included participants with pneumonia on imaging, suggesting that this is a highly selected population. In an additional four studies, we were unable to assess the risk for selection bias. These factors make it very difficult to determine the diagnostic properties of these signs and symptoms from the included studies. We also had concerns about the applicability of these results, since most studies included participants who were already admitted to hospital or presenting to hospital settings. This makes these findings less applicable to people presenting to primary care, who may have less severe illness and a lower prevalence of COVID-19 disease. None of the studies included any data on children, and only one focused specifically on older adults. We hope that future updates of this review will be able to provide more information about the diagnostic properties of signs and symptoms in different settings and age groups.

Authors' Conclusions

The individual signs and symptoms included in this review appear to have very poor diagnostic properties, although this should be interpreted in the context of selection bias and heterogeneity between studies. Based on currently available data, neither absence nor presence of signs or symptoms are accurate enough to rule in or rule out disease. Prospective studies in an unselected population presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings, examining combinations of signs and symptoms to evaluate the syndromic presentation of COVID-19 disease, are urgently needed. Results from such studies could inform subsequent management decisions such as self-isolation or selecting patients for further diagnostic testing. We also need data on potentially more specific symptoms such as loss of sense of smell. Studies in older adults are especially important.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^98dcbd69]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The clinical implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection are highly variable. Some people with SARS-CoV-2 infection remain asymptomatic, whilst the infection can cause mild to moderate COVID-19 and COVID-19 pneumonia in others. This can lead to some people requiring intensive care support and, in some cases, to death, especially in older adults. Symptoms such as fever, cough, or loss of smell or taste, and signs such as oxygen saturation are the first and most readily available diagnostic information. Such information could be used to either rule out COVID-19, or select patients for further testing. This is an update of this review, the first version of which published in July 2020.

Objectives

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms to determine if a person presenting in primary care or to hospital outpatient settings, such as the emergency department or dedicated COVID-19 clinics, has COVID-19.

Search Methods

For this review iteration we undertook electronic searches up to 15 July 2020 in the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the University of Bern living search database. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID-19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Studies were eligible if they included patients with clinically suspected COVID-19, or if they recruited known cases with COVID-19 and controls without COVID-19. Studies were eligible when they recruited patients presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings. Studies in hospitalised patients were only included if symptoms and signs were recorded on admission or at presentation. Studies including patients who contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection while admitted to hospital were not eligible. The minimum eligible sample size of studies was 10 participants. All signs and symptoms were eligible for this review, including individual signs and symptoms or combinations. We accepted a range of reference standards.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of review authors independently selected all studies, at both title and abstract stage and full-text stage. They resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Two review authors independently extracted data and resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias using the Quality Assessment tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) checklist. We presented sensitivity and specificity in paired forest plots, in receiver operating characteristic space and in dumbbell plots. We estimated summary parameters using a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis whenever five or more primary studies were available, and whenever heterogeneity across studies was deemed acceptable.

Main Results

We identified 44 studies including 26,884 participants in total. Prevalence of COVID-19 varied from 3% to 71% with a median of 21%. There were three studies from primary care settings (1824 participants), nine studies from outpatient testing centres (10,717 participants), 12 studies performed in hospital outpatient wards (5061 participants), seven studies in hospitalised patients (1048 participants), 10 studies in the emergency department (3173 participants), and three studies in which the setting was not specified (5061 participants). The studies did not clearly distinguish mild from severe COVID-19, so we present the results for all disease severities together. Fifteen studies had a high risk of bias for selection of participants because inclusion in the studies depended on the applicable testing and referral protocols, which included many of the signs and symptoms under study in this review. This may have especially influenced the sensitivity of those features used in referral protocols, such as fever and cough. Five studies only included participants with pneumonia on imaging, suggesting that this is a highly selected population. In an additional 12 studies, we were unable to assess the risk for selection bias. This makes it very difficult to judge the validity of the diagnostic accuracy of the signs and symptoms from these included studies. The applicability of the results of this review update improved in comparison with the original review. A greater proportion of studies included participants who presented to outpatient settings, which is where the majority of clinical assessments for COVID-19 take place. However, still none of the studies presented any data on children separately, and only one focused specifically on older adults. We found data on 84 signs and symptoms. Results were highly variable across studies. Most had very low sensitivity and high specificity. Only cough (25 studies) and fever (7 studies) had a pooled sensitivity of at least 50% but specificities were moderate to low. Cough had a sensitivity of 67.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 59.8% to 74.1%) and specificity of 35.0% (95% CI 28.7% to 41.9%). Fever had a sensitivity of 53.8% (95% CI 35.0% to 71.7%) and a specificity of 67.4% (95% CI 53.3% to 78.9%). The pooled positive likelihood ratio of cough was only 1.04 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.11) and that of fever 1.65 (95% CI 1.41 to 1.93). Anosmia alone (11 studies), ageusia alone (6 studies), and anosmia or ageusia (6 studies) had sensitivities below 50% but specificities over 90%. Anosmia had a pooled sensitivity of 28.0% (95% CI 17.7% to 41.3%) and a specificity of 93.4% (95% CI 88.3% to 96.4%). Ageusia had a pooled sensitivity of 24.8% (95% CI 12.4% to 43.5%) and a specificity of 91.4% (95% CI 81.3% to 96.3%). Anosmia or ageusia had a pooled sensitivity of 41.0% (95% CI 27.0% to 56.6%) and a specificity of 90.5% (95% CI 81.2% to 95.4%). The pooled positive likelihood ratios of anosmia alone and anosmia or ageusia were 4.25 (95% CI 3.17 to 5.71) and 4.31 (95% CI 3.00 to 6.18) respectively, which is just below our arbitrary definition of a 'red flag', that is, a positive likelihood ratio of at least 5. The pooled positive likelihood ratio of ageusia alone was only 2.88 (95% CI 2.02 to 4.09). Only two studies assessed combinations of different signs and symptoms, mostly combining fever and cough with other symptoms. These combinations had a specificity above 80%, but at the cost of very low sensitivity (< 30%).

Authors' Conclusions

The majority of individual signs and symptoms included in this review appear to have very poor diagnostic accuracy, although this should be interpreted in the context of selection bias and heterogeneity between studies. Based on currently available data, neither absence nor presence of signs or symptoms are accurate enough to rule in or rule out COVID-19. The presence of anosmia or ageusia may be useful as a red flag for COVID-19. The presence of fever or cough, given their high sensitivities, may also be useful to identify people for further testing. Prospective studies in an unselected population presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings, examining combinations of signs and symptoms to evaluate the syndromic presentation of COVID-19, are still urgently needed. Results from such studies could inform subsequent management decisions.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^3ff43b6f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 illness is highly variable, ranging from infection with no symptoms through to pneumonia and life-threatening consequences. Symptoms such as fever, cough, or loss of sense of smell (anosmia) or taste (ageusia), can help flag early on if the disease is present. Such information could be used either to rule out COVID-19 disease, or to identify people who need to go for COVID-19 diagnostic tests. This is the second update of this review, which was first published in 2020.

Objectives

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms to determine if a person presenting in primary care or to hospital outpatient settings, such as the emergency department or dedicated COVID-19 clinics, has COVID-19.

Search Methods

We undertook electronic searches up to 10 June 2021 in the University of Bern living search database. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID-19 publications. We used artificial intelligence text analysis to conduct an initial classification of documents. We did not apply any language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Studies were eligible if they included people with clinically suspected COVID-19, or recruited known cases with COVID-19 and also controls without COVID-19 from a single-gate cohort. Studies were eligible when they recruited people presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings. Studies that included people who contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection while admitted to hospital were not eligible. The minimum eligible sample size of studies was 10 participants. All signs and symptoms were eligible for this review, including individual signs and symptoms or combinations. We accepted a range of reference standards.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of review authors independently selected all studies, at both title and abstract, and full-text stage. They resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the QUADAS-2 checklist, and resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Analyses were restricted to prospective studies only. We presented sensitivity and specificity in paired forest plots, in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space and in dumbbell plots. We estimated summary parameters using a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis whenever five or more primary prospective studies were available, and whenever heterogeneity across studies was deemed acceptable.

Main Results

We identified 90 studies; for this update we focused on the results of 42 prospective studies with 52,608 participants. Prevalence of COVID-19 disease varied from 3.7% to 60.6% with a median of 27.4%. Thirty-five studies were set in emergency departments or outpatient test centres (46,878 participants), three in primary care settings (1230 participants), two in a mixed population of in- and outpatients in a paediatric hospital setting (493 participants), and two overlapping studies in nursing homes (4007 participants). The studies did not clearly distinguish mild COVID-19 disease from COVID-19 pneumonia, so we present the results for both conditions together. Twelve studies had a high risk of bias for selection of participants because they used a high level of preselection to decide whether reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing was needed, or because they enrolled a non-consecutive sample, or because they excluded individuals while they were part of the study base. We rated 36 of the 42 studies as high risk of bias for the index tests because there was little or no detail on how, by whom and when, the symptoms were measured. For most studies, eligibility for testing was dependent on the local case definition and testing criteria that were in effect at the time of the study, meaning most people who were included in studies had already been referred to health services based on the symptoms that we are evaluating in this review. The applicability of the results of this review iteration improved in comparison with the previous reviews. This version has more studies of people presenting to ambulatory settings, which is where the majority of assessments for COVID-19 take place. Only three studies presented any data on children separately, and only one focused specifically on older adults. We found data on 96 symptoms or combinations of signs and symptoms. Evidence on individual signs as diagnostic tests was rarely reported, so this review reports mainly on the diagnostic value of symptoms. Results were highly variable across studies. Most had very low sensitivity and high specificity. RT-PCR was the most often used reference standard (40/42 studies). Only cough (11 studies) had a summary sensitivity above 50% (62.4%, 95% CI 50.6% to 72.9%)); its specificity was low (45.4%, 95% CI 33.5% to 57.9%)). Presence of fever had a sensitivity of 37.6% (95% CI 23.4% to 54.3%) and a specificity of 75.2% (95% CI 56.3% to 87.8%). The summary positive likelihood ratio of cough was 1.14 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.25) and that of fever 1.52 (95% CI 1.10 to 2.10). Sore throat had a summary positive likelihood ratio of 0.814 (95% CI 0.714 to 0.929), which means that its presence increases the probability of having an infectious disease other than COVID-19. Dyspnoea (12 studies) and fatigue (8 studies) had a sensitivity of 23.3% (95% CI 16.4% to 31.9%) and 40.2% (95% CI 19.4% to 65.1%) respectively. Their specificity was 75.7% (95% CI 65.2% to 83.9%) and 73.6% (95% CI 48.4% to 89.3%). The summary positive likelihood ratio of dyspnoea was 0.96 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.11) and that of fatigue 1.52 (95% CI 1.21 to 1.91), which means that the presence of fatigue slightly increases the probability of having COVID-19. Anosmia alone (7 studies), ageusia alone (5 studies), and anosmia or ageusia (6 studies) had summary sensitivities below 50% but summary specificities over 90%. Anosmia had a summary sensitivity of 26.4% (95% CI 13.8% to 44.6%) and a specificity of 94.2% (95% CI 90.6% to 96.5%). Ageusia had a summary sensitivity of 23.2% (95% CI 10.6% to 43.3%) and a specificity of 92.6% (95% CI 83.1% to 97.0%). Anosmia or ageusia had a summary sensitivity of 39.2% (95% CI 26.5% to 53.6%) and a specificity of 92.1% (95% CI 84.5% to 96.2%). The summary positive likelihood ratios of anosmia alone and anosmia or ageusia were 4.55 (95% CI 3.46 to 5.97) and 4.99 (95% CI 3.22 to 7.75) respectively, which is just below our arbitrary definition of a 'red flag', that is, a positive likelihood ratio of at least 5. The summary positive likelihood ratio of ageusia alone was 3.14 (95% CI 1.79 to 5.51). Twenty-four studies assessed combinations of different signs and symptoms, mostly combining olfactory symptoms. By combining symptoms with other information such as contact or travel history, age, gender, and a local recent case detection rate, some multivariable prediction scores reached a sensitivity as high as 90%.

Authors' Conclusions

Most individual symptoms included in this review have poor diagnostic accuracy. Neither absence nor presence of symptoms are accurate enough to rule in or rule out the disease. The presence of anosmia or ageusia may be useful as a red flag for the presence of COVID-19. The presence of cough also supports further testing. There is currently no evidence to support further testing with PCR in any individuals presenting only with upper respiratory symptoms such as sore throat, coryza or rhinorrhoea. Combinations of symptoms with other readily available information such as contact or travel history, or the local recent case detection rate may prove more useful and should be further investigated in an unselected population presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings. The diagnostic accuracy of symptoms for COVID-19 is moderate to low and any testing strategy using symptoms as selection mechanism will result in both large numbers of missed cases and large numbers of people requiring testing. Which one of these is minimised, is determined by the goal of COVID-19 testing strategies, that is, controlling the epidemic by isolating every possible case versus identifying those with clinically important disease so that they can be monitored or treated to optimise their prognosis. The former will require a testing strategy that uses very few symptoms as entry criterion for testing, the latter could focus on more specific symptoms such as fever and anosmia.

### Prevalence, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of pediatric COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^5a3b2647]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The novel coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing challenge faced by the public and health care systems around the globe. Majority of information and evidence gathered so far regarding COVID-19 has been derived from data and studies in adult populations. Crucial information regarding the characterization, clinical symptomatology, sequelae, and overall outcomes in the pediatric population is lacking. As such, we aimed to conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis and systematic review to collect and analyze current evidence about COVID-19 in the pediatric population.

Method

A systematic search and review of scientific literatures was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Medline, and Google Scholar databases. All relevant studies until June 16, 2020 were included. Studies were reviewed for methodological quality, and random-effects model was used to conduct the primary meta-analysis. I 2 value and Egger's test was used to estimate heterogeneity and publication bias respectively.

Results

We reviewed 20 eligible studies that included 1810 pediatric patient population (<21 yo) with PCR tested COVID-19 positivity. In pooled data, majority (25 % [CI 18-32], I 2 59 %) of overall COVID-19 positive patients fell in the 6-10 yr age group. 13 % ([CI 11-14], I 2 78 %) of the patients were asymptomatic, with headache (67 % [CI 60-74], I 2 46 %), fever (55 % [CI 52-58], I 2 61 %), and cough (45 % [CI 42-49], I 2 79 %) accounting for the most prevalent physical signs seen in symptomatic patients. Leukopenia (12 % [CI 9-15], I 2 50 %) and lymphopenia (15 % [CI 13-19], I 2 85 %) was common. Elevated Ferritin (26 % [CI 16-40], I 2 73 %), Procal (25 % [CI 21-29 %], I 2 83 %), and CRP (19 % [CI 16-22 %], I 2 74 %) were other laboratory abnormalities commonly observed. Common radiological features were ground-glass opacities (36 % [CI 32-39 %], I 2 92 %), normal finding (33 % [CI 30-36 %], I 2 81 %), and consolidation. 29 % ([CI 26-33], I 2 85 %) of the patient cases was non-severe, whereas only 5 % ([CI 1-8], I 2 87 %) was severe. Mortality was observed in 0.3 % ([CI 0.1-0.4], I 2 0%) of the overall cases.

Conclusion

COVID-19 is prevalent across all pediatric age-groups and presents with varying degree of symptomology. However, children have a milder course of the disease with extremely favorable prognosis. Laboratory and radiological features are inconsistent and require further investigations. Additional studies are needed on this topic to corroborate findings and establish evidence-based and consistent characterization of COVID-19 in the pediatric population.

### Screening for COVID-19: patient factors predicting positive PCR test [^e0d1542c]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2020). Medium credibility.

To inform the efficient allocation of testing resources, we evaluated the characteristics of those tested for COVID-19 to determine predictors of a positive test. Recent travel and exposure to a confirmed case were both highly predictive of positive testing. Symptom-based screening strategies alone may be inadequate to control the ongoing pandemic.

### Diagnostics for COVID-19: moving from pandemic response to control [^dad72b5f]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Diagnostics have proven to be crucial to the COVID-19 pandemic response. There are three major methods for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection and their role has evolved during the course of the pandemic. Molecular tests such as PCR are highly sensitive and specific at detecting viral RNA, and are recommended by WHO for confirming diagnosis in individuals who are symptomatic and for activating public health measures. Antigen rapid detection tests detect viral proteins and, although they are less sensitive than molecular tests, have the advantages of being easier to do, giving a faster time to result, of being lower cost, and able to detect infection in those who are most likely to be at risk of transmitting the virus to others. Antigen rapid detection tests can be used as a public health tool for screening individuals at enhanced risk of infection, to protect people who are clinically vulnerable, to ensure safe travel and the resumption of schooling and social activities, and to enable economic recovery. With vaccine roll-out, antibody tests (which detect the host's response to infection or vaccination) can be useful surveillance tools to inform public policy, but should not be used to provide proof of immunity, as the correlates of protection remain unclear. All three types of COVID-19 test continue to have a crucial role in the transition from pandemic response to pandemic control.

### Effectiveness of tests to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus, and antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, to inform COVID-19 diagnosis: a rapid systematic review [^3ab1da44]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Objectives

We undertook a rapid systematic review with the aim of identifying evidence that could be used to answer the following research questions: (1) What is the clinical effectiveness of tests that detect the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to inform COVID-19 diagnosis? (2) What is the clinical effectiveness of tests that detect the presence of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus to inform COVID-19 diagnosis?

Design and Setting

Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of diagnostic test accuracy. We systematically searched for all published evidence on the effectiveness of tests for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus, or antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, up to 4 May 2020, and assessed relevant studies for risks of bias using the QUADAS-2 framework.

Main Outcome Measures

Measures of diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive value) were the main outcomes of interest. We also included studies that reported influence of testing on subsequent patient management, and that reported virus/antibody detection rates where these facilitated comparisons of testing in different settings, different populations or using different sampling methods.

Results

38 studies on SARS-CoV-2 virus testing and 25 studies on SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing were identified. We identified high or unclear risks of bias in the majority of studies, most commonly as a result of unclear methods of patient selection and test conduct, or because of the use of a reference standard that may not definitively diagnose COVID-19. The majority were in hospital settings, in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. Pooled analysis of 16 studies (3818 patients) estimated a sensitivity of 87.8% (95% CI 81.5% to 92.2%) for an initial reverse-transcriptase PCR test. For antibody tests, 10 studies reported diagnostic accuracy outcomes: sensitivity ranged from 18.4% to 96.1% and specificity 88.9% to 100%. However, the lack of a true reference standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis makes it challenging to assess the true diagnostic accuracy of these tests. Eighteen studies reporting different sampling methods suggest that for virus tests, the type of sample obtained/type of tissue sampled could influence test accuracy. Finally, we searched for, but did not identify, any evidence on how any test influences subsequent patient management.

Conclusions

Evidence is rapidly emerging on the effectiveness of tests for COVID-19 diagnosis and management, but important uncertainties about their effectiveness and most appropriate application remain. Estimates of diagnostic accuracy should be interpreted bearing in mind the absence of a definitive reference standard to diagnose or rule out COVID-19 infection. More evidence is needed about the effectiveness of testing outside of hospital settings and in mild or asymptomatic cases. Implementation of public health strategies centred on COVID-19 testing provides opportunities to explore these important areas of research.

### Post-COVID-19 condition symptoms among emergency department patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection [^5bf6a5bf]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Symptoms of the Post-COVID-19 Condition are often non-specific making it a challenge to distinguish them from symptoms due to other medical conditions. In this study, we compare the proportion of emergency department patients who developed symptoms consistent with the World Health Organization's Post-COVID-19 Condition clinical case definition between those who tested positive for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 infection and time-matched patients who tested negative. Our results show that over one-third of emergency department patients with a proven acute infection meet Post-COVID-19 Condition criteria 3 months post-index visit. However, one in five test-negative patients who claim never having been infected also report symptoms consistent with Post-COVID-19 Condition highlighting the lack of specificity of the clinical case definition. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 during the acute phase of a suspected infection should continue until specific biomarkers of Post-COVID-19 Condition become available for diagnosis and treatment.

### Challenges and controversies to testing for COVID-19 [^41e42c37]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has placed the clinical laboratory and testing for SARS-CoV-2 front and center in the worldwide discussion of how to end the outbreak. Clinical laboratories have responded by developing, validating, and implementing a variety of molecular and serologic assays to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This has played an essential role in identifying cases, informing isolation decisions, and helping to curb the spread of disease. However, as the demand for COVID-19 testing has increased, laboratory professionals have faced a growing list of challenges, uncertainties, and, in some situations, controversy, as they have attempted to balance the need for increasing test capacity with maintaining a high-quality laboratory operation. The emergence of this new viral pathogen has raised unique diagnostic questions for which there have not always been straightforward answers. In this commentary, the author addresses several areas of current debate, including (i) the role of molecular assays in defining the duration of isolation/quarantine, (ii) whether the PCR cycle threshold value should be included on patient reports, (iii) if specimen pooling and testing by research staff represent acceptable solutions to expand screening, and (iv) whether testing a large percentage of the population is feasible and represents a viable strategy to end the pandemic.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^8172686c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale

It is essential to understand the accuracy of diagnostic tests including signs and symptoms to identify the best way they can be used in different settings to develop effective diagnostic and management pathways. We are producing a suite of Cochrane 'living systematic reviews', which will summarise evidence on the clinical accuracy of different tests and diagnostic features, grouped according to present research questions and settings, in the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease. Summary estimates of accuracy from these reviews will help inform diagnostic, screening, isolation, and patient management decisions.

New tests are being developed and evidence is emerging at an unprecedented rate during the COVID‐19 pandemic. We will aim to update these reviews as often as is feasible to ensure that they provide the most up‐to‐date evidence about test accuracy.

These reviews are being produced rapidly to assist in providing a central resource of evidence to assist in the COVID‐19 pandemic, summarising available evidence on the accuracy of the tests and presenting characteristics.

### Prevalence of symptoms ≤ 12 months after acute illness, by COVID-19 testing status among adults-United States, December 2020-March 2023 [^0dda7581]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, among the COVID test–negative group, no information on any other condition that might have caused the reported acute symptoms is available. Second, although the number of participants who subsequently reported a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result was higher in the COVID test–negative than in the COVID test–positive group, the rate of nonresponse to the question about having a subsequent SARS-CoV-2 test result was relatively higher in the COVID test–negative group. Testing was not systematically performed and participants with a subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection might have not tested or might have received a false-negative test result. However, analysis including participants who reported subsequent positive test results did not differ substantially; thus, the results are not likely driven by subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infections. Infection with any other pathogen or the occurrence of other medical problems might have been experienced by persons in either group and could account for some reported symptoms. Third, the survey did not include all possible symptoms; therefore, other symptoms might not have been captured. Finally, this study did not report symptom severity or impact on daily activities, thus the functional significance of these findings could not be assessed.

Implications for Public Health Practice

Given the findings that approximately 16% of persons who have had an acute COVID-like illness might experience persistent symptoms through 12 months, post-COVID–like conditions could represent a substantial impact on health and the health care system. This report highlights the patterns of symptoms after acute COVID-like illness by providing estimates of symptom prevalence for both ongoing and emerging symptoms. Improved understanding of the persistent and fluctuating nature of symptoms could guide clinical care and public health response to post-COVID–like conditions.

### Utility of retesting for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19 in hospitalized patients: impact of the interval between tests [^e20610dc]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Molecular testing of nasopharyngeal specimens for SARS-CoV-2 are highly specific and sensitive. However, SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding within the respiratory specimens of individual patients may not be dependable or consistent throughout the course of illness. - The range of clinical presentations of COVID-19 present a diagnostic dilemma; reports of false positivesadd to uncertainty. Retesting of patients is increasingly requested in the setting of ongoing concern for COVID-19 after an initial negative test. Which patients should be prioritized for retesting and at what time interval are currently unclear.

IDSA algorithm for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection—community exposure testing timing and assay approaches are outlined as follows: individuals who have been exposed to someone known or suspected of having COVID-19 should be tested at least 5 days after the exposure, and if symptoms develop before 5 days, they should get tested immediately. For nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), either rapid or standard laboratory-based testing is suggested, and NAAT refers to rapid (i.e. ≤60 minutes in-laboratory turnaround time) or laboratory-based nucleic acid amplification test. Either point-of-care or laboratory-based antigen testing is suggested. The panel makes no recommendation for or against antigen testing for students in educational settings, employees at work, or individuals planning to attend a large social gathering, and no recommendation for or against home testing using NAAT. For timing of repeat testing for a specific assay, users should consult the respective assay package insert or the latest FDA guidance.

Recommendation 8—NAAT in asymptomatic individuals before hospital admission—states that the IDSA panel suggests against routine SARS-CoV-2 NAAT in asymptomatic individuals without a known exposure to COVID-19 who are being hospitalized (conditional recommendation, very low certainty evidence). Remarks note that the IDSA panel was unable to identify studies published during the period of literature review that showed reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission to healthcare providers or to other patients resulting from prehospitalization testing, and that the evidence was indirect and assessed only diagnostic test accuracy in studies of symptomatic patients alone or together with asymptomatic patients.

Recommendation 9: NAAT in asymptomatic individuals undergoing procedures—The IDSA panel suggests against routine SARS-CoV-2 NAAT of asymptomatic individuals without a known exposure to COVID-19 who are undergoing a medical or surgical procedure (conditional recommendation, very low certainty evidence). Remarks note that NAAT is used to determine presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, which may not represent infectious virus, and that detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory specimens without evidence of infectious virus has been reported widely; the panel concluded that data were insufficient to establish SARS-CoV-2 infectiousness based on non-standardized instrument signal values, such as cycle threshold (Ct) values; and decisions on timing of a procedure in a patient with prior SARS CoV-2 infection must balance the risk to the patient against the risks of delaying or avoiding the planned procedure and should consider patient-related factors (e.g., vaccination status, symptomatic status, age).

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: antigen testing (January 2023) [^3080798a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America COVID-19 antigen testing—conclusions on diagnostic performance and use: Antigen (Ag) testing had a sensitivity of 80% in symptomatic individuals and 63% in asymptomatic persons, with pooled specificities of close to 100% in both populations, compared with a single standard nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). Despite the low sensitivity of Ag tests, standard NAAT remains the benchmark testing approach for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially when the pretest probability of infection is moderate to high or the harms of falsely negative results are significant. When standard NAAT is not available, timely, or feasible, Ag testing can be used without the need to routinely confirm positive test results. A negative Ag test does not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection; ideally, negative Ag test results should be confirmed by standard NAAT if the suspicion of COVID-19 is moderate or high, and repeat Ag testing may be considered when standard NAAT is not an option. A negative Ag test does not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infectiousness, although a positive Ag test makes infectiousness more likely.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing guideline—abstract states that accurate molecular diagnostic tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are necessary to confirm coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and that direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids in respiratory specimens informs decision-making at patient, healthcare institution, and public health levels. The guideline’s goal was to develop an evidence-based diagnostic guideline to assist clinicians, clinical laboratorians, patients and policymakers in decisions related to optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests, with IDSA convening a multidisciplinary panel and using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations. The panel agreed on 12 diagnostic recommendations, and access to accurate SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing is described as critical for patient care and hospital infection prevention.

### Symptom duration and risk factors for delayed return to usual health among outpatients with COVID-19 in a multistate health care systems network-United States, March-June 2020 [^27ba1efe]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Prolonged symptom duration and disability are common in adults hospitalized with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Characterizing return to baseline health among outpatients with milder COVID-19 illness is important for understanding the full spectrum of COVID-19-associated illness and tailoring public health messaging, interventions, and policy. During April 15-June 25, 2020, telephone interviews were conducted with a random sample of adults aged ≥18 years who had a first positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, at an outpatient visit at one of 14 U.S. academic health care systems in 13 states. Interviews were conducted 14-21 days after the test date. Respondents were asked about demographic characteristics, baseline chronic medical conditions, symptoms present at the time of testing, whether those symptoms had resolved by the interview date, and whether they had returned to their usual state of health at the time of interview. Among 292 respondents, 94% (274) reported experiencing one or more symptoms at the time of testing; 35% of these symptomatic respondents reported not having returned to their usual state of health by the date of the interview (median = 16 days from testing date), including 26% among those aged 18-34 years, 32% among those aged 35-49 years, and 47% among those aged ≥50 years. Among respondents reporting cough, fatigue, or shortness of breath at the time of testing, 43%, 35%, and 29%, respectively, continued to experience these symptoms at the time of the interview. These findings indicate that COVID-19 can result in prolonged illness even among persons with milder outpatient illness, including young adults. Effective public health messaging targeting these groups is warranted. Preventative measures, including social distancing, frequent handwashing, and the consistent and correct use of face coverings in public, should be strongly encouraged to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

### At-home COVID-19 diagnostic tests: frequently asked questions (...) [^5eb2abaf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic tests can show if you have an active COVID-19 infection and need to take steps to quarantine or isolate yourself from others. This page supplements the information found at: At-Home OTC COVID-19 Diagnostic Tests and provides answers to frequently asked questions related to at-home COVID-19 diagnostic tests. This page is part of the FAQs on Testing for SARS-CoV-2. Q: When should I test for COVID-19. A: COVID-19 testing is important to find out if you have COVID-19 so that you can get treatment, if needed, as well as to be aware if you are infected and should stay away from people to help reduce the spread of the virus. You should test for COVID-19 in the following situations:
- If you have symptoms, test immediately, and then test again per the instructions if your first result is negative.
- If you were exposed to someone who has COVID-19 and you do not have symptoms, wait at least 5 full days after your exposure before testing.

If you test too early, you may have an inaccurate result.
- If you are in certain high-risk settings, you may need to test as part of a screening testing program.
- Consider testing before coming into contact with someone who has a high risk for severe COVID-19, people who are older adults or immunocompromised, or have other medical conditions, especially if you are in an area with a medium or high COVID-19 Hospital Admission Level. Q: I got a negative test result on an at-home COVID-19 antigen test. Do I need to take another test. A: Yes. The FDA recommends repeat testing following a negative COVID-19 antigen test result whether or not you have COVID-19 symptoms. COVID-19 antigen tests are less accurate than molecular tests and may not detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus early in an infection or in people who do not have COVID-19 symptoms.
- If you have COVID-19 symptoms, test again 48 hours after the first negative test, for a total of at least two tests.
- If you do not have COVID-19 symptoms, test again 48 hours after the first negative test, then 48 hours after the second negative test, for a total of at least three tests.
- If you get a positive result on any COVID-19 test, you most likely have COVID-19 and should follow the CDC guidance for people with COVID-19.

IDSA COVID-19 serology—Recommendation 5 states that when evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection is desired, the IDSA panel suggests using serologic assays that target nucleocapsid protein rather than spike protein (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). This is supported by remarks that most available vaccines result in formation of only anti-spike antibodies, that some inactivated whole virus vaccines can also result in anti-nucleocapsid antibodies, and that detection of anti-spike antibodies has low positive predictive value for diagnosis of recent COVID-19 in most individuals.
