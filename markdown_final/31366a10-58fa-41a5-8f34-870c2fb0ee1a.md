## Question

Polyarticular degenerative changes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing polyarticular degenerative changes, with explicit step-by-step thinking and self-verification language preserved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical problem and distinguishing degenerative from inflammatory polyarthritis. Then, I should verify the key elements of history and examination that separate noninflammatory from inflammatory patterns. Next, I will review the imaging strategy and how to interpret radiographic, ultrasound, and MRI findings in context. After that, I need to construct a prioritized differential diagnosis and outline red flags that mandate urgent action. Finally, I will synthesize management principles for polyarticular osteoarthritis and highlight pitfalls and special populations, ensuring each assertion is supported by appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct: polyarticular degenerative changes typically reflect osteoarthritis (OA) involving five or more joints, characterized by noninflammatory pain, brief morning stiffness, activity-related pain that improves with rest, and radiographic features such as joint space narrowing, osteophytes, and subchondral sclerosis. I should double-check that these features align with accepted definitions and prevalence estimates, which they do, noting OA is the most common cause of chronic polyarthritis in older adults and that radiographic hallmarks are well established [^1124uUZ4] [^11138GGz] [^113fg6yX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — before labeling this as degenerative, I need to ensure I am not missing inflammatory arthritis. I should confirm the absence of inflammatory features such as prolonged morning stiffness (> 30–60 minutes), warm/swollen joints with synovitis, systemic symptoms, and symmetric small-joint involvement, because rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory arthritides can mimic or coexist with OA and require different management pathways [^1124uUZ4] [^114pobUv].

> Next, I should review the history elements that refine pretest probabilities: age, sex, tempo (acute vs chronic), symmetry, distribution (distal interphalangeal, first metatarsophalangeal, knees, hips, spine), extra-articular features (skin, nails, eyes, GI), family history, and comorbidities such as obesity and metabolic syndrome. I need to check that these domains are consistently emphasized in diagnostic frameworks, which they are, and that they help distinguish OA from inflammatory and crystal arthropathies [^1124uUZ4] [^114pobUv] [^11138GGz].

> I will now examine the physical findings that support a degenerative pattern: bony enlargement (Heberden's/Bouchard's nodes), coarse crepitus, reduced range of motion, and joint-line tenderness, while actively looking for synovitis (boggy swelling), dactylitis, enthesitis, or rheumatoid nodules that would suggest inflammatory disease. Wait, let me verify that these exam maneuvers are validated discriminators — yes, palpation to distinguish bony hypertrophy from soft, boggy synovitis is repeatedly emphasized in primary care rheumatology guidance [^1124uUZ4] [^112Wu5Mg] [^113vba6p].

> Next, I should review the imaging strategy. Radiography remains first-line to confirm OA and establish a baseline, with classic findings of asymmetric joint space narrowing, osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis, and cysts, but I need to remember radiographs can be normal in early disease and are insensitive to soft-tissue inflammation. Ultrasound can detect effusions, synovitis, and guide injections, while MRI is more sensitive to early cartilage, bone marrow lesions, and periarticular soft-tissue changes but is not routinely indicated for uncomplicated OA. I should confirm these modality roles, which are consistent with contemporary guidance and reviews [^1124uUZ4] [^1152ewor] [^113fg6yX].

> But wait, what if the pattern is symmetric and erosive — could this still be OA? I should double-check for erosive OA, which can show central erosions and more dramatic joint destruction in the hands, and I must also consider psoriatic arthritis, which can show both erosions and new bone formation (e.g., pencil-in-cup, fluffy periostitis) and often has an asymmetric distribution. Radiographic coexistence of erosion and proliferation is a clue away from RA and toward PsA, so I need to inspect the films carefully and correlate with skin/nail findings [^111v6fgu] [^112GfwMw] [^115YYXWv].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis. Common causes of polyarticular pain include OA, RA, PsA, crystal arthropathies (gout, CPPD), and spondyloarthropathies. Less common considerations include metabolic/endocrine arthropathies (e.g., acromegaly, hemochromatosis), heritable connective tissue disorders (e.g. Stickler), and drug-induced or reactive arthritis. I should confirm that CPPD is frequently polyarticular and often coexists with OA, and that metabolic syndrome associates with degenerative spinal and entheseal changes rather than PsA-specific damage, which helps avoid overcalling inflammatory spondyloarthritis in the presence of mechanical degeneration [^1124uUZ4] [^117SwpYS] [^112A1L1v].

> Hold on, I should verify red flags and urgent scenarios: acute hot swollen joint raises concern for septic arthritis and mandates aspiration, rapidly progressive destructive change suggests RPDD or other aggressive arthropathies, and new neurologic deficits with spinal degenerative changes warrant urgent spine imaging. I need to ensure I do not miss these because delays can be limb- or life-threatening [^1124uUZ4] [^115QYFRg].

> Let me think about management principles for confirmed polyarticular OA. Core nonpharmacologic therapy includes education, structured land-based exercise, and weight management, with topical NSAIDs as first-line for hand/knee when appropriate and oral NSAIDs (prefer COX-2 selective or gastroprotection) for hip or polyarticular disease when benefits outweigh risks. I should confirm that acetaminophen has limited efficacy and that opioids are not recommended, and that intra-articular corticosteroids are conditionally supported for knee but not broadly for hip/polyarticular OA. These align with OARSI and ACR/AAFP guidance [^1163Xhsn] [^116QTzV7] [^115fJEex].

> Wait, I should verify pharmacologic nuances and comorbidity tailoring: topical NSAIDs are strongly recommended for knee OA and can be reasonable for hand OA, oral NSAIDs require cardiovascular and GI risk assessment, and duloxetine is a reasonable alternative for patients with contraindications to NSAIDs or persistent symptoms. I need to ensure I counsel that glucosamine/chondroitin and most supplements have weak or inconsistent evidence and are generally not recommended in guidelines, reinforcing a focus on core therapies and shared decision-making [^1163Xhsn] [^116QTzV7] [^115fJEex].

> Next, I should review special populations and pitfalls. In older adults, degenerative SI joint disease is common and often female-predominant, and can mimic sacroiliitis on radiographs, so I should correlate with MRI if inflammatory back pain is suspected. In patients with psoriasis or ICI therapy, I must not over-attribute pain to OA when inflammatory arthritis may be present. In children with polyarticular symptoms, I should consider JIA and rare noninflammatory entities like CACP or PPD rather than OA. And I should remember that spine degeneration is prevalent and often incidental, so I must correlate imaging with clinical findings to avoid overtreatment [^1157FPt4] [^115NVXQH] [^111KM8ag] [^115gMFfQ].

> I should double-check the role of advanced imaging and monitoring. MRI can detect early OA features and inflammation but rarely changes acute management in straightforward OA, whereas in suspected inflammatory arthritis, MRI can identify bone marrow edema, synovitis, and erosions that inform prognosis and treatment. In axial spondyloarthritis workups, MRI helps distinguish inflammatory lesions from degenerative changes that can mimic sacroiliitis, preventing misclassification and inappropriate immunotherapy [^1152ewor] [^112vo7BY] [^113czVm3].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency: confirm polyarticular involvement and characterize inflammatory features. Localize the pattern (DIP, CMC, knees, hips, feet, spine) and screen for extra-articular clues. Obtain radiographs to establish baseline OA features. Use ultrasound or MRI selectively when diagnosis is uncertain, early inflammatory disease is suspected, or injection guidance is needed. And tailor management to OA severity, comorbidities, and patient preferences, escalating cautiously while avoiding low-value interventions. This stepwise approach mirrors contemporary primary care and rheumatology guidance and should minimize both under- and over-treatment [^1124uUZ4] [^1163Xhsn] [^116QTzV7].

Polyarticular degenerative changes refer to **multijoint osteoarthritis** involving five or more joints, typically with symmetric involvement of the hands, knees, hips, and spine. Diagnosis relies on **clinical assessment and radiography** [^1152ewor], which shows joint space narrowing, osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis, and cysts [^1159Ksvf]; MRI or ultrasound is reserved for atypical or early disease [^114T9rVd]. Management is **multimodal**, emphasizing education, exercise, weight loss, and topical/oral NSAIDs [^1163Xhsn]; intra-articular corticosteroids are used selectively, and surgery is reserved for advanced disease [^1163Xhsn] [^11138GGz]. Prognosis is generally stable but can progress to significant disability; comorbidities and patient factors influence outcomes [^11138GGz].

---

## Clinical presentation

Polyarticular degenerative changes present with the following **clinical features**:

- **Pain**: Typically worsens with activity and improves with rest [^114pobUv].
- **Stiffness**: Morning stiffness lasting less than 30 minutes [^notfound].
- **Functional impairment**: Reduced range of motion, crepitus, and joint deformities [^112Wu5Mg].
- **Distribution**: Commonly affects hands (DIP, PIP, CMC), knees, hips, and spine [^112Wu5Mg].

---

## Pathophysiology

The **pathophysiology** of polyarticular degenerative changes involves multiple factors:

- **Cartilage degeneration**: Loss of proteoglycans and collagen fibers [^notfound].
- **Subchondral bone remodeling**: Osteophyte formation and sclerosis [^113fg6yX].
- **Synovial inflammation**: Mild synovitis and inflammatory mediators [^112aRfsk].
- **Genetic predisposition**: Family history and genetic factors influence susceptibility [^111JmCmG].

## Diagnostic criteria and imaging modalities

Diagnosis of polyarticular degenerative changes relies on **clinical assessment and imaging**:

| **Imaging modality** | **Findings** | **Role in diagnosis** |
|-|-|-|
| Radiography | - Joint space narrowing <br/> - Osteophytes <br/> - Subchondral sclerosis <br/> - Cysts | First-line imaging; confirms diagnosis and assesses severity [^113fg6yX] |
| MRI | - Early cartilage changes <br/> - Bone marrow lesions <br/> - Synovitis | Detects early disease; reserved for atypical or early cases [^114T9rVd] |
| Ultrasound | - Synovitis <br/> - Effusions <br/> - Erosions | Useful for detecting inflammation and guiding injections [^1124uUZ4] |

---

## Differential diagnosis

Polyarticular degenerative changes must be differentiated from other causes of **polyarticular joint pain**:

- **Rheumatoid arthritis**: Inflammatory arthritis with symmetric joint involvement and systemic features [^113saJj6].
- **Psoriatic arthritis**: Associated with psoriasis, dactylitis, and enthesitis [^112GfwMw].
- **Gout**: Crystal arthropathy with acute flares and tophi formation [^notfound].
- **Systemic lupus erythematosus**: Multi-system involvement and serologic abnormalities [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management of polyarticular degenerative changes is **multimodal and individualized**:

- **Non-pharmacological**: Patient education, weight loss, exercise, physical therapy, and occupational therapy [^1163Xhsn].
- **Pharmacological**: Topical NSAIDs, oral NSAIDs, acetaminophen, duloxetine, and intra-articular corticosteroids [^116QTzV7].
- **Surgical**: Joint replacement surgery (arthroplasty) for advanced disease refractory to conservative management [^11138GGz].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis varies with disease severity, comorbidities, and patient factors. Complications include **joint deformities, functional impairment, chronic pain, and reduced quality of life** [^11138GGz].

### ABCs of the degenerative spine [^116HQY4e]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Degenerative changes in the spine have high medical and socioeconomic significance. Imaging of the degenerative spine is a frequent challenge in radiology. The pathogenesis of this degenerative process represents a biomechanically related continuum of alterations, which can be identified with different imaging modalities. The aim of this article is to review radiological findings involving the intervertebral discs, end plates, bone marrow changes, facet joints and the spinal canal in relation to the pathogenesis of degenerative changes in the spine. Findings are described in association with the clinical symptoms they may cause, with a brief review of the possible treatment options. The article provides an illustrated review on the topic for radiology residents.

Teaching Points

- The adjacent vertebrae, intervertebral disc, ligaments and facet joints constitute a spinal unit.
- Degenerative change is a response to insults, such as mechanical or metabolic injury.
- Spine degeneration is a biomechanically related continuum of alterations evolving over time.

### Prevalence of degenerative changes and overlap with spondyloarthritis-associated lesions in the spine of patients from the DESIR cohort [^112DxmrF]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

For both MRI and radiographic images, degenerative changes were found predominantly in the lumbar spine. Especially at L4–L5 and L5–S1, the prevalence of degeneration was high. Overall, 292/366 (79.8%) patients with degeneration in the lumbar spine had degeneration at this location. Degenerated discs (grade 2 or higher) were found in 211/366 patients (57.7%) at level L4–L5, L5–S1 and herniation in 149/366 patients (40.7%) in L4–L5 or L5–S1. Schmorls nodes were an exception as these were most prevalent in the lower thoracic spine. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the degenerative changes in the spine per VU.

### Osteoarthritis [^11138GGz]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Osteoarthritis is a major source of pain, disability, and socioeconomic cost worldwide. The epidemiology of the disorder is complex and multifactorial, with genetic, biological, and biomechanical components. Aetiological factors are also joint specific. Joint replacement is an effective treatment for symptomatic end-stage disease, although functional outcomes can be poor and the lifespan of prostheses is limited. Consequently, the focus is shifting to disease prevention and the treatment of early osteoarthritis. This task is challenging since conventional imaging techniques can detect only quite advanced disease and the relation between pain and structural degeneration is not close. Nevertheless, advances in both imaging and biochemical markers offer potential for diagnosis and as outcome measures for new treatments. Joint-preserving interventions under development include lifestyle modification and pharmaceutical and surgical modalities. Some show potential, but at present few have proven ability to arrest or delay disease progression.

### Osteoarthritis year 2012 in review: biology [^112Sn1aL]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2012). Low credibility.

This review focuses on recent findings in pathobiology of osteoarthritis (OA). The progress in this field will be illustrated based on three questions; 1. What factors maintain or alter the articular chondrocyte phenotype? 2. What is the role of inflammation in OA? 3. Is there a role for aging-related genes in OA? Recent findings make it more and more obvious that OA is not a single tissue disease, but that development and progression of OA is the resulted of an integrated complex of local and systemic factors that contribute to the pathobiology of this widespread disease.

### Use of magnetic resonance imaging to identify immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced inflammatory arthritis [^1141btvb]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) first gained US Food and Drug Administration approval in 2011 after ipilimumab was found to be efficacious in metastatic melanoma. Since the approval of ipilimumab, ICIs have shown survival benefit in an increasing number of cancers. These therapies have demonstrated that the immune system can be effectively harnessed to aid in killing cancerous cells. However, their use has also led to the emergence of immune-related adverse events, such as ICI-induced inflammatory arthritis (ICI-IIA), which has been estimated to occur in approximately 2% of patients with cancer undergoing ICI treatments. Radiographic examinations are commonly performed as part of clinical evaluation; however, radiographs may not be useful during early phases of inflammatory arthritis (IA)and may only provide indirect information on synovial inflammation. Furthermore, radiographs have low sensitivity for early inflammatory bone involvement and damage. Indeed, despite evident clinical synovitis, patients who develop ICI-IIA typically only show evidence of degenerative changes on roentgenographs. Musculoskeletal ultrasonography may overcome some of these limitations, but its efficacy is operator-dependent and subject to significant variability in interpretation. In undifferentiated IA, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may detect factors associated with the progression to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Magnetic resonance imaging findings of bone marrow edema, the combination of synovitis and erosions, and tenosynovitis are significant risk factors for RA progression. Additionally, MRI can be used to evaluate early changes in the joints and bones in patients with RA before such changes can be detected by other imaging modalities. Thus, we hypothesized that MRI may be useful to assess early arthritis related to ICI treatment. Anatomic localization of ICI-IIA with the use of MRI could also help in understanding the pathophysiological processes involved in this poorly characterized entity. We aimed to systematically evaluate MRI features of ICI-IIA in a cohort of patients with cancer who were undergoing other treatments at our center.

### Spectrum of benign articular and periarticular findings at FDG PET / CT [^113wG2Nd]. Radiographics (2016). Low credibility.

Whole-body fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) is performed primarily for oncologic indications; however, FDG uptake is not specific for malignancy. Herein we focus on causes of increased FDG uptake in and around joints, as lesions in these locations are commonly benign. A combination of primary intra-articular processes and osseous processes that may occur near the joint space will be discussed. Causes of intra-articular and periarticular increased FDG activity can be broadly divided into infectious, inflammatory, degenerative, and benign neoplastic categories. A familiarity with the full range of these processes is important to avoid misinterpretation, in turn decreasing unnecessary follow-up studies, procedures, and treatments. Differentiation from malignancy is often possible on the basis of a different level of FDG activity, divergent response to therapy, or differing changes over time, in comparison with a patient's known primary cancer. Recognizing an intra-articular lesion location can also be critical, as intra-articular metastases are rare. In some cases, benign FDG-avid articular and periarticular entities have a specific appearance at FDG PET/CT and a correct diagnosis may be made without any additional workup. In most other cases, comparison with prior studies and/or additional imaging can afford an accurate diagnosis. This review is meant to introduce the reader to a spectrum of benign FDG-avid articular and periarticular processes that may be encountered at oncologic FDG PET/CT to increase confidence and diagnostic accuracy.

### Magnetic resonance imaging characteristics in patients with psoriatic arthritis and axial manifestations from the MAXIMISE cohort [^116FU3C3]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The current analysis of the MAXIMISE trial was conducted to investigate the presence of post-inflammatory and degenerative spinal changes and inflammatory changes in spinal processes identified in baseline MRIs and their potential for predicting differential treatment effects in a cohort of PsA patients with axial manifestations.

Methods

Baseline spinal MRIs from the MAXIMISE trial were re-read to identify additional inflammatory (spinal process), post-inflammatory, and degenerative changes, and investigate the differential treatment effect of these imaging features using logistic regression modelling.

Results

In addition to bone marrow oedema assessed at primary analysis, spinal process inflammation and post-inflammatory changes evaluated by FAt Spondyloarthritis Spine Score were documented in 11.1% and 20.2% patients, respectively. At least one type of degenerative change was noted in 64% patients, with Pfirrmann grade ≥ 3 (51.1%) being the most common. Combining primary and re-read MRI findings, 67.1% of patients presented with inflammatory or post-inflammatory changes while 21.2% had degenerative changes alone. Although not statistically significant, post-inflammatory changes were associated with a trend for better efficacy outcomes in terms of ASAS20, ASAS40 and BASDAI50 responses; a trend for worse outcomes was observed in the presence of degenerative changes.

Conclusion

The current analysis revealed the occurrence of additional inflammatory and post-inflammatory changes suggestive of axial PsA (axPsA) and a trend for better clinical outcomes for patients treated with secukinumab. These results elucidate the imaging characteristics and improve our current understanding of axPsA thereby supporting the interpretation of future trials.

Degenerative changes

For 21.2% (n = 102) of the patients, only degenerative changes were identified, while 11.7% (n = 56) of patients had a normal MRI (Fig. 3). Approximately 64% of the patients had at least one type of degenerative change. Pfirrmann grade ≥ 3 (n = 248, 51.1%), disc herniation or high intensity zone (n = 178, 36.7%) and Modic changes (including Modic 1 and Modic 2) (n = 107, 22.1%) were the most common degenerative changes seen in whole spine (Fig. 4).

Degenerative changes by region of the spine; N = 485. The following changes such that a score of 1 for either denotes an overall score of 1 were combined as follows: Modic 1 and Modic 2; Schmorl's node with BME and Schmorl's node without BME; and disc herniation and high intensity zone. Pfirrmann grade was dichotomized at each DVU: a score of 1 or 2 was rated as 0 and a score of ≥ 3 was rated as 1. BME, bone marrow oedema; DVU, disco-vertebral unit; n, number of patients with at least one DVU showing as 'present' for the associated spinal degenerative change variable in the whole spine

Main analysis

As the likelihood ratio test P -value was > 0.20 for all the assessed outcome measures, we failed to reject the null hypothesis of the less complex interaction, and model 1 was considered a better fit to the data; hence, there was no evidence of a differential treatment effect. Also, interaction model 1 did not reveal any evidence of a main effect for the eight mutually exclusive imaging groups.

### Early knee osteoarthritis [^114T9rVd]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Concepts regarding osteoarthritis, the most common joint disease, have dramatically changed in the past decade thanks to the development of new imaging techniques and the widespread use of arthroscopy that permits direct visualisation of intra-articular tissues and structure. MRI and ultrasound allow the early detection of pre-radiographic structural changes not only in the peri-articular bone but also in the cartilage, menisci, synovial membrane, ligaments and fat pad. The significance of MRI findings such as cartilage defects, bone marrow lesions, synovial inflammation/effusions and meniscal tears in patients without radiographic signs of osteoarthritis is not fully understood. Nevertheless, early joint tissue changes are associated with symptoms and, in some cases, with progression of disease. In this short review, we discuss the emerging concept of early osteoarthritis localised to the knee based on recently updated knowledge. We highlight the need for a new definition of early osteoarthritis that will permit the identification of patients at high risk of osteoarthritis progression and to initiate early treatment interventions.

### Advances in the treatment of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^111R2zXz]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is defined as arthritis of unknown etiology, presenting in children less than 16 years old and persisting for at least 6 weeks. It is classified by ILAR into six subtypes. Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) is defined as disease involving more than five joints in the first 6 months of disease. A recent Canadian study of 1104 JIA patients showed that patients with pJIA, particularly rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive pJIA, were less likely to go into remission, more likely to have worse outcomes and be treated with steroids and biologic agents than the other subtypes. Some studies use the term polyarticular course JIA to denote any disease with more than five joints involved, which then may include extended oligoarticular JIA, enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA), psoriatic JIA and systemic-onset JIA. For the purposes of this review, data and evidence may be relevant to all of these subtypes, except for systemic-onset JIA, which has been extensively reviewed elsewhere. In this review, we will discuss recent advances in the management strategies of pJIA as well as identify unanswered questions and avenues for further research.

### Pathogenesis and management of pain in osteoarthritis [^112aRfsk]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

The term osteoarthritis describes a common, age-related, heterogeneous group of disorders characterised pathologically by focal areas of loss of articular cartilage in synovial joints, associated with varying degrees of osteophyte formation, subchondral bone change, and synovitis. Joint damage is caused by a mixture of systemic factors that predispose to the disease, and local mechanical factors that dictate its distribution and severity. Various genetic abnormalities have been described, but most sporadic osteoarthritis probably depends on minor contributions from several genetic loci. Osteoarthritic joint damage may be associated with clinical problems, but the severity of joint disease is only weakly related to that of the clinical problem. For this reason the associations and pathogenesis of pain are in as much need of investigation as joint damage. Subchondral bone and synovium may be responsible for nociceptive stimuli, and peripheral neuronal sensitisation is an important feature, and can result in normal activities (such as walking) causing pain. Central pain sensitisation can also occur, and psychosocial factors are important determinants of pain severity. We present a stepwise approach to the management of osteoarthritis.

### Disappearing acts: the many causes of rapidly destructive arthritis [^115QYFRg]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Most of the destructive joint disease necessitating arthoplasty is the result of an insidious and protracted process that occurs over the course of many years. However, there are a variety of diseases that may result in a rapid progressive deterioration of a joint. We describe both the common and less common etiologies of rapidly destructive arthropathy that one should consider, with imaging examples, and present discriminative factors when present.

### Rate and predisposing factors for sacroiliac joint radiographic progression after a two-year follow-up period in recent-onset spondyloarthritis [^114yPRqF]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

The recommended imaging investigations for patients with chronic inflammatory back pain (present for ≥ 3 months) occurring before the age of 45 years include both plain radiographs of the pelvis and (in the case of normal findings on radiography) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis, since the suspected diagnosis in this case is axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) and the involvement of the sacroiliac (SI) joints seems to be a cornerstone of the disease 1. For epidemiologic studies and/or clinical trials, patients are enrolled according to existing classification criteria. The presence of structural damage of the SI joints observed on plain radiographs of the pelvis is mandatory in the first set of classification criteria (the New York criteria and the modified New York criteria) 2. These abnormalities on radiographs are wrongly called "sacroiliitis", since "‐itis" means an inflammatory process in medicine and plain radiography cannot detect inflammation but only chronic change and structural damage, such as subchondral bone sclerosis and joint irregularities.

### Models of osteoarthritis: the good, the bad and the promising [^117QnsUH]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative disease of diarthrodial joints, predominantly affecting the spine and peripheral joints of the body, particularly the hands, hips, knees and feet. OA most commonly affects people over the age of forty, with the risk of disease increasing with age. OA is a complex heterogeneous disease with different clinical and biochemical phenotypes.

The cause(s) of OA are unknown, and many studies have suggested that the pathobiology of OA is far more complex than a simple cartilaginous or bone disease. It is now acknowledged that OA affects many joint structures, including degeneration of cartilage, abnormal bone remodelling and synovial inflammation. Also, studies have shown that there is a complex interplay between the different joint components, making understanding of the degradative sequence of events involved in OA pathogenesis very difficult to dissect.

The initial onset of OA disease is considered due to an imbalance between the cartilage degradation and repair process. The exact sequence of events that trigger the onset of the disease is however widely debated throughout the literature. One hypothesis, suggests that secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines into the synovial joint induces matrix metalloproteinases which cause the fragmentation and degradation of cartilage extracellular matrix leading to bone remodelling and synovitis. Contrary to this theory, some studies suggest that subchondral bone remodelling and synovitis precede articular degeneration in the early stages of OA. While other studies suggest that meniscal degeneration evolving through fibrillation of tissue and a decrease in the levels of type I and II collagen within the meniscus, act as a predisposing or contributing factor to OA progression. In the later stages of OA, formation of subchondral cysts, subchondral sclerosis and osteophytes occur as a direct result of bone remodelling, cartilage degradation and synovitis.

### Hand osteoarthritis: clinical phenotypes, molecular mechanisms and disease management [^113vba6p]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a highly prevalent condition, and the hand is the most commonly affected site. Patients with hand OA frequently report symptoms of pain, functional limitations and frustration in undertaking everyday activities. The condition presents clinically with changes to the bone, ligaments, cartilage and synovial tissue, which can be observed using radiography, ultrasonography or MRI. Hand OA is a heterogeneous disorder and is considered to be multifactorial in aetiology. This Review provides an overview of the epidemiology, presentation and burden of hand OA, including an update on hand OA imaging (including the development of novel techniques), disease mechanisms and management. In particular, areas for which new evidence has substantially changed the way we understand, consider and treat hand OA are highlighted. For example, genetic studies, clinical trials and careful prospective imaging studies from the past 5 years are beginning to provide insights into the pathogenesis of hand OA that might uncover new therapeutic targets in the disease.

WARNINGS

(See also boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS.)

Skeletal Abnormalities

In adults receiving long-term treatment with acitretin, appropriate examinations should be periodically performed in view of possible ossification abnormalities (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Because the frequency and severity of iatrogenic bony abnormality in adults is low, periodic radiography is only warranted in the presence of symptoms or long-term use of acitretin. If such disorders arise, the continuation of therapy should be discussed with the patient on the basis of a careful risk/benefit analysis. In clinical trials with acitretin, subjects were prospectively evaluated for evidence of development or change in bony abnormalities of the vertebral column, knees, and ankles.

Of 380 subjects treated with acitretin, 15% had preexisting abnormalities of the spine which showed new changes or progression of preexisting findings. Changes included degenerative spurs, anterior bridging of spinal vertebrae, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, ligament calcification, and narrowing and destruction of a cervical disc space. De novo changes (formation of small spurs) were seen in 3 subjects after 1½ to 2½ years.

Six of 128 subjects treated with acitretin showed abnormalities in the knees and ankles before treatment that progressed during treatment. In 5, these changes involved the formation of additional spurs or enlargement of existing spurs. The sixth subject had degenerative joint disease which worsened. No subjects developed spurs de novo. Clinical complaints did not predict radiographic changes.

### Association between metabolic syndrome and radiographic changes in psoriatic arthritis: a cohort study [^112A1L1v]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Multivariate GEE analysis identified plantar and/or Achilles calcaneal spurs, DISH, and DDD (cervical and thoracolumbar) as radiographic features independently associated with MetS in patients with PsA but not radiographic damage to peripheral joints, sacroiliitis, or syndesmophytes. This is not unexpected because these radiographic findings share with MetS the close relation to aging, degenerative disease, and metabolic changes. Although not characteristic radiographic disease features of PsA, both DISH and DDD may occur in patients with psoriatic disease. In a previous study, we demonstrated an association between DISH and the presence of radiographic damage to peripheral joints. Calcaneal spurs, although commonly secondary to degenerative disease, may also represent enthesophytic manifestation of PsA. Thus, although MetS is associated with higher PsA disease activity, it is not associated with higher PsA‐related radiographic damage to axial or peripheral joints.

It should be emphasized that factors associated with MetS, such as higher BMI and lower physical activity, are modifiable; tight control and healthy lifestyle changes can result in favorable health‐related outcomes, especially in the cardiovascular domain. In PsA, weight loss was shown to be associated with a higher rate of minimal disease activity in patients with overweight or obesity taking TNFi. Klingberg et alfound that short‐term weight loss treatment with a very low energy diet correlated favorably with disease activity in joints, entheses, and skin in patients with PsA and obesity.

Our study has several strengths, including the large number of patients, the organized and well‐documented nature of the follow‐up, and detailed clinical and radiographic data. We do acknowledge some limitations, including the retrospective design and that it was conducted at a single center.

In conclusion, MetS was not associated with more severe peripheral or axial radiographic damage in our study. On the other hand, it was found to be associated with metabolic and degenerative changes in the spine and entheses, most likely due to shared underlying pathomechanisms. These imaging changes, although not being inherent radiographic features of PsA, may have untoward impacts on patient symptoms and quality of life. The relationship between MetS and PsA, and potential mitigating strategies, merit further investigation.

### Update on calcium pyrophosphate deposition [^117SwpYS]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) associates with ageing, osteoarthritis (OA), uncommon metabolic diseases, mutations and polymorphisms in the ankylosis human gene (ANKH). CPPD is frequently polyarticular, occurs due to a generalised articular predisposition, and the association between CPPD and OA is joint specific, for example CPPD associates with knee OA, but not with hip OA. Other recently identified associations include knee malalignment (knee CC), low cortical BMD and soft-tissue calcification. CPPD is generally asymptomatic. A recent study reported that knees with OA plus CC at the index joint, or at distant joints (in absence of index joint CC), were more likely to have attrition. CPPD can cause acute CPP crystal arthritis, chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis, and is frequently present in joints with OA. Joint aspiration remains the gold standard for diagnosing CPPD, although other promising techniques are emerging. Patients with polyarticular or young onset CPPD should be screened for underlying metabolic abnormalities, however, such testing can be unrewarding. The treatment of CPPD is symptomatic. Acute CPP crystal arthritis is treated with rest, local application of ice-packs, joint aspiration, colchicine and/or intra-articular corticosteroid injection (once infection is excluded). Colchicine, low-dose corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine and radiosynovectomy are recommended for the treatment of chronic or recurrent acute CPP crystal arthritis. Recent RCTs did not confirm any benefit from methotrexate, and although there is increasing interest in the use of anti-IL1 agents for acute or chronic CPP crystal arthritis, their efficacy has not been formally examined. Unlike gout, currently there are no treatments to eliminate CPP crystal deposits.

### Pharmaceutical treatment of osteoarthritis [^116JgF4S]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the current state of pharmaceutical treatment recommendations for the management of osteoarthritis.

Method

A narrative review was drafted to describe treatment guidelines, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity for nine classes of pharmaceuticals: 1) oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 2) topical NSAIDs, 3) COX-2 inhibitors, 4) duloxetine, 5) intra-articular corticosteroids, 6) intra-articular hyaluronic acid, 7) acetaminophen (paracetamol), 8) tramadol, and 9) capsaicin.

Results

In general, oral and topical NSAIDs, including COX-2 inhibitors, are strongly recommended first-line treatments for osteoarthritis due to their ability to improve pain and function but are associated with increased risks in patients with certain comorbidities (e.g., heightened cardiovascular risks). Intra-articular corticosteroid injections are generally recommended for osteoarthritis management and have relatively minor adverse effects. Other treatments, such as capsaicin, tramadol, and acetaminophen, are more controversial, and many updated guidelines offer differing recommendations.

Conclusion

The pharmaceutical management of osteoarthritis is a constantly evolving field. Promising treatments are emerging, and medicines that were once considered conventional (e.g., acetaminophen) are gradually becoming less acceptable based on concerns with efficacy and safety. Clinicians need to consider the latest evidence and recommendations to make an informed decision with their patients about how to optimize treatment plans for patients with knee, hip, polyarticular, or hand osteoarthritis.

### Approach to the patient with controlled acromegaly and acromegalic arthropathy: clinical diagnosis and management [^1135J4NF]. Pituitary (2024). Medium credibility.

Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging

A more detailed radiographic assessment of the joint(s) might be needed. Ultrasonography is a non-invasive, high-resolution imaging technique without the need for radiation. For joint assessment, ultrasonography can detect, amongst others, effusions, and ligament and cartilage injury, which can aid in the detection of inflammatory diseases (i.e. arthritis tendinitis, and bursitis). On the other hand, the role for ultrasonography in diagnosing OA is limited. Moreover, reproducibility of ultrasonography during follow-up remains highly dependent on the specialized ultrasonographer.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be performed, e.g. to exclude traumatic injury with cartilage or ligament tears, or other subtle structural changes. Previously, we have successfully and reliably performed MRI scans of the knee in patients with acromegaly, which showed the characteristic structural changes as well as decreased cartilage quality. For degenerative joint disease, however, MRI scans are not indicated in the clinical diagnostic trajectory. Moreover, MRI scans are expensive, time consuming, and have limited availability.

Categorization of patients depending on severity of arthropathy

Based on the presence of complaints, amount and location of affected joints, patients are divided into three categories: patients without joint complaints, patients with mono-articular disease (one singular joint affected) and poly-articular disease (multiple joint locations affected, e.g. hip and knee, or shoulder and hip). Moreover, patients will be divided into clinically affected, and radiologically affected, or both.

### Degenerative arthritis of the knee in active patients: evaluation and management [^115Uk9RH]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2001). Low credibility.

The natural history and treatment of degenerative arthritis of the knee in active patients is a topic of great interest, with continually evolving concepts and techniques. Osteoarthritis is a spectrum of clinical entities, ranging from focal chondral defects to established arthrosis resulting from biologic and biomechanical hyaline cartilage failure. Evaluation of the active patient with knee arthritis should include a comprehensive history emphasizing symptom manifestation, activity level, and previous surgical treatment. The physical examination must include an evaluation of extremity alignment, gait patterns, and coexisting disorders of the spine and adjacent joints. Diagnostic testing is usually straightforward and should include the 45-degree flexion weight-bearing posteroanterior plain radiograph. Nonsurgical treatment modalities include rehabilitation, lifestyle modification, bracing, supportive devices, and medical management, including use of the new chondroprotective oral and injectable agents. Several surgical options exist, each with specific indications. Arthroscopic debridement can provide a positive, but often short-lived, reduction in the severity of symptoms. Tibial or femoral osteotomy may maintain the patient's active lifestyle and delay the need for arthroplasty. Unicompartmental and total knee arthroplasty can each provide reliable relief of symptoms but may not permit a return to the activities that the patient values.

### Prevalence of degenerative changes and overlap with spondyloarthritis-associated lesions in the spine of patients from the DESIR cohort [^113czVm3]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

MRI and conventional radiographs are both used in the screening for and diagnosis of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). MRI is a relatively new imaging technique in the field of axSpA. The advantage is the early detection of bone marrow oedema on short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequences, consistent with inflammation. MRI of the sacroiliac (SI) joints is introduced in the imaging arm of the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) definition of axSpA in 2009. Although MRI of the spine is not used for classification and its additional value has to be determined, it may play a role in the evaluation of (potential) patients with axSpA.

Lesions in the spine associated with axSpA have been well documented and various scoring systems have been developed. However, in addition to lesions associated with axSpA, concomitant degenerative changes in the spine are prevalent both in patients with axSpA and in the general population. Degenerative changes in the spine can become relevant when they mimic axSpA. For example, the presence of degenerative changes of the endplates might be misinterpreted for inflammatory lesions since both are associated with bone marrow oedema. On radiographs, syndesmophytes and spondylophytes are both a bony spur arising from the corner of vertebral bodies and are distinguished by the angle that they form with the vertebra, but this is sometimes challenging. Until now, it is unknown whether misinterpretation is an issue when assessing MRIs and radiographs of the spine.

Therefore, the aim of this study is to describe the prevalence and location of degenerative changes in the spine in a young population with suspicion of axSpA. In addition, this study aims to assess whether it is possible to discriminate reliably between degenerative changes and lesions associated with axSpA.

### Epigenetically-driven anatomical diversity of synovial fibroblasts guides joint-specific fibroblast functions [^113saJj6]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Formation of joint-specific structures during embryogenesis is accompanied by tightly controlled topographical and temporal expression of specific sets of positional genes, including homeobox (HOX) transcription factors. The highly conserved HOX transcription factors specify regional identities of cells and tissues throughout the body and regulate the correct formation of the body axes. Adult human cells and tissues, such as skin fibroblasts, aortic smooth muscle cellsand adipose tissue depots, retain key features of embryonic positional HOX gene expression. The unique topographical signature of HOX transcription factors and downstream effector molecules in skin fibroblasts provides critical signals to guide the site-specific fate of neighbouring cells, such as keratinocytes.

Most forms of arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA) and spondyloarthropathies, occur with a distinctive topographical pattern of joint involvement. RA is a symmetric, destructive polyarticular arthritis that is typically localized distally in small joints of the hands and feet, in particular metacarpophalangeal joints and metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints. Proximal, larger joints, like knees and shoulders, are involved less often and usually later in disease. In spondyloarthropathies, on the other hand, involvement of the spine together with peripheral oligoarthritis, affecting primarily the joints of the lower extremity, is typical. OA, which is a chronic, primarily degenerative disease of the cartilage, is also found mainly in knees and hips. In addition, OA can affect the feet, typically the MTP I joint, and hands, where distal interphalangeal joints are primarily involved.

Arthritis-specific topographical patterns of joint involvement form despite common systemic activation of the adaptive immune system and common systemic and environmental risk factors, arguing for a local predisposing factor within the synovium. Resident stromal cells of the synovium have a central function in the pathogenesis of arthritis. Synovial fibroblasts (SFs), the most abundant resident stromal cells of the synovium, are major local effectors of joint inflammation and destruction in arthritis, producing a variety of proinflammatory and matrix-degrading molecules. In vivo studies suggest that SFs from patients with RA can transmigrate into vasculature, spreading RA from oligoarticular to polyarticular disease.

Here we demonstrate that SFs of different anatomical origins have different transcriptomes that translates into unique joint-specific phenotypes of SFs. This finding might underlie the joint-specific occurrence and severity of arthritis.

Supplementary analysis

A supplementary analysis with interaction model 1 and 2 was carried out for the three binary imaging groups 'any inflammatory change' including positive Berlin score and SPi, 'any post-inflammatory change', and 'any degenerative change' (Fig. 3). The likelihood ratio test P -value was > 0.20 for all the assessed outcome measures and, similar to the main analysis, interaction model 1 was considered a better fit to the data failing to demonstrate a differential treatment effect for any of the three imaging categories. Although not statistically significant, degenerative changes predicted poorer outcomes, while post-inflammatory changes may be associated with a higher likelihood for better outcomes, especially in terms of ASAS20 and ASAS40 responder rates at week 12. Similar observations were noted for BASDAI50 but not for ASDAS-CRP MCII responder status (Fig. 5).

### Magnetic resonance imaging characteristics in patients with psoriatic arthritis and axial manifestations from the MAXIMISE cohort [^112oHzGo]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective

The current analysis of the MAXIMISE trial was conducted to investigate the presence of post-inflammatory and degenerative spinal changes and inflammatory changes in spinal processes identified in baseline MRIs and their potential for predicting differential treatment effects in a cohort of PsA patients with axial manifestations.

Methods

Baseline spinal MRIs from the MAXIMISE trial were re-read to identify additional inflammatory (spinal process), post-inflammatory, and degenerative changes, and investigate the differential treatment effect of these imaging features using logistic regression modelling.

Results

In addition to bone marrow oedema assessed at primary analysis, spinal process inflammation and post-inflammatory changes evaluated by FAt Spondyloarthritis Spine Score were documented in 11.1% and 20.2% patients, respectively. At least one type of degenerative change was noted in 64% patients, with Pfirrmann grade ≥ 3 (51.1%) being the most common. Combining primary and re-read MRI findings, 67.1% of patients presented with inflammatory or post-inflammatory changes while 21.2% had degenerative changes alone. Although not statistically significant, post-inflammatory changes were associated with a trend for better efficacy outcomes in terms of ASAS20, ASAS40 and BASDAI50 responses; a trend for worse outcomes was observed in the presence of degenerative changes.

Conclusion

The current analysis revealed the occurrence of additional inflammatory and post-inflammatory changes suggestive of axial PsA (axPsA) and a trend for better clinical outcomes for patients treated with secukinumab. These results elucidate the imaging characteristics and improve our current understanding of axPsA thereby supporting the interpretation of future trials.

### Radiographic assessment of osteoarthritis [^113fg6yX]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis is one of the most prevalent and disabling chronic conditions affecting older adults and a significant public health problem among adults of working age. As the bulk of the U.S. population ages, the prevalence of osteoarthritis is expected to rise. Although the incidence of osteoarthritis increases with age, the condition is not a normal part of the aging process. More severe symptoms tend to occur in the radiographically more advanced stage of the disease; however, considerable discrepancy may exist between symptoms and the radiographic stage. Roentgenograms of involved joints may be useful in confirming the diagnosis of osteoarthritis, assessing the severity of the disease, reassuring the patient and excluding other pathologic conditions. The diagnosis of osteoarthritis is based primarily on the history and physical examination, but radiographic findings, including asymmetric joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, osteophyte formation, subluxation and distribution patterns of osteoarthritic changes, can be helpful when the diagnosis is in question.

### Polyarticular joint pain in adults: evaluation and differential diagnosis… [^111v6fgu]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

1 Two of the most common causes of chronic polyarthritis are osteoarthritis, especially in older patients, and rheumatoid arthritis, which affects at least 0. 25% of adults worldwide. 2 Most people in the United States with arthritis have osteoarthritis, which is a noninflammatory condition. Although inflammatory arthritis is uncommon, studies show that adults presenting to primary care with musculoskeletal symptoms often report joint pain, stiffness, or swelling that could be consistent with inflammatory arthritis. The fingers should be examined for bony enlargement at the proximal interphalangeal joints and distal interphalangeal joints that indicate osteoarthritis. Rheumatoid nodules are often found where there are pressure points. Tophi are found in the soft tissues, including the helix of the ear and around articular structures. On palpation, synovitis will consist of boggy swelling over the joint.

IMAGING Imaging for polyarticular pain can be helpful in supporting a diagnosis. It is important to view imaging as an extension of the history and physical examination, not a replacement for it. Classically, radiography has been the preferred standard for imaging and can show erosive changes from RA. Radiographic findings suggestive of osteoarthritis include marginal osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis, subchondral cysts, and joint space narrowing. 43 Early changes of RA include soft tissue swelling and juxta-articular osteopenia. The earliest erosions in the metacarpophalangeal joints occur where the joint capsule synovium directly contacts the bone, often referred to as a marginal erosion 44. Late changes include diffuse osteoporosis, large subchondral erosions, uniform joint space loss, and joint subluxation.
45.

Although the clinical findings of psoriatic arthritis can be similar to RA, some findings on radiography are distinct. Marginal erosions can be seen initially but may progress to also involve the central portion of the joint, 46 leading to a pencil-in-cup erosion. In addition to destructive changes, bone proliferation can also occur, which may be juxta-articular or along the shaft of the bone. 46, 47.

### Imaging of inflammatory arthritis in adults: status and perspectives on the use of radiographs, ultrasound, and MRI [^112vo7BY]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

The term inflammatory arthritis encompasses a variety of conditions featuring synovial inflammation as a defining characteristic, with resultant local tissue damage occurring over time. These arthritides often share overlapping clinical and imaging characteristics, although the pattern of joint involvement, specific appearance of pathologic changes, and associated findings often allow imaging-based differentiation or individual arthritides.

### Diagnostic approach to polyarticular joint pain… [^1129bxwj]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

1. Consequently, family physicians need to keep the diagnosis open in evaluating patients who present with pain in multiple joints. For instance, a 50-year-old woman with symmetric, progressive polyarticular joint swelling and prolonged morning stiffness would seem to have rheumatoid arthritis. However, this patient might develop a malar rash and oral ulcers, which would change the diagnosis to systemic lupus erythematosus. Alternatively, the patient might develop thickening of the skin, which would suggest the diagnosis of scleroderma. Thus, a series of visits over time may be necessary to arrive at a specific diagnosis in many patients with polyarticular joint pain. In some patients, it may not be possible to establish a definitive diagnosis. Disease Chronology Acute polyarticular joint pain may be the sign of a self-limited disorder or a harbinger of chronic disease.

Although chronic polyarticular arthritides more often develop insidiously, they can present abruptly. Thus, chronic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus should be considered, at least initially, in patients who present with acute polyarticular joint pain. Palpation of multiple joint capsules is important to look for soft tissue swelling and effusions that result in edema and influx of inflammatory cells into and around the synovium. Soft tissue swelling should be distinguished from noninflammatory bony hypertrophy, such as Heberden's and Bouchard's nodes, which often indicate osteoarthritis. AGE Certain diagnoses are more common in specific age groups. Rheumatic fever, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, reactive arthritis, and spondyloarthropathies occur more often in younger persons. Osteoarthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, and giant cell arteritis are more common in older persons.
13.

RACE Polymyalgia rheumatica and Wegener's granulomatosis are more likely to affect whites. 13 In contrast, sarcoidosis and systemic lupus erythematosus are more common in blacks. FAMILY HISTORY Familial aggregation occurs in some arthritic diseases, such as spondyloarthropathies, rheumatoid arthritis, and Heberden's nodes of osteoarthritis. 1 There is a particularly strong association between ankylosing spondylitis and the HLA-B27 allele.

### ACR guideline for managing patients with degenerative joint… [^115fJEex]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question What are the key approaches to managing patients with degenerative joint disease involving the hand, knee, or hip. Bottom Line This guideline underscores that we have multiple options to help patients with degenerative joint disease be more comfortable and functional, but we still have significant limitations based on the available evidence. For many of our patients, exercise, adaptive devices, and comfort measures will be the best approaches. On the basis of their own reviews of the available literature, the panel issued strong or conditional recommendations based on a 70% consensus among the voting panel members, typically according to the quality of the supporting data. The use of their own reviews rather than others is important in that some systematic reviews come to differing conclusions for some of their recommendations, such as intra-articular steroid injections.

The panel made strong recommendations for a comprehensive approach that includes exercise, self-efficacy programs, weight loss, tai chi, and assistive devices, as well as topical, oral, and intra-articular steroids. The panel made conditional recommendations in favor of education, cognitive behavior therapy, and other forms of exercise. They made conditional recommendations in favor of taping, other types of splints and braces, acetaminophen, tramadol, duloxetine, chondroitin, topical capsaicin, and acupuncture. They made strong recommendations against the use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, bisphosphonates, glucosamine, hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, biologics, platelet-rich plasma or stem cell injections, chondroitin, and intra-articular hyaluronic acid.

The panel made conditional recommendations against many other measures, including chondroitin, hyaluronic acid injections, topical capsaicin, botulinum toxin, prolotherapy, colchicine, nontramadol opioids, fish oil, vitamin D, massage, and wedged insoles or modified shoes. Some of the negative recommendations were based on a lack of reasonable-quality evidence of benefit as opposed to an abundance of reasonable-quality evidence of the absence of benefit. Some of these areas will continue to evolve.

### Links between radiological change, disability, and pathology in rheumatoid arthritis [^112Zg9vi]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

The relationship between the development of radiographic joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis and its longterm consequences for the patient is not well understood. Two objectives for further research have been identified: elucidating this relationship and relating pathological processes to the features visible on radiographs. Extrapolation from a proposed model suggests that if radiographic progression is suppressed early in the disease, it might take many years before the benefit can be clearly appreciated against a background of variation within individual patients. Two approaches have recently been brought to bear on this issue, including a detailed modeling of medium term observations from a single dataset and a review of a large number of published studies. There are a number of reservations about the notion of a minimum clinically important change, but one possibility for defining such a change for radiographs is in relation to longterm functional outcome.

### Chronic limping in childhood, what else other than juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a case series [^111KM8ag]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

CACP syndrome

CACP syndrome is a rare recessive disorder (prevalence of < 1/1,000,000) caused by a mutation in the PRG4 gene coding for a lubricating proteoglycan of the surface of articular cartilage. The loss of function mutation causes progressive joints deformity due to a hyperplasic process of the synoviocytes, responsible for the typical features (camptodactyly, arthropathy and coxa vara). In about 20% of cases, in addition to joint involvement, pericardial involvement is described, suggesting that CACP syndrome may also be due to a regulatory dysfunction in the proliferation of serosal cells. This condition is likely underdiagnosed and sometimes misdiagnosed as polyarticular or systemic JIA when pericardial involvement is present. However, in contrast to JIA, there is no joint inflammation, and therefore, there is little response to anti-inflammatory therapy; In addition, MRI allows to find the typical acetabular cysts. The therapeutic management is only symptomatic in association with physiotherapy and multidisciplinary approach.

Number of patients with a degenerative change split by gender

Equal number of patients with axSpA and without axSpA had one or more positive degenerative parameters on MRI (173/239 (72.4%) patients with no axSpA and 283/409 (69.2%) patients with axSpA, p = 0.45) and on radiograph (87/239 (36.4%) patients with no axSpA and 104/409 (26.9%) patients with axSpA, p = 0.14). When patients with axSpA and without axSpA were compared for cut-off points of individual degenerative changes, more patients in the no-axSpA group had Modic changes compared with patients from the axSpA group; Modic type I change was found in 29/239 (14.9%) patients with no axSpA and in 19/409 (4.2%) patients with axSpA (p = 0.001). For Modic type II changes, this was 20/239 (10.3%) patients with no axSpA and 11/409 (2.4%) patients with axSpA (p = 0.002). Only few patients from both groups had more than one Modic I or Modic II change. No statistically significant differences were found between the two patient groups for any of the other cut-off points of any of the degenerative changes.

### Role of diagnostic imaging in psoriatic arthritis: how, when, and why [^115YYXWv]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Imaging findings

Radiographic changes in the course of PsA exhibit a striking and characteristic pattern usually not seen in other forms of inflammatory arthritis, which is the coexistence of erosions and new bone formation (Fig. 2 a, b).

Fig. 2
A characteristic patter of PsA is the coexistence of erosive changes and new bone formation as in this example where the same patient (a, b) presented with fluffy periotitis in the proximal phalanges in both hands (arrow head) and acro-osteolysis (*) in the distal phalanges of the first toe in the right foot and the fifth toe of the left foot. c Polyarticular and asymmetrical PsA on hands with interphalangeal joints involved showing articular space narrowing and erosions (thin arrows), one of them is a Ω shaped erosion (thick arrow). d Subluxation and pencil-in-cup appereance in interphalangeal joint of the thumb in this particular case is another example of typical radiological changes in peripheral PsA. Bony erosions narrowed the end of the proximal phalange as a "pencil" (thin arrows) which rested in "cup" formed by the expanded base of the adjacent phalange (arrow head)

Radiography is a fast, feasible, reliable, and relatively inexpensive procedure. Thanks to the ability to provide a record of the cumulative joint damage, radiography is most widely used imaging exam in arthritis and in the particular case of PsA.

While radiography of peripheral joints requires a small dose of ionizing radiation, for evaluating the axial skeleton the required dose is greater. This concern in children and young adults contributes to favoring MRI.

Radiological damage was observed in at least a quarter of early PsA patients. Althoutgh arthritis of longer duration than reported by the patient is a possibility, the presence of joint damage on radiography has been proved to be an independent predictor of radiographic progression and so, of a very aggressive disease.

A patient with this diagnosis should not be on bisphosphonates and femoral pinning might be required though the individual circumstances need to be carefully assessed. The authors are aware of cases where atypical femoral fractures were misdiagnosed as "normal" insufficiency fractures leading to continued or even newly instigated bisphosphonate treatment and eventually to overt fracture.

Migrating bone marrow oedema syndrome, transient osteoporosis, transient bone marrow oedema syndrome, spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SONK)

MR imaging of joints not rarely shows areas of increased fluid signal immediately adjacent to the joint or in the proximity. While some of these signal changes can be explained by degenerative changes, larger, ill-defined areas of oedema-like signal cannot. It was recognised that the radiographic diagnosis of transient osteoporosis has an MRI equivalent and indeed that areas of diffuse oedema-like signal can show different imaging and clinical outcomes with time.

Large ill-defined areas of bone marrow oedema-like change can spontaneously resolve without associated clinical or imaging findings. They can be associated with pain or radiographically visible transient osteoporosis before resolution occurs. The oedema-like signal changes might show small crescent-shaped areas of subchondral contour concavity and sclerosis and this is now thought to represent subchondral stress fractures. This is seen particularly on the convex joint surface of large joints, especially the femoral head and femoral condyles. The overlying cartilage is intact here (Fig. 6).

Areas of osteonecrosis might also develop on the background of bone marrow oedema-like change.

This is distinct from the MRI findings seen in avascular necrosis (avn). In cases of avn disruption of the blood supply to the bone is the primary pathology. The bone marrow shows signal changes with typical serpiginous margins. With ischaemia bone necrosis occurs but in avn necrosis is due to primary disruption of the blood supply as opposed to a primary mechanical bone injury in stress fractures. Bone necrosis due to any cause can lead to bone collapse/fracture. The serpiginous morphology sets primary avn apart from other pathologies and can usually be identified. Often avn is due to a generalised metabolic problem and other sites in the body may show typical findings in cases where local collapse has occurred.

Psoriatic arthritis clinical and radiographic features — Characteristic radiographic features include joint erosions, joint space narrowing, bony proliferation including periarticular and shaft periostitis, osteolysis including "pencil in cup" deformity, acro-osteolysis, ankylosis, spur formation, and spondylitis; the presence of DIP erosive changes may provide both sensitive and specific radiographic findings to support the diagnosis of PsA. In patients with PsA, the hands tend to be involved much more frequently than the feet with a ratio of nearly 2:1, and dactylitis is common and most often affects the feet in an asymmetric distribution; dactylitis is associated with a greater degree of radiologic damage than occurs in digits not affected by dactylitis. Figure images depict dactylitis of toes and a middle finger, enthesitis of the Achilles' tendon, and a radiograph of hands.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) versus rheumatoid arthritis (RA) highlights that clinical features are essential to differentiate seronegative (rheumatoid factor — negative) RA with coincidental psoriasis from peripheral PsA; psoriatic plaques or nail psoriasis support PsA, and patients with rheumatoid nodules, extra-articular involvement, and high titers of rheumatoid factor should not be given a diagnosis of PsA. In PsA, involved joints are usually less tender, less swollen, and less symmetric than in RA; however, 20% of patients with PsA, especially female patients, have a symmetric polyarticular inflammatory arthritis resembling RA, distinguished by cutaneous or nail findings. Dactylitis, enthesitis, and DIP joint involvement common in PsA are uncommon in RA.

### Magnetic resonance imaging analysis of work-related chronic low back pain: comparisons of different lumbar disc patterns [^111VZ4qW]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Currently, numerous pathogenic factors of CLBP have been reported, such as work-related risk factors, traumatic factors, spinal degenerative diseases, aging, inflammation, tumor, and even psychosocial factors. As we all know, intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) and intervertebral disc herniation (IDH) are the most common sources of work-related CLBP due to long-term unhealthy posture or manual handling of heavy objects. However, the correlation between the presence of radiographic degenerative changes in intervertebral discs and the presence or severity of back pain was still uncertain, which has drawn increased attention. It is an established fact that back pain is a typical symptom associated with degenerative discs (DD) because of direct stimulation caused by structural abnormalities, facet joint arthritis associated with disc height collapse or segmental micro-instability, and induced neurological symptoms. Additionally, however, more than 30% of asymptomatic volunteers without any history of back pain have different forms of degenerative changes. Besides individual levels of pain sensitivity, the main reason for this uncertain correlation is probably the lack of identified relationship between DD and herniated discs (HD), since disc degeneration does not always precede herniation, and some degenerative changes can follow herniation. Therefore, further comprehensive investigation into the correlation between various patterns of disc degeneration and back pain was urgently needed to elucidate the etiological and pathological mechanisms of CLBP.

In the present study, we retrospectively investigated 283 cases with CLBP by using MRI analysis. Four different lumbar disc patterns, including normal discs (ND), DD, bulging discs (BD), and HD, were found in CLBP and compared in detail regarding various aspects based on MRI findings. The aim of this study was to identify MRI differences according to different lumbar disc patterns in CLBP.

### Differential diagnosis of polyarticular arthritis [^114pobUv]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Polyarticular arthritis is commonly encountered in clinical settings and has multiple etiologies. The first step is to distinguish between true articular pain and nonarticular or periarticular conditions by recognizing clinical patterns through the history and physical examination. Once pain within a joint or joints is confirmed, the next step is to classify the pain as noninflammatory or inflammatory in origin. Noninflammatory arthritis, which is mostly related to osteoarthritis, has a variable onset and severity and does not have inflammatory features, such as warm or swollen joints. Osteoarthritis usually presents with less than one hour of morning stiffness and pain that is aggravated by activity and improves with rest. A review of systems is usually negative for rashes, oral ulcers, or other internal organ involvement. In contrast, inflammatory arthritis generally causes warm, swollen joints; prolonged morning stiffness; and positive findings on a review of systems. Once inflammatory arthritis is suspected, possible diagnoses are sorted by the pattern of joint involvement, which includes number and type of joints involved, symmetry, and onset. The suspicion for inflammatory arthritis should be confirmed by the appropriate serologic/tissue and/or imaging studies in the clinical setting or in consultation with a subspecialist.

### Guidelines for management of osteoarthritis published by the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism: why are they so different? [^116A5Ntj]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Because of different methodology the ACR and EULAR guidelines differ significantly in their recommendations despite an identical evidence base. Guidelines that use a strictly evidence-based approach are less likely to incur bias than those that rely more on expert consensus. Although expert consensus is useful in areas in which there are little trial data, clear delineation should be made between evidence-based statements and expert opinion. Following the dissemination of guidelines for the management of OA, emphasis should now be placed on discussion and implementation of the recommendations and subsequent revision of guidelines as new evidence comes to light.

### Facet joint syndrome: from diagnosis to interventional management [^116kAEtf]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Imaging findings (Table 1)

X-ray imaging: Radiographs and computed tomography (CT)

The initial radiographic assessment of patients presenting with lumbar facet-mediated pain includes AP, lateral, and oblique views. Oblique radiographs are the best projections for assessing FJs of the lumbar spine because of their oblique position ("Scottie dog"). Lateral films, however, may provide useful information from the isthmus profile such as the pars interarticularis defect. Because of its ability to provide cross-sectional images and to provide a higher contrast between bony structures, CT improves anatomic evaluation of the FJs and is the preferred method for imaging FJ osteoarthritis. However, standard radiographs can also show pathological changes especially in severe disease. Degeneration is characterized by joint space narrowing, sclerosis, subchondral sclerosis and erosions, cartilage thinning, calcification of the joint capsule, hypertrophy of articular processes and of the ligamentum flavum causing impingement of the foramina and osteophytes. Secondary signs include vacuum joint phenomenon (intra-articular gas), joint effusion and associated degenerative spondylolisthesis. Synovial and subchondral cysts can extend posterior to the FJ but also anterior in the spinal cord or neuroforamen. Kalichman et al. showed 24% of X-rays FJOA before 40 years and 89% in the 60–69 years population, but once again with no correlation between abnormal morphology on radiologic findings and back pain.

### Role of diagnostic imaging in psoriatic arthritis: how, when, and why [^112GfwMw]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Radiographic findings in Peripheral PsA

Joint involvement in peripheral PsA is highly variable, and often changes over time. PsA can involve the small joints of hands and feet. Another frequent joint pattern is that of oligoarthritis affecting mainly larger weight bearing joints.

Erosive changes and new bone formation may occur within the same joint or in different joints within the same digit. Unlike for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), bone density is normal and bilaterality and symmetry less frequent (Fig. 2 c).

On the hands, two different patterns have been described for PsA:
A "row pattern" when there is predilection for the distal interphalangeal joint and sparing of the metacarpophalangeal joint.
A "ray pattern", when all three joints in one digit are affected, and potentially also the wrist.

The "ray pattern" and asymmetric arthritis have been used to clinically distinguish PsA from RA. However, at least half the patients had symmetrical (RA-like) polyarthritis.

A typical appearance, althougth not specific to PsA, is "Pencil in Cup Deformity" (Fig. 2 d). A term of art referring to bony erosions in which narrowed end of metacarpal or phalanges (pencil) rests in the expanded end of the adjacent bone sharing the joint (cup). Up to 5% of cases develop arthritis mutilans.

Other typical radiological changes include lysis of the terminal phalanges (acro-osteolysis), fluffy periostitis, as well as new bone formation at the site of enthesitis; gross destruction of isolated joints; and the occurrence of both joint lysis and ankylosis in the same patient.

Enthesitis and dactylitis also are commonly seen, and can accompany any of the other manifestations and in particular, a "ray pattern".

### Synovial pathology detected on ultrasound correlates with the severity of radiographic knee osteoarthritis more than with symptoms [^113p73qP]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2014). Low credibility.

In conclusion, this study highlights the correlation between grey-scale US features and radiographic severity. However, it questions the general assumption that synovial abnormalities are "inflammatory" in nature and is responsible for driving pain in OA, and suggests instead that they are a part of the overall structural pathology reflecting the biomechanical adaptations of the OA joint. PD signal which is widely asserted to represent a more "active inflammation" was more common in painful OA compared to controls but did not differ significantly from asymptomatic OA but this may not be the case for hospital referred patients. US features, particularly synovial hypertrophy, may well have a role to play in the development of painful OA but given the multi-factorial nature of pain this is unlikely to be straight forward. Further longitudinal studies are required to demonstrate whether US features are important in the development and progression of structural change and symptoms.

### ABCs of the degenerative spine [^113E8qKQ]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Erected vertically, the spine is the mast of our body and has three major functions: to provide structural support, enable trunk movement and protect the neural elements. From a biomechanical point of view, the spine is a multiarticular structure comprising numerous segments or units, enabling multidirectional motions and the absorption of large complex loads. Two adjacent vertebrae, the intervertebral disc, spinal ligaments and facet joints between them constitute a functional spinal unit (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Functional spinal unit (FSU). The FSU represents the smallest motion segment of the spine and exhibits biomechanical characteristics similar to those of the entire spine. Approximately 70% of applied axial compression is transmitted by the vertebral body and the intervertebral discs, with the remaining 30% of the load being distributed through the facet joints

Degenerative change is considered a response to insults, such as mechanical or metabolic injury, rather than a disease. The aetiology of the degenerative changes may be mechanical micro-insults or damage secondary to macro-insults, such as spinal fractures, spinal surgery not related to degenerative disc disease or significant metabolic processes, such as ochondrosis or mucoplysaccharidoses. All elements of the spine, including the intervertebral discs, joints, ligaments and bony structures, may undergo morphological changes that can be classified as degenerative.

Accurate and comprehensive interpretation of imaging findings relating to the degenerative spine can be challenging and sometimes even confusing because the word "degeneration" means different things to radiologists, neurologists, neurosurgeons and pathologists. The pathogenesis of these changes in the spine is a biomechanically related continuum of alterations that evolve over time. Therefore, understanding the pathophysiology of these biomechanical changes in the spine is essential for radiologists to characterise radiological abnormalities. The pathophysiology-based approach in assessing imaging findings in the degenerative spine can: (1) accurately characterise the process in the involved segment; (2) identify the sequence of degenerative changes and predict further abnormalities; (3) identify hidden or subtle abnormalities based on indirect signs; (4) assist clinicians in finding the source of pain or neurological symptoms; (5) identify the best treatment options for patients. No degenerative change should be considered an isolated event or reported as a random finding.

### Juvenile idiopathic arthritis: oligoarthritis and polyarthritis [^116bb64i]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) comprises a group of heterogeneous diseases further divided into various categories based on shared clinical presentation, laboratory markers, and disease prognosis. Extra-articular complications include uveitis and growth abnormalities. Disease course and prognosis vary with respect to each JIA category and subsequently guide respective treatment. Over the past few decades, considerable treatment advances have significantly reduced the morbidity associated with childhood arthritis. Nevertheless, the treatments are not curative; many children continue to have active disease into adulthood. Emphasis is placed on the initiation of early aggressive therapy in hopes of delaying disease progression and inducing remission.

Regarding medical management for juvenile idiopathic arthritis, more specifically with respect to management of polyarticular JIA (biologics), ACR 2019 guidelines recommend to consider adding a biologic to the original DMARD over changing to a second DMARD in patients with polyarticular JIA and moderate or high disease activity despite DMARD monotherapy.

### Investigations of potential phenotypes of foot osteoarthritis: cross-sectional analysis from the clinical assessment study of the foot [^1134R6nB]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

Several methodological strengths and limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings in this article. This analysis included participants recruited from the general population who reported having foot pain in the previous year; therefore a wide range of foot pain and radiographic severities were present. A standardized radiographic protocol was used to obtain weight‐bearing views so JSN was appropriately assessed, and multiple planes captured OA features, which have been noted to vary on different views 6. However, in this analysis only 5 joints in each foot were examined. It is possible that other foot joints may be affected by OA and contribute to the patterning and subgroups observed. Intrarater reliability for the presence of OA was found to be excellent. Despite interrater reliability being moderate, it was comparable with the original atlas 5. Although the study population had a prevalence of OA in 1 or more foot joints of 63%, when multiple foot joints were examined the numbers in some of the combinations were quite small. This is likely to have reduced the statistical power, potentially leading to type II error. Additionally, although all individuals in the study had reported having foot pain in the last year, the latent classes of foot OA were based only on radiographic structural changes. As discordance between symptoms and structural changes are often seen, further investigation characterizing polyarticular foot OA and first MTP joint OA in relation to symptomatic radiographic disease is needed.

In conclusion, this is the first detailed analysis of the pattern of multiple‐joint involvement in foot OA. We have demonstrated that, as is the case for OA at other small joint sites (particularly the hands), patterning of individual joint involvement in radiographic foot OA is polyarticular and strongly symmetrical. Patterns of joint involvement in radiographic foot OA have indicated a distinction between individuals with isolated first MTP joint OA and those with a more widespread form of OA labeled "polyarticular foot OA", but that also includes one or both first MTP joints. Our findings of these different forms of foot OA have provided new insights into possible causes, with a joint‐specific predilection to OA at the first MTP joint and possible systemic risk factors and mechanical mechanisms, which leads to a more generalized presentation of OA that includes the midfoot. While a greater symptomatic burden was seen in those with polyarticular foot OA, further investigation is needed to examine if these subgroups differ in their foot‐specific symptoms, clinical presentation, and the symptomatic course over time to extend our understanding of foot OA and how it should be best managed.

### Spectrum of common and uncommon causes of knee joint hyaline cartilage degeneration and their key imaging features [^1165uZRk]. European Journal of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyaline cartilage lining the surfaces of diarthrodial joints is an important construct for transmission of load and to reduce friction between the bones. Normal wear and tear accounts for about 3–5 percent knee cartilage loss ever year in otherwise healthy people after the age of 30 years. Several conditions and diseases lead to premature cartilage degeneration. Standardized description of cartilage loss, detailed evaluation of the joint health and determining the underlying etiology of cartilage loss are important for effective reporting, multidisciplinary communications and patient management. In this article, the authors discuss normal and abnormal imaging appearances of the hyaline cartilage of knee with focus on using controlled terminology and MRI classifications. The reader will benefit and learn key MR imaging features of a spectrum of common and uncommon conditions and diseases affecting the knee cartilage, such as trauma, secondary injury associated with meniscus and ligament injury related instability, arthritis, ischemia, idiopathic, and hereditary conditions including Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) mutations and mucopolysaccharidosis type IX disease with illustrative case examples.

### ABCs of the degenerative spine [^116FWVve]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

Degenerative changes in the spine have high medical and socioeconomic significance. Imaging of the degenerative spine is a frequent challenge in radiology. The pathogenesis of this degenerative process represents a biomechanically related continuum of alterations, which can be identified with different imaging modalities. The aim of this article is to review radiological findings involving the intervertebral discs, end plates, bone marrow changes, facet joints and the spinal canal in relation to the pathogenesis of degenerative changes in the spine. Findings are described in association with the clinical symptoms they may cause, with a brief review of the possible treatment options. The article provides an illustrated review on the topic for radiology residents.

Teaching Points

- The adjacent vertebrae, intervertebral disc, ligaments and facet joints constitute a spinal unit.

- Degenerative change is a response to insults, such as mechanical or metabolic injury.

- Spine degeneration is a biomechanically related continuum of alterations evolving over time.

### Diagnostic approach to polyarticular joint pain [^111oEEBP]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Identifying the cause of polyarticular joint pain can be difficult because of the extensive differential diagnosis. A thorough history and a complete physical examination are essential. Six clinical factors are helpful in narrowing the possible causes: disease chronology, inflammation, distribution, extra-articular manifestations, disease course, and patient demographics. Patients with an inflammatory arthritis are more likely to have palpable synovitis and morning stiffness; if the condition is severe, they may have fever, weight loss, and fatigue. Viral infections, crystal-induced arthritis, and serum sickness reactions are common causes of acute, self-limited polyarthritis. Because chronic arthritides may present abruptly, they need to be considered in patients who present with acute polyarticular joint pain. Joint palpation can help to distinguish inflammatory synovitis from the bony hypertrophy and crepitus that typically occur with osteoarthritis. Extra-articular manifestations of rheumatologic disease may be helpful in arriving at a more specific diagnosis. Many classic rheumatologic laboratory tests are nonspecific. A complete blood count, urinalysis, and a metabolic panel may provide more useful diagnostic clues. Plain-film radiographs may demonstrate classic findings of specific rheumatologic diseases; however, radiographs can be normal or only show nonspecific changes early in the disease process.

### Psoriatic arthritis: state of the art review [^117EdLDx]. Clinical Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on psoriatic arthritis:

- **Definition**: PsA is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disorder that occurs in patients with psoriasis and is associated with multiple musculoskeletal manifestations.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathogenesis of PsA is multifactorial and involves polygenic inheritance, environmental factors, and patient-specific risk factors, including obesity. These various factors initiate an auto-inflammatory loop with amplification of the IL-23/IL-17 pathway that leads to a diverse array of associated pathologies at distant body sites.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of PsA is estimated at 50–250 persons per 100,000 population. PsA is prevalent in 6–41% of patients with psoriasis.
- **Disease course**: Key clinical manifestations include arthritis, enthesitis, spondylitis, nail disease, dactylitis, and uveitis. Five disease phenotypes have been described. The oligoarticular subtype affects ≤ 4 joints, and typically occurs in an asymmetric distribution. The polyarticular subtype affects ≥ 5 joints; the involvement may be symmetric and resemble rheumatoid arthritis. The distal subtype affects distal interphalangeal joints of the hands, feet, or both. The axial or spondyloarthritis subtype primarily involves the spine and sacroiliac joints. Finally, a subtype known as arthritis mutilans is characterized by deforming and destructive arthritis that involves marked bone resorption or osteolysis, with telescoping and flail digits.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Articular damage develops in a large number of patients with PsA, with up to 47% of patients developing bony erosions within 2 years of diagnosis, despite the use of disease-modifying medications. Spontaneous remission is extremely rare. Treatment with biologics leads to partial remission in over 50% of patients.

### Towards secondary prevention of early knee osteoarthritis [^1159gwmx]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is the most common arthritic disease, yet there is no convincing drug treatment available today that affects the progression of the disease process. There are many reasons for this, including the lack of understanding of what drives the disease process and the heterogeneity of the patient population. Indeed, there is considerable variability in disease trajectories, also dependent on patient profiles and the defined outcomes, leading to a need for disease stratification. A recent report has proposed a framework for the investigation of clinical and structural phenotypes; the patient characteristics and disease stage should be considered as most relevant for stratification of patients to be used in future studies. This approach will be of value for the field, but from a pragmatic clinical standpoint, it neither helps the individual patient nor the clinician facing the patient, today. However, we believe there is reasonable scientific evidence from studies in both animals and the human model that a personalised, patient-centred approach can result in successful clinical outcomes.

Therefore, in this narrative, we try to integrate scientific evidence and our professional experience to illustrate which approaches can be taken for prototypical individual patient profiles that are most likely going to successfully alleviate pain, control symptoms and signs, maintain or restore function and perhaps even affect the disease course. For sure, it is not our goal to be fully comprehensive, and we made some choices. This paper focuses on secondary prevention, thus on early knee OA, as we believe this being a window of opportunity for interventions that benefit the patient. As OA develops slowly, in most cases, pain, symptoms/signs and loss of function precede radiographic changes, although the opposite is also possible in some cases. Consequently, there is in general poor disease management in clinical practice over the course of the disease. Indeed, typical examinations in primary care do not reveal abnormalities in blood exam and imaging, certainly not in early disease, and the patient is getting the message to adapt and cope with it. Healthcare providers are not taking any coordinated action and await late stage disease associated with pronounced clinical manifestations including severe functional limitations and radiographic advanced disease. Then, more attention is geared towards surgical interventions mostly total knee replacement (with some exceptions). However, OA is a chronic disease process and begs for early disease intervention, as has been illustrated in other chronic arthritic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.

### Early-onset osteoarthritis due to otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia in a family with a novel splicing mutation of the COL11A2 gene [^115XkvoE]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate an approach to the clinical, radiographic, and molecular diagnosis of an underlying skeletal dysplasia in adults presenting with early-onset polyarticular osteoarthritis (OA).

Methods

We identified a family with 2 adults with polyarticular OA and a child with generalized arthralgia. General, musculoskeletal, ocular, and auditory evaluations were undertaken. Investigations included radiographs of symptomatic joints, analysis of serum inflammatory markers and joint fluid, and mutational analyses of the COL11A2 gene.

Results

The 3 affected individuals had normal stature, mild mid-face hypoplasia, and hearing impairment, but normal eyes. Radiographs of the affected adults showed severe polyarticular OA but did not reveal diagnostic evidence of an underlying skeletal dysplasia. However, the child's radiographs showed enlarged epiphyses with an advanced bone age. The combination of skeletal, facial, and auditory features together with the absence of ocular features indicated that they had otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia, also known as Stickler syndrome type III. The diagnosis was confirmed by identifying a mutation in the COL11A2 gene that encodes the pre-pro-alpha2(XI) chain of type XI collagen that is involved in type II collagen fibrillogenesis.

Conclusion

Early-onset polyarticular OA may occur in adults without a known or obvious underlying skeletal dysplasia. This study provides an approach to the diagnosis of an underlying skeletal dysplasia in such individuals.

Introduction: Progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia (PPD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by non-inflammatory progressive arthropathy. A genetic defect causes progressive degeneration in joint cartilage (1). Typically starting with symmetric joint swelling and pain in childhood, PPD is often confused with more common pediatric rheumatic diseases such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis due to clinical similarities (2). Radiographic findings typically display characteristic changes like vertebral flattening and peripheral metaphyseal widening, which are important for distinguishing PPD from other conditions. This disease leads to progressive cartilage loss, joint stiffness, joint enlargement, and skeletal abnormalities, without the systemic inflammatory features typical of JIA.

Objectives: Misdiagnosis of PPD can lead to inappropriate treatments. Here, we present two siblings diagnosed with PPD to highlight the need for a genetic approach in cases of arthropathy with atypical courses.

Methods: Case 1 (17-year-old male): The patient first presented at the age of 7–8 with swelling in the fingers, leg deformities, later immobility, and a history of corrective orthopedic surgery. He had previously received treatments for JIA, which had not been beneficial. It was noted that his parents were related. Physical examination revealed bilateral metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joint swelling, pronounced kyphosis, deformities in the lower extremities, muscle atrophy, and swelling in both knees and toes, resulting in the inability to walk and reliance on a wheelchair. Despite these findings, he reported no significant pain. The patient's growth metrics were significantly below the standard percentile for his age. Acute phase reactants were normal, and radiographic examinations showed epiphyseal widening in the hand joints. MRI also displayed similar changes, indicating a non-inflammatory polyarticular process. Case 2 (9-year-old male): The younger brother of Case 1 presented with swelling in the fingers, wrists, and knees, and difficulty walking. Despite sharing similar clinical features, he did not have the advanced orthopedic complications seen in his older brother. Family history, radiological, and clinical findings prompted genetic testing of the patients.

### Utility of repeat MRI in assessing treatment non-response in axial spondyloarthritis: data from two large tertiary rheumatology centres [^1129JkCu]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Nearly half of patients in this report had non-inflammatory findings on MRI scans, and around 17% had concomitant inflammatory and non-inflammatory findings including structural changes such as SIJ ankylosis or degenerative changes and disc pathology. The presence of disc and degenerative changes increases with age and is more common in males, which is in keeping with the overall demographics of our cohort. The relationship between degenerative changes and disc disease on MRI with low back pain is unclear. A large study of healthy volunteers and those with lower back pain symptoms found no relationship between degenerative changes on lumbar MRI and symptoms, whereas other studies have demonstrated a relationship between MRI findings and symptoms. Caution should therefore be taken when attributing patient symptomology to MRI findings, such as degenerative changes and disc disease.

Some rarer findings included possible malignancy, spinal fractures and spinal stenosis. These findings resulted in a significant minority of patients being referred on to other medical specialties including spinal surgery, oncology, and pain team. This highlights the importance of MRI in identifying non-inflammatory pathology, some of which required further specialist input.

### Investigations of potential phenotypes of foot osteoarthritis: cross-sectional analysis from the clinical assessment study of the foot [^115gz2h5]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The pattern and location of joint involvement have played a fundamental role in shaping the current understanding of osteoarthritis (OA). Whether it is the differing effects of risk alleles and gene expression on hip and knee OA 1, the contrasting risk profiles of tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joint OA 2, or the symmetry and clustering of small joint involvement in hand OA 3, joint‐specific perspectives have proved insightful.

Box 1
Significance & Innovations

The foot joint complex presents a novel challenge in this regard. With few exceptions, population‐based epidemiologic studies have focused on the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints, predominantly the first MTP, for the purpose of estimating prevalence 4. Using a recently developed radiographic atlas for semiquantitative scoring of plain radiographs of the feet 5, Menz et al 6 and Roddy et al 7 have observed the frequent occurrence of osteophytes or joint space narrowing (JSN) in joints located in the medial column of the midfoot (specifically, the second cuneometatarsal [CM] joint, talonavicular [TN] joint, and navicular first cuneiform [NC] joints). While it remains the case that the first MTP joint is most commonly implicated in foot OA, these observations could be consistent with 2 quite different scenarios, both of which carry implications for how foot OA is understood and managed: either there are forms of OA at the foot that occur independently, or first MTP joint OA is associated with OA at other proximal joints in the foot as part of a more widespread polyarticular presentation.

### Hip osteoarthritis: what the radiologist wants to know [^1159Ksvf]. European Journal of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common disease of the hip joint seen in adults. The diagnosis of OA is based on a combination of radiographic findings of joint degeneration and characteristic subjective symptoms. The lack of a radiographic consensus definition has resulted in a variation of the published incidences and prevalence of OA. The chronological sequence of degeneration includes the following plain radiographic findings: joint space narrowing, development of osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis, and cyst formation. There are cases though, that plain radiographs show minor changes and the clinical suspicion of early disease can be confirmed with more sophisticated imaging methods, such as multi-detector computed tomography and MR imaging. The present article will review all the clinical information on the hip OA together with an updated radiological approach, with emphasis on the early depiction and the differential diagnosis of the disease.

### OARSI guidelines for the non-surgical management of knee, hip, and polyarticular osteoarthritis [^1163Xhsn]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To update and expand upon prior Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) guidelines by developing patient-focused treatment recommendations for individuals with Knee, Hip, and Polyarticular osteoarthritis (OA) that are derived from expert consensus and based on objective review of high-quality meta-analytic data.

Methods

We sought evidence for 60 unique interventions. A systematic search of all relevant databases was conducted from inception through July 2018. After abstract and full-text screening by two independent reviewers, eligible studies were matched to PICO questions. Data were extracted and meta-analyses were conducted using RevMan software. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Evidence Profiles were compiled using the GRADEpro web application. Voting for Core Treatments took place first. Four subsequent voting sessions took place via anonymous online survey, during which Panel members were tasked with voting to produce recommendations for all joint locations and comorbidity classes. We designated non-Core treatments to Level 1A, 1B, 2, 3, 4A, 4B, or 5, based on the percentage of votes in favor, in addition to the strength of the recommendation.

Results

Core Treatments for Knee OA included arthritis education and structured land-based exercise programs with or without dietary weight management. Core Treatments for Hip and Polyarticular OA included arthritis education and structured land-based exercise programs. Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were strongly recommended for individuals with Knee OA (Level 1A). For individuals with gastrointestinal comorbidities, COX-2 inhibitors were Level 1B and NSAIDs with proton pump inhibitors Level 2. For individuals with cardiovascular comorbidities or frailty, use of any oral NSAID was not recommended. Intra-articular (IA) corticosteroids, IA hyaluronic acid, and aquatic exercise were Level 1B/Level 2 treatments for Knee OA, dependent upon comorbidity status, but were not recommended for individuals with Hip or Polyarticular OA. The use of Acetaminophen/Paracetamol (APAP) was conditionally not recommended (Level 4A and 4B), and the use of oral and transdermal opioids was strongly not recommended (Level 5). A treatment algorithm was constructed in order to guide clinical decision-making for a variety of patient profiles, using recommended treatments as input for each decision node.

Conclusion

These guidelines offer comprehensive and patient-centered treatment profiles for individuals with Knee, Hip, and Polyarticular OA. The treatment algorithm will facilitate individualized treatment decisions regarding the management of OA.

### 2019 American College of Rheumatology / arthritis foundation guideline for the management of osteoarthritis of the hand, hip, and knee [^116QTzV7]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Medication selection and clinical considerations in osteoarthritis — for some patients with more limited disease in whom medication is required, topical NSAIDs represent an appropriate first choice, whereas for others, particularly with hip OA or polyarticular involvement, oral NSAIDs are more appropriate. The appropriate use of other oral agents, particularly acetaminophen and opioids, will continue to evolve. Despite the many options available, some patients may continue to experience inadequate symptom control, and clinicians treating patients in these circumstances should choose interventions with a low risk of harm; there are controversies in interpretation of the evidence, particularly with regard to the use of glucosamine and chondroitin, acupuncture, and intraarticular hyaluronic acid injections.

### What is the role of imaging in the clinical diagnosis of osteoarthritis and disease management? [^1152ewor]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

While OA is predominantly diagnosed on the basis of clinical criteria, imaging may aid with differential diagnosis in clinically suspected cases. While plain radiographs are traditionally the first choice of imaging modality, MRI and US also have a valuable role in assessing multiple pathologic features of OA, although each has particular advantages and disadvantages. Although modern imaging modalities provide the capability to detect a wide range of osseous and soft tissue (cartilage, menisci, ligaments, synovitis, effusion) OA-related structural damage, this extra information has not yet favourably influenced the clinical decision-making and management process. Imaging is recommended if there are unexpected rapid changes in clinical outcomes to determine whether it relates to disease severity or an additional diagnosis. On developing specific treatments, imaging serves as a sensitive tool to measure treatment response. This narrative review aims to describe the role of imaging modalities to aid in OA diagnosis, disease progression and management. It also provides insight into the use of these modalities in finding targeted treatment strategies in clinical research.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^115NVXQH]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Inflammatory arthritis with immune checkpoint inhibitors — frequency, presentation, differential diagnosis, and management are summarized: musculoskeletal symptoms such as arthralgia and myalgia are common in patients receiving ICI therapy, as reported in up to 40% of those treated in clinical trials, and the most common musculoskeletal and rheumatic irAEs are arthritis, polymyalgia-like syndromes, and myositis, which seem to be more frequent with PD-1/PD-L1 antagonists and when agents are used in combination. Clinical presentations vary from involvement of large and/or small joints to oligoarthritis of large joints, features of reactive arthritis, or symmetrical polyarthritis with autoantibodies; differentials include degenerative joint disease, osteoarthritis, soft tissue rheumatic disorders, crystal arthropathies, and septic arthritis, and inflammatory markers are usually very elevated. NSAIDs alone are usually not sufficient to control symptoms, and corticosteroids and synthetic or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs might be required, with intra-articular corticosteroid injections an option if only one or two joints are affected.

### Lower extremity arthroplasty in patients with inflammatory arthritis: preoperative and perioperative management [^1153WhjR]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

Spondylarthritis, which includes conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis are the most common forms of inflammatory arthritis. Joint inflammation and damage may result in the need for arthroplasty, and the surgeon must be aware of the perioperative challenges associated with these systemic diseases. In patients with inflammatory arthritis who have polyarticular disease and spinal involvement at the time of presentation for lower extremity arthroplasty, preoperative evaluation must include careful evaluation of all joints, including the cervical spine. Preoperative assessment and perioperative management must be appropriate to minimize cardiac and pulmonary complications. Finally, the perioperative management of medications used to manage inflammatory arthritis is critical because these medications may increase the risk of infection and compromise wound healing.

### Classification vs diagnostic criteria: the challenge of diagnosing axial spondyloarthritis [^115gMFfQ]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conventional radiography of sacroiliac joints (Fig. 4A) showed suspicious changes in the right sacroiliac joint – subchondral sclerosis and no clearly visible joint space in the upper portion of the joint that can be potentially related to true bony ankylosis as a manifestation of SpA but can also represent degenerative changes – a bulky osteophyte or a capsule ossification mimicking true ankylosis. MRI-STIR (Fig. 4B) showed no active inflammatory changes in the sacroiliac joints, but some bone marrow oedema in the vertebral bodies L5 and S1. MRI-T1 (Fig. 4C) showed no SpA compatible structural changes, but: (i) ossification of the capsule in the right sacroiliac joint that was responsible for the ankylosis-like appearance of the joint on the conventional radiography, and (ii) degenerative changes of the intervertebral disc L5/S1 with fatty metaplasia of the bone marrow of L5 and S1 vertebrae – degenerative changes compatible with the Modic type II lesion. Bone marrow oedema visible on STIR has, therefore, also degenerative origin. In this case, the presence of uveitis, HLA-B27, and inflammatory back pain is overweighed by the absence of SpA typical changes on imaging and – even more importantly – by the presence of degenerative changes explaining long-lasting back pain (Fig. 4D). Of note, an inappropriate application of the ASAS classification criteria instead of the diagnostic approach in this case would have resulted in a conclusion of the presence of axial SpA due to the presence of chronic back pain that started before 45 years of age, HLA-B27-positivity, presence of inflammatory back pain and acute anterior uveitis. 4
Conventional radiography, MRI-STIR, MRI-T1 of sacroiliac joints, and a diagnostic scale for patient B

A 53-year-old male patient referred by an ophthalmologist because of two recent episodes of acute anterior uveitis and inflammatory back pain of intermittent intensity for about 20 years. HLA-B27 is positive, CRP is normal. Conventional radiography of sacroiliac joints showed suspicious changes, but no SpA-compatible changes could be found on MRI. At the same time, degenerative changes of the intervertebral disc represent the most likely explanation of back pain in this case. See the article text for further details. SpA: spondyloarthritis; STIR: short tau inversion recovery.

### Lipoma arborescens: comparison of typical and atypical disease presentations [^111A1wcW]. Clinical Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

To determine whether the aetiology differed between typical cases of lipoma arborescens with unilateral knee involvement and atypical cases involving joints other than the knee, polyarticular disease, and disease outside of the knee joint.

Materials and Methods

Cases of lipoma arborescens involving the knee joint were evaluated for the distribution of the disease and severity of degenerative arthritis. Joints other than the knee were evaluated for the presence and severity of degenerative arthritis, and the distribution was classified as either intra-articular, extra-articular, or both. Clinical history was reviewed for patient age at presentation, a history of inflammatory arthritis, diabetes mellitus, and known steroid use. Fisher's exact test was used to determine whether there was a statistically significant difference between typical and atypical presentations of the disease.

Results

Lipoma arborescens was identified in 45 joints in 39 patients. Twenty-eight patients were classified as "typical" and 11 patients had "atypical" disease. There was no significant difference in age at presentation, presence of degenerative arthritis, or known inflammatory arthritis when comparing typical and atypical presentations of the disease.

Conclusion

Twenty-eight percent of patients in the present study had atypical presentation of lipoma arborescens with multifocal lipoma arborescens or disease in joints other than the knee. There was no significant difference in age at presentation, presence of degenerative arthritis, or known inflammatory arthritis when comparing typical and atypical presentations of the disease. Of the 39 patients, only three had no evidence of degenerative arthritis, which suggests that many cases of lipoma arborescens are secondary to chronic reactive change in association with degenerative arthritis.

### Imaging in rheumatology: reconciling radiology and rheumatology [^114h9MJF]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Radiographs

Radiographs are insensitive to most forms of soft tissue inflammation and usually play little role in these cases. Radiographs of the hands or other inflamed joints mostly show normal bone structure and alignment in early disease (Fig. 1) and are requested by some rheumatologists to establish a baseline. The earliest radiographic findings or rheumatoid arthritis are periarticular soft tissue swelling, followed by osteopenia and bone erosions. In early disease the joint space may appear widened due to joint effusion and synovitis. In latter stages joint destruction, bone union and malalignment may occur (Fig. 2). The early disease stages, soft tissue swelling, osteopenia and even bone erosions are still reversible. Obviously once cartilage destruction has occurred this is irreversible and, even if the rheumatoid arthritis is halted, secondary osteoarthritis will ensue.

Fig. 1

Radiographs of the hands were normal (shown here X-ray left hand, a). Ultrasound demonstrates a bone erosion of the second metacarpal head with mild hypervascularity (b), indicating active mild inflammation. Ultrasound is far more sensitive than radiography for inflammatory joint change

Fig. 2

A radiograph of the left hand shows osteopenia, destruction of the metacarpophalangeal joints (MCPJs) and wrist joint, and fusion of the carpal bones. Outcomes like these should hopefully become extinct with early diagnosis and treatment

### Correlation of radiographic and arthroscopic findings with rotator cuff tears and degenerative joint disease [^1153Eo9f]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to identify early signs of rotator cuff tear and glenohumeral articular cartilage degeneration by using conventional radiography. A non-weighted anteroposterior oblique and a weighted active abduction view were evaluated for superior humeral migration and matching degenerative changes at the inferolateral acromion and superior aspect of the greater tuberosity in 40 patients who underwent shoulder arthroscopy. Measurements of the glenohumeral distance were performed. Surgical reports were reviewed to determine rotator cuff and glenohumeral articular cartilage status. Matching degenerative changes correlate with complete rotator cuff tear (P = 0.04); superior migration does not. Severe glenohumeral cartilage loss correlates with narrowing of the superior joint space on the anteroposterior oblique radiograph (P = 0.02) and with narrowing of the mid joint space on the active abduction view (P = 0.05). Both glenohumeral articular cartilage degenerative change and rotator cuff injury, before formation of typical sequelae of chronic rotator cuff tear, can be detected with the use of conventional radiography.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patterns and imaging detail two major patterns — peripheral joint disease (polyarticular or pauciarticular) and skeletal or axial disease — with approximately 95% of patients having peripheral joint involvement, about 5% having exclusively axial involvement, and 20% to 50% having both spine and peripheral joint involvement. Asymptomatic involvement of the spine and sacroiliac joints may occur, and radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging and/or computed tomography imaging can be helpful in detecting asymptomatic disease.

### Heberden's nodes and what heberden could not see: the pivotal role of ligaments in the pathogenesis of early nodal osteoarthritis and beyond [^111JmCmG]. Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Despite its relatively high prevalence, polyarticular nature, limited treatment options and recognized genetic contribution, the study of generalized OA (GOA) has lagged behind that of isolated knee OA. Whilst the pathogenesis of OA has been viewed in relation to either articular cartilage or bone disease, this article offers a viewpoint on why GOA may, in fact, be primarily a disorder of ligaments, and to a lesser extent tendon and joint capsule dysfunction. A relatively fast presentation of GOA, typically in the perimenopausal period, and its recognition on clinical grounds alone makes this type of OA potentially useful for pathogenic studies in OA, in general. The recent high-resolution MRI studies, microanatomical studies and animal models, in addition to established clinical and radiographic data that support this ligament-centric perspective of disease, are reviewed. The earliest structural abnormalities in GOA may be evident in ligaments and the ligament-associated 'enthesis organ', where degenerative changes are evident. Ligaments also influence the expression of joint damage including Heberden's node and joint erosion formation. Joint inflammation in a 'periarthritis' pattern is well recognized in GOA, and histological studies have shown that the ligament and capsule could represent the epicentre of such inflammatory changes. A perspective is also offered on how ligaments could play a pivotal role in OA in general; for example, the loss of joint space in knee OA due to meniscal extrusion could ultimately be related to derangement of the medial collateral ligament to which the meniscus is anchored.

### A clinical perspective on imaging in juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^116bUcnM]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

In advanced stages of disease, XR allows visualization of late complications (erosions, ankylosis, subluxation or joint malalignment, enlarged epiphysis, premature growth plate fusion leading to limb length inequality, spinal deformities, muscle atrophy) (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3
Anteroposterior radiographs of both hands in a 19-year-old young woman with a long history of aggressive seronegative polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, onset at the age of 7 years and with poor adherence to treatment. Images show mild bilateral periarticular osteoporosis (long arrows), growth arrest lines in the radial metaphysis and bone-in-bone appearance of carpal bones (short arrows), joint space narrowing of carpo-metacarpal joints and intercarpal bones, more pronounced on the right (arrowheads), and mild soft tissue edema around the right ulna (thin arrow)

In addition, XR has a historical role in assessing bone maturity and detecting bone age delay or progression, which in JIA may also help to distinguish where disease control is suboptimal or whether other factors are influencing growth retardation.

In summary, XR is a useful method for differential diagnosis in doubtful cases, evaluation of structural and morphological changes before diagnosis (indication based on clinical examination), and evaluation and monitoring of joint destruction and growth disorders.

Indications for musculoskeletal ultrasound

Musculoskeletal US represents an easily accessible, clinically relevant routine examination in children with JIA.

Before US can be established as a valuable imaging modality, two significant challenges must be overcome: understanding age-related normal findings and standardizing the US protocol for different joints.

Numerous papers, including the 2018 OMERACT US in Paediatrics Working Group, have described the standardization of US examination for different joints, including physiological intra-articular vascularization, patient and joint position, and transducer placement for each examination approach.

Although these reports provide information to help differentiate between normal and pathological findings of joints in children, they currently serve as baseline information. Assessment of changes in US characteristics within an individual subject over time could potentially be more informative than a simple comparison with a cutoff value. Another issue is the minimum and optimal set of joints that should be scanned for routine musculoskeletal US surveillance. Scanning all accessible joints is not feasible in routine practice, and different studies have tested different numbers of joints.

### Diagnosis and clinical presentation of osteoarthritis [^112Wu5Mg]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA), the commonest arthropathy, targets the knees, hips, finger interphalangeal joints, thumb bases, first metatarsophalangeal joints, and spinal facet joints, and displays marked heterogeneity of clinical presentation. Signs of OA include coarse crepitus, bony enlargement, reduced range of movement, and joint-line tenderness. Muscle wasting and joint deformity occur with severe OA. Painful periarticular disorders often coexist with OA. Inflammation is absent or only modest, although mild-moderate effusions are common at the knee. The diagnosis of OA may be made without recourse to radiographic or laboratory investigations in the at-risk age group with typical symptoms and signs.

### Hip pain and mobility deficits – hip osteoarthritis: clinical practice guidelines linked to the international classification of functioning, disability, and health from the orthopaedic section of the American Physical Therapy Association [^1136sjvX]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2009). Medium credibility.

Hip osteoarthritis — imaging studies and radiographic criteria: Imaging studies, specifically plain film radiographs, are confirmatory for moderate to severe hip OA; however, radiographs are less useful in demonstrating early osteoarthritic joint changes, and joint space narrowing detected on radiographs may be a relatively late stage phenomenon of OA. Joint space narrowing has been advocated as the best indicator and best predictor of arthritic change in patients with hip OA. The normal hip joint space is 3 to 5 mm, and a reduction of greater than or equal to 0.5 mm represents a clinically relevant and significant reduction in joint space width. Hip joint OA is considered moderate when joint space is less than 2.5 mm and severe when joint space is less than 1.5 mm. The development of newer imaging techniques, such as gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, has been suggested as a method to detect deficiencies in cartilage structure that may represent early arthritic changes in young patients. In addition to joint space narrowing, other criteria, including osteophyte formation and subchondral sclerosis, also are used to identify patients with hip OA, and the Kellgren/Lawrence scale has been used to classify degenerative findings associated with hip OA. The scale consists of 4 grades: grade 1, no radiographic evidence of OA; grade 2, doubtful narrowing of joint space and possible (minute) osteophytes; grade 3, moderate definite osteophytes, definite moderate narrowing of joint space; grade 4, large osteophytes, severe joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and definite deformity of bone contour; a potential caveat when using the Kellgren/Lawrence scale is spurs or osteophytes are emphasized and not all patients with hip OA have osteophytes.

### African guidelines for diagnosis and management of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis: PAFLAR initiative [^112nJD34]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common rheumatologic disease of childhood. JIA is not a single disease but a diagnosis that applies to all forms of arthritis of unknown origin, with an onset before the 16th birthday, lasting more than 6 weeks, and where other causes of arthritis have been excluded. According to the International League Against Rheumatism (ILAR) classification system, there are different clinical categories of JIA, including oligoarthritis, extended oligoarthritis, enthesitis-related arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor (RF) negative), polyarthritis (RF positive) and systemic arthritis. Each form of JIA has a risk of irreversible joint damage and a lower health-related quality of life. The illness can also continue into adulthood, resulting in persistently high morbidity and a reduced quality of life. Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (poly-JIA) is a subset of JIA which is characterized by the presence of more than four affected joints during the first six months of disease, poly-JIA affects about 20 to 30% of JIA patients.

The main aim of JIA treatment is to achieve remission of the disease with normalization of physical findings and laboratory markers of inflammation, to preserve the physical and psychological integrity of the child, and to prevent any long-term consequences related to the disease or its therapy. Clinical evidence suggests that early diagnosis and treatment of inflammation might improve the prognosis and avert chronic consequences. Treatment recommendations are designed to help healthcare professionals in various manners, such as lowering the likelihood of receiving improper care, promoting the appropriate and efficient use of resources, and encouraging the adoption of a consistent approach to care delivery.

The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) published its last recommendations for Non-Systemic Polyarthritis, Sacroiliitis, and Enthesitis in 2019 to provide international guidelines for some JIA subtypes. Africa is a low- and middle-income continent where managing this chronic illness presents major challenges due to scarce resources and inequities. This served as the primary impetus for creating guidelines tailored specifically for African children suffering from JIA. All children JIA have the right to fair access to the best clinical care possible and setting standards of care is one way to realize this right progressively.

The aim of this work is to release updated guidelines for diagnosis and treatment based on evidence for children and adolescents with poly-JIA, considering the African-specific nature of the varied spectrum of resources and low income, also on the same time incorporating newly released data and using a treat-to-target approach.

### Polyarticular joint pain in adults: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^1124uUZ4]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Polyarticular joint pain involves five or more joints and can be inflammatory or noninflammatory. Two of the most common causes of chronic polyarthritis are osteoarthritis, especially in older patients, and rheumatoid arthritis, which affects at least 0.25% of adults worldwide. The initial evaluation should include a detailed history of the patient's symptoms, with a focus on inflammation, location of pain, duration of symptoms, the presence of systemic symptoms, and any exposures to pathogens that could cause arthritis. Redness, warmth, or swelling in a joint is suggestive of synovitis and joint inflammation. A systematic approach to the physical examination that assesses for a pattern of joint involvement and presence of synovitis can help narrow the differential diagnosis. Laboratory tests, joint aspiration, and imaging studies should be used to confirm a suspected diagnosis. Rheumatoid factor and cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody tests are helpful when there is concern for rheumatoid arthritis. Although magnetic resonance imaging is highly sensitive in identifying erosive bony changes and inflammation, conventional radiography remains the standard for the initial imaging evaluation of rheumatoid arthritis. Point-of-care musculoskeletal ultrasonography can also be a useful tool to detect findings that support a diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis.

### Two-year changes in magnetic resonance imaging features and pain in thumb base osteoarthritis [^116WetJw]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hand osteoarthritis (OA) is a polyarticular disease, affecting the interphalangeal joints and the thumb base, a joint complex that includes the first carpometacarpal (CMC1) and scaphotrapeziotrapezoid (STT) joints. The thumb base has certain unique qualities, such as a high range of motion and the capability to bear high loads, which sets it apart from other hand joints. Thumb base OA is associated with different clinical and imaging outcomes than interphalangeal OA, and was therefore considered to be a separate hand OA subset. Most research in hand OA has focused on the hand as a whole or the interphalangeal joints specifically, and the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for OA of the hand do not distinguish between interphalangeal OA and thumb base OA. Therefore, our knowledge of this hand OA subset and its natural course is limited.

SIGNIFICANCE & INNOVATIONS

In thumb base osteoarthritis (OA), the majority of patients have unchanged pain on palpation and unchanged magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features after a 2‐year follow‐up.
In patients who had changes on MRI during the follow‐up period, structural osteoarthritic MRI features generally deteriorated, while synovitis and bone marrow lesions fluctuated.
Change in MRI inflammation is associated with change in pain on palpation in thumb base OA.

Alongside structural joint damage, which is a hallmark of the disease, inflammatory features visible on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including synovitis and bone marrow lesions (BMLs), are often present in interphalangeal and thumb base OA. Cross‐sectional studies have shown that in interphalangeal joints, synovitis and BMLs are associated with pain on palpation, and more strongly so than structural damage. Yet, in a study investigating these aspects in thumb base OA, the opposite was seen — while synovitis and BMLs were associated with pain, structural damage was found to be the most important determinant of pain.

Longitudinal imaging studies of interphalangeal OA have shown that a change in MRI inflammation was also associated with a change in pain levels. In thumb base OA, however, no longitudinal imaging studies have been performed thus far. Hence, the natural course of osteoarthritic MRI features is unknown, as is the relation between changes in these features and clinical outcomes. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the two‐year course of pain on palpation and MRI features in thumb base OA and their association with one another.

### 2019 update of the American College of Rheumatology / Spondylitis Association of America / Spondyloarthritis Research and Treatment Network recommendations for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis [^114hPdnH]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

Imaging and monitoring in axial spondyloarthritis — MRI and radiography guidance specifies that spine and/or pelvis MRI could aid in the evaluation of patients in whom the degree of active inflammation is uncertain, especially when findings would change management. MRI is not recommended to seek subclinical inflammation in patients with stable disease, though MRI could be considered in circumstances in which the findings would inform shared decision‑making. We recommend against obtaining spine radiographs on scheduled intervals to monitor progression; the panel also recommended against repeating spine radiographs as a standard approach, although in the absence of clinical indications repeat spine radiographs could be considered on an ad hoc basis for counseling patients on disease progression.

Radiographic findings

Radiographs of the spine and pelvis may show typical findings of AS and SI. The latter is typically bilateral, although a higher frequency of asymmetric SI and zygapophyseal joint ankylosis has been reported. Peripheral joint involvement is generally not accompanied by radiographic changes, but erosive lesions mainly of the metatarsal joints, have been described. These lesions show some differences to rheumatoid lesions, for example an absence of osteoporosis and the presence of adjacent bone proliferation. Rarely, a destructive granulomatous synovitis may be seen in CD. Enthesopaties do not differ radiographically from those seen in other SpA.

- presence of erosive disease or enthesitis

- delay in diagnosis

- elevated levels of inflammatory markers

- symmetric disease.

### Inflammatory and degenerative sacroiliac joint disease in a primary back pain cohort [^1157FPt4]. Arthritis Care & Research (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The prevalence of sacroiliac (SI) joint abnormalities in a primary low back pain population remains unresolved. The aims of our study were to define the prevalence of SI joint disease in this cohort, and to identify clinical features that might accurately predict radiographic changes in the SI joint and spine.

Methods

Lumbar spine and anteroposterior pelvis radiographs taken over a 3-year period for the evaluation of back pain at a major chiropractic college were scored for the presence of inflammatory or degenerative features. Data were subsequently extracted by means of a predetermined template from the clinical notes. The outcomes were correlated using Spearman's correlation coefficients.

Results

We identified 315 patients (173 men, 142 women), ages 18–60 years. Of these, 100 patients (31.7%) demonstrated SI joint abnormalities: 75 (23.8%) degenerative, 25 (7.9%) inflammatory. Sex was strongly associated with type of SI joint pathology; degenerative disease was predominantly found in women (68%), whereas inflammatory disease was predominantly found in men (63%). In women there was no correlation between degenerative SI joint abnormalities and degenerative changes in the lumbar spine. Of the clinical descriptors evaluated, none were associated with the radiographic findings with the exception of buttock pain, which was associated with inflammatory sacroiliitis. Neither being overweight nor pregnancy history was associated with degenerative changes in the SI joint.

Conclusion

In a primary back pain cohort, degenerative SI joint disease may be an under-recognized clinical entity. It is strongly influenced by sex but is unrelated to degenerative changes in the lumbar spine. Currently proposed clinical discriminators performed poorly in correlating with radiographic changes in the SI joint.

Serious conditions and inconsistent presentations — clinicians should recognize signs and symptoms associated with serious pathological knee conditions, continually screen for them, and immediately initiate referral when a potentially serious medical condition is suspected; clinicians should consider diagnostic classifications associated with serious pathological conditions or psychosocial factors when patients' limitations are inconsistent with this guideline or when symptoms are not resolving with impairment-focused interventions.

### Hip pain and mobility deficits-hip osteoarthritis: revision 2017 [^111u6Bt2]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Medium credibility.

Pathoanatomical features and imaging — clinicians should assess for impairments in mobility of the hip joint and the strength of the surrounding muscles, especially the hip abductor muscles, when a patient presents with hip pain, and acetabular retroversion is associated with the development of hip OA with radiographic identification via the ischial spine sign. Cartilage defects and bone marrow lesions in the anterior and central superolateral regions of the joint may represent early structural damage, and patients with hip OA have less femoral-head cartilage volume and a higher prevalence of cartilage defects and bone marrow lesions. Early articular changes observed on imaging may help identify individuals who have not been clinically diagnosed with hip OA, and in patients with hip pain there is some evidence that the presence of acetabular retroversion is related to the development of hip OA.

### Incidence of bilateral scapholunate dissociation in symptomatic and asymptomatic wrists [^111dw5mh]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Scapholunate dissociation (SLD) is thought to be a common cause of both acute and chronic wrist pain. Classically, this condition is attributed to a traumatic event and is thought to inevitably lead to the development of degenerative arthritis. Bilateral findings should thus be infrequent. The purpose of the present study was to determine the incidence of bilateral radiographic SLD and associated arthritic changes.

Methods

Demographic, radiographic, and clinical data were obtained from 124 patients with abnormal x-ray findings in at least 1 wrist. Radiographs reviewed included posteroanterior, lateral, and Moneim views of both symptomatic and asymptomatic wrists. Pathology was defined as a scapholunate gap ≥ 5 mm and/or a scapholunate angle ≥ 60°. Arthritic changes were assessed.

Results

A majority of the 124 patients (51%) were unable to recall any specific injury to their wrist. On the symptomatic side, 101 (81%) patients had a pathologic measurement for their scapholunate gap, and 109 (88%) had an abnormal angle measurement. On the asymptomatic side, 64 (52%) of the gap measurements and 87 (70%) of the angle measurements were pathologic. Ninety-nine patients (80%) had abnormal radiographic findings bilaterally for at least 1 variable on each side. Only 13 patients (11%) had a clinical instability pattern typical of SLD. Half the patients had radiographic degenerative changes at presentation.

Conclusions

Bilateral radiographic SLD is much more common than previously assumed, is often asymptomatic, and does not inevitably lead to degenerative arthritis. These findings should call into question the assumption of a uniquely traumatic etiology. Further, most patients presented with pathologies unrelated to the scapholunate articulation. Surgical intervention chosen on the basis of radiologic findings, in the absence of clinical instability, might not be the best course of action, unless criteria are established to determine which patients eventually develop arthritic changes or become symptomatic.

### Osteoarthritis-an untreatable disease? [^1137QoTc]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2005). Medium credibility.

Osteoarthritis is a painful and disabling disease that affects millions of patients. Its aetiology is largely unknown, but is most likely multi-factorial. Osteoarthritis poses a dilemma: it often begins attacking different joint tissues long before middle age, but cannot be diagnosed until it becomes symptomatic decades later, at which point structural alterations are already quite advanced. In this review, osteoarthritis is considered as a disease of the whole joint that may result from multiple pathophysiological mechanisms, one of which is the dysregulation of lipid homeostasis. No proven disease-modifying therapy exists for osteoarthritis and current treatment options for chronic osteoarthritic pain are insufficient, but new pharmacotherapeutic options are emerging.

Cervical plain film imaging and facet pain — evidence from observational studies shows limited association between radiographic changes and pain. In chiropractic clinic attendees, 322 pts had symptoms that did not correlate with cervical facet joint degeneration. In a national survey, 5440 volunteers 20–65 years of age showed that osteoarthritis of cervical facet joints on radiographs was not associated with neck pain, with mean age of participants 46 years and age positively associated with neck pain. In patients with chronic neck pain, 205 pts with neck pain > 10 years duration showed no association between pain presence or severity and degenerative changes including facet arthropathy; 68 of 205 (33%) were involved in litigation, mean age at onset 43 years, and mean final evaluation age 58 years. In a case–control sample, 653 case pts and 365 controls demonstrated no significant difference in cervical spondylosis between groups or associations of pain/stiffness with x-ray findings, although cervical spondylosis was positively correlated with age.
