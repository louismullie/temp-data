## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about post-void residual (PVR) — what it is, how to measure it, how to interpret it across populations, and how to act on it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining PVR and its clinical relevance. Then, I should verify the best measurement methods and pitfalls. Next, I will examine normative values by population and the concept of "significant" PVR. After that, I need to check how PVR informs decision-making in key clinical scenarios. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and highlight uncertainties that require caution in interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the definition and why PVR matters. PVR is the volume of urine remaining in the bladder immediately after voiding; it is a nonspecific marker of impaired emptying that can reflect detrusor underactivity, bladder outlet obstruction, or both, and chronically elevated PVR can predispose to complications such as UTIs, stones, and upper tract deterioration, though the strength of evidence linking specific PVR thresholds to complications varies by population and context [^4d5ce8b3] [^0a1af52e].

> I need to verify the optimal measurement method and timing. Ultrasound bladder scanning is preferred over catheterization because it is noninvasive and avoids infection or urethral trauma; catheterization remains the reference standard when ultrasound is unavailable or unreliable, and PVR should be measured as soon as possible after voiding to minimize error from post-void drainage or refilling, with attention to bladder fullness at the time of voiding to avoid false positives from overdistension [^51c1ec24] [^8e6ce9e4] [^f6bb31ab].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single PVR value. I should double-check repeatability. A single elevated PVR is unreliable; repeating the measurement reduces false positives substantially, with studies showing that an initial PVR ≥ 100 mL often normalizes on repeat testing, so I should confirm an abnormality before making decisions that carry risk or cost [^547bc919] [^a50cd7c5].

> Next, I should review normative PVR in healthy adults. In a large cohort of healthy adults, the 90th percentile for PVR was about 73 mL in men and 61 mL in women, and the 95th percentile was about 103 mL in men and 94 mL in women; importantly, PVR correlated with voided volume and symptom burden, but age did not independently influence PVR in multivariable analysis, which cautions against age-based thresholds alone [^6748101c].

> Wait, let me verify population-specific norms. In adolescents, age and sex matter: older adolescents have higher PVRs than younger, and females have higher PVRs than males; the 90th percentile thresholds are roughly 20 mL for males and 25–35 mL for females depending on age, reinforcing the need for age- and sex-specific reference ranges rather than fixed cutoffs [^6414d245]. In children, normal PVR is often defined as less than 20 mL or less than 10% of expected bladder capacity, but intra-individual variability is high, so repeat measurement is essential to avoid misclassification [^873d239d] [^560e09f5].

> I will now examine what constitutes "significant" or "elevated" PVR. There is no universal threshold; clinical significance depends on context. That said, many guidelines and studies pragmatically treat PVR greater than 150–200 mL as noteworthy in adults, while acknowledging that values between 50 and 200 mL are a gray zone and that PVR alone does not diagnose obstruction or detrusor underactivity [^98721b75] [^8e6ce9e4]. In men with LUTS/BPH, a PVR greater than 300 mL is often flagged as "large" and worth monitoring, though it is not a strong predictor of acute urinary retention, so I should avoid overinterpreting a single large value [^add82bd1].

> Let me consider the link between PVR and UTI risk, because this often drives action. In asymptomatic men, a PVR threshold of 180 mL was associated with high specificity but low sensitivity for bacteriuria, and a separate validation found poor diagnostic performance, so I should not use 180 mL as a standalone trigger for antibiotics or invasive therapy; instead, I should integrate PVR with symptoms, flow, and culture results [^4bc67e51] [^d98eddf1]. In women with recurrent UTIs, a PVR greater than 100 mL increases suspicion for incomplete emptying, but again, I should confirm with repeat testing and correlate with symptoms before escalating care [^fd7d0aaa].

> Next, I should review how PVR guides decisions in key scenarios. In men with LUTS/BPH, measuring PVR is recommended before initiating treatment or surgery, and a large PVR may influence the choice or timing of therapy, though it does not reliably predict acute retention; in women with stress urinary incontinence, PVR is part of the preoperative evaluation, and an elevated PVR should prompt reassessment of voiding function before anti-incontinence surgery; in neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction, PVR is essential at baseline and follow-up, with a PVR greater than 300 mL often prompting urodynamics and consideration of catheterization strategies; in the postpartum setting, covert retention is common, and many experts advocate using a higher threshold (for example, ≥ 500 mL) to define clinically meaningful retention given the larger bladder capacities during pregnancy and early postpartum [^add82bd1] [^420cea7d] [^0a1af52e] [^9e2c04f7].

> I should confirm how PVR is used in overactive bladder care. Guidelines advise measuring PVR when OAB symptoms coexist with voiding or emptying symptoms or when response to therapy is suboptimal, largely to exclude retention or incomplete emptying that could be worsened by antimuscarinics; importantly, there is no accepted PVR threshold that contraindicates OAB therapy, but caution is warranted when PVR is elevated, and bladder voiding efficiency can help contextualize incomplete emptying when capacity is low [^5fc81c72] [^9b2478f0].

> But wait, what if the patient is postoperative and I need a practical threshold for retention. In urogynecologic postoperative care, voiding trials use inconsistent criteria; a PVR threshold around 150 mL balances detection of retention against unnecessary interventions, and cost-effectiveness modeling supports 150 mL over 100 mL to minimize ED visits and missed retention, though some centers use 100–200 mL depending on protocol and risk tolerance [^06272ce5] [^81b73fc8].

> I need to ensure I am not overpromising what PVR can tell us. PVR is a nonspecific safety marker; it cannot distinguish obstruction from detrusor underactivity, and a normal PVR does not exclude voiding dysfunction, so I should pair PVR with uroflowmetry, symptom assessment, and, when indicated, pressure-flow studies to clarify etiology and guide therapy [^98721b75] [^d3a205fd].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations. Measure PVR with ultrasound when feasible, repeat if elevated, and interpret in clinical context; in general adults, PVR less than 50 mL is reassuring, 50–150 mL warrants attention if symptomatic or persistent, and greater than 150–200 mL should prompt evaluation for causes of incomplete emptying; in adolescents, use age- and sex-specific percentiles; in children, repeat measurements are critical and PVR greater than 20 mL or greater than 10% of capacity is concerning if persistent; in neurogenic patients, PVR greater than 300 mL should trigger further assessment; and in postpartum patients, consider higher thresholds and monitor closely for persistence beyond 7 days [^6748101c] [^6414d245] [^873d239d] [^0a1af52e] [^53eafec4].

> Finally, I should double-check key uncertainties so we do not overgeneralize. There is no consensus on a single "normal" PVR across populations, evidence linking specific PVR thresholds to hard outcomes like renal failure is limited, and measurement variability and bladder fullness at voiding can confound interpretation; therefore, I should individualize decisions, avoid reflexive catheterization based on a single value, and align follow-up with symptoms, risk, and the clinical scenario [^7ec73c33] [^8e6ce9e4] [^f6bb31ab].

Post-void residual (PVR) is the **volume of urine remaining in the bladder after voiding** [^bca36dd5], typically measured by ultrasound or catheterization [^51c1ec24] [^9b2478f0]. PVR is used to assess bladder emptying and guide management of LUTS, incontinence, and neurogenic bladder [^8e6ce9e4] [^4d5ce8b3]. Normal PVR is **generally < 50 mL** [^420cea7d]; 50–100 mL is borderline, and > 100 mL is considered abnormal and may indicate retention or voiding dysfunction [^7dd6c7df]. Elevated PVR increases risks of UTI, renal damage, and retention [^4d5ce8b3]; management depends on cause and may include bladder training, medications, or catheterization [^7ec73c33]. Always confirm a single elevated PVR with repeat measurement before acting [^a50cd7c5] [^547bc919].

---

## Definition and clinical significance

PVR is the **volume of urine remaining in the bladder after voiding** [^bca36dd5]; it reflects bladder emptying efficiency and helps identify retention or voiding dysfunction [^4d5ce8b3]. PVR is a standard part of evaluating LUTS, incontinence, and neurogenic bladder [^8e6ce9e4] [^4d5ce8b3].

---

## Normal values and thresholds

Normal PVR varies by age, sex, and bladder capacity; general adult thresholds include:

| **Pvr volume** | **Clinical interpretation** |
|-|-|
| < 50 mL | Normal |
| 50–100 mL | Borderline; monitor if symptomatic |
| > 100 mL | Abnormal; evaluate for retention or voiding dysfunction |

---

These thresholds guide decisions, but **repeat measurement is essential** to confirm persistence before acting [^a50cd7c5] [^547bc919].

---

## Measurement methods

PVR can be measured by **ultrasound (preferred)** [^51c1ec24] or **catheterization (reference standard)** [^0a1af52e]. Ultrasound is noninvasive and accurate, but accuracy can be reduced by obesity, prior surgery, or pelvic pathology [^3150e6db]; catheterization is more invasive and carries UTI risk [^a50cd7c5].

---

## Clinical implications of elevated PVR

Elevated PVR signals impaired emptying and is associated with:

- **Increased UTI risk**: Especially with PVR > 100 mL [^notfound].
- **Renal damage**: From chronic retention and backpressure [^4d5ce8b3].
- **Acute urinary retention**: Particularly in men with BPH or neurogenic bladder [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing PVR

Several factors affect PVR:

- **Age**: Older adults have higher PVR due to reduced detrusor function [^notfound].
- **Sex**: Men have higher PVR due to prostate-related obstruction [^c4cba3b5].
- **Bladder capacity**: Larger bladders may have higher absolute PVR but similar relative residuals [^6748101c].
- **Medications**: Anticholinergics and opioids can increase PVR [^notfound].

---

## Clinical management of elevated PVR

Management depends on cause, severity, and symptoms:

- **Behavioral therapy**: Bladder training, double voiding, pelvic floor therapy [^notfound].
- **Medications**: Alpha-blockers for obstruction; cholinergics for detrusor underactivity [^72cd28e6].
- **Catheterization**: Intermittent or indwelling for retention or neurogenic bladder [^7ec73c33].
- **Surgery**: For obstruction (e.g. TURP) or severe prolapse [^7dd6c7df].

---

## Special considerations

- **Neurogenic bladder**: PVR > 300 mL warrants urodynamics and close follow-up [^0a1af52e].
- **Postpartum retention**: Common; most resolve, but persistent PVR > 150 mL needs evaluation [^53eafec4].
- **Pediatrics**: PVR > 20 mL or > 10% of capacity is abnormal and may indicate dysfunction [^560e09f5].

---

## Limitations and considerations

PVR is a snapshot and can vary with hydration, anxiety, or measurement method; **repeat measurement is critical** to confirm abnormalities before making decisions [^a50cd7c5] [^547bc919]. PVR alone does not distinguish obstruction from detrusor underactivity, so clinical context and, when needed, urodynamics are essential [^98721b75].

---

PVR is a key measure of bladder emptying; **normal is generally < 50 mL**, with > 100 mL prompting evaluation. Management is tailored to cause and symptoms, and **repeat measurement is essential** to confirm persistence before intervening [^a50cd7c5].

### Residual urinary volume and urinary tract infection – when are they linked? [^4bc67e51]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Large post-void residual urinary volume may be related to the development of urinary tract infection. However, the maximum post-void residual volume that predisposes patients to a higher risk of urinary tract infection is not known. In this prospective study we determined the cutoff value for post-void residual volume that places adult men at risk for bacteriuria.

Materials and Methods

Data were obtained from 196 consecutive healthy adult men (median age 62 years) who came for prostate evaluation without symptoms of acute urinary tract infection. Right after spontaneous voiding, bladder catheterization was performed under normal aseptic conditions, and the post-void residual volume measured. Urine samples were collected for culture from each patient and the results were compared to the various post-void residual volume.

Results

Overall 27% of the patients presented with a positive urine culture. The mean post-void residual volume in this group was 257 mL (range 150 to 560) compared to 133 mL (range 10 to 340) for the group with negative culture (p < 0.001). The post-void residual volume value of 180 mL was determined to have the best specificity and sensitivity. The positive predictive value for bacterial growth at a post-void residual volume of 180 mL or greater was 87.0% and the negative predictive value was 94.7%.

Conclusions

Clinically asymptomatic adult men with a post-void residual volume of 180 mL are at a high risk for bacteriuria. Such cases require close medical attention since it may be necessary to introduce early drug therapy or surgical intervention to improve the bladder emptying.

### Measurement of post-void residual urine [^8e6ce9e4]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

To present the teaching module "Measurement of Post-void residual urine".

Methods

This module has been prepared by a Working Group of the ICS Urodynamics Committee. The methodology used included comprehensive literature review, consensus formation by the members of the Working Group, and review by members of the ICS Urodynamics Committee core panel.

Results

In this ICS teaching module the evidence for and relevance of PVR measurement in patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) is summarized; in short: The interval between voiding and post-void residual (PVR) measurement should be of short duration and ultrasound bladder volume measurement is preferred to urethral catheterization. There is no universally accepted definition of a significant residual urine volume. Large PVR (> 200-300ml) may indicate marked bladder dysfunction and may predispose to unsatisfactory treatment results if for example, invasive treatment for bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) is undertaken. PVR does not seem to be a strong predictor of acute urinary retention and does not indicate presence of BOO specifically. Although the evidence base is limited, guidelines on assessment of LUTS generally include PVR measurement.

Conclusion

Measurement of PVR is recommended in guidelines and recommendations on the management of LUTS and urinary incontinence, but the level of evidence for this measurement is not high. This manuscript summarizes the evidence and provides practice recommendations for teaching purposes in the framework of an ICS teaching module.

### Age-and gender-specific normal post void residual urine volume in healthy adolescents [^6414d245]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Elevated post void residual (PVR) is a significant risk factor for urinary tract infections (UTI). It is also a significant predictor of treatment outcomes in cases of vesicoureteral reflux, pediatric enuresis, and non-neurogenic LUT dysfunction. However, the absence of age-specific nomograms for adolescents may limit PVR's use in clinical practice.

Objective

To establish age- and gender-specific normal PVR urine volume in adolescents.

Material and Methods

Healthy adolescents aged 12–18 years were recruited to undergo two uroflowmetry and PVR studies whenever they felt the urge to urinate. Adolescents with neurological disorders, known LUT dysfunction or UTI were excluded.

Results

A total of 1050 adolescents were invited, but only 651 consented. Fourteen participants were excluded due to low bladder volume (BV < 100 ml) in both assessments (n = 12), BV < 100 mL in one assessment (n = 1), or failure to provide relevant history (n = 1). From the 1084 uroflowmetry and PVR obtained from 637 adolescents, 190 results were further excluded due to artefacts (n = 152), BV < 100 mL (n = 27), PVR > 100 mL (n = 5) and missing information (n = 6). Ultimately, 894 uroflowmetry and PVR from 605 adolescents (mean age 14.6 ± 1.5 years) were analyzed. PVRs were higher in adolescents aged 15–18 years than in those aged 12–14 years (P < 0.001). Moreover, they were higher in females than in males (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that PVR was positively influenced by age (P = 0.001) and BV (P < 0.001). The age- and gender-specific percentiles of PVR in mL and percentage of BV were calculated. We recommend a repeat PVR and close monitoring if PVR is above the 90th percentile, i.e. PVR > 20 mL (7% BV) for males of both the age groups, and PVR > 25 mL (9% BV) and PVR > 35 mL (> 10% BV) for females aged 12–14 and 15–18 years, respectively. Further investigation may be warranted if the repeat PVR is above the 95th percentile, i.e. PVR > 30 mL (8% BV) and > 30 mL (11% BV) for males aged 12–14 and 15–18 years, respectively, and PVR > 35 mL (11% BV) and > 45 mL (13% BV) for females aged 12–14 and 15–18 years, respectively.

Conclusion

PVR increases with age and varies by gender; thus, age-and gender-specific reference values should be used. Further data from other countries is required to determine whether the study's recommendations can be applied globally.

### Post-void residual urine as a predictor of urinary tract infection – is there a cutoff value in asymptomatic men? [^d98eddf1]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Post-void residual urine can lead to various complications, including urinary tract infection. Recently investigators calculated that a cutoff value of 180 mL has considerably high sensitivity and specificity for significant bacteriuria in asymptomatic men. We determined the association between post-void residual urine volume and urinary tract infection, and validated the suggested 180 mL cutoff in asymptomatic men.

Materials and Methods

In a prospective study we analyzed certain criteria in 225 asymptomatic male patients, including prostate specific antigen, prostate volume, International Prostate Symptom Score, peak urine flow rate, urine culture results and post-void residual urine volume using transabdominal ultrasound. Using ROC analysis a cutoff predicting bacteriuria was calculated. Different cutoff values were validated.

Results

Of the study group 60% were able to completely empty the bladder and had a post-void residual urine volume of 10 mL or less. However, in 31% of the study group urine culture was positive. Patients presenting with urinary tract infection had significantly higher mean post-void residual urine volume than patients without urinary tract infection (113 vs 41 ml, p < 0.001). In 29 men (13%) post-void residual volume was 180 mL or greater. Confirming urinary tract infection, this cutoff showed only 28% sensitivity and 94% specificity (AUC 0.606, p = 0.01).

Conclusions

No cutoff value could be determined to predict positive urine culture with sufficient sensitivity and specificity. Based on the results of the current study it seems premature to recommend a cutoff value leading to therapeutic consequences.

### Can we define the optimal postvoid residual volume at which intermittent catheterization should be recommended, and are there other measures that could guide an intermittent catheterization protocol: ICI-RS 2023 [^7ec73c33]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

The postvoid residual (PVR) volume of urine in the bladder is widely used in clinical practice as a guide to initiate treatment, including clean-intermittent self-catheterization (CISC). It is often believed that an elevated PVR causes complications such as recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI) and renal failure. However, evidence for this is limited and identifying alternative measures to guide treatment decisions may optimize patient care. At the International Consultation on Incontinence Research Society (ICI-RS) meeting in 2023 a Think Tank addressed the question of whether we can define the optimal PVR at which CISC should be recommended, and whether there are other measures that could guide a CISC protocol.

Methods

The Think Tank conducted a literature review and expert consensus meeting focusing on current limitations in defining and measuring PVR, and highlighting other measures that may optimize selection for, and persistence with, CISC.

Results

There is no consensus on the threshold value of PVR that is considered "elevated" or "significant". There is a lack of standardization on terminology, and the normal range of PVR in different populations of different ages remains to be well-studied. The measurement of PVR is influenced by several factors, including intraindividual variation, timing and method of measurement. Furthermore, the evidence linking an elevated PVR with complications such as UTI and renal failure is mixed. Other measures, such as bladder voiding efficiency or urodynamic parameters, may be better at predicting such complications, and therefore may be more relevant at guiding a CISC protocol.

Conclusions

There is a lack of high quality evidence to support PVR as a predictor for complications of UTI or renal failure. Threshold values for normal PVR in different populations are unknow, and so threshold values for "elevated" or "significant" PVR cannot be determined. Other factors, such as urodynamic findings, may be better at predicting complications and therefore guiding management decisions, and this remains to be studied. Areas for further research are proposed.

### Repeatability of post-void residual urine ≥ 100 mL in urogynaecologic patients [^547bc919]. International Urogynecology Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Post-void residual urine (PVR) is a key variable in the assessment of the emptying function of the lower urinary tract and is often used as an outcome measure after treatment. Increased PVR can lead to further investigation and treatment, or cancellation of planned incontinence surgery. In a prospective study, we aimed to assess the repeatability of the finding of PVR ≥ 100 mL in urogynaecologic patients.

Methods

Of 396 women with urogynaecologic complaints visiting our outpatient clinic, 297 had PVR measured after a micturition in full privacy preceded by normal desire to void. Women with PVR ≥ 100 mL were offered a second and eventually a third PVR measurement after a subsequent micturition. A Verathon Bladder Scanner BV 9400 was used to measure PVR immediately after micturition.

Results

The prevalence of PVR ≥ 100 was 14%, which declined to 1.3% on repeated measurements. Voided volumes did not vary between voids.

Conclusions

One PVR measurement ≥ 100 mL is unreliable and needs repetition to confirm consistency.

Postvoid residual urine volume — screening and thresholds: According to the Value of Urodynamic Evaluation trial, a postvoid residual volume of less than 150 mL measured by bladder ultrasonography or catheter indicates adequate bladder emptying in women undergoing stress urinary incontinence surgery, and because isolated instances of elevated residual urine volume may not be significant, the test should be repeated when a single abnormally high value is obtained. An elevated postvoid residual urine volume in the absence of pelvic organ prolapse is uncommon and should trigger an evaluation.

### Normal postvoid residual urine in healthy adults [^6748101c]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To establish a normal reference value of postvoid residual (PVR) urine volume in "healthy" adults.

Methods

Adults were recruited to undergo uroflowmetry and PVR. Those with neurological disorders, malignancy, diabetes, known lower urinary tract dysfunction, and urinary tract infection within the previous 3 months, were excluded from the study. Constipation was defined as Rome IV ≥ 2.

Results

Of the 883 adults enrolled in this study, 194 (22.3%) did not complete the questionnaires or perform the uroflowmetry, 103 (11.7%) met ≥ 1 exclusion criteria and thus were excluded. In addition, 30 and 38 uroflowmetry were excluded due to artifacts and low bladder volume (BV) (< 100mL), respectively. Finally, 515 uroflowmetry and PVR data from adults aged 36–89 (mean: 59.0 ± 9.5) were examined. There was a significant nonlinear relationship between BV and PVR (p < 0.05), with PVR significantly increased when BV was around 528mL. Women had lower PVR than men (p < 0.05). PVR also increased as the International Prostatic Symptom Score (IPSS) increased. PVR was unaffected by age and functional constipation. A multivariate analysis revealed that BV (p < 0.05) and IPSS (p < 0.05) had significant influence on PVR, but age, gender, and Rome IV score did not. The 90th and 95th percentiles of PVR for men were 73.2mL (25% of BV) and 102.6mL (30% of BV), respectively, while for women they were 60.5mL (21% of BV) and 93.8mL (27% of BV), respectively.

Conclusion

Women had lower PVR than men. The 90th percentile or 95th percentile of normal adults' PVR may serve as the upper limit of normal PVR, and readings above this level may necessitate additional evaluation and treatment. Further studies are required to substantiate these recommendations.

### Urodynamic studies in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^a50cd7c5]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Adult urodynamics — post-void residual (PVR) assessment in LUTS states that the potential benefits of measuring PVR include identifying significant urinary retention and decreasing potential morbidity, and while no conclusive evidence exists to support or refute its use to predict treatment outcomes, it may be used on the basis of expert opinion as a safety measure to evaluate for significant urinary retention both initially and during subsequent monitoring; risks/harms of catheterization are low and include UTI or urethral trauma and can be eliminated with ultrasound determination of PVR, but because measurement of PVR may be associated with false positives and negatives and thus could lead to inappropriate treatment, it is recommended that decisions not be based on a single measurement.

### Normative noninvasive bladder function measurements in healthy women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^28560fea]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

To conduct an evidence synthesis of normative reference values for bladder function parameters in women.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting bladder function parameters obtained from noninvasive tests in healthy women. Seven databases were searched for relevant studies from inception through December 2018, with manual searching of reference lists. We included English language articles that provided quantitative data on urination frequency, voided and postvoid residual volumes, and uroflowmetry results in women without lower urinary tract symptoms. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were undertaken by at least two independent reviewers. Random-effects meta-analytic models were used to derive study-level pooled mean estimates and 95% confidence intervals.

Results

A total of 24 studies (N = 3090 women, age range, 18–91 years) met eligibility criteria. Pooled mean estimates of bladder function parameters were: 6.6 daytime voids (95% confidence interval (95% CI), 6.2, 7.0), 0.4 nighttime voids (95% CI, 0.0, 0.8), 1577mL for 24-hour voided volume (95% CI 1428,1725); 12mL for postvoid residual volume (95% CI, 4, 20); and 28mL/sec for maximum flow rate (95% CI, 27,30). Between-study heterogeneity was high for all outcomes (I 2 = 61.1–99.6%), but insufficient data were available to explore reasons for this high heterogeneity (eg, differences by age).

Conclusion

Although summary mean estimates of bladder function parameters were calculated, the wide heterogeneity across studies precludes generalization of these estimates to all healthy women. Further research is needed to determine normative reference values within specific groups, such as those defined by age.

### Variability, related factors and normal reference value of post-void residual urine in healthy kindergarteners [^873d239d]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

We report intra-individual variability, related factors and the normal reference value of post-void residual urine in children.

Materials and Methods

Healthy kindergarteners were enrolled for the evaluation of post-void residual urine, which was assessed by ultrasound within 5 minutes after voiding when voided volume was greater than 50 ml. Bladder over distention was arbitrarily defined as a bladder capacity (voided volume plus post-void residual urine) of 115% or greater of expected bladder capacity. The Pearson correlation method was used to evaluate the correlation between post-void residual urine and related factors.

Results

More than 1 post-void residual urine value was recorded in 219 children with a mean ± SD age of 4.9 ± 0.9 years. Mean post-void residual urine was 12.2 ± 20.3 mL (median 5.5). The correlation for consecutive post-void residual urine was low in all children and negligible in the 129 without bladder over distention (r = 0.34 and 0.13, respectively). Repeat post-void residual urine greater than 20 mL and greater than 10% bladder capacity was observed in 2.3% and 7.8% of children, respectively, without bladder over distention. Post-void residual urine increased as bladder capacity increased (r = 0.38, p < 0.01). Excluding those with bladder over distention, post-void residual urine decreased as the age of the child increased. Children who drank more fluids before voiding had a higher rate of bladder over distention for each micturition than those who drank regularly (13.8% vs 4.9%, p = 0.04).

Conclusions

Because of the significant intra-individual variability of post-void residual urine, a single post-void residual urine test is not reliable for assessing pediatric voiding function. Two post-void residual urine tests are recommended. Post-void residual urine is affected by bladder over distention, age of the child and possibly extra hydration before assessment. Abnormal post-void residual urine could be defined as post-void residual urine greater than 20 ml, rather than as greater than 10% bladder capacity, on repeat micturitions without bladder over distention.

### Normal lower urinary tract assessment in women: I. uroflowmetry and post-void residual, pad tests, and bladder diaries [^b85c704b]. International Urogynecology Journal (2012). Low credibility.

This study aims to provide reference ranges of normal variability in urodynamic parameters through literature review of normal urodynamic values in the literature. Data were obtained through MEDLINE from articles published between January 1956 and February 2011, International Continence Society meeting abstracts and standardization reports. Search terms included urodynamics, bladder diary, uroflowmetry, frequency volume charts, pad tests, normal control, and normal volunteer. Normal values varied widely in the literature. However, with the help of clinical data, it was possible to define "normality" ranges for most of the different parameters. Urodynamic evaluation of lower urinary tract (LUT) function is not a physiological test. However, it is still the best available tool to assess LUT function. Even if normality in urodynamics can be defined, tests must always be interpreted against patient characteristics, complaints, and symptoms.

### Post-void residual urine under 150 mL does not exclude voiding dysfunction in women [^38c0c242]. International Urogynecology Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

It has been claimed that post-void residual urine (PVR) below 150 mL rules out voiding dysfunction in women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and provides license to perform sling surgery. The cut-off of 150 mL seems arbitrary, not evidence-based, and so we sought to investigate the ability of PVR < 150 mL to exclude voiding dysfunction.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the charts of all patients who underwent invasive urodynamics from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2013. Voiding dysfunction was diagnosed if both the invasive urodynamic and the free flow showed abnormal results. We registered the PVR in patients with voiding dysfunction and divided them into groups with PVR < 150 mL and PVR ≥ 150 ml. Patients were then analyzed for bladder outlet obstruction and detrusor underactivity.

Results

Of the 205 patients undergoing invasive urodynamics in 2013, a total of 20 had voiding dysfunction, 2 with PVR ≥ 150 ml. Eighteen patients had PVR < 150 mL (range 0–50 ml); 9 had bladder outlet obstruction while 7 had detrusor underactivity. Two patients were uncategorized. Out of the 20 patients, 7 had no symptoms or complaints indicating voiding dysfunction.

Conclusions

Patients with voiding dysfunction often have normal PVR and so PVR < 150 mL cannot exclude voiding dysfunction. All patients should be evaluated using free flow measurements along with PVR to obtain a reliable, objective measurement of their voiding pattern, before anti-incontinence surgery.

### Postpartum urinary retention: what are the sequelae? A long-term study and review of the literature [^53eafec4]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study shows that although being transient, in most cases persistent voiding disorders after postpartum urinary retention are not negligible, and if increased PVR does not resolve by day 7 postpartum it is likely to persist. Our findings show that 8.2%, 6.7%, and 4.9% of the women have long-term voiding difficulties after 1, 2, and 3 years respectively, requiring intermittent clean self-catheterization after postpartum urinary retention (Fig. 1, Table 1). In the majority of cases normal voiding was re-established after 7 days, and patients with long-term voiding disorder had noticeably high initial residual volumes of > 2,000 mL that reportedly persisted over several hours and were managed poorly with in-and-out catheters instead of adequate continuous drainage. Yet, for high initial residual volumes being a risk factor we were not able to demonstrate statistical significance, possibly because of the lack of variance in our data and the rare event of persistent long-term voiding problems.

Post-void residual volume is not uniformly defined and there is no consensus on what constitutes a significant elevation or at which volume PVR contributes to urinary problems. The current cut-off values for covert PUR are rather arbitrary until data on the clinical consequences of abnormal PVR are available. The arbitrary cut-off of 150 mL in nonpregnant women does not exclude voiding dysfunction. The Agency Health Care Research and Quality guidelines define a PVR of less than 50 mL as being indicative of adequate emptying and a PVR of more than 200 mL as inadequate emptying, but the range between 50 and 200 mL remains ambiguous. Stricter definitions use a PVR cut-off of 100 mL or one third of total volume, in contrast to 150–200 mL or one half of total volume. In men, covert urinary retention definitions range from 300 to 1,000 ml, reflecting the lack of clear cut-offs. A change of the current definition of covert PUR was proposed to be ≥ 500 mL after the first postpartum void because above this cut-off some women do need more time to normalize emptying of the bladder.

### Longitudinal changes in post-void residual and voided volume among community dwelling men [^dd473baa]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

We describe the natural history of post-void residual (PVR) and voided volume (VV) in men.

Materials and Methods

A random sample of community dwelling men (529 men 40 to 79 years old) were followed with a sonographic PVR and VV every 2 years for up to 12 years (median 5 examinations). Men were censored at the time of treatment for a prostate condition.

Results

The median annual change (slope) for PVR was 2.2% (p = 0.03) and for VV was -2.1% (p < 0.0001). There was considerable variability in PVR slopes (25th percentile -11%, 75th percentile 18%). A rapid increase in PVR slope (greater than 80th percentile) was more likely in men with a baseline American Urological Association Symptom Index greater than 7 (age adjusted odds ratio [OR]1.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.5). There was less variability in VV slopes (25th percentile -8.0%, 75th percentile 3.1%). A rapid decrease in VV slope (less than 20th percentile) was more likely in men with baseline age 70 to 79 years than 40 to 49 years (OR 3.9, 95% CI 2.1 to 7.2) and in men with a baseline PVR greater than 50 mL (age adjusted OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.6).

Conclusions

Although it is highly variable, there is progressive bladder dysfunction in community dwelling men as they age. In addition, signs and symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia were modest predictors of the development of bladder dysfunction. A baseline increased PVR predicted a rapid decrease in VV, consistent with a bladder outlet obstruction contributing to the development of detrusor overactivity and decreased bladder compliance.

### Large voided volume suggestive of abnormal uroflow pattern and elevated post-void residual urine [^4140a4ba]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2011). Low credibility.

Aim

To report the cut-off value for large voided volume (LVV) suggestive of abnormal uroflow pattern or elevated post-void residual urine (PVR) in healthy kindergarteners.

Methods

From 2003 through 2008, we enrolled 417 healthy kindergarten children for evaluation of uroflowmetry tests and PVR. The uroflowmetry curves were interpreted if voided volumes (VV) were > 50 ml, and categorized as bell-shaped, staccato, plateau, and interrupted. Only bell-shaped curves were categorized as normal. After 2006, PVR was assessed within 5 min after each voiding with a VV > 50 ml. A PVR > 20 mL is regarded as elevated. Receiver operative characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the cut-off value of VV/expected bladder capacity (EBC) with regard to nonbell-shaped uroflowmetry curves, and/or elevated PVR.

Results

Of 385 children (mean age: 4.85 ± 0.96 years), 699 uroflowmetry, and 556 PVR data were eligible for analysis. There were 502 (71.8%) bell-shaped, 76 (10.9%) plateau, 102 (14.6%) staccato, and 19 (2.7%) interrupted curves. Mean and median PVR were 12.4 ± 21.2 and 5.5 ml, respectively. Of 556 PVRs, 96 (17.3%) were > 20 ml. Based on the ROC curve for the nonbell-shaped curves and/or elevated PVR, VV > 100% EBC was best defined as LVV. There were statistically more elevated PVR, and more nonbell-shaped curves in the voidings with than without LVV. There is a trend that peak flow rate decreased when VV was > 150% EBC.

Conclusions

VV of more than 100% EBC can be defined as LVV which was associated with higher rates of abnormal uroflow pattern and/or elevated PVR.

### Measurement of post-void residual bladder volumes in hospitalized older adults [^7ab93486]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

It is commonly recommended to catheterize or closely follow up patients with post-void residual volumes of 150 mL or more, but the frequency of such findings in geriatric hospitalized patients and the need for intervention are unclear.

Methods

Post-void residual volumes were measured by ultrasound examination within 14 hours of admission in 464 patients aged 70 years or more who were hospitalized in a regional hospital general internal medicine department. Outcome variables included the need for an indwelling catheter and complications of urinary retention during the hospitalization.

Results

Post-void residual volumes of ≥ 150 mL were common (23.9%; 111/464) and had the following distribution: 150 to 299 mL, 13.1% (61/464); 300 to 499 mL, 6.4% (30/464); and 500 mL or more, 6% (28/464). The rate of indwelling catheters was 3.2% (15/464). Results of post-void residual volumes did not predict the need for indwelling catheters in those without other criteria, although those with indications for indwelling catheters had a significantly higher frequency of post-void residual volumes ≥ 500 mL (P < .001) compared with those without such indications.

Conclusions

We conclude that urinary retention in hospitalized geriatric patients is common, but measurements of post-void residual volumes did not have definite clinical utility. However, the study had limited power to determine the benefits or potential harms of urinary catheterization for elevated post-void residual volumes.

### Urodynamic studies in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^98721b75]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Adult urodynamics — post-void residual (PVR) testing in lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS): "Clinicians may perform PVR in patients with LUTS as a safety measure to rule out significant urinary retention both initially and during follow up. (Clinical Principle)". PVR elevation may reflect detrusor underactivity, bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), or both, making it "a non-specific indication of poor bladder emptying". An elevated PVR alone "does not necessarily predict the presence of obstruction", and "PVR alone cannot be used to differentiate between obstructed and non-obstructed patients", with "no agreed upon standard definition of exactly what constitutes an elevated PVR". Although "in some patients an elevated PVR may be harmful", based on experience in pediatrics, the elderly, diabetics and neurogenic patients, "it is not clear which patients" with LUTS absent these conditions are predisposed to harm, and "there are no relevant studies that have identified the usefulness of PVR for guiding clinical management".

### Post-operative residual voiding volume following bulking… [^9de7ff36]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Post-operative Residual Voiding Volume Following Bulking and Vaginal Prolapse Surgery and Impact on In-hospital Stay ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Post operative urinary retention is a commonly observed complication following women undergoing urogynecology surgery. The trial includes patients undergoing bulking and vaginal prolapse surgery, who are randomized in two postoperative groups prior to surgery in order to test two void regimes. One group includes a strict voiding regime, where patients are discharged when voiding volume is minimum 150 mL and residual volume is maximum 200 ml. Comparatively, the minimalistic voiding group discharge patients after one spontaneous voiding, independent of voiding volume and residual volume. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate time to discharge in two different voiding trials techniques after anterior, posterior or vaginal vault prolapse surgery as well as bulking surgery.

Secondly, to register the development of postoperative urinary tract infection, urine retention, gynecological pain and patients' calls to the gynecological ward after discharge. Project description Aim The primary aim of this study is to evaluate time to discharge in two different voiding trials techniques after anterior, posterior or vaginal vault prolapse surgery as well as bulking surgery. Secondly, to evaluate the frequency of postoperative urinary tract infection, urine retention and pain as well as patients' calls to the gynecological ward after discharge. To determine the development of postoperative urinary tract infection, urine retention and gynecological pain, the patients will have to answer a questionnaire when included in the study and two postoperative questionnaires at two weeks and three months after surgery. These questionnaires will be sent to e-box by using Open Redcap.

To assess the patients' need for guidance after surgery, the patients' calls to the gynecological ward after discharge will be registered. Inclusion criteria
- Patients who undergo anterior, posterior or vaginal vault prolapse surgery or bulking surgery at the departments of obstetric and gynecology, OUH.
- Patients who have the catheter removed at the operating room.
- Patients > 18 years old. Exclusion criteria. Participation Criteria For general information about clinical research, read Learn About Studies. Inclusion Criteria:

### Establishing a mean postvoid residual volume in asymptomatic perimenopausal and postmenopausal women [^e8360e5a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate mean postvoid residual (PVR) volumes among perimenopausal and postmenopausal women without significant lower urinary tract or pelvic organ prolapse symptoms.

Methods

Patients presenting for well-women encounters were offered study participation. Women with a history of urinary incontinence greater than twice per week, urinary retention, symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse, or neurologic disorders were excluded. Pelvic relaxation, if present, was characterized according to the pelvic organ prolapse quantification system. Within 10 minutes of spontaneously voiding, PVR volume was assessed with bladder ultrasonography.

Results

A total of 96 patients were enrolled; mean age was 60 ± 11 years. The majority (80%) were postmenopausal; 30% had a previous hysterectomy. Most women (92%) had some degree of prolapse; the median stage was one, most commonly involving the anterior compartment (70%). The median PVR volume was 19 mL (range 0–145 mL); the mean PVR volume was 24 ± 29 mL. Only 15% of patients had a PVR volume greater than 50 mL, and 95% had a PVR volume 100 mL or less. Only age 65 years or older was associated with a higher mean PVR volume; hormone therapy, vaginal atrophy, parity, and stage of asymptomatic prolapse did not affect PVR volumes.

Conclusion

Most asymptomatic perimenopausal and postmenopausal women had a PVR volume less than 50 mL, which was unaffected by multiple factors that were thought to potentially affect bladder function. Establishing "normal" volumes in this population may aid in developing recommendations regarding appropriate bladder function and retention criteria for women who are symptomatic or those who have had pelvic floor surgery.

The idea of PUR being transient and self-limiting has to be questioned. This belief might explain why postpartum urinary retention management guidelines are not yet established but urgently needed in clinical practice. Data on PUR management are insufficient, particularly because treatment options differ widely between studies. Protocols of timed voiding and routine measurement of PVR have been shown to reduce PUR. Even if routine screening is not yet recommended, adequate symptom assessment by the health care provider after delivery is of utmost importance. Last but not least, knowledge of PUR is considered to be low amongst residents in obstetrics and gynecology and management guidelines increase their comfort in dealing with patients in the postpartum period.

### Natural history of post-void residual urine volume over 5 years in community-dwelling older men: the concord health and ageing in men project [^449c8e47]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

To describe the natural history of post-void residual urine volume (PVR) in community-dwelling older men.

Methods

The Concord Health and Ageing in Men Project involves a representative sample of community-dwelling men aged 70 and older in a defined geographic area of Sydney, Australia. PVR were measured at baseline and 2-year and 5-year follow-up. The measurements were considered valid when the voided volumes were 150mL and over. Three-hundred twenty-nine men without conditions that are likely to alter PVR (neurological disorders, prostate cancer, and a history of urological treatment) were included in the analyses.

Results

Baseline PVR were 0-49mL in 183 men, 50-99mL in 59 men, 100-199mL in 72 men, 200-399mL in 11 men, and 400mL and over in 4 men. Thirteen out of 314 (4%) men with a baseline PVR of 0-199mL and 2 out of 11 (18%) men with a baseline PVR of 200-399mL had surgery for benign prostate enlargement (BPE) or indwelling catheterization over 5 years compared to three out of four men (75%) with a PVR of 400mL and over. In all 101 men with a baseline PVR of less than 400mL who did not receive urological treatment during follow-up and had valid PVR data for both 2-year and 5-year follow-up, PVR did not exceed 400mL at either follow-up time point.

Conclusion

Conservative management may be appropriate for most older men with incidentally found elevated PVR of up to 400mL.

### Is a pelvic examination contributory in the initial evaluation of women with recurrent urinary tract infections? [^fd7d0aaa]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) affect up to 44% of women; evidenced-based guidelines regarding the contributory role of a pelvic examination in these women are lacking. We hypothesize that routine pelvic examination has a limited role in evaluation and management of women with rUTI when appropriate symptoms-based screening is performed and normal post-void residual volume (PVR) is confirmed.

Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review of women ages 18–85 years presenting to Wake Forest Pelvic Health Center with two culture-proven UTIs in 6 months or three UTIs in 12 months with a documented pelvic examination. Pregnant women were excluded. Data extraction included demographics, medical history, screening assessment of vaginal bulge symptoms, urine culture results, imaging, physical/pelvic examination findings, PVR, treatment recommendations and outcomes within 1 year of initial assessment. Descriptive statistics and Fisher's exact test were performed.

Results

Of 160 charts screened, 91 met the inclusion criteria. Nineteen (21%) had symptoms of vaginal bulge, and 14 (17%) had PVR > 100 ml. Pelvic examination provided new/contributory information in eight (8.8%) of women. The negative predictive value of absence of bulge symptoms and normal PVR was 89%. Within 1 year, 41 (46%) reported symptom resolution with rUTI treatment with no difference between those with or without a contributory pelvic examination (p value = 0.64).

Conclusions

In women with rUTI who report absence of vaginal bulge symptoms and have a PVR < 100 ml, a pelvic examination provides contributory information in < 10% of women and did not change treatment outcomes.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction: diagnosis and evaluation [^0a1af52e]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) — post-void residual (PVR) definition, measurement, and follow-up — has no universally agreed definition, and in NLUTD there is no definite upper limit defining normal or a lower limit defining abnormal; a volume of greater than 300 cc has been suggested as a definition for non-neurogenic chronic urinary retention. An elevated PVR that could be associated with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), urinary tract infection (UTI), or upper tract deterioration is generally considered abnormal and should prompt further evaluation with multichannel UDS and treatment as indicated. PVR can be measured by transabdominal bladder scanner, real-time ultrasound (US), or urethral catheterization; catheterization is the most accurate but most invasive, and the accuracy of transabdominal US may be compromised by factors such as obesity, prior lower abdominal or pelvic surgery, ascites or pelvic cysts, and vaginal prolapse. A single elevated PVR may not reflect emptying ability and should be confirmed with a second measurement at another visit; a PVR should be performed at the time of diagnosis and may be checked periodically thereafter, recognizing that some NLUTD patients cannot empty on command and that a low PVR does not absolutely exclude significant NLUTD risk.

PVR should be performed immediately after voiding with a non-invasive ultrasound bladder scanner, and straight catheterization is acceptable if a bladder scanner is unavailable. It is important to note that there is no accepted volume threshold that defines elevated PVR, although most RCTs evaluating medication for OAB used a PVR of 150–200 mL as an exclusion criterion. The use of antimuscarinic medications in patients with an elevated PVR may exacerbate incomplete emptying. If a patient has a low functional bladder capacity (< 300 mL), the clinician can use bladder voiding efficiency (voided volume/bladder capacity) to evaluate for incomplete emptying.

### Women with pure stress urinary incontinence symptoms assessed by the initial standard evaluation including measurement of post-void residual volume and a stress test: are urodynamic studies still needed? [^83d00953]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

The significance of preoperative urodynamic studies in women with a "clinically-defined pure stress urinary incontinence (SUI) symptom" has been debated in recent years. We evaluated changes of reliability of pure SUI symptoms for prediction of pure urodynamic SUI (USUI) when the assessment of post-void residual (PVR) volume and a stress test, designated as the initial standard evaluation in the NICE and AUA guidelines, were added to the process for the diagnosis of pure SUI symptoms.

Methods

We reviewed records of 1,019 women aged 30–80 who underwent urodynamic study for incontinence. Criteria for pure SUI symptoms were defined as absence of overactive bladder symptoms and voiding difficulties based on a frequency-volume chart and AUA Symptom Index. We then added assessment of PVR volume and a stress test to the process for clinical diagnosis.

Results

Of subjects, 211 (20.7%) could be classified as having a pure SUI symptom. Of these, only 167 (79.1%) had pure USUI and 33 (15.7%) had detrusor overactivity. Eight (3.8%) had detrusor underactivity/bladder outlet obstruction. Sensitivity and specificity of pure SUI symptoms for pure USUI were 28.6% and 89.9%. Addition of assessment of PVR volume and a stress test resulted in an increase of predictive accuracy of only 3.6%.

Conclusions

As one-fifth of women with pure SUI symptoms exhibit the pathophysiologies that could affect the surgical outcomes despite additional use of PVR assessment and a stress test in the clinical diagnostic process, urodynamic evaluation is considered necessary before anti-incontinence surgery in this population.

### Postpartum urinary retention: what are the sequelae? A long-term study and review of the literature [^76de7017]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Risk factors for PUR include: a prolonged second stage of labor (duration of labor [first and second stage] > 700 min predicts PUR), vacuum-assisted, and instrumental delivery, (high grade) perineal lacerations, and episiotomy, degree of perineal pain, fetal birth weight, use of systemic narcotics, nulliparity, cesarean section (possibly after failure to progress in labor), epidural analgesia (possibly by modifying other obstetrical parameters such as duration of labor), intermittent catheterization during labor, an increasing number of catheterizations, and an absence of spontaneous voiding before leaving the delivery room. One study identified urination just before delivery as a preventive factor for PUR.

Commonly, PUR is thought to be transient, possibly because PVR is not routinely measured and therefore PUR is underdiagnosed, but data to sustain the transient nature of PUR are scarce.

In particular, there is a paucity of data on long-term outcome after postpartum urinary retention and time period to normalization of post-void residual urine volume. The aim of this study was to assess long-term persistence of elevated post-void residual urine volume after PUR. We hypothesize that postpartum urinary retention does not necessarily resolve spontaneously in all women.

### Clinical significance of postvoid residual volume in older ambulatory women [^1db333a6]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine the prevalence, natural history, and clinical significance of high postvoid residual (PVR) volume in ambulatory older women.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

Group health plan in Washington state.

Participants

Nine hundred eighty-seven ambulatory women aged 55 to 75.

Measurements

PVR was measured using bladder ultrasonography at baseline, 1 year, and 2 years. Participants completed questionnaires about urinary symptoms and provided urine samples for microbiological evaluation.

Results

Of the 987 participants, 79% had a PVR less than 50 mL, 10% of 50 to 99 mL, 6% of 100 to 199 mL, and 5% of 200 mL or greater at baseline. Of women with a PVR less than 50 mL, 66% reported at least one urinary symptom at baseline. Of women with a PVR of 200 mL or greater, 27% reported no significant symptoms at baseline. In adjusted analyses using data from all study visits, women with a PVR of 100 mL or greater were more likely to report urinating more than eight times during the day (odds ratio (OR) = 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.07–1.87), and women with a PVR of 200 mL or greater were more likely to report weekly urgency incontinence (OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.03–2.18) than those with a PVR less than 50 mL. High PVR was not associated with greater risk of stress incontinence, nocturnal frequency, or urinary tract infection in adjusted analyses. Forty-six percent of those with a PVR of 200 mL or greater and 63% of those with a PVR of 100 to 199 mL at baseline had a PVR less than 50 mL at 2 years.

Conclusion

More than 10% of ambulatory older women may have a PVR of 100 mL or greater, which is associated with greater risk of some urinary symptoms, but many with high PVR are asymptomatic, and high PVR frequently resolves within 2 years. Symptom-guided management of urinary symptoms may be more appropriate than PVR-guided management in this population.

### Immediate postvoid residual volumes in women with symptoms of pelvic floor dysfunction [^59824954]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the prevalence and clinical and urodynamic associations of postvoid residual volumes (PVRs), measured immediately after micturition, in women with symptoms of pelvic floor dysfunction.

Methods

The patients were 1,140 women presenting consecutively for their initial urogynecological assessment, including urodynamics. They were studied prospectively. Measurement of PVRs was by transvaginal ultrasonography within 60 seconds of micturition. After the estimation of prevalence of the different levels of PVR, an appropriate upper limit of normal PVR was estimated and associations then were sought for PVRs with a wide range of clinical and urodynamic parameters.

Results

The overall prevalence of PVRs was 76% at 0–10 mL, 5% at 11–30 mL, 5% at 31–50 mL, 8% at 51–100 mL, and 6% at more than 100 mL. Thus, using transvaginal ultrasonography, 81% of immediate PVRs were 30 mL or less. Higher than 30 mL, a significantly increased prevalence of women presenting with recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) was noted (P < .001). The level of 30 mL was deemed to be an appropriate upper limit of normal PVR. The prevalence of PVRs higher than 30 mL increased significantly with age (P < .001) and higher grades of prolapse (P < .001). There was a significant inverse relation of PVRs higher than 30 mL to the symptom of stress incontinence (P = 0.018) and the diagnosis of urodynamic stress incontinence (P < .001).

Conclusion

Eighty-one percent of immediate PVRs (95% confidence interval 79–84%) in symptomatic women are 30 mL or less. Postvoid residual volumes higher than this level are significantly associated with increasing age, higher grades of prolapse, and an increased prevalence of recurrent UTIs.

### Voiding dysfunction in older women with overactive bladder symptoms: a comparison of urodynamic parameters between women with normal and elevated post-void residual urine [^e9eba88b]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

To compare urodynamic parameters in two groups of older women who have overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms: those with normal and those with elevated post-void residual (PVR).

Methods

Secondary data analyses were conducted on medical record data from 203 women who were 65 years or older and who completed urodynamic testing. Of these, 151 (74%) medical records met the study criteria. A PVR of 100ml or greater during the pressure-flow study was considered elevated for this study. Maximal flow rate (Qmax) and detrusor pressure at Qmax, bladder capacity, voiding volume, and voiding pattern were compared between these two groups.

Results

The mean Qmax and detrusor pressure at Qmax were 19.63ml/sec (SD = 8.74) and 16.15 cmH2 O (SD = 11.19) for the overall sample, respectively. The elevated PVR group (n = 54) had significantly higher detrusor pressure at Qmax and bladder capacity than the normal PVR group (n = 97) (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, respectively). An interrupted voiding pattern accounted for 47.4% of the normal PVR group and 77.4% of the elevated PVR group, respectively (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

Older women with an elevated PVR required on average a higher detrusor pressure at Qmax and greater bladder capacity than women with a normal PVR. Although an interrupted voiding pattern was more prevalent in the elevated PVR group, many women in the normal PVR group also had an interrupted voiding pattern. These findings indicate that many women may habitually strain to void as well as strain due to inadequate detrusor function.

### Postoperative urinary retention [^06272ce5]. Urogynecology (2023). High credibility.

AUGS clinical consensus — criteria to pass or fail a voiding trial (VT) — Criteria used in the literature to define a successful VT after surgery for POP or SUI has been extremely inconsistent with no observable differences between the various criteria and post-operative retention rates, and reported passing thresholds include voided volumes > 200 mL, > 2/3 the total bladder volume, and force of stream > 50%, while commonly cited postvoid residual (PVR) measurements for passing a VT include < 100 mL up to < 500 mL and < 1/3 the total bladder volume.

### Does post-void residual volume predict worsening urological symptoms in patients with multiple sclerosis? [^90b2907d]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Our goal was to examine how post-void residual urine volume relates to urinary symptoms in patients with multiple sclerosis.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients with multiple sclerosis who had lower urinary tract symptoms and presented to a tertiary neurourology clinic. Patients for whom post-void residual volume was recorded at the initial urological assessment were included in our analysis. Results of the AUA (American Urological Association) SI (Symptom Index) and the M-ISI (Michigan Incontinence Symptom Index) completed at this visit were analyzed to assess the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms and incontinence. A chart review was performed to obtain information on demographics and documented urinary tract infections.

Results

Between 2014 and 2017, 110 patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis underwent post-void residual volume measurement at our clinic. Average post-void residual volume was 123.4 cc (range 0 to 650 cc). The mean AUA symptom score was 19.1 with an average bother score of 4.1. Analysis of post-void residual volume as a continuous variable did not show an association between increasing post-void residual volume and an increasing AUA SI or bother score (p = 0.53 and 0.44, respectively). When evaluated by post-void residual volume tertile, no relationship was found between post-void residual volume, and the AUA SI and the M-ISI (p = 0.54 and 0.57, respectively). No correlation was also found between increasing post-void residual volume and a recent history of recurrent urinary tract infections (p = 0.27).

Conclusions

Post-void residual volume was not associated with worsening obstructive lower urinary tract symptoms as assessed by the AUA SI, worsening incontinence as measured by the M-ISI score or an increased risk of recurrent urinary tract infections in select patients with multiple sclerosis and lower urinary tract symptoms.

Investigations

Assessment of possible impact of obstetric trauma on voiding function

Labor, regional anesthesia and delivery and specifically obstetric pelvic floor trauma can have a negative impact on voiding function, screening for which involves a bladder postvoid residual volume measurement and ideally uroflowmetry. Voiding cystometry may clarify the cause of any voiding dysfunction.

However, invasive urodynamic investigations in the postpartum period are usually delayed and non-invasive assessment (post void residual measurement) is the common investigation of choice for first line assessment of voiding symptoms. (NEW).

Postpartum urodynamic investigations

Measurement of physiological parameters relevant to the function of the lower urinary tract.

These usually take place in a special clinical room and involve post void residual urine volume (PVR) measurement after a spontaneous micturition flow. Uroflowmetry, filling cystometry with (artificial) bladder filling with a specified liquid (ICS recommends physiological saline solution or X-ray contrast if video studies) at a specified rate and pressure-flow studies are unnecessary in the most, if not, in almost all cases during postpartum period and up 12 months after delivery.

### The distribution of post-void residual volumes in people seeking care in the symptoms of lower urinary tract dysfunction network observational cohort study with comparison to asymptomatic populations [^c4cba3b5]. Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe the distribution of post-void residual (PVR) volumes across patients with and without lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and examine relationships between self-reported voiding symptoms, storage symptoms, and PVR.

Methods

PVR and demographic data were obtained from the Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) observational cohort study. Self-reported symptoms were collected using the American Urological Association Symptom Index and the LUTS Tool. PVR values were obtained from 2 other cohorts: living kidney donors with unknown LUTS from the Renal and Lung Living Donors Evaluation Study (RELIVE), and continent women in the Establishing the Prevalence of Incontinence (EPI) study, a population-based study of racial differences in urinary incontinence prevalence.

Results

Across the 3 studies, median PVRs were similar: 26 mL in LURN (n = 880, range 0–932 mL), 20 mL in EPI (n = 166, range 0–400 mL), and 14 mL in RELIVE (n = 191, range 0–352 mL). In LURN, males had 3.6 times higher odds of having PVR > 200 mL (95% CI = 1.72–7.48). In RELIVE, median PVR was significantly higher for males (20 mL vs 0 mL, P = 0.004). Among women, only the intermittency severity rating was associated with a probability of an elevated PVR. Among men, incomplete emptying and burning severity rating were associated with a higher odds of elevated PVR, but urgency severity ratings were associated with lower odds of elevated PVR.

Conclusion

Care-seeking patients have PVRs similar to those in people with unknown history of LUTS (RELIVE) and without self-reported LUTS (EPI). Although PVR was correlated with voiding symptoms, the mean differences only explain ∼2% of the variance.

### Does this man with lower urinary tract symptoms have bladder outlet obstruction? the rational clinical examination: a systematic review [^d3a205fd]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Early, accurate diagnosis of bladder outlet obstruction in men with lower urinary tract symptoms may reduce the need for invasive testing (ie, catheter placement, urodynamics), and prompt early treatment to provide symptomatic relief and avoid complications.

Objectives

To systematically review the evidence on (1) the diagnostic accuracy of office-based tests for bladder outlet obstruction in men with lower urinary tract symptoms; and (2) the accuracy of the bladder scan as a measure of urine volume because management decisions rely on measuring postvoid bladder residual volumes.

Data Sources and Study Selection

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1950-March 2014), along with reference lists from retrieved articles were searched to identify studies of diagnostic test accuracy among males with lower urinary tract symptoms due to bladder outlet obstruction. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library (1950-March 2014) were searched to identify studies of urine volumes measured with a bladder scanner vs those measured with bladder catheterization. Prospective studies were selected if they compared 1 or more office-based, noninvasive diagnostic test with the reference test or were invasive urodynamic studies, and if urine volumes were measured with a bladder scanner and bladder catheterization.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

For the bladder outlet obstruction objective, 8628 unique citations were identified. Ten studies (1262 patients among 9 unique cohorts) met inclusion criteria. For the bladder scan objective, 2254 unique citations were identified. Twenty studies (n = 1397 patients) met inclusion criteria.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The first main outcome and measure was the diagnostic accuracy of individual symptoms and questionnaires compared with the reference standard (urodynamic studies) for the diagnosis of bladder outlet obstruction in males with lower urinary tract symptoms. The second was the correlation between urine volumes measured with a bladder scanner and those measured with bladder catheterization.

Results

Among males with lower urinary tract symptoms, the likelihood ratios (LRs) of individual symptoms and questionnaires for diagnosing bladder outlet obstruction from the highest quality studies had 95% CIs that included 1.0, suggesting they are not significantly associated with one another. An International Prostate Symptom Score cutoff of 20 or greater increased the likelihood of bladder outlet obstruction (positive LR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.0), whereas scores of less than 20 had an LR that included 1.0 in the 95% CI (negative LR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.67–1.00). We found no data on the accuracy of physical examination findings to predict bladder outlet obstruction. Urine volumes measured by a bladder scanner correlated highly with urine volumes measured by bladder catheterization (summary correlation coefficient, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.91–0.95).

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients with lower urinary tract symptoms, the symptoms alone are not enough to adequately diagnose bladder outlet obstruction. A bladder scan for urine volume should be performed to assess patients with suspected large postvoid residual volumes.

### SNMMI procedure standard / EANM practice guideline for diuretic renal scintigraphy in adults with suspected upper urinary tract obstruction 1.0 [^6830ba30]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

H. Residual urine volume — At the time of the study, residual urine volume can be measured from counts in pre- and postvoid regions of interest (ROIs) over the bladder plus measurement of the voided volume, using the formula: residual urine volume = (voided volume)(prevoid counts)/(prevoid counts – postvoid counts). Patients should walk around for several minutes before voiding to facilitate gravity-assisted drainage, which minimizes error from residual urine draining after voiding and before the postvoid image, and this measurement may also detect unsuspected urinary retention.

### American Urogynecologic Society best practice statement: evaluation and counseling of patients with pelvic organ prolapse [^7dd6c7df]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Pelvic organ prolapse — voiding evaluation recommends that for women with abnormal voiding symptoms and for those with prolapse beyond the hymen, bladder emptying be evaluated with a postvoid residual (PVR) measurement; in general, a PVR of less than one third of the total voided volume is considered adequate emptying, with suggested parameters of a PVR of less than 50 mL as normal and a PVR greater than 200 mL as abnormal. If PVR is elevated or other bothersome voiding symptoms are noted, urodynamic testing may provide additional information. Treatment of prolapse may be considered even in asymptomatic patients if they have persistent voiding symptoms. Because 30% of women with advanced prolapse (Aa, Ba, or C measurements of +1 or greater) have hydronephrosis, imaging of the upper urinary tracts may be helpful in select patients.

Neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) — At initial evaluation, patients with NLUTD who spontaneously void should undergo post-void residual measurement (Clinical Principle). PVR is defined as the volume of urine left in the bladder at the end of micturition, provides valuable information regarding bladder emptying, and when elevated suggests an abnormality of bladder emptying due to detrusor underactivity (DU), bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), or both; a chronically elevated PVR can result in LUTS, as well as complications such as UTIs, bladder stones, and upper urinary tract deterioration.

### Postpartum urinary retention: what are the sequelae? A long-term study and review of the literature [^fd3376b2]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

We performed a prospective cohort study in our tertiary referral urogynecology unit in the University Women's Hospital of Bern, Switzerland. In our Department 2,300 babies are delivered annually and we have 65 gynecological beds. The rate of vaginal operative delivery is 13% in our hospital. Patients who were referred to our unit for immediate PUR from our own maternity ward, as well as from outside hospitals, were asked to participate in this study. All patients were referred on the day of or after delivery because the PVR was greater than 500 cc or the patient was symptomatic or not able to void at all. Ethical consent from the local ethics committee was obtained (Kantonale Ethikkommission Bern, 16-04-2008) and patients were asked to sign consent forms. The primary outcome was the time to normalization of post-void residual urine, the secondary outcomes were influencing factors for persistent increased volumes.

At first visit, demographic data, obstetric data such as mode of delivery, birth weight, type of anesthetic, and obstetric complications were noted.

Post-void residual urine was measured using ultrasound (Aloka Systems, Japan) applying the curved array 3.5-MHz probe immediately after micturition with the formula width × length × depth × 0.6. Residual urine was defined as significant if more than 150 mL were measured. Immediately after the diagnosis of retention was made a permanent catheter was placed for 24 h, then removed, and patients were instructed to perform clean intermittent self-catheterization afterwards.

Self-catheterization was instructed by specialized incontinence nurses in an outpatient setting. Catheter choice and the patient's position during catheterization were performed according to patients' preference and manual abilities, and catheter intervals were prescribed according to the amount of residual urine, aiming at not surpassing the bladder capacity of more than 500 ml. Patients were catheterized depending on residual urine volume, i.e. once a day over 100 ml, twice a day over 200 ml, and so forth. At follow-up, difficulties using the self-catheterization were noted. Patients were asked to fill in a voiding-residual diary. In case of an inability to self-catheterize, a transurethral Foley catheter was offered.

### Overactive bladder symptoms and voiding dysfunction in neurologically normal women [^72cd28e6]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

To understand mechanisms underlying overactive bladder (OAB) and voiding dysfunction (VD) in neurologically normal women.

Methods

Review of MEDLINE from (1982) to (2011) using defined search terms, and manual analysis. Only articles published in English were included.

Results

One in five women report moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Whilst VD is more common in men, women report a higher rate of storage symptoms or post-micturition symptoms. Post-void residual (PVR) volume measurements are vital in the assessment of women with LUTS and patients with VD without stress incontinence (SUI) are likely to have an elevated PVR (82%). Bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) also causes VD in women and can be alleviated by surgery or alpha-blocker therapy, although OAB symptoms typically remain. Surgical repair for SUI can result in temporary VD in the minority of patients, highlighting the complex interplay that is emerging in the urethral bladder functioning complex in women.

Conclusions

Women with impaired bladder emptying present with a wide range of LUTS, and PVR measurement is essential for diagnosis. OAB and VD can clearly coexist and accurate diagnosis of underlying pathophysiology is required. Recommendations for clinical practice and research are provided including: investigation of VD in women with OAB; evaluation of PVR values to determine appropriate therapy and identification of BOO. There is clearly a need for further research into the impact of alpha-blockers in women with VD as well as an evaluation of PVR changes in women with OAB before and after antimuscarinic therapy.

### Women urinate in the standing position do not increase post-void residual urine volumes [^d03705f9]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

The effects of standing while voiding have seldom been investigated in women. We evaluate urodynamic parameters of voiding while standing in healthy women using uroflowmetry and post-void residual urine volume assessment. Results are compared with crouching and sitting.

Methods

Between July and October, 2008, a total of 30 healthy, nulliparous female volunteers were enrolled. Ages were 22–37 (mean: 28 ± 4). Urodynamic studies were performed for all in sitting, crouching and standing positions; 3, 3 and 5 times in each position, respectively. Volunteers used homemade auxiliary appliances for collecting urine from the urethra and draining it forward when standing. Volume, maximum flow rate, mean flow rate and post-void residual urine volume were compared.

Results

Maximum and average flow rates in the sitting and standing positions were significantly different, but not between sitting and crouching or between crouching and standing. There were no differences in voided volume and post-void residual urine volume. There's no apparent learning curve for women in the standing position.

Conclusions

Though flow rates are decreased while standing, post-void residual volume is not significantly different. Women have another choice for voiding in public restrooms.

### Objective versus subjective outcome measures of biofeedback: what really matters? [^24cb84d1]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Clinical epidemiologic studies suggest that once established, voiding dysfunction can become a lifelong condition if not treated correctly early on in life. Biofeedback is one component of a voiding retraining program to help children with voiding dysfunction. Our goal was to compare objective non-invasive urodynamic data obtained during office biofeedback sessions with patient reported voiding symptom scores.

Methods

Charts of 55 children referred in 2010 for pelvic floor muscle biofeedback therapy for urinary incontinence were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with any anatomic diagnoses were excluded. Forty-seven (86%) females and eight males (14%) with a mean age of 8.2 years made up the cohort. Uroflow curves, voided volumes, and post-void residuals were recorded at each visit and served as objective data. Volumes were normalized as a percentage of expected bladder capacity according to age. The patient reported symptom score and patient reported outcome (improved, no change or worse) served as subjective measures of intervention.

Results

The primary referral diagnoses were day and night wetting in 37 (67%) and daytime incontinence in 18 (33%) children. A history of urinary tract infection (UTI) was noted in 32 (64%) patients, and 25% were maintained on antibiotic prophylaxis during the study period. Twenty-nine percent were maintained on anticholinergic medication. Patients attended an average of 2.5 biofeedback sessions. Voided volumes and post void residual volumes were unchanged, 50% of the abnormal uroflow curves normalized over the course of treatment (p < 0.05). Patient reported symptom score decreased from 12.8 ± 5.6 to 8.0 ± 6.5 (p < 0.002) over an average follow-up time of 276 days reflecting fewer daytime voiding symptoms. There was no significant change in the patient symptom score component for the night-time wetting. Patient-reported outcomes at the final session of biofeedback were rated an improved in 26 (47%), no change in 15 (27%), worse in three (5%) patients, and not rated in 11 patients (21%).

Conclusions

Pelvic floor muscle biofeedback is associated with patient-reported improvement in symptoms, reduction in voiding symptom score, and normalization of uroflow curves, but these improvements are not correlated with objective parameters of voided volumes and post-void residual urine obtained during office visits for biofeedback. It is important to identify the most relevant outcome measures for BFB, as insurance coverage for medical interventions that cannot offer outcomes analysis that demonstrates a benefit for the patient will eventually be eliminated.

### Post-void residual urine volume in women with overactive bladder symptoms [^f61b8b32]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

Most patients with overactive bladder symptoms initially present to their primary care provider for treatment. It is currently recommended that post-void residual urine (PVR) should be measured during the assessment of women complaining of overactive bladder symptoms and anticholinergic medication should be used if PVR is low. However, many primary care providers are reluctant to measure PVR and, therefore, they may delay treatment or even inappropriately treat patients who have a high PVR. We identified clinical factors that are associated with increased PVR that could be used to select which patients are at risk for this.

Materials and Methods

The charts of women presenting to our clinic with complaints of urinary frequency, urgency and/or urge incontinence were retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographics, physical examination and PVR were analyzed to determine if any factor was associated with increased PVR (100 mL or greater).

Results

The charts of 201 patients with complete data were reviewed. Patient age was 20 to 90 years (mean 55). Overall 19% of patients were found to have elevated PVR. Univariate analysis identified that older age, prior incontinence surgery, history of multiple sclerosis, greater American Urological Association Symptom Score, vaginal parity greater than 2, greater pad use and stage 2 or greater vaginal prolapse were associated with elevated PVR. Multivariate analysis identified age older than 55 years, prior incontinence surgery, a history of multiple sclerosis and vaginal prolapse stage 2 or greater as independent predictors of elevated PVR.

Conclusions

It is possible to identify patients with overactive bladder symptoms who are at risk for elevated PVR based on history and physical examination. This could result in fewer patients needing PVR measurement prior to initiating treatment.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^f44ef61a]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU overactive bladder — post–botulinum toxin (BTX) monitoring and post-void residual (PVR) management: Clinicians should obtain a post-void residual in patients with overactive bladder (OAB) whose symptoms have not adequately improved or worsened after intradetrusor botulinum toxin injection (Clinical Principle), and clinicians should evaluate patients approximately two weeks after the initial BTX injection to assess symptom improvement and to rule out potential urinary retention, which is highest at two weeks post-procedure. If symptoms do not improve, a PVR, urinalysis, and if positive, a urine culture should be obtained; if the PVR is elevated with respect to voided volume (i.e. PVR 100–300 mL), the clinician may decide to start the patient on CIC based on symptoms and history of UTI. Caution should be used when performing BTX injection in patients with a PVR ≥ 100–200 mL, and if a patient empties well after the first BTX injection it is optional to check PVR post-procedure for subsequent injections since the rate of retention after a prior history of good emptying is rare.

### Urine flow acceleration in healthy children: a retrospective cohort study [^4b7443eb]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aims

To establish normal reference values of urine flow acceleration (Q acc) in healthy children, as there is a lack of nomograms for normative reference values of Q acc by voided volumes in the pediatric population so far. Q acc might be an early indicator of autonomic neuropathy in children and adolescents.

Methods

Data were retrospectively collected from healthy children who underwent uroflowmetry between 1990 and 1992. Exclusion criteria were voided volume less than 20 ml, and postvoid residual more than 15%. Baseline characteristics and uroflowmetry parameters were collected from girls and boys aged between 6 and 18 years. Voided volume, voiding time, time to maximum flow rate, and maximum and average flow rates of urine were measured, and Q acc was calculated. Postvoid bladder diameter was measured by ultrasonography and converted to volume.

Results

Uroflowmetry parameters of 208 children (≤ 18 years old, 45.2% girls, mean age 9.68 ± 3.09 years) who performed 404 micturition were analyzed. Median voided volume, voiding time, time to Q max, Q ave, Q max, Q acc, and postvoid residual volume were 130 [20–460] ml, 10 [3–56] s, 3 [1–14] s, 11.7 [2.5–36.6] ml/s, 20.5 [5–50] ml/s, 6 [0.81–25] ml/s 2, and 1.83 [0–38.62] ml, respectively. Q acc nomograms were given in centile forms for girls and boys separately, which show an inversely proportional correlation between voided volumes.

Conclusions

These are the first nomograms for normative reference values of Q acc in the pediatric population (girls and boys separately) by voided volumes in centile forms. These may be useful to interpret abnormal Q acc values and diagnose lower urinary tract diseases over a wide range of voided volumes.

Table 1
Definitions of dysfunctional voiding symptoms

Voiding diary

A detailed voiding diary and associated symptoms can provide valuable diagnostic and management insights into DV. The diary should span three days and record the time and volume of each void, fluid intake, incontinence episodes, defecation, and fecal soiling episodes.

Uroflowmetry can provide key insights into the dynamics of bladder emptying. It is beneficial for children who are capable of voiding on command, particularly in cases involving a weak urinary stream, difficulty voiding without straining, frequent UTIs due to incomplete bladder emptying, or incontinence that does not respond to treatment. Uroflowmetry measures urine flow rate and offers a comprehensive view of bladder function when combined with post-void residual volume assessed via ultrasound. Repeated abnormal flow patterns may indicate bladder contraction abnormalities or the presence of a functional or structural issue at the bladder outlet or along the urethra.

Physical examination

The physical examination should be thorough, identifying any urologic, neurologic, or anatomical abnormalities. Table 2 outlines the key components of a comprehensive physical exam for DV.

Table 2
Physical Examination Components

Laboratory assessment

The urinalysis and urine culture are the first laboratory assessments that should be conducted. These tests are essential to rule out underlying infections, hematuria, or proteinuria, which may indicate additional urinary system abnormalities.

Imaging evaluation

Ultrasound [US], as a non-invasive and commonly used method, is employed to investigate the kidneys and bladder of children with DV. It should be performed in every child suspected of neurological or anatomical lesions, UTI, or symptoms indicating obstructive uropathy, such as a weak or interrupted urinary stream. The US is beneficial because of its safety, ease of use, and ability to detect structural anomalies early. It can provide information regarding anomalies, such as hydronephrosis, a duplicated collecting system with or without an ectopic ureter, and scarring of the kidneys. Additionally, it assesses post-void residual volume, which indicates impaired bladder emptying when a volume exceeds 20 mL after repeated measurements [or more than 15–20% of their bladder capacity]. Increased residual volumes suggest ineffective bladder emptying, which may require further urodynamic evaluation. The US also evaluates bladder wall thickness, which, if thickened, suggests an overactive bladder due to an anatomical or functional abnormality of its outlet.

### Standardization of pediatric uroradiological terms: a multidisciplinary European glossary [^560e09f5]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Persistent urogenital sinus

Abnormal persistence of a common channel for the urinary and genital tracts due to a developmental arrest before the urogenital septum has divided the sinus into both tracts. It belongs to partial cloacal malformations and may be associated with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

Post-void residual urine

Residual urine is the amount of urine left in the bladder immediately after voiding. Healthy infants and toddlers have shown not to empty the bladder completely in every micturition but they do so at least once during a 4-h observation. Normal residual urine volume is zero, while 20 mL or more on repeat measurements is pathological. Values between these two measurements represent a possible clinical relevant amount of residual urine. Another easy and useful definition is the presence of a residual urine volume higher than 10% of the expected bladder volume.

Posterior urethral valves

Congenital obstructiing urethral membrane (rather than true valves) between the lateral urethral wall and the distal end of the veru montanum. It is caused by an abnormal migration of the Wolff channels and occurs only in males. Secondary obstruction is variable. Depending on the severity and back pressure on the kidneys during development in utero, posterior urethral valves can result in varying degrees of chronic kidney disease due to renal dysplasia.

Proximal

When referring to the anatomy of the urogenital tract, the natural flow of urine from the kidney to the urethra has to be considered. Proximal means close to the arriving urine unlike distal which is downstream. For example, the proximal ureter is close to the kidney whereas the distal part is close to the bladder.

Pyelectasis (= pelviectasis)

Borderline dilatation of the renal pelvis. The pelvis is measured in an orthogonal plane to the long axis of the kidney between the anterior and posterior lips (intrasinusal measurement, corresponding to an anteroposterior diameter). This measurement should not be performed outside the kidney (unless explicitly specified). The range of normal values is not straightforward and there is no simple threshold value which separates normal from abnormal. The values depend on the age, the position of the patient, the hydration status and the degree of bladder distension. Thus the use of this term may be misleading and is not recommended. For description, pelvic anteroposterior diameter should be provided in association with the grading of pelvicalyceal dilatation.

Pyelocaliectasis

See "pelvicalyceal dilatation". The use of this former term is not recommended.

### Comparison of diagnostic accuracies of commonly used trial of void parameters [^f202e341]. Urogynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Importance

Understanding the diagnostic accuracy of postoperative trial of void (TOV) parameters is important for decision making related to postoperative catheterization.

Objective

The aim of the study was to compare the diagnostic accuracies of common postoperative TOV parameters.

Design

The study population comprised a prospective cohort undergoing outpatient urogynecologic procedures at a tertiary referral center from September 2018 to June 2021. Participants recorded their postvoid residual volume (PVR), voided volume, and subjective force of stream (sFOS) for all postoperative voids until meeting criteria to stop. The primary outcome was the sensitivity of TOV parameters in predicting postoperative urinary retention, defined as PVR ≥ 1/2 voided volume on the first 2 postoperative voids. Sample size was set at 183 to detect a 20% difference (α = 0.05, β = 0.2, up to 20% with missing data) in sensitivity between TOV parameters. Diagnostic accuracies were compared with McNemar's test for paired proportions, with Youden's index calculated to determine optimal thresholds.

Results

The 160 participants had a mean age of 52.1 ± 11.4 years and a mean body mass index of 28.9 ± 5.8 kg/m2 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). Mean preoperative PVR was 25.8 ± 29.9 mL. Most participants had surgery that included a midurethral sling (137/160, 85.6%). Thirty-four (34/160, 21.3%) participants met criteria for postoperative urinary retention. The optimal recovery room TOV thresholds to predict postoperative urinary retention were PVR ≥ 87 mL (sensitivity 96.8%, specificity 60.0%), voided volume ≤ 150 mL (sensitivity 83.9%, specificity 72.3%), and sFOS ≤ 60% (sensitivity 100%, specificity 50.8%). Voided volume ≤ 150 mL had greater diagnostic accuracy than PVR ≥ 100 mL (156.2 vs 151.8).

Conclusions

In this cohort, PVR ≥ 87 mL, voided volume ≤ 150 mL, and sFOS ≤ 60% had optimal diagnostic accuracy for postoperative urinary retention.

### EAU guidelines on the assessment of non-neurogenic male lower urinary tract symptoms including benign prostatic obstruction [^36115fb2]. European Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) represent one of the most common clinical complaints in adult men and have multifactorial aetiology.

Objective

To develop European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on the assessment of men with non-neurogenic LUTS.

Evidence Acquisition

A structured literature search on the assessment of non-neurogenic male LUTS was conducted. Articles with the highest available level of evidence were selected. The Delphi technique consensus approach was used to develop the recommendations.

Evidence Synthesis

As a routine part of the initial assessment of male LUTS, a medical history must be taken, a validated symptom score questionnaire with quality-of-life question(s) should be completed, a physical examination including digital rectal examination should be performed, urinalysis must be ordered, post-void residual urine (PVR) should be measured, and uroflowmetry may be performed. Micturition frequency-volume charts or bladder diaries should be used to assess male LUTS with a prominent storage component or nocturia. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) should be measured only if a diagnosis of prostate cancer will change the management or if PSA can assist in decision-making for patients at risk of symptom progression and complications. Renal function must be assessed if renal impairment is suspected from the history and clinical examination, if the patient has hydronephrosis, or when considering surgical treatment for male LUTS. Uroflowmetry should be performed before any treatment. Imaging of the upper urinary tract in men with LUTS should be performed in patients with large PVR, haematuria, or a history of urolithiasis. Imaging of the prostate should be performed if this assists in choosing the appropriate drug and when considering surgical treatment. Urethrocystoscopy should only be performed in men with LUTS to exclude suspected bladder or urethral pathology and/or before minimally invasive/surgical therapies if the findings may change treatment. Pressure-flow studies should be performed only in individual patients for specific indications before surgery or when evaluation of the pathophysiology underlying LUTS is warranted.

Conclusions

These guidelines provide evidence-based practical guidance for assessment of non-neurogenic male LUTS. An extended version is available online (www.uroweb.org/guidelines).

Patient Summary

This article presents a short version of European Association of Urology guidelines for non-neurogenic male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The recommended tests should be able to distinguish between uncomplicated male LUTS and possible differential diagnoses and to evaluate baseline parameters for treatment. The guidelines also define the clinical profile of patients to provide the best evidence-based care. An algorithm was developed to guide physicians in using appropriate diagnostic tests.

### Effect of premicturitional bladder volume on the accuracy of postvoid residual urine volume measurement by transabdominal ultrasonography: rate of bladder fullness is of great importance for preventing false-positive residue diagnosis [^f6bb31ab]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of premicturitional bladder volume (V1) on postvoid residual urine volume (V2) measurements and to assess the ideal V1 for an accurate V2 determination.

Methods

Twenty-five healthy men without any urinary symptoms constituted the study group. Measurements by transabdominal ultrasonography for V1 and V2 were performed for each subject at 3 different phases, each of which was preceded by oral intake of 1000 mL of water and accompanied by "mild", "moderate", and "severe" sensations of micturition, respectively.

Results

Mean ± SD V1 and V2 during the first, second, and third phases were 117.7 ± 70.3 and 1 ± 1, 356.2 ± 112.3 and 11.5 ± 12 and 639.6 ± 171.8 and 58.8 ± 35.2 mL, respectively. With 50 mL as the cutoff value for a pathologic V2, 15 (60%) men had V2 in the third phase exceeding this value, whereas the same rate was calculated as 0% for either of the first 2 phases. No patient with V1 of less than 540 mL had V2 of greater than 50 mL.

Conclusions

Postvoid residual urine volume measurements with an uncomfortably full bladder result in high false-positive postmicturitional residue values even in healthy young men. We strongly advise that V1 measurements of the bladder be performed before V2 measurements and that V2 not be measured if V1 is greater than 540 mL.

Voiding dysfunction

A diagnosis by symptoms and investigations, including urodynamics, is defined as abnormally slow and/or incomplete micturition, based on abnormally slow urine flow rates and or abnormally high post-void residuals, ideally on repeated measurement to confirm abnormality. Pressure-flow studies can be required to determine the cause of the voiding dysfunction. FN4.6

Postpartum urinary retention (PPUR):

Inability to empty the bladder completely during the postpartum period and up to 12 months after delivery characterized by high PVR accompanied or not by symptoms of bladder distension. There is a generally (but not always) evidence of painless and palpable or percussible bladder in the postpartum period and up to 12 months after delivery, suggestive of a chronic high PVR. The patient experiences slow flow and incomplete bladder emptying. (NEW).

Acute Postpartum urinary retention (APPUR):

A patient, with or without symptoms of bladder distension, is unable to pass any urine despite having full bladder, which on examination is painfully distended and readily palpable or percussible and on catheterization is characterized by high PVR during the postpartum period and up to 12 months after delivery. (NEW).

Postpartum voiding dysfunction — Retention with overflow:

Involuntary loss of urine directly related to an excessively full bladder in retention. (NEW).

Postpartum chronic urinary retention:

Complaint of chronic or repeated inability to empty the bladder, despite the ability to pass some urine. This may result in the frequent passage of small amounts of urine or urinary incontinence and a distended bladder. (NEW). FN4.7

Postpartum acute on chronic retention:

An individual with chronic retention goes into acute retention and is unable to void. (NEW).

Covert postpartum urinary retention:

Diagnosis of high PVR with no or minimal voiding symptoms and a postvoid residual volume greater than 100 ml, in the early postpartum period, up to 4 weeks. (NEW). FN4.8

### The fundamentals of uroflowmetry practice, based on international continence society good urodynamic practices recommendations [^19c00740]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

To review the recommendations on uroflowmetry in the International Continence Society (ICS) Standardization documents in order to identify a systematic approach to the delivery and interpretation of free flow rate testing in clinical practice.

Methods

Expectations of service and good practice in uroflowmetry described in the ICS standards on Urodynamic Practice, Urodynamic Equipment, and Terminology for Lower Urinary Tract Function were identified and summarized.

Results

Urodynamic centers should provide a suitable uroflowmetry testing environment. Equipment should be calibrated and maintained according to manufacturer requirements. Patients should be well-informed in advance of the test. They should be advised to avoid: knocking the machine; allowing the stream to move; squeezing the urethra; and body movements. It is generally appropriate to get more than one flow trace for each patient. Voided volume should be representative for the patient, for example by comparing with values recorded on a Bladder Diary. Post void residual (PVR) should be measured soon after testing. After the test, the urodynamicist should review the trace and ensure maximum flow rate and end of micturition are correctly identified in case the equipment has inappropriately taken the values from a trace artefact.

Conclusions

The summary provides a systematic approach to ensure a representative, high quality, non-invasive flow test is carried out for individual patients.

### The pitfalls of bladderScan ™ PVR in evaluating bladder volume in adolescent females [^bcf90daf]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Post-void residual (PVR) determination is an integral part of the evaluation of children presenting with lower urinary tract symptoms. Historically the PVR volume has been obtained by urinary catheterization after the child has voided, however, with the advent of ultrasound technology, PVR was determined in a noninvasive fashion by radiology personnel. Currently, PVR determinations may be obtained by healthcare personnel (without specialized training) using a portable, self calculating ultrasound; the BladderScan. While BladderScan PVR has been shown to be accurate and reproducible, it cannot differentiate between a distended bladder and other cystic pelvic structures. Several case reports have been published illustrating falsely elevated PVRs by bladder scan in adults with cystic pelvic structures. We present two adolescent females with LUTS who had falsely elevated PVRs by bladder scan, who, subsequently, underwent formal imaging to identify ovarian cystic pathology. To our knowledge, this is the first report of falsely elevated bladder scan PVR in children related to cystic pelvic organ pathology.

### Establishing a standard protocol for the voiding cystourethrography [^80eed4af]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) reporting parameters — bladder, vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), voiding, and urethra — specify to document bladder shape and contour; filling defects, trabeculations, or other abnormalities; maximum bladder capacity at first void if cyclic; estimate of postvoid residual (PVR) as mild, moderate, or large; and the position and appearance of the bladder neck. For VUR, record onset for each side including approximate bladder volume and whether onset occurred during filling or voiding, grade VUR per the International Reflux Study, comment on ureter insertion site and anatomy (normal vs ectopic; single vs duplicated or bifid; insertion near or in a diverticulum), and assess drainage after void, noting that recatheterization may be necessary to assess drainage of refluxed material, especially in non–toilet-trained children. For voiding, record bladder volume at onset of voiding, note bladder neck appearance as the child voids, and estimate bladder volume residual (mild, moderate, or large). For the urethra, record abnormalities including dilatation, valves, strictures, and the appearance in the region of the external sphincter.

### Long-term micturition problems of asymptomatic postpartum urinary retention: a prospective case-control study [^9e2c04f7]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

In the group with PVRV ≥ 150 mL, 15% of women had a PVRV ranging from 150 to 250 mL, 69% (n = 86) had a PVRV between 250 and 500 mL and 16% (n = 19) of women had a PVRV above 500 mL. This implies that in clinical daily practice, a considerable percentage of women with high residual volumes remain unnoticed.

With a median PVRV of 175 mL after the first void in the total group and median PVRV of 300 mL in the group of women with a PVRV ≥ 150 mL, it is reasonable to assume that the cut-off value of 150 mL, as used by many authors and based on residual volumes in non-pregnant patients, may be too low to detect a pathological condition. Many authors focus on abnormal PVRVs; however, an internationally accepted definition with clinically significant threshold values is lacking. Although large PVRVs (≥ 200–300 mL) may suggest a higher incidence of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), evidence for using this measurement as a predictor is low. It seems reasonable to define adequate emptying of the bladder as a voided volume that is over two thirds of the bladder capacity, indicating that residual volumes over 30% of the bladder volume could be abnormal. With non-pregnant women with bladder capacities around 400–500 mL, this would result in PVRV < 150 mL. However, as bladder volumes during pregnancy and postpartum can reach and exceed 1,000 mL, it is a reasonable assumption that limiting PVRVs to 150 mL after delivery is clinically irrelevant. As over 15% of our patients had PVRV ≥ 500 mL, comparable with previous studies, we believe that the cutoff value to detect a potential pathological condition should be increased. We therefore suggest that the new definition of covert PUR should be: "covert or asymptomatic postpartum urinary retention (PUR) includes post void residual volume (PVRV) ≥ 500 mL after the first spontaneous void following (vaginal) delivery, measured by ultrasound or catheter". This adjusted definition could help us to learn more about potential LUTS related to inadequate bladder emptying after (vaginal) delivery and should therefore not only be a topic for future research, but also be widely accepted by international expert societies and incorporated into daily clinical guidelines.

### Long-term micturition problems of asymptomatic postpartum urinary retention: a prospective case-control study [^6c84b32b]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Covert PUR according to the definition of PVRV ≥ 150 mL, is a common and transient phenomenon after vaginal delivery that does not result in more LUTS 1 year after delivery. Although the current definition is not useful in identifying postpartum those women who have a pathological condition, we suggest changing the definition of covert PUR to: "post-void residual volume ≥ 500 mL after the first spontaneous void after (vaginal) delivery". This cut-off value is the value at which some women do need more time to normalise emptying of the bladder. The exact clinical implications of covert PUR need to be further studied in this subcategory of women.

### Non-invasive bladder function measures in healthy, asymptomatic female children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b3319a12]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common in children and adolescents. Non-invasive tests evaluating bladder function are generally preferred over invasive tests, yet few studies have explored the range of normative values for these tests in healthy, asymptomatic children.

Objective

To define normative reference ranges for non-invasive tests of bladder function in healthy, asymptomatic girls and adolescents.

Study Design

A comprehensive search strategy was performed in seven electronic databases through October 2019. English-language studies reporting data on voiding frequency, voided and postvoid residual volumes (PVR) and uroflowmetry results in healthy, asymptomatic girls (mean age ≥ 5 years) were included. Two independent reviewers performed study review, data extraction, and quality assessment. Overall mean estimates and 95% confidence intervals for each bladder function parameter were calculated using random effects models, and 95% normative reference values were estimated.

Results

Ten studies met eligibility criteria for the meta-analysis (n = 2143 girls, age range: 3–18). Mean estimates of maximum voided volume and PVR were 233.4 mL (95% CI 204.3–262.6; n = 1 study) and 8.6 mL (95% CI 4.8–12.4; n = 2 studies) respectively. Pooled mean estimates for uroflowmetry parameters were: 21.5 ml/s (95% CI 20.5–2.5) for maximum flow rate (n = 6 studies), 12.5 ml/s (95% CI 11.2–13.8) for mean flow rate (n = 6 studies), 6.8 s (95% CI 4.4–9.3) for time to maximum flow (n = 3 studies), 15.7 s (95% CI 13.0–18.5) for flow time (n = 3 studies), and 198.7 mL (95% CI 154.2–234.2) for voided volume (n = 9 studies). No studies reported estimates of voiding frequency. Between-study heterogeneity was high (89.0–99.6%).

Conclusions

Although we were able to calculate pooled mean estimates for several parameters, the small number of included studies and the wide age ranges of participants preclude generalization of reference values to all healthy girls. Further research is needed to determine normative reference values within specific age groups.

### A cost-effectiveness analysis of post-void residual bladder scan thresholds in the postoperative setting [^81b73fc8]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

To identify the optimal cost-effectiveness threshold of post-void residual (PVR) by bladder scan in postoperative urogynecologic patients.

Methods

A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed as a secondary analysis of a previously published study of patients undergoing urogynecologic procedures with planned voiding trials, setting thresholds for postoperative PVR bladder scan volumes at 100 ml, 150 ml, and 200 ml. Patient-based scenarios were modeled for ambulatory office or emergency department (ED) resource utilization and to determine the cost-effectiveness of each threshold. Costs were obtained from a southeastern academic medical center, only utilizing direct medical costs and hospital costs, not including societal costs. Quality-adjusted life years (QALY's) were used as health outcomes determining the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).

Results

A total of 151 patients from the original study were included. A willingness to pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY was assumed. A PVR of 100 mL exceeded this at $373,824. A PVR threshold of 150 mL was dominant (-$1,211,716), while minimizing ED visits for postoperative urinary retention (POUR) and unnecessary clinic appointments. While a PVR of 200 mL appeared a cost-effective strategy (-$488,389), there was increased ED utilization and under-detection of postoperative urinary retention (POUR).

Conclusion

A PVR threshold of 100 mL created a healthcare system burden due to increased office voiding trials. Both PVR thresholds of 150 mL and 200 mL were cost-effective strategies; however, ED utilization for POUR increased with 200 ml. Utilizing 150 mL as the PVR cut-off proved the most cost-effective strategy, avoiding POUR under-detection and undue health costs.

### Urodynamic studies in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^bca36dd5]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Adult urodynamics — Description of tests defines key urodynamic measurements consistent with International Continence Society terminology: Post-void residual (PVR) "is the volume of urine left in the bladder at the completion of micturition" and "can be measured by ultrasound or catheterization"; Uroflowmetry "is the measurement of the rate of urine flow over time"; Cystometry "is the method by which the pressure/ volume relationship of the bladder is measured during bladder filling", with measurements including "bladder sensations, compliance, bladder capacity and the presence or absence of detrusor overactivity (DO)"; Electromyography (EMG) "is the study of the electronic potentials produced by the depolarization of muscle membranes", and in most tests EMG of the striated sphincteric muscles evaluates abnormalities associated with lower urinary tract symptoms; Pressure flow studies (PFS) "measure the relationship between pressure in the bladder and urine flow rate during bladder emptying"; Videourodynamic studies (VUDS) "include the addition of simultaneous imaging (usually fluoroscopy) during cystometry and/or PFS"; Abdominal leak point pressure (ALPP) or Valsalva leak point pressure (VLPP) "is a measurement of urethral function or outlet competence and is the intravesical pressure at which urine leakage occurs due to increased abdominal pressure in the absence of a detrusor contraction"; Urethral pressure profile "is the continuous measurement of the fluid pressure needed to just open a closed urethra"; and Maximum urethral closure pressure (MUCP) "is the maximum difference between the urethral pressure and the intravesical pressure".

### Recommendations of the SUFU / AUGS / ICS female stress urinary incontinence surgical publication working group: a common standard minimum data set for the literature [^38185763]. Urogynecology (2024). High credibility.

Post-void residual urine (PVR) assessment should be documented preoperatively and the method specified (STANDARD), and it may be part of inclusion/exclusion criteria with recognition that incomplete bladder emptying preoperatively may impact postoperative voiding dysfunction; methods include catheterization or ultrasound. Other preoperative testing includes voiding/bladder diaries, which can be difficult, burdensome, and unreliable (ADDITIONAL); urodynamic studies, which increase cost and discomfort, have not been shown to improve outcomes or change operative plans in uncomplicated SUI and are not readily available (ADDITIONAL); and pad testing, which was deemed to have little value in SUI studies (UNNECESSARY).

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^07fc6642]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU guideline — initial evaluation of idiopathic overactive bladder (OAB) states that clinicians should not routinely perform urodynamics (UDS), cystoscopy, or urinary tract imaging in the initial evaluation of patients with OAB, and that clinicians may perform advanced testing, such as UDS, cystoscopy, or urinary tract imaging, in the initial evaluation of patients with OAB when diagnostic uncertainty exists. The initial evaluation of patients with symptoms of OAB should include a medical history, physical examination, and urinalysis, and additional components of an OAB evaluation may also include post-void residual (PVR) measurement, voiding diary, and a symptom questionnaire. There is no need to obtain UDS, cystoscopy, or upper tract imaging in the initial evaluation of a patient with OAB symptoms, but further evaluation with UDS, cystoscopy, and/or urinary tract imaging can be considered to clarify diagnosis when diagnostic uncertainty or abnormal findings exist and can also be considered if patients have a suboptimal or unexpected response to standard OAB therapy.

### Fundamentals of urodynamic practice, based on international continence society good urodynamic practices recommendations [^a53e7e52]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

To review the recommendations on basic urodynamic testing in the International Continence Society (ICS) standardization documents, specifying key recommendations for delivery and interpretation in clinical practice.

Methods

Fundamental expectations described in the ICS standards on good urodynamic practices, urodynamic equipment, and terminology for lower urinary tract (LUT) function were identified and summarized.

Results

The ICS standard urodynamic protocol includes clinical history, including symptom and bother score(s), examination, 3-day voiding chart/diary, representative uroflowmetry with post-void residual, and cystometry with pressure-flow study (PFS). Liquid filled catheters are connected to pressure transducers at the same vertical pressure as the patient's pubic symphysis, taking atmospheric pressure as the zero value. Urodynamic testing is done to answer specific therapy-driven questions for treatment selection; provocations are applied to give the best chance of reproducing the problem during the test. Quality of recording is monitored throughout, and remedial steps taken for any technical issues occurring during testing. Labels are applied during the test to document events, such as patient-reported sensation, provocation tests, and permission to void. After the test, the pressure and flow traces are scrutinized to ensure artefacts do not confound the findings. An ICS standard urodynamic report details the key aspects, reporting clinical observations, technical, and quality issues. Urodynamic services must maintain and calibrate equipment according to manufacturer stipulations.

Conclusions

The review provides a succinct summary of practice expectations for a urodynamic unit offering cystometry and pressure flow studies (PFS) to an appropriate standard.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction: diagnosis and evaluation [^55d2b31e]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) initial evaluation — At initial evaluation, all patients with NLUTD should undergo a detailed history, physical exam, and urinalysis (Clinical Principle), and patients with NLUTD who spontaneously void should undergo post-void residual measurement (Clinical Principle). Optional studies include a voiding/catheterization diary, pad test, and non-invasive uroflow (Expert Opinion). For low-risk NLUTD, the clinician should not routinely obtain upper tract imaging, renal function assessment, or multichannel urodynamics (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C), whereas for unknown-risk NLUTD, the clinician should obtain upper tract imaging, renal function assessment, and multichannel urodynamics (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). In the patient with an acute neurological event resulting in NLUTD, the clinician should perform risk stratification once the neurological condition has stabilized (Clinical Principle), and clinicians should not perform routine cystoscopy in the initial evaluation of the NLUTD patient (Clinical Principle).

### ACR-ACNM-SNMMI-SPR practice parameter for the performance of radionuclide cystography [^9c45e48a]. ACR/SNMMI/SPR/ACNM (2025). High credibility.

Radionuclide cystography — processing and quantification — states that for visual analysis of digital images, a consistent image display technique capable of contrast enhancement and cine mode should be used to maximize the sensitivity of the test. If desired, quantification of reflux during the bladder-filling phase and during the voiding phase may be achieved using region-of-interest (ROI) analysis, with ROI placed over the kidneys and the ureters. For quantification of postvoid residual volumes (RVs), prevoid and postvoid images of the bladder should be acquired anteriorly or posteriorly; ROIs are drawn around the bladder on both the pre- and postvoid images and the volume of voided urine is recorded. RV can be estimated by the following formulas, and RV may be calculated if the volume to which the bladder was filled is known using the provided equation.

### Evaluation of bladder function in children with familial mediterranean fever and outcomes: a retrospective study [^232412f9]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

In children diagnosed with FMF, post-micturition residual urine values may generally be within the normal range, but this is not always the case. Additionally, ultrasonographic measurement of bladder capacity may be misleading in the evaluation of bladder capacity. Therefore, it is important to evaluate PMR values and monitor them closely in termsofbladderfunction. Some authors have defined pathologically a PMR of more than 20 mL or a residual urine volume of more than 10% of estimated bladder capacity after repeated voiding without bladder overdistension. Ultrasonographic and uroflowmetric measurements are two effective methods for evaluating bladder capacity in children. Bladder volume measurement by ultrasonography is based on length, width, and height measurements of the bladder's widest dimensions. The obtained volume value is used to determine bladder capacity. This value reflects the maximum amount of urine a normal bladder can typically hold. Automated volume measurement modes, characterized by the highest measurement accuracy, are applied when measuring bladder volumes and assessing the residual urine volume after urination. (Toschiba Aplio 500) In most cases, these methods are based on measurements made using the prolate ellipsoid formula. Measurements must be taken in two planes perpendicular to each other at the maximum sections of the bladder. It should be noted that the results are subject to unavoidable calculation errors. In our study, urinary ultrasonography was performed by a single radiologist, and measurements were taken following the same principles. We believe this approach enhanced the reliability of our results and increased the impact on the accuracy of the findings. Altough considering the high reliability of our results in this context, we have observed that evaluations using ultrasonography can sometimes be misleading. Additionally, in routine daily follow-ups, the involvement of different radiologists, the use of different ultrasonography devices, variations in bladder filling levels, and differences in measurement locations could further reduce the reliability of the results. Therefore, we recommend that patients be evaluated with these factors in mind.
