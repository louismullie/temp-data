5 HT3 receptor anti agonist

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, including their mechanism, available agents, indications, comparative efficacy, safety, and practical selection guidance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the receptor biology and mechanism of action. Then, I should classify the available agents by generation and pharmacology. Next, I will review guideline-backed indications across CINV, PONV, RINV, and IBS-D. After that, I should compare efficacy and safety within class, including cardiac risk. Finally, I will synthesize practical selection principles and special-population considerations, and close with a concise clinical take-home message.

> Let me first confirm the receptor and mechanism. The 5-HT3 receptor is the only serotonin receptor subtype that is an ionotropic channel, mediating fast excitatory neurotransmission via sodium influx; antagonism blocks this signal and interrupts emetic reflexes both centrally in the area postrema and peripherally on vagal afferents, which explains antiemetic efficacy across multiple settings [^111gZoW6] [^114HhzZ7]. Wait, let me verify the structural context: recent structural work shows heteromeric 5-HT3AB channels differ from homomeric 5-HT3A in conductance and pharmacology, which may underlie subtle clinical differences among setrons, though this remains investigational for routine practice [^111bUaUu].

> I will now examine the agents by generation and pharmacology. First-generation setrons include ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, and tropisetron, with relatively short half-lives and competitive antagonism; second-generation palonosetron has higher receptor affinity, a long half-life near 40 hours, and unique allosteric binding with receptor internalization, which may confer advantages in delayed emesis and cross-talk modulation with NK1 pathways [^114GikQZ]. Hold on, I should verify formulation diversity: granisetron is available as oral, IV, transdermal patch, and extended-release subcutaneous injection, while ondansetron is available in multiple oral and IV forms; ramosetron is used in some regions and has supportive data in IBS-D, though availability varies [^113VPKqc] [^112aKzk9].

> Next, I should review indications and guideline positions. For chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, ASCO recommends a 5-HT3 antagonist as a core component, with triplet therapy (NK1 RA + 5-HT3 RA + dexamethasone) for high emetic risk and doublet therapy for moderate risk; palonosetron is often preferred in AC-based regimens due to delayed-phase activity, and for multiday chemotherapy, extended-duration options like the granisetron patch or ER injection are reasonable [^115r7fUg] [^114E7niq] [^113VPKqc]. For postoperative nausea and vomiting, contemporary consensus recommends multimodal prophylaxis and supports 5-HT3 antagonists as effective monotherapy or in combination, with similar efficacy across agents at guideline doses and a class signal for headache [^117WjVPn]. For radiation-induced emesis, prophylaxis with a 5-HT3 antagonist is recommended for high- and moderate-risk fields, with or without dexamethasone depending on risk category [^112PYnCK] [^114rW8B9]. For diarrhea-predominant IBS, 5-HT3 antagonists reduce urgency and pain; alosetron is FDA-approved for severe, refractory IBS-D in women with REMS, and network meta-analyses suggest ondansetron improves stool form while alosetron improves global symptoms, though safety must be weighed carefully [^112aKzk9] [^111LYsUh].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about interchangeability. I should compare efficacy within class. Multiple meta-analyses and guidelines conclude that first-generation setrons have broadly similar efficacy for acute CINV, with palonosetron showing superiority for delayed emesis in some studies; Cochrane found granisetron and ondansetron equivalent for acute and delayed outcomes, while a separate analysis suggested palonosetron plus dexamethasone outperformed granisetron plus dexamethasone for delayed control, albeit with limited head-to-head data [^117U8Djd] [^112DPBwz]. For PONV, network meta-analyses indicate broadly similar efficacy among setrons at recommended doses, with granisetron plus dexamethasone often ranking among the most effective combinations, though newer agents have not clearly surpassed ondansetron in head-to-head trials [^115yBYuq] [^117WjVPn]. In IBS-D, comparative analyses suggest alosetron excels for global improvement, cilansetron for pain, and ondansetron for stool consistency, but availability and safety constraints limit routine use [^112aKzk9].

> I need to check safety next, especially cardiac risk. Class-wide, 5-HT3 antagonists can cause small, reversible ECG interval changes, but clinically significant torsades is rare. However, dolasetron has a stronger QT signal and is singled out in regulatory communications, and combining granisetron with dexamethasone has been linked to increased arrhythmia risk in surgical cohorts, so caution is warranted in patients with baseline QT prolongation or interacting drugs [^115UHHbj] [^116Zk4w4] [^112U1sj1]. Let me reconsider pediatric and elderly contexts: ondansetron carries a labeled QT warning and should be avoided in congenital long QT or with other QT-prolonging agents; in older adults, granisetron's minimal CYP interactions and multiple formulations may be advantageous, and dose adjustments are generally unnecessary in renal impairment for most setrons [^112GSeKt] [^111hyzQj].

> Next, I should review special populations and practical selection. For pediatrics, ondansetron is commonly used for acute gastroenteritis and cyclic vomiting, though evidence quality varies and guidelines emphasize individualized action plans; NK1 antagonists like aprepitant may be added in refractory CVS, and olanzapine is not routinely used in children for CINV [^1136Lvju] [^1124yvEg] [^115qhuV8]. For older adults, I should confirm that granisetron's favorable interaction profile and transdermal or ER options can simplify regimens; for hepatic impairment, ondansetron requires dose reduction, whereas granisetron generally does not, which can guide selection in cirrhosis [^111hyzQj] [^113VPKqc]. For multiday chemotherapy, extended-duration granisetron formulations reduce daily administration burden, which can improve adherence and outcomes [^113VPKqc].

> I will now synthesize practical selection principles. For acute CINV, any first-generation setron plus dexamethasone is acceptable. For delayed emesis risk or AC-based regimens, palonosetron-based triple therapy is reasonable, and for multiday regimens, consider granisetron patch or ER injection to maintain coverage. For PONV, choose based on availability and patient risk, using guideline doses and combining with dexamethasone when indicated. For IBS-D, reserve alosetron for severe, refractory cases with REMS compliance, and consider ondansetron for stool form improvement where available and appropriate [^116N56UT] [^114E7niq] [^117WjVPn] [^112aKzk9]. But wait, what if cost or access is a constraint? Given therapeutic equivalence for acute CINV and PONV, formulary and route preferences can reasonably drive agent selection without sacrificing efficacy [^112wmxZz] [^115yBYuq].

> Final clinical take-home: 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are the cornerstone antiemetics for CINV, PONV, and RINV, with broadly similar efficacy across first-generation agents and meaningful advantages for palonosetron in delayed CINV. Selection should integrate emetic risk category, regimen duration, patient comorbidities including QT risk and hepatic function, pediatric versus adult status, and practical considerations like formulation and drug–drug interactions, while remembering that combination regimens consistently outperform monotherapy in moderate-to-high emetic risk settings [^114hwTqL] [^112PYnCK] [^117WjVPn].

5-HT3 receptor antagonists are the **first-line therapy** for acute chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) [^114hwTqL] and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) [^117WjVPn], with palonosetron favored for delayed CINV due to its longer half-life and higher receptor affinity [^115owfRw] [^117U8Djd]. They are also used for **radiation-induced nausea and vomiting** [^112PYnCK] and IBS-D [^112aKzk9], with alosetron and ramosetron showing efficacy but requiring caution due to rare ischemic colitis [^111LYsUh]. Common adverse effects include headache and constipation [^115J7ELP]; **QT prolongation** is a class risk, especially with dolasetron [^112U1sj1], so ECG monitoring is advised in at-risk patients [^112GSeKt]. Overall, 5-HT3 antagonists are effective and well tolerated, with selection guided by clinical context and safety profile [^114xWFob].

---

## Mechanism of action

5-HT3 receptors are ligand-gated ion channels [^111bUaUu] located on peripheral and central neurons, including vagal afferents and the area postrema. Serotonin released from enterochromaffin cells during chemotherapy or surgery activates these receptors, triggering the emetic reflex [^114HhzZ7] [^111mYZ3z]. Antagonists **block these receptors**, preventing emesis [^111mYZ3z] [^117WjVPn].

---

## Clinical indications

### Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV)

- **First-line therapy**: 5-HT3 antagonists are standard for acute CINV [^115owfRw], especially with highly emetogenic chemotherapy [^116N56UT].
- **Delayed CINV**: Palonosetron is preferred for delayed emesis due to its longer half-life and higher receptor affinity [^115owfRw] [^117U8Djd].
- **Combination therapy**: Often combined with dexamethasone and NK1 antagonists (e.g. aprepitant) for enhanced efficacy [^114E7niq] [^116N56UT].

---

### Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV)

Standard prophylaxis includes 5-HT3 antagonists — particularly ondansetron, granisetron, and palonosetron — given their **proven efficacy** [^111mYZ3z] [^115yBYuq]. Combination therapy with dexamethasone or NK1 antagonists further improves outcomes [^116Aknjg].

---

### Radiation-induced nausea and vomiting

Prophylaxis is recommended for **moderate- to high-risk radiation fields** (e.g. total body, upper abdomen) using 5-HT3 antagonists [^112PYnCK] [^112ZhUKW].

---

### Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D)

Alosetron and ramosetron reduce **bowel frequency, urgency, and abdominal pain** in IBS-D [^113r1AM9]. However, rare ischemic colitis has been reported with alosetron, so careful patient selection and monitoring are required [^111LYsUh].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

| **Drug** | **Half-life (hours)** | **Route of administration** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Ondansetron | 3–6 | Oral, IV, IM | - Headache <br/> - Constipation <br/> - QT prolongation [^112GSeKt] |
| Granisetron | 9–12 | Oral, IV, transdermal | - Longer duration <br/> - Transdermal patch available [^113VPKqc] |
| Palonosetron | 40 | IV | - High affinity <br/> - Effective for delayed emesis [^115wz3U3] |
| Dolasetron | 7–9 | Oral, IV | - QT prolongation <br/> - Avoid in cardiac patients [^114xWFob] |
| Ramosetron | 5–9 | Oral, IV | - Effective for IBS-D <br/> - Limited availability [^notfound] |

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Common adverse effects**: Headache, constipation, dizziness, and fatigue [^115J7ELP].
- **QT prolongation**: Class effect, notably with dolasetron; avoid in patients with congenital long QT syndrome or concomitant QT-prolonging drugs [^112U1sj1] [^112GSeKt].
- **Serotonin syndrome**: Rare but possible, especially with SSRIs or SNRIs.
- **Pregnancy**: Ondansetron is commonly used for hyperemesis gravidarum, but data on safety are mixed; use cautiously.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **ASCO**: 5-HT3 antagonists are first-line for acute CINV and PONV; palonosetron preferred for delayed CINV [^114hwTqL] [^112mxgXa].
- **NCCN**: Similar recommendations, emphasizing combination therapy for high emetic risk [^114xJnWf].
- **PONV guidelines**: Recommend multimodal prophylaxis, including 5-HT3 antagonists with dexamethasone or NK1 antagonists [^116Aknjg].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Delayed CINV remains inadequately controlled, necessitating **combination strategies** [^116xpTBk]. Individual variability in response and tolerability requires tailored therapy, and rare but serious adverse effects (e.g. QT prolongation, ischemic colitis) necessitate vigilance [^112U1sj1] [^111LYsUh].

---

5-HT3 receptor antagonists are **effective and well tolerated** for acute CINV, PONV, and radiation-induced emesis, with palonosetron favored for delayed CINV. They also have a role in IBS-D, but safety considerations — particularly QT prolongation — guide agent selection and monitoring.

### 5-HT2C receptor blockade reverses SSRI-associated basal ganglia dysfunction and potentiates therapeutic efficacy [^114wXfgp]. Molecular Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Serotonin (5-HT) selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used in the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders, but responsiveness is uncertain and side effects often lead to discontinuation. Side effect profiles suggest that SSRIs reduce dopaminergic (DAergic) activity, but specific mechanistic insight is missing. Here we show in mice that SSRIs impair motor function by acting on 5-HT2C receptors in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), which in turn inhibits nigra pars compacta (SNc) DAergic neurons. SSRI-induced motor deficits can be reversed by systemic or SNr-localized 5-HT2C receptor antagonism. SSRIs induce SNr hyperactivity and SNc hypoactivity that can also be reversed by systemic 5-HT2C receptor antagonism. Optogenetic inhibition of SNc DAergic neurons mimics the motor deficits due to chronic SSRI treatment, whereas local SNr 5-HT2C receptor antagonism or optogenetic activation of SNc DAergic neurons reverse SSRI-induced motor deficits. Lastly, we find that 5-HT2C receptor antagonism potentiates the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of SSRIs. Together our findings demonstrate opposing roles for 5-HT2C receptors in the effects of SSRIs on motor function and affective behavior, highlighting the potential benefits of 5-HT2C receptor antagonists for both reduction of motor side effects of SSRIs and augmentation of therapeutic antidepressant and anxiolytic effects.

The quality of the clinical trials included in this review was considered to be strong or moderate overall. However, one study had small sample size (n = 9) due to it being a subset of a larger study that was terminated early by the sponsor for non-safety-related issues. Quality assessments were not carried out on preclinical rodent studies as the availability of standardized quality assessment for use in animal studies is lacking.

Hence, the efficacy of the triple therapy was sustained through all six cycles, unlike that of the 5HT 3 antagonist plus dexamethasone standard therapy, which further decreased. The benefit of triple therapy over standard therapy was clinically apparent as an almost two-fold increase (from 34 to 59%) in a patient's chance of remaining free of emesis and of the need for rescue medication during all of 5 days post-treatment and through six cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

### Palonosetron hydrochloride (Aloxi) [^115wz3U3]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

ALOXI is a serotonin subtype 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist indicated for:

- Moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy — prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses (1.1)

- Highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy — prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses (1.1)

- Prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) for up to 24 hours following surgery. Efficacy beyond 24 hours has not been demonstrated (1.2)

1.1 Chemotherapy Induced Nausea and Vomiting

ALOXI is indicated for:

- Moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy — prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses

- Highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy — prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses

1.2 Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting

ALOXI is indicated for:

- Prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) for up to 24 hours following surgery. Efficacy beyond 24 hours has not been demonstrated.

As with other antiemetics, routine prophylaxis is not recommended in patients in whom there is little expectation that nausea and/or vomiting will occur postoperatively. In patients where nausea and vomiting must be avoided during the postoperative period, ALOXI is recommended even where the incidence of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting is low.

### Comparative safety and effectiveness of serotonin receptor antagonists in patients undergoing chemotherapy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112PvgK8]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

From this study, we conclude that most 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists alone or combined with steroids decrease the occurrence of nausea and/or vomiting. Most 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists were relatively safe when compared with each other, yet none of the studies compared active treatment with placebo for harms. Dolasetron + dexamethasone may prolong the QTc compared to ondansetron + dexamethasone. Additional studies are needed to characterize the cardiac and cognitive safety of these treatments. Until then, it would be prudent for clinicians to obtain baseline electrocardiographic tracings before prescribing these common, effective antiemetics to any patients who are undergoing chemotherapy.

### Do atypical antipsychotic drugs reduce the risk of ischemic heart disease and mortality? Possible role of 5-HT2A receptor blockade [^115Pxa1N]. Schizophrenia Research (2010). Low credibility.

A recent Finnish study reported that long-term cumulative exposure to any antipsychotic treatment was related to lower mortality than was no drug exposure. We hypothesize that the antipsychotic 5-HT2A receptor blockade might protect from ischemic heart disease and buffer the deleterious metabolic effects of antipsychotics. The 5-HT2A receptor may be involved in vascular smooth muscle contraction, coronary artery spasms, platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. 5-HT2A receptor blockade might protect from ischemic heart disease by decreasing platelet aggregation and myocardium hypertrophy. Long-term follow-up studies are needed to clearly establish the long-term contribution of the various antipsychotic drugs to ischemic heart disease, and to explore our hypothesis that 5-HT2A receptor blockade may be protective for cardiovascular disease.

### The role of serotonin in cognitive function: evidence from recent studies and implications for understanding depression [^113So2Ad]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Symptoms of cognitive impairment such as poor concentration, memory loss and difficulty with decision making are prevalent in patients with depression, but currently are not specific targets for treatment. However, patients can continue to demonstrate cognitive impairments even when apparently clinically recovered. Drugs that potentiate serotonin (5-HT) function, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are the mainstay of treatment for depression. Nevertheless, our understanding of the effects of SSRIs and other conventional antidepressant therapy on cognitive function in healthy humans and depressed patients remains limited.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to provide a concise overview for clinicians on the impact of pharmacological manipulation of 5-HT on cognitive function in healthy humans with additional reference to animal models where human data are lacking, particularly regarding specific 5-HT receptor subtype modulation.

Findings

The most consistent observation following manipulation of serotonin levels in humans is that low extracellular 5-HT levels are associated with impaired memory consolidation. Preclinical data show that agonism and antagonism at specific 5-HT receptors can exert effects in animal models of cognition.

Conclusions

Larger, consistently designed studies are needed to understand the roles of 5-HT in cognition in healthy and depressed individuals. Efforts to target specific 5-HT receptors to improve cognitive outcomes are warranted.

### 5-HT ₃ receptor antagonists for prevention of late acute-onset emesis [^114ksBEw]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the currently available literature on the efficacy of the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists in the prevention of late acute-onset chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (12–24 h after cytotoxic treatment).

Data Sources

Primary articles were identified by PubMed search (performed in March 2004) and through secondary sources. Search terms included granisetron, ondansetron, tropisetron, dolasetron, acute, chemotherapy, nausea, and vomiting (a further search was performed for palonosetron in March 2004).

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All studies that performed regular assessments (every 2–6 h) of antiemetic control over the first 24 hours with 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

Current guidelines recommend the use of 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists for the control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting but do not differentiate between the available agents. However, there is variability in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of these agents, and this has implications for dosing regimen, safety, efficacy, and potential drug-drug interactions. Cytotoxic agents vary in the time profile of their emetic effect; this must be considered when choosing an appropriate 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist. The optimal agent should be simple to administer and provide safe and effective antiemetic protection over the whole 24-hour period.

Conclusions

The differences between the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists have important consequences for their dosing and efficacy in the control of late acute-onset chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.

### 5HT3-receptor antagonists as antiemetics in cancer [^1157WM8q]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2005). Low credibility.

Effective antiemetic therapy is crucial for patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy for cancer. Severe nausea and vomiting associated with such cancer treatment can lead to anxiety, anorexia, dehydration, electrolyte disturbance and renal failure, and may interrupt cancer therapy, demoralise patients or even cause them to abandon treatment. In 1992, we welcomed the introduction of ondansetron, the first selective serotonin type 3- (5HT3-) receptor antagonist marketed in the UK, as an important advance in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Several selective 5HT3-receptor antagonists are now licensed. They are widely prescribed to patients receiving cancer treatment, but not always appropriately. Here we review their optimal use.

### Comparative effectiveness of 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor antagonists in irritable bowel syndrome: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies [^112aKzk9]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, the results of this NWM show that 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists play an important role in improving the debilitating symptoms related to NC-IBS, in particular IBS-D, given the associated urgency and episodic incontinence. These findings are expected to be taken into account when considering therapeutic options for IBS. However, since there are a number of questions still to be answered, well-designed RCTs are needed to confirm the efficacy, safety profile and optimal dose of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists in IBS patients.

Summary Box

What is already known:

There is evidence demonstrating the beneficial effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor (5-HT 3) antagonists for the treatment of non-constipated irritable bowel syndrome (NC-IBS)
The effectiveness of alosetron, cilansetron, ondansetron and ramosetron has been assessed in randomized control clinical trials in comparison to control regimens (placebo and mebeverine)
Currently the comparative effectiveness of all 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists in patients with NC-IBS is lacking

What the new findings are:

This network meta-analysis showed that all 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists performed better in comparison to control regimens
Alosetron showed the best performance for global symptom improvement, cilansetron showed the best performance for abdominal pain/discomfort, and ondansetron was by far the best choice for improvement in bowel habits/consistency, in comparison to other 5-HT 3 antagonists and also to control regimens (mebeverine and placebo), which represented the least efficacious regimens
Consequently, this class of drugs may play an important role in improving the debilitating symptoms in NC-IBS patients, in particular those with diarrhea

### Comparative effectiveness of 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor antagonists in irritable bowel syndrome: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies [^114UZcAu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There is evidence demonstrating the beneficial effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor antagonists (5-HT 3) for the treatment of non-constipated irritable bowel syndrome (NC-IBS). We aimed to determine the comparative effectiveness of 5-HT 3 antagonists in NC-IBS, as evidenced by the results of a network meta-analysis (NWM) of published relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Methods

We searched the PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases for relevant RCTs through September 2020 and data from each selected RCT were extracted. A Bayesian NWM was then performed to investigate the efficacy of 5-HT 3 antagonists and to explore the effectiveness rank order in treating NC-IBS patients.

Results

Twenty-one eligible RCTs were identified and entered into this NWM. They included a total of 10,421 NC-IBS patients, randomized to alosetron, cilansetron, ondansetron, ramosetron, placebo, and mebeverine. The cumulative ranking probability for each intervention at the end of treatment period, was evaluated by means of surfaces under cumulative ranking (SUCRA) values. These results showed that alosetron had the best performance for global symptom improvement (SUCRA 0.82), cilansetron showed the best performance (SUCRA 0.90) for abdominal pain/discomfort improvement, while ondansetron (SUCRA 0.98) was by far the best choice concerning bowel habits/consistency improvement. The control regimens (mebeverine and placebo) represented the least efficacious interventions.

Conclusions

This NWM showed that 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists performed better in comparison to control drugs. Consequently, this class of drugs may play an important role in improving the debilitating symptoms in NC-IBS patients, in particular those with diarrhea.

### Granisetron: relating pharmacology to clinical efficacy [^115sFSDE]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

The 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonists, which are regarded as the 'antiemetic gold-standard', are used for prophylaxis against chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced emesis. At equally effective doses, the 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonists have been shown to demonstrate broadly equivalent clinical antiemetic activity and safety. However, the pharmacology of granisetron suggests that it may have an improved side-effect and tolerability profile, a lower risk of drug interactions and a longer duration of action than other 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonists. The high affinity of granisetron, coupled with the insurmountable antagonism displayed at 5-HT(3) receptors, is thought to underlie its good clinical efficacy.

### Factors influencing the choice of 5-HT ₃-receptor antagonist antiemetics: focus on elderly cancer patients [^111JDUs2]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

With old age comes declining organ function, cognitive impairment, increased likelihood of comorbid conditions and multiple prescription and nonprescription pharmacotherapy. These issues are particularly relevant in elderly cancer patients, who commonly receive combination chemotherapy and supportive care agents along with radiation therapy and surgery. This situation can complicate medical care, particularly since over half of all cancers occur in those aged over 65 years. The 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonists as a class are highly effective antiemetics and are currently considered the gold standard for treatment of chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. However, these agents do possess different pharmacologic properties, such as varying terminal half lives, routes of metabolism and selectivity for 5-HT(3) receptors. These differences may have an impact on efficacy (e.g., duration of action of the drug) safety (e.g., the risk of drug interactions and potential adverse effects), and simplicity of the dosing regimen. The focus of this review is on some of the pertinent issues of 5-HT(3) antagonists relating to elderly cancer patients.

### American Society of Clinical Oncology guideline for antiemetics in oncology: update 2006 [^116fzwMY]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To update the 1999 American Society of Clinical Oncology guideline for antiemetics in oncology.

Update Methodology

The Update Committee completed a review and analysis of data published from 1998 thru February 2006. The literature review focused on published randomized controlled trials, and systematic reviews and meta-analyses of published phase II and phase III randomized controlled trials.

Recommendations

The three-drug combination of a 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT(3)) serotonin receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, and aprepitant is recommended before chemotherapy of high emetic risk. For persons receiving chemotherapy of high emetic risk, there is no group of patients for whom agents of lower therapeutic index are appropriate first-choice antiemetics. These agents should be reserved for patients intolerant of or refractory to 5-HT3 serotonin receptor antagonists, neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists, and dexamethasone. The three-drug combination of a 5-HT3 receptor serotonin antagonist, dexamethasone, and aprepitant is recommended for patients receiving an anthracycline and cyclophosphamide. For patients receiving other chemotherapy of moderate emetic risk, the Update Committee continues to recommend the two-drug combination of a 5-HT3 receptor serotonin antagonist and dexamethasone. In all patients receiving cisplatin and all other agents of high emetic risk, the two-drug combination of dexamethasone and aprepitant is recommended for the prevention of delayed emesis. The Update Committee no longer recommends the combination of a 5-HT3 serotonin receptor antagonist and dexamethasone for the prevention of delayed emesis after chemotherapeutic agents of high emetic risk. CONCLUSION The Update Committee recommends that clinicians administer antiemetics while considering patients' emetic risk categories and other characteristics.

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^117WjVPn]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

5-HT3 receptor antagonists for vomiting prevention — An analysis found 10 out of 28 single drugs lowered the risk of vomiting, and three of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (RAs) included ramosetron, granisetron, and ondansetron. Tropisetron was ranked as one of the ten most clinically effective single drugs compared to placebo but had a lower certainty of evidence, while palonosetron was minimally effective with also a lower certainty of evidence. The recommended and high doses of granisetron, ondansetron, and tropisetron were similarly effective but more effective than lower doses of each agent; therefore, the use of recommended doses of these drugs should be adequate for vomiting prevention, though the 5-HT3 RA's class of drugs increased the risk of headache.

### Prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea: the role of neurokinin-1 (NK) receptor antagonists [^113uFxo2]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

International guidelines recommendations

Recommendations for CINV prophylaxis have been defined in the MASCC/ESMO, American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and NCCN guidelines. These recommendations are based on evidence from clinical studies in which the primary efficacy endpoint was most commonly CR and not a nausea-related outcome. CINV prophylaxis with the NK 1 RA–5-HT 3 RA–dexamethasone triplet combination is recommended for patients receiving AC and non-AC HEC by all three guidelines and for patients receiving carboplatin-based chemotherapy by MASCC/ESMO guidelines. In MEC-treated patients, the NK 1 RA–5-HT 3 RA–dexamethasone combination is also recommended for selected patients in accordance with clinician's decision by ASCO guidelines, and by NCCN guidelines in patients with further high-risk factors, or if previous 5-HT 3 RA–dexamethasone treatment has failed.

Regarding the choice of NK 1 RA, all four NK 1 RAs were gradually incorporated into international guidelines in a timely manner following their approval in the respective geographic regions. Currently, aprepitant/fosaprepitant and NEPA are recommended by all three guidelines, and rolapitant is included in recommendations by MASCC/ESMO and NCCN.

Future directions

Nausea control has become the top priority of current antiemetic research, to reach the final goal of "no nausea/no vomiting" after anticancer treatment. Progress in understanding the pathophysiology of nausea, and the design of clinical trials with nausea as primary efficacy endpoint should help determine the most effective antiemetic combination for nausea prevention.

The accurate measurement of nausea, both in clinical trials and in daily practice, remains a priority. While VAS and categorical scales (as documented in the MASCC antiemesis tool (MAT)) may provide reproducible and useful measurements, results are often documented inconsistently, and NSN or no nausea are not reported at times. We would advise that the VAS actual scores be reported and analyzed, rather than be categorized. These additional measures should improve the consistency of the data and could assist in statistical review. Reporting exact VAS scores for nausea and for individual items on the nausea domain of the FLIE questionnaire in all patients (including those for whom treatment has failed) would also aid in understanding the effect of antiemetics on patients' QoL as suggested by Andrews. Furthermore, strategies to improve patient-healthcare professional communication and use of tools that incorporate patient-reported outcomes to evaluate toxicity in cancer clinical trials may help prevent underreporting of nausea.

### Functional abdominal pain: time to get together and move forward [^113r1AM9]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Medium credibility.

Serotonin receptors on sensory afferents — serotonin increases firing in gastrointestinal sensory fibers via the serotonergic 5-HT3 receptor subtype, which is expressed on intramural terminals of both spinal and vagal sensory nerves; selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists such as alosetron block this action, the efficacy of alosetron for abdominal pain and discomfort in diarrhea-predominant IBS in women suggests overactive endogenous release and elevated serotonin, and hypersimulation may also result from weakened uptake by the serotonin transporter, which normally restricts serotonin accumulation at sensory neuron receptors.

### Ondansetron [^114HhzZ7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharmacodynamics:

Ondansetron is a selective 5-HT3receptor antagonist. While its mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, ondansetron is not a dopamine-receptor antagonist. Serotonin receptors of the 5-HT3type are present both peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is not certain whether ondansetron's antiemetic action is mediated centrally, peripherally, or in both sites. However, cytotoxic chemotherapy appears to be associated with release of serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine. In humans, urinary 5-HIAA (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid) excretion increases after cisplatin administration in parallel with the onset of emesis. The released serotonin may stimulate the vagal afferents through the 5-HT3receptors and initiate the vomiting reflex.

In animals, the emetic response to cisplatin can be prevented by pretreatment with an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis, bilateral abdominal vagotomy and greater splanchnic nerve section, or pretreatment with a serotonin 5-HT3receptor antagonist.

In normal volunteers, single intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron had no effect on esophageal motility, gastric motility, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, or small intestinal transit time. Multiday administration of ondansetron has been shown to slow colonic transit in normal volunteers. Ondansetron has no effect on plasma prolactin concentrations.

Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied.

### Psychotherapeutics and serotonin agonists and antagonists [^114JUdTH]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remains challenging for patients and practitioners. Current therapeutic choices include antidepressants and psychotherapy, which are thought to target central nervous system triggers of symptoms. Data supporting these treatments are reviewed. Therapeutic agents targeted at receptors in the enteric nervous system have recently been developed to act locally in the gut. Alosetron, an antagonist for serotonin-3 receptors, reduces intestinal motility, secretion, and possibly sensitivity. It is effective for diarrhea predominant IBS, although there are some potentially serious side effects. Tegaserod, a serotonin-4 receptor agonist, is a prokinetic agent that speeds small bowel transit and right colon transit in IBS, reducing symptoms of constipation, pain, and bloating. IBS symptoms are improved with integration of old and new therapies, combined with reassurance, education, and lifestyle adjustments.

### Current position of 5HT3 antagonists and the additional value of NK1 antagonists; a new class of antiemetics [^116wMVQo]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

5HT 3 ANTAGONISTS ANTIEMETIC EFFICACY IS NOT MAINTAINED OVER REPEATED CYCLES

It is well recognised that the chance to develop nausea and vomiting increases with each subsequent cycle of chemotherapy. Part of this can be explained by anticipatory mechanisms. With each additional cycle, a patient may have a protection failure on that occasion. A patient who has experienced post-treatment nausea and emesis more than once or twice is prone to develop anticipatory symptoms, and will suffer from emesis again in the next cycles.

Several studies have demonstrated that indeed, and despite the use of 5HT 3 antagonist plus dexamethasone, with each subsequent cycle of chemotherapy, emesis protection decreases. In the largest study in 125 patients receiving six cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy, despite dual therapy with granisetron and dexamethasone both in the acute and the delayed period, the initial complete acute emesis protection decreased from 66 to 39%, and for delayed emesis, the initial complete protection of 52% decreased to 43, or 21% in the sixth cycle, depending on the type of statistical analysis. In this study, it was also found that unsuccessful delayed emesis protection adversely influenced acute emesis protection in subsequent cycles of chemotherapy. If delayed emesis protection is not improved, most patients will develop emesis, and in due course both in the acute and in the delayed phase.

### Current position of 5HT3 antagonists and the additional value of NK1 antagonists; a new class of antiemetics [^116xpTBk]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

The advent of the 5HT 3 receptor antagonists (5HT 3 antagonists) in the 1990 s and the combination with dexamethasone has resulted in acute emesis protection in 70% of patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. Despite complete protection in the acute phase, however, 40% of patients as yet have symptoms in the delayed phase. 5HT 3 antagonists and dexamethasone are only modestly effective in this delayed phase. Moreover, the antiemetic protection over repeated cycles is not sustained. Neurokinine 1 receptor antagonists (NK 1 antagonists) belong to a new class of antiemetic agents that specifically target the NK 1 receptor, which is involved in both the acute and, particularly, the delayed phase of emesis. Clinical studies have demonstrated that the addition of NK 1 antagonists to dual therapy with a 5HT 3 antagonist plus dexamethasone improves the acute emesis protection by a further 10–15%. In the delayed phase, the proportion of patients remaining free of emesis increases by even 20–30%. Since the effectiveness of this triplet combination was found to be sustained over six cycles of chemotherapy, the chance for an individual patient to remain completely protected during both the acute and the delayed phase over six chemotherapy cycles is nearly doubled.

### The 5-HT7 receptor system as a treatment target for mood and anxiety disorders: a systematic review [^115t7bXk]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Preclinical animal and preliminary human studies indicate that 5-HT7 antagonists have the potential as a new treatment approach for mood and anxiety disorders. In this systematic review, we aimed to review the relationship between the 5-HT7 receptor system and mood and anxiety disorders, and to explore the pharmacology and therapeutic potential of medications that target the 5-HT7 receptor for their treatment.

Methods

Medline, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PsycINFO databases, the National Institute of Health website Clinicaltrials.gov, controlled-trials.com, and relevant grey literature were used to search for original research articles, and reference lists of included articles were then hand searched.

Results

Sixty-four studies were included in the review: 52 animal studies and 12 human studies. Studies used a variety of preclinical paradigms and questionnaires to assess change in mood, and few studies examined sleep or cognition. Forty-four out of 47 (44/47) preclinical 5-HT7 modulation studies identified potential antidepressant effects and 20/23 studies identified potential anxiolytic effects. In clinical studies, 5/7 identified potential antidepressant effects in major depressive disorder, 1/2 identified potential anxiolytic effects in generalized anxiety disorder, and 3/3 identified potential antidepressant effects in bipolar disorders.

Conclusion

While there is some evidence that the 5-HT7 receptor system may be a potential target for treating mood and anxiety disorders, many agents included in the review also bind to other receptors. Further research is needed using drugs that bind specifically to 5-HT7 receptors to examine treatment proof of concept further.

### Comparative safety and effectiveness of serotonin receptor antagonists in patients undergoing chemotherapy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115E6hFa]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for 8.2 million deaths in 2012. Chemotherapy is a major component of cancer therapy. However chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) are common, affecting approximately 70–80% of patients who receive chemotherapy, and can be debilitating. CINV cause significant anxiety; decrease quality of life; and can result in dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and hospital admission.

Serotonin (5-HT 3) receptor antagonists are antiemetic medications that act by inhibiting the vagal nerves in the central nervous system and intestinal mucosa that trigger the emetic reflex. Examples of first-generation 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists include dolasetron, granisetron, and ondansetron, while palonosetron is a second-generation receptor antagonist. These treatments can be administered orally, subcutaneously, or intravenously. Previous systematic reviews have found that 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists are effective for treating nausea and vomiting that occur after chemotherapy. As such, 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists are recommended as the first-line of treatment for CINV in both adults and children.

Although 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists are effective in reducing nausea and vomiting, concerns have been raised that they may be associated with increased risk of arrhythmia. Some evidence suggests that they prolong the QT interval on electrocardiography, which is associated with an increased risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias (e.g. torsades de pointes). In vitro studies have indicated that 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists block voltage-dependent sodium channels and human ether-a-go-go-related gene potassium channels (cardiac ion channels), with the magnitude and type of electrocardiographic change depending on the particular drug. The US Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada (a division of the Canadian federal government) have published warnings on the safety of dolasetron but no warnings have appeared for other 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. Information about cardiac risks cannot be gleaned from previous systematic reviews of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists because cardiac safety was not examined in those studies. This systematic review was undertaken, at the request of Canadian policy-makers from Health Canada, to determine the comparative safety and effectiveness of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists for patients undergoing chemotherapy.

### Comparative safety of serotonin (5-HT ₃) receptor antagonists in patients undergoing surgery: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1123U2EM]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

We used an integrated knowledge translation approach, entailing collaboration between researchers and research users throughout the conduct of this study. The research users involved in this study who posed the original study question were from Health Canada.

Protocol

A protocol was developed and revised using feedback from the research team and the research users. We registered our protocol with PROSPERO (CRD42013003564) and published it in an open-access journal. Our methods are described briefly here; additional details can be found in the protocol publication. We originally intended to evaluate both safety and efficacy outcomes for patients undergoing surgery or chemotherapy; however, due to the enormous number of studies that met the inclusion criteria, we made slight changes to our protocol and subdivided the analyses. The current paper focuses on the safety of 5-HT 3 antagonists in patients undergoing surgery. Subsequent papers will examine the efficacy of 5-HT 3 antagonists for patients undergoing surgery, and the efficacy and safety of 5-HT 3 antagonists for patients undergoing chemotherapy.

Eligibility criteria

We included experimental (randomized clinical trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, non-RCTs), quasi-experimental (interrupted time series, controlled before–after studies), and observational (cohort) studies involving patients of any age undergoing any type of surgery who were given a 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist for nausea and/or vomiting. A list of the agents and relevant comparators that were investigated in the included studies can be found in Additional file 1: Appendix 1. The primary outcome was the number of patients experiencing arrhythmia, and secondary outcomes were QT prolongation, PR prolongation, delirium, and mortality (overall and sudden cardiac death). Given the large number of included studies we limited the review to those published in English. Studies suspected or identified as fraudulent were excluded.

Information sources

An experienced librarian executed searches of MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception until 11 January 2013. Unpublished studies were sought by searching trial protocol registries and conference proceedings.

Study selection and data collection

After a calibration exercise, the literature search results were screened by pairs of reviewers, working independently. The same approach was used to abstract data and appraise the quality of included studies. Conflicts at both the screening and the abstraction steps were resolved through discussion. When data was missing or clarification of published data was needed we contacted the authors.

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^113Mds4Z]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

5-HT3 antagonist combinations in postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) — Subgroup analysis showed that ondansetron and palonosetron demonstrated significant reduction in PONV (A1); pooled data from 12 RCTs of dexamethasone in addition to palonosetron demonstrated a marginal, albeit statistically significant reduction in rescue antiemetic requirements; palonosetron is also effective when used in combination with methylprednisolone; tropisetron in addition to dexamethasone was effective in reducing PONV in both thyroidectomy and gynecological procedures (A2); and ramosetron is also effective in combination with dexamethasone (A2).

### Consensus proposals for the prevention of acute and delayed vomiting and nausea following high-emetic-risk chemotherapy [^112f6GBS]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

This paper uses an evidence-based approach whenever possible to formulate recommendations, emphasizing the results of controlled trials concerning the best use of antiemetic agents. We address issues of dose, schedule, and route of administration of five selective 5-HT(3) antagonists. We conclude that for each of these five drugs, there is a plateau in therapeutic efficacy above which further dose escalation does not improve outcome. Furthermore, for all classes of antiemetic agents, a single dose is as effective as multiple doses or a continuous infusion. The oral route is as efficacious as the intravenous route of administration, even with chemotherapy of high emetic risk. Selective antagonists of the type 3 serotonin receptor (5-HT(3)) in combination with dexamethasone and aprepitant are the standard of care for the prevention of emesis following chemotherapy of high emetic risk.

### The cardiotoxic potential of the 5-HT (3) receptor antagonist antiemetics: is there cause for concern? [^116Wbs5J]. The Oncologist (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To review and evaluate the potential cardiac effects of 5-HT(3) antiemetic treatment in patients who may be predisposed to cardiac complications resulting from malignancy, cytotoxic oncologic regimens, or preexisting comorbid conditions.

Design

A literature review was conducted on the negative cardiovascular effects of chemotherapeutic agents, and, more specifically, on the cardiac interactions of the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists commonly used to treat chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.

Results

Clinical studies in healthy subjects have reported electrocardiograph changes following administration of 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists. However, there are limited data on the use of 5-HT(3) antiemetics when administered with cardiotoxic chemotherapy. Nonetheless, the development of significant electrocardiograph changes with some agents may indicate a potential for significant cardiac effects in patients, particularly those who may be predisposed to cardiac complication.

Conclusions

As the predicted human life span increases, clinicians will be treating a larger, older oncology population. Because two of the most common major comorbidities are cardiovascular related, we need to be acutely aware of the toxic effects of chemotherapy, as well as the possible cardiac interaction of supportive agents, specifically the 5-HT(3) antiemetics. Until more data are made available, the best antiemetic option for patients receiving emetogenic and cardiotoxic chemotherapy may be the agent with the fewest apparent cardiac effects.

### Potential role of the NK1 receptor antagonists in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting [^115hTTdo]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2001). Low credibility.

Better tolerated and more effective means of controlling chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting have been introduced over the past decade. Despite the progress made, incompletely controlled emesis is a persistent problem for significant numbers of patients receiving chemotherapy. Efforts to improve antiemetic control further are ongoing. The most interesting new class of antiemetics under development focuses on antagonism of the neurotransmitter substance P. Substance P exerts its effects by binding to the tachykinin neurokinin NK1 receptor. A number of selective antagonists of the NK1 receptor have been synthesized and, when used in preclinical models, have demonstrated an ability to antagonize the emetic effects of a number of stimuli, including chemotherapy agents such as cisplatin. Over the past 3 years, results of the initial studies evaluating this class of agents for cisplatin-induced emesis in cancer patients have begun to appear. These agents have been well tolerated. As single agents, they appear to be no more effective than 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in preventing acute cisplatin-induced emesis. Their real value may be found in combination with existing agents and in the treatment of delayed emesis. The results of ongoing clinical trials will hopefully define the utility and appropriate place for this new class of agents in the management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.

### Antiemetics: American Society of Clinical Oncology focused guideline update [^115r7fUg]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

To update a key recommendation of the American Society of Clinical Oncology antiemetic guideline. This update addresses the use of the oral combination of netupitant (a neurokinin 1 [NK1] receptor antagonist) and palonosetron (a 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 [5-HT3] receptor antagonist) for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting in patients receiving chemotherapy.

Methods

An update committee conducted a targeted systematic literature review and identified two phase III clinical trials and a randomized phase II dose-ranging study.

Results

In one phase III trial, the oral combination of netupitant and palonosetron was associated with higher complete response rates (no emesis and no rescue medications) compared with palonosetron alone in patients treated with anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide chemotherapy (74% v 67% overall; p = 0.001). In another phase III trial, the oral combination of netupitant and palonosetron was safe and effective across multiple cycles of moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapies. In the phase II dose-ranging study, each dose of netupitant (coadministered with palonosetron 0.50 mg) produced higher complete response rates than palonosetron alone among patients receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The highest dose of netupitant (ie, 300 mg) was most effective.

Recommendations

All patients who receive highly emetogenic chemotherapy regimens (including anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide) should be offered a three-drug combination of an NK1 receptor antagonist, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, and dexamethasone. The oral combination of netupitant and palonosetron plus dexamethasone is an additional treatment option in this setting. The remaining recommendations from the 2011 ASCO guideline are unchanged pending a full update. Additional information is available at www.asco.org/guidelines/antiemetics and www.asco.org/guidelineswiki.

### Consensus recommendations for the prevention of vomiting and nausea following high-emetic-risk chemotherapy [^112DPBwz]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

In this update of our 2005 document, we used an evidence-based approach whenever possible to formulate recommendations, emphasizing the results of controlled trials concerning the best use of antiemetic agents for the prevention of emesis and nausea following anticancer chemotherapies of high emetic risk. A three-drug combination of a 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptor (5-HT(3)) receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, and aprepitant beginning before chemotherapy and continuing for up to 4 days remains the standard of care. We address issues of dose, schedule, and route of administration of five selective 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists. We conclude that, for each of these five drugs, there is a plateau in therapeutic efficacy above which further dose escalation does not improve outcome. In trials designed to prove the equivalence of palonosetron to ondansetron and granisetron, palonosetron proved superior in emesis prevention, while adverse effects were comparable. Furthermore, for all classes of antiemetic agents, a single dose is as effective as multiple doses or a continuous infusion. The oral route is as efficacious as the intravenous route of administration.

### Serotonin and its role in colonic function and in gastrointestinal disorders [^111Tq2Nb]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2007). Low credibility.

Serotonin (5-HT) is most commonly thought of as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. However, the predominant site of serotonin synthesis, storage, and release is the enterochromaffin cells of the intestinal mucosa. Within the intestinal mucosa, serotonin released from EC cells activates neural reflexes associated with intestinal secretion, motility, and sensation. Two important receptors for serotonin that are located in the neural circuitry of the intestines are the 5-HT(3) and 5-HT(4) receptors; these are the targets of drugs designed to treat gastrointestinal disorders. 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists are used to treat nausea and emesis associated with chemotherapy and for functional disorders associated with diarrhea. 5-HT(4) receptor agonists are used as promotility agents to promote gastric emptying and to alleviate constipation. Because of the importance of serotonin in normal gut function and sensation, a number of studies have investigated potential changes in mucosal serotonin signaling in pathologic conditions. Despite the inconsistencies in the current literature, changes in serotonin signaling have now been demonstrated in inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome, and idiopathic constipation. Emerging evidence has led to many contradictory theories regarding serotonin signaling and its roles in the pathology of gut disorders. This review summarizes the current medications affecting serotonin signaling and provides an overview of our current knowledge of the changes in serotonin that occur in pathologic conditions.

### Comparative safety and effectiveness of serotonin receptor antagonists in patients undergoing chemotherapy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112U1sj1]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although serotonin (5-HT 3) receptor antagonists are effective in reducing nausea and vomiting, they may be associated with increased cardiac risk. Our objective was to examine the comparative safety and effectiveness of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists (e.g. dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron, palonosetron, tropisetron) alone or combined with steroids for patients undergoing chemotherapy.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception until December 2015 for studies comparing 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists with each other or placebo in chemotherapy patients. The search results were screened, data were abstracted, and risk of bias was appraised by pairs of reviewers, independently. Random-effects meta-analyses and network meta-analyses (NMAs) were conducted.

Results

After screening 9226 citations and 970 full-text articles, we included 299 studies (n = 58,412 patients). None of the included studies reported harms for active treatment versus placebo. For NMAs on the risk of arrhythmia (primary outcome; three randomized controlled trials [RCTs], 627 adults) and mortality (secondary outcome; eight RCTs, 4823 adults), no statistically significant differences were observed between agents. A NMA on the risk of QTc prolongation showed a significantly greater risk for dolasetron + dexamethasone versus ondansetron + dexamethasone (four RCTs, 3358 children and adults, odds ratio 2.94, 95% confidence interval 2.13–4.17).

For NMAs on the number of patients without nausea (44 RCTs, 11,664 adults, 12 treatments), number of patients without vomiting (63 RCTs, 15,460 adults, 12 treatments), and number of patients without chemotherapy-induced nausea or vomiting (27 RCTs, 10,924 adults, nine treatments), all agents were significantly superior to placebo. For a NMA on severe vomiting (10 RCTs, 917 adults), all treatments decreased the risk, but only ondansetron and ramosetron were significantly superior to placebo. According to a rank-heat plot with the surface under the cumulative ranking curve results, palonosetron + steroid was ranked the safest and most effective agent overall.

Conclusions

Most 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists were relatively safe when compared with each other, yet none of the studies compared active treatment with placebo for harms. However, dolasetron + dexamethasone may prolong the QTc compared to ondansetron + dexamethasone. All agents were effective for reducing risk of nausea, vomiting, and chemotherapy-induced nausea or vomiting.

### The 5-HT7 receptor system as a treatment target for mood and anxiety disorders: a systematic review [^115jhYT9]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background:

Preclinical animal and preliminary human studies indicate that 5-HT7 antagonists have the potential as a new treatment approach for mood and anxiety disorders. In this systematic review, we aimed to review the relationship between the 5-HT7 receptor system and mood and anxiety disorders, and to explore the pharmacology and therapeutic potential of medications that target the 5-HT7 receptor for their treatment.

Methods:

Medline, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PsycINFO databases, the National Institute of Health website Clinicaltrials.gov, controlled-trials.com, and relevant grey literature were used to search for original research articles, and reference lists of included articles were then hand searched.

Results:

Sixty-four studies were included in the review: 52 animal studies and 12 human studies. Studies used a variety of preclinical paradigms and questionnaires to assess change in mood, and few studies examined sleep or cognition. Forty-four out of 47 (44/47) preclinical 5-HT7 modulation studies identified potential antidepressant effects and 20/23 studies identified potential anxiolytic effects. In clinical studies, 5/7 identified potential antidepressant effects in major depressive disorder, 1/2 identified potential anxiolytic effects in generalized anxiety disorder, and 3/3 identified potential antidepressant effects in bipolar disorders.

Conclusion:

While there is some evidence that the 5-HT7 receptor system may be a potential target for treating mood and anxiety disorders, many agents included in the review also bind to other receptors. Further research is needed using drugs that bind specifically to 5-HT7 receptors to examine treatment proof of concept further.

### Are all 5-HT ₃ receptor antagonists the same? [^112wmxZz]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2007). Low credibility.

The 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists have become the cornerstone for preventing and treating chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Four 5-HT3 antagonists are commercially available in the United States, and numerous reports have been published comparing 2 or more agents. The studies ranged from randomized, double-blinded to open-label or retrospective trials; included chemotherapy-naïve and -non-naïve patients; and covered a range of doses and routes of administration with and without concomitant steroids, for preventing and treating nausea and vomiting after highly and moderately high emetogenic chemotherapy. With few exceptions, the studies uniformly show an equivalent efficacy rate and side effect profile among the various agents at equivalent doses. This article reviews the pharmacology of the class for insight into minor differences among the agents that could possibly influence drug selection for certain patients, and considers data on the absorption, half-life, metabolism, and receptor activity. Clinical trials support the claim of various guidelines that the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are therapeutically similar in safety and efficacy, particularly because the current best practice for preventing nausea and vomiting after highly and moderately high emetogenic chemotherapy is a combination of a 5-HT3 antagonist, steroids, and aprepitant.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition 2025 guidelines for management of cyclic vomiting syndrome in children [^115qhuV8]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Abortive interventions (pharmacological) — The guideline panel recommends using antimigraine agents (e.g. NSAIDs, triptans) for treatment of acute cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) episodes in children and adolescents with a personal or family history of migraine (strong recommendation, moderate certainty in the evidence of effects). The guideline panel suggests using NK1-receptor antagonist (i.e., aprepitant) for treatment of acute CVS episodes in children and adolescents (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence of effects), and acute treatment with NK1 receptor antagonist should be continued for 3 consecutive days. The guideline panel suggests using 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (i.e., ondansetron) for treatment of acute CVS episodes in children and adolescents (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence of effects).

### Serotonin receptor antagonists for highly emetogenic chemotherapy in adults [^117U8Djd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Serotonin receptor antagonists (5-HT(3) RAs) are used to control chemotherapy-induced emesis. Although they have the same general mechanism of action (blockade of serotonin receptors), they have different chemical structures and may have different effects.

Objectives

To compare efficacy of different serotonin receptor antagonists (5-HT(3) RAs) in the control of acute and delayed emesis induced by highly emetogenic chemotherapy.

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL, the Specialised Register of the Cochrane PaPaS Group, PubMed, EMBASE, and LILACS databases. Our most recent search was in March 2009.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing 5-HT(3) RAs in an adult cancer population.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted information from the included studies on the control of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting, either as a single or a combined outcome. Where appropriate, we combined the results of similar trials. We carried out sensitivity and subgroup analyses to test the robustness of our findings.

Main Results

We included 16 randomised trials (7808 participants). Nine of the trials compared granisetron versus ondansetron. No other drug comparison was studied in more than one trial. The meta-analyses of the granisetron versus ondansetron trials found similar results for the two drugs on acute vomiting (eight trials, 4256 participants, odds ratio (OR) 0.89; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.02), acute nausea (seven trials, 4160 participants, OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.10), delayed vomiting (three trials, 1119 participants, OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.34) and delayed nausea (two trials, 1024 participants, OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.24). Granisetron and ondansetron showed similar effects on headache and diarrhoea, with the possible exception of less constipation associated with ondansetron. One study of 1114 participants comparing palonosetron plus dexamethasone versus granisetron plus dexamethasone showed superiority of palonosetron in controlling delayed vomiting (OR 1.45; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.85) and delayed nausea (OR 1.63; 95% CI 1.27 to 2.10). Complete response for delayed nausea and vomiting was also in favour of the combination palonosetron and dexamethasone (OR 1.63; 95% CI 1.29 to 2.07).

Authors' Conclusions

Ondansetron and granisetron appear to be equivalent drugs for the prevention of acute and delayed emesis following the use of highly emetogenic chemotherapy. According to one single trial the combination of palonosetron and dexamethasone was superior to granisetron and dexamethasone in controlling delayed emesis. However, more evidence is needed before palonosetron could become the candidate 5-HT(3) RA for the control of delayed emesis induced by highly emetogenic chemotherapy.

### CINV: still troubling patients after all these years [^114GikQZ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Progress in CINV prophylaxis

Prior to the 1990s, antiemetic therapy consisted primarily of dopamine receptor antagonists such as metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, and haloperidol, and the use of glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone. Most of the research was aimed at reducing emesis during the acute phase (0 to 24 h after chemotherapy) for newly emerging, highly emetogenic chemotherapeutic agents, including high-dose cisplatin. The 1990s ushered in the development and approval of serotonin receptor antagonists and drastically improved the treatment of acute chemotherapy-induced emesis. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have a chemical structure similar to serotonin and bind to the same site on the 5-HT3 receptor, blocking its activation. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron in 1991 as prophylaxis for chemotherapy-induced emesis and approved granisetron and dolasetron for the same indication in 1997. That same year, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) first published guidelines for the management of CINV, followed shortly by guidelines from the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/European Society for Medical Oncology (MASCC/ESMO) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO).

The next landmark advance in CINV management came in 2003 with the approval of the second-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonist palonosetron and the NK-1 receptor antagonist aprepitant. Compared to the first-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, palonosetron has a higher binding affinity to the 5-HT3 receptor and a half-life of 40 h versus 4 h, 7.3 h, and 9 h for ondansetron, dolasetron, and granisetron, respectively. The chemical structure of palonosetron differs from the first-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and this inhibitor not only blocks serotonin binding in an allosteric fashion but also leads to internalization of the 5-HT3 receptor and prevention of crosstalk with NK-1 receptors. These characteristics may contribute to its increased efficacy against both acute and delayed emesis compared to the first-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonists.

CURRENT ROLE OF 5HT 3 ANTAGONISTS PLUS DEXAMETHASONE; ACUTE PHASE

Before the advent of the 5HT 3 antagonists, nausea and vomiting were ranked as the two most distressing side effects of systemic chemotherapy. The use of 5HT 3 antagonists (ondansetron, granisetron and tropisetron) has provided complete acute emesis protection in 50–70% of patients receiving a first cycle of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The addition of dexamethasone to 5HT 3 antagonists has improved the complete protection rate by a further 10–15%, resulting in a total complete acute emesis protection in 65–80% of patients.

### Comparative efficacy of serotonin (5-HT ₃) receptor antagonists in patients undergoing surgery: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115yBYuq]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Serotonin (5-HT3) receptor antagonists are commonly used to decrease nausea and vomiting for surgery patients. We conducted a systematic review on the comparative efficacy of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists.

Methods

Searches were done in MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify studies comparing 5-HT3 receptor antagonists with each other, placebo, and/or combined with other antiemetic agents for patients undergoing surgical procedures. Screening search results, data abstraction, and risk of bias assessment were conducted by two reviewers independently. Random-effects pairwise meta-analysis and network meta-analysis (NMA) were conducted. PROSPERO registry number: CRD42013003564.

Results

Overall, 450 studies and 80,410 patients were included after the screening of 7,608 citations and 1,014 full-text articles. Significantly fewer patients experienced nausea with any drug relative to placebo, except for ondansetron plus metoclopramide in a NMA including 195 RCTs and 24,230 patients. Significantly fewer patients experienced vomiting with any drug relative to placebo except for palonosetron plus dexamethasone in NMA including 238 RCTs and 12,781 patients. All agents resulted in significantly fewer patients with postoperative nausea and vomiting versus placebo in a NMA including 125 RCTs and 16,667 patients.

Conclusions

Granisetron plus dexamethasone was often the most effective antiemetic, with the number needed to treat ranging from two to nine.

### 5-HT (3)-receptor antagonists for the treatment of nausea and vomiting: a reappraisal of their side-effect profile [^114xWFob]. The Oncologist (2002). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting can cause considerable distress and discomfort to patients undergoing chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery. Several classes of antiemetic agents exist to combat these side effects, though the 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonists have become the first-line treatment choice for many cancer patients and are considered the "gold standard" in antiemetic therapy. Compared with the older generation antiemetic drugs, 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonists are effective, well tolerated, and associated with few side effects. However, emerging differences among these agents suggest that the incidence and/or intensity of adverse events should not be regarded as a class effect. The side-effect profile of any supportive care therapy is particularly important in certain subgroups of patients, including pediatric patients and the elderly, as well as those suffering comorbid conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and renal or hepatic impairment. Indeed, dolasetron is associated with cardiovascular effects, and thus, should be used with extreme caution in patients who suffer from or may develop prolongation of cardiac conduction intervals. Ondansetron, on the other hand, is associated with a greater incidence of central nervous system side effects than either dolasetron or ondansetron, and pharmacokinetic parameters are affected in patients with hepatic impairment, thereby requiring dose adjustments. Clinicians are encouraged to evaluate patients on an individual basis when choosing which 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonist to prescribe.

### Comparative safety of serotonin (5-HT ₃) receptor antagonists in patients undergoing surgery: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116jugqj]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Serotonin (5-HT 3) receptor antagonists are a class of antiemetics recommended for patients undergoing surgery who are at risk for nausea and vomiting. Serotonin (5-HT 3) receptor antagonists reduce nausea and vomiting by inhibiting vagal nerves in the central nervous system and intestinal mucosa. However, some evidence suggests that 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists can increase the risk of cardiac harm in children undergoing chemotherapy. Adverse events associated with these medications include a decrease in heart rate and prolongation of the QT interval. We were commissioned by Health Canada, a department of the federal government, to determine the comparative safety of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists for patients of all ages undergoing surgery due to safety concerns regarding the 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists.

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^1168hGpu]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) treatment comparisons — Dose adjustments may not be needed when treating breakthrough PONV with the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists above the doses used for prophylaxis. Newer 5-HT3 agents did not show improved efficacy over ondansetron (A3, moderate certainty). Droperidol 1 to 1.25 mg has comparable efficacy as ondansetron at the recommended dose of 4 to 8 mg (A3, low certainty). Droperidol was found to be more effective than dexamethasone 8 mg and metoclopramide 10 mg (A3, low certainty). Metoclopramide 10 mg is significantly less effective than ondansetron and droperidol (A2, moderate certainty). Propofol 20–40 mg is effective as treatment for PONV (A3, low certainty).

### Getting it right the first time: recent progress in optimizing antiemetic usage [^115owfRw]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

5-HT3 receptor antagonists

The first-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, and tropisetron) revolutionized the management of CINV in terms of both efficacy and safety compared to historical antiemetics (e.g. metoclopramide). These agents exhibit comparable efficacy, preventing 50 to 80% of acute CINV in patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) or highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) regimens and are considered equivalent in CINV guidelines. Importantly, despite their efficacy against acute CINV, these agents are much less effective in prevention of delayed CINV.

In an effort to improve response to antiemetic therapy, the second-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonists palonosetron and APF530 were subsequently developed and are now approved for patients with CINV. Palonosetron has unique, advantageous pharmacodynamic properties, including a longer half-life and higher receptor binding affinity compared to the first-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. In addition, binding of palonosetron to the 5-HT3 receptor creates positive cooperativity that results in further palonosetron binding and eventual receptor internalization, blocking 5-HT3 signaling and preventing crosstalk with NK-1 receptor signaling. APF530 is a novel, extended-release, subcutaneous formulation of granisetron with a unique biochronomer delivery system that provides sustained release to improve the therapeutic concentration of granisetron over an extended period (> 5 days). Both palonosetron and APF530 demonstrate superior prevention of both acute and delayed CINV compared to the first-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonists.

### Update on GPCR-based targets for the development of novel antidepressants [^112mUnWe]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Monoaminergic neurotransmission is largely based on GPCR signaling. Since the major antidepressant classes affect the monoaminergic systems, they exert their actions either directly or indirectly through GPCRs. There is a delayed onset of therapeutic efficacy of monoamine-based antidepressants and the mechanism(s) underlying their antidepressant actions remain to be fully understood. There is evidence that the late onset therapeutic effects may be the outcome of transcriptional alterations in genes encoding proteins involved in synapse formation or neurogenesis. There is also data suggesting an important role of altered levels and posttranslational modifications of proteins regulating synaptic plasticity and neuronal firing. There are 14 5-HT receptors (13 which are GPCRs), 6 NE receptors and 5 DA receptors. 5-HT 1A receptors are critical in regulating 5-HT neurotransmission. The 5-HT 1A somatodendritic autoreceptor, which negatively controls 5-HT release, is an important target, since its blockade augments extracellular 5-HT levels, whereas postsynaptic 5-HT 1A receptors exert behavioral and neurogenic effects of fluoxetine. Accordingly, vilazodone is a combined 5-HT 1A partial agonist and an SSRI, and is used for the treatment of depression. Another compound that both inhibits 5-HT reuptake and targets 5-HT receptors is vortioxetine, which binds to 5-HT 1A (agonist, postsynaptic receptor selectivity), 5-HT 1B (partial agonist), and 5 HT 7 (antagonist) receptors along with ionotropic 5-HT 3 (antagonist) receptors. In addition to these 5-HT receptors, antagonism at 5-HT 2C receptors plays an important role in the antidepressant actions of mirtazapine and agomelatine. Agomelatine combines 5-HT 2C receptor antagonism with agonism at another GPCR, the melatonin MT 1 receptor and has antidepressant properties, along with beneficial effects on sleep, due to the restoration of circadian rhythmicity. Mirtazapine is also a NEergic α 2A autoreceptor antagonist and enhances fronto-cortical NEergic transmission to elevate mood.

Several studies have reported that DA D 2/3 agonists, some of which are used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, exert antidepressant actions.

### Comparative effectiveness of 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor antagonists in irritable bowel syndrome: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies [^117U6V5z]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There is evidence demonstrating the beneficial effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor antagonists (5-HT 3) for the treatment of non-constipated irritable bowel syndrome (NC-IBS). We aimed to determine the comparative effectiveness of 5-HT 3 antagonists in NC-IBS, as evidenced by the results of a network meta-analysis (NWM) of published relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Methods

We searched the PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases for relevant RCTs through September 2020 and data from each selected RCT were extracted. A Bayesian NWM was then performed to investigate the efficacy of 5-HT 3 antagonists and to explore the effectiveness rank order in treating NC-IBS patients.

Results

Twenty-one eligible RCTs were identified and entered into this NWM. They included a total of 10,421 NC-IBS patients, randomized to alosetron, cilansetron, ondansetron, ramosetron, placebo, and mebeverine. The cumulative ranking probability for each intervention at the end of treatment period, was evaluated by means of surfaces under cumulative ranking (SUCRA) values. These results showed that alosetron had the best performance for global symptom improvement (SUCRA 0.82), cilansetron showed the best performance (SUCRA 0.90) for abdominal pain/discomfort improvement, while ondansetron (SUCRA 0.98) was by far the best choice concerning bowel habits/consistency improvement. The control regimens (mebeverine and placebo) represented the least efficacious interventions.

Conclusions

This NWM showed that 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists performed better in comparison to control drugs. Consequently, this class of drugs may play an important role in improving the debilitating symptoms in NC-IBS patients, in particular those with diarrhea.

### Latest update on prevention of acute chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in pediatric cancer patients [^115J7ELP]. Current Oncology Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

The Evolution of Clinical Practice Guidelines for Prevention of CINV in Pediatrics

Prevention and management of CINV as an important supportive care goal came to the forefront in the late 1990s in adult medicine. This was based on multiple investigations that improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of chemotherapy-induced nausea, and specifically, the subsequent introduction of the 5-HT3 antagonists. Here, we first review the main classes of antiemetic drugs included in national CINV prevention guidelines.

5-HT3 Antagonists

There are several neurotransmitters involved in the pathophysiology of CINV, however, 5-HT (serotonin) has been shown to be the most important to date. In addition, of all the 5-HT receptors, selective antagonists of the 5-HT3 receptors are currently the single most effective class of antiemetics available for acute-phase CINV. There are five widely available 5-HT3 selective antagonists: ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, tropisetron, and a more recently introduced drug, palonosetron. Ondansetron was the first to be US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for adults in 1991, palonosetron was the most recent. 5-HT3 selective antagonists act on receptors present in both central nervous system targets such as the area postrema, and the peripheral nervous system such as vagal afferents in the intestine. They are a well-tolerated class of drugs, with no limiting toxicity at typical doses. The most common adverse events include headache and constipation. In addition, the oral and intravenous administrations are therapeutically equivalent.

### Molecular mechanism of setron-mediated inhibition of full-length 5-HTreceptor [^111bUaUu]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Previous 5-HT 3A R structures have all been homomeric receptors. Incorporation of the B subunit of the heteromeric receptor significantly alters channel activity. Compared to the homomeric channel, the heteromeric 5-HT 3AB R has a different serotonin dose–response curve, single-channel conductance, permeation properties, desensitization, Ca 2+ permeability, and pharmacology. However, knowledge of the structural contribution of this subunit to ligand-recognition and inhibition mechanisms is lacking. There is some indication that 5-HT 3A R may be more abundant in the central nervous system and the 5-HT 3AB R in the peripheral nervous system. Obtaining structures of heteromeric channels will open the door to answering questions related to ligand occupancy in the binding site and how many ligands must bind for the channel to activate. Our current models cannot answer the question of occupancy because data processing requires averaging of all five ligand-binding sites. Furthermore, a more complete understanding of ligand recognition leading to channel activation and inhibition will require the context of a membrane environment depicting a physiological state. In addition to orthosteric antagonists, strategies targeting allosteric mechanisms in inhibition of 5-HT 3A R set the stage for the discovery of new drugs that could be receptor subtype specific, and do not alter the pattern of endogenous neurotransmitters. These studies will pave the way for design of drugs that specifically target the 5-HT 3 R in the central nervous system or gut to treat psychiatric or gastrointestinal-tract-related conditions with less off-target effects.

### Antiemetics: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline update [^112mxgXa]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To update the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline for antiemetics in oncology.

Methods

A systematic review of the medical literature was completed to inform this update. MEDLINE, the Cochrane Collaboration Library, and meeting materials from ASCO and the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer were all searched. Primary outcomes of interest were complete response and rates of any vomiting or nausea.

Results

Thirty-seven trials met prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria for this systematic review. Two systematic reviews from the Cochrane Collaboration were identified; one surveyed the pediatric literature. The other compared the relative efficacy of the 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT(3)) receptor antagonists.

Recommendations

Combined anthracycline and cyclophosphamide regimens were reclassified as highly emetic. Patients who receive this combination or any highly emetic agents should receive a 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, and a neurokinin 1 (NK(1)) receptor antagonist. A large trial validated the equivalency of fosaprepitant, a single-day intravenous formulation, with aprepitant; either therapy is appropriate. Preferential use of palonosetron is recommended for moderate emetic risk regimens, combined with dexamethasone. For low-risk agents, patients can be offered dexamethasone before the first dose of chemotherapy. Patients undergoing high emetic risk radiation therapy should receive a 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist before each fraction and for 24 hours after treatment and may receive a 5-day course of dexamethasone during fractions 1 to 5. The Update Committee noted the importance of continued symptom monitoring throughout therapy. Clinicians underestimate the incidence of nausea, which is not as well controlled as emesis.

### Central mechanisms of emesis: a role for GDF15 [^113c3zH6]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

4 | THE ROLE OF GDF15 IN THE MEDIATION OF CINV

CINV is among the most recognized clinical examples highlighting the severity and prevalence of these side effects surrounding diseases and treatments. Despite significant advancements in pharmacology within the field, particularly via serotonin type 3 receptor (5-HT 3 R) and neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) antagonists, satisfactory control of CINV remains unmet. Today, CINV continues to be a distressing set of side effects among patients undergoing classical/conventional chemotherapeutic treatments. Between 30% and 80% of cancer patients experience CINV even with the use of modern anti-emetic medications, and although common, CINV is often underestimated in outpatient settings, which can exert a profound negative influence on prognosis, quality of life, and the ability to adhere to treatment. Historically, CINV severity has even dissuaded some patients from proceeding with potentially curative chemotherapeutic regimes.

### 2016 updated MASCC / ESMO consensus recommendations: prevention of nausea and vomiting following moderately emetogenic chemotherapy [^111kBUpi]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

An update of the recommendations for the prophylaxis of acute and delayed emesis induced by moderately emetogenic chemotherapy published after the last MASCC/ESMO antiemetic consensus conference in 2009 has been carried out.

Methods

A systematic literature search using PubMed from January 1, 2009 to January 6, 2015 with a restriction to papers in English was conducted.

Results

Overall, two randomized phase II and seven randomized phase III studies plus the results of three subgroup analysis of large phase III trials and those of a pilot study have been included.

Conclusions

In carboplatin-treated patients, a moderate benefit from adding an NK1 receptor antagonist to dexamethasone and a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist has been shown. However, in oxaliplatin-treated patients, contrasting results about the role of NK1 receptor antagonists have been obtained. At present, it is not possible to suggest a specific 5-HT3 receptor antagonist to use for the prevention of acute emesis in these patients. No routine prophylaxis for delayed emesis is recommended but in patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with known potential for delayed emesis (e.g., oxaliplatin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide) the use of dexamethasone for days 2–3 can be considered.

The 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists we examined were ondansetron (0.1 − 48 mg/day; 76%), granisetron (0.1 − 3 mg/day; 13%), tropisetron (0.1 − 5 mg/day; 8%), dolasetron (12.5 − 200 mg/day; 7%), palonosetron (0.025 − 0.25 mg/day; 3%), and ramosetron (0.1 − 0.6 mg/day; 2%) (Table 1, Additional file 1: Appendix 5). We also included studies comparing combinations of 5-HT 3 drugs administered concomitantly with other antiemetics, e.g. dexamethasone (2–20 mg/day; 16%), butyrophenone (3%), and benzamide (1%).

Overall, 286 studies with dichotomous outcome data were included in our analyses. Studies with continuous outcome data and studies investigating the same 5-HT 3 treatment in different doses were not included in the analysis.

The median study size was 118 (interquartile range, 75–180) patients, whereas most patients were women (72%), and adults (59%), with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status of I or II (60%) undergoing obstetrical and gynecological (30%) surgery (Table 2, Additional file 1: Appendix 6). The included studies often did not report patients' history of PONV (56%). Similarly, a history of motion sickness was reported in only 33% of the studies; comorbidities were rarely reported (5%).

### Comparative effectiveness of 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor antagonists in irritable bowel syndrome: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies [^116gnUnP]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Network meta-analysis (NWM) has been used as an evidence synthesis tool for comparing RCTs with multiple treatments. NWM incorporates both direct and indirect evidence in a collection of RCTs, thus providing information concerning the relative effects of 3 or more therapeutic interventions competing for a similar result. Since no NWM exists concerning the comparative effectiveness of all 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists evaluated in relevant RCTs, such a study is warranted. Our aim therefore was to perform an NWM in order to obtain more accurate and comprehensive results concerning the comparative efficacy of 5-HT 3 antagonists in the treatment of NC-IBS. It is expected that such comparisons will enable ranking of treatments and will help in clinical decision making.

### Comparative effectiveness of netupitant-palonosetron plus dexamethasone versus aprepitant-based regimens in mitigating chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1176DRgW]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chemotherapy, a critical component of cancer treatment, often induces severe nausea and vomiting, extending beyond physical discomfortand significantly impacting patients' emotionaland psychological well-being. These adverse effects not only diminish quality of life but also contribute to nutritional deficitsand physical weakness, compromising patients' capacity to withstand cancer treatment. Addressing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is thus crucial for maintaining patients' physical health and resilience during cancer treatment.

Current guidelines from leading oncology societies, including the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer, and the European Society of Medical Oncology, offer strategies for CINV management. These guidelines commonly endorse specific medications combinations, although recommendations vary slightly based on the emetogenic potential of prescribed chemotherapy agents. The recommended medications of neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor antagonists, such as aprepitant, fosaprepitant, rolapitant, and netupitant-palonosetron; 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists, such as palonosetron, granisetron, and ondansetron; dexamethasone; and olanzapine. Depending on the chemotherapy drugs used, there are recommendations for 2-drug, 3-drug, or 4-drug antiemetic regimens. However, explicit directives for selecting particular NK1 receptor antagonists tailored to individual patient requirements remain ambiguous, highlighting a gap in clinical guidance and underscoring the necessity for clarity in medication selection to aid healthcare providers in prescription decisions.

### Ramosetron for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111LYsUh]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized as abdominal pain and/or discomfort with altered bowel habits, without any demonstrable structural and biochemical abnormalities. Based on the predominant bowel habit, Rome III criteria categorize IBS into four subtypes: IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), IBS with constipation (IBS-C), mixed IBS (IBS-M), and unsubtyped IBS. IBS affects an estimated 10–15% of adults worldwide. IBS leads to significant reduction in patients' daily activities and quality of life, and accounts for a considerable amount of medical resources. Therefore, development of effective, well-tolerated and safe IBS treatments is important for the patients, health-care systems, and society as a whole.

Serotonin type 3 (5-HT 3) receptor is one of the seven subtypes serotonin (5-HT) receptors. This receptor has been identified on the intestinal nerves, and a number of studies have suggested its role in the pathogenesis of IBS. Treatment targeted at 5-HT 3 receptor has been the focus of numbers of recent studies. Clinical trials and meta-analysis have confirmed the efficacy of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist alosetron in the treatment of IBS-D patients. However, some serious gastrointestinal events (e.g. ischemic colitis and severe constipation) have been reported with alosetron use. Therefore, alosetron is only available exclusively for women with severe, chronic IBS-D refractory to conventional therapy in the USA.

Ramosetron is a potent and selective 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist. It has been used as an antiemetic for cancer patients in their chemotherapy and for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting for many years. Clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy and safety of ramosetron in IBS-D patients. Though the results of these available clinical trials have been generally favorable, there is still no evidence for the efficacy of ramosetron for IBS-D based on the systematic review and meta-analysis. The efficacy of ramosetron on the treatment of both male and female IBS-D population, and the safety data of ramosetron, need to be clearly elucidated. Therefore, we performed this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ramosetron with placebo in the treatment of IBS-D, in order to obtain more accurate and comprehensive results to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of ramosetron in the treatment of abdominal symptoms and bowel function in IBS-D.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition 2025 guidelines on the diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome in children [^114iyHSj]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) in children — abortive pharmacological therapy (oral): The guideline panel recommends using antimigraine agents (e.g. NSAIDs, triptans) for treatment of acute CVS episodes in children and adolescents with a personal or family history of migraine (strong recommendation, moderate certainty in the evidence of effects). The guideline panel suggests using NK1-receptor antagonist (i.e., aprepitant) for treatment of acute CVS episodes in children and adolescents (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence of effects), and acute treatment with NK-1 receptor antagonist should be continued for 3 consecutive days. The guideline panel also suggests using 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (i.e., ondansetron) for treatment of acute CVS episodes in children and adolescents (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence of effects).

### Granisetron: an update on its clinical use in the management of nausea and vomiting [^111hyzQj]. The Oncologist (2004). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are typical side effects of cytotoxic therapy and some surgical procedures. These symptoms can represent a major therapeutic challenge and, if inadequately controlled by antiemetic treatment, will result in increased mortality, morbidity, and health care costs. However, the management of nausea and vomiting has improved greatly in recent years following the introduction of the 5-HT3-receptor antagonists, known as 'setrons'. In light of recent developments in antiemetic care, including the approval of the first neurokinin-1-receptor antagonist aprepitant (Emend; Merck and Company, Inc.; West Point, PA) and a new 5-HT3 receptor antagonist palonosetron (Aloxi; MGI Pharma; Minneapolis, MN), this article provides an update on the clinical experience gained with the 5-HT3-receptor antagonist granisetron (Kytril; Roche Laboratories, Inc.; Nutley, NJ) for the management of chemotherapy-induced, radiation-induced, and postoperative nausea and vomiting, and also reviews its use in special patient populations. Granisetron is a potent and highly selective 5-HT3-receptor antagonist that has little or no affinity for other receptors, a characteristic that is thought to underlie the favorable side-effect and safety profiles of this agent. Extensive clinical trial data have shown granisetron to be an effective and well-tolerated agent for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in the oncology and surgical settings. Granisetron has also been shown to be effective and well tolerated in special populations, such as patients refractory to antiemetic treatment, patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and children. Data also suggest that its safety profile and minimal potential for drug-drug interactions would make it an antiemetic agent of choice for elderly cancer patients.

### Comparative safety of serotonin (5-HT ₃) receptor antagonists in patients undergoing surgery: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116Zk4w4]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

We conclude that most 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists that do not cause delirium. Granisetron plus dexamethasone increased the risk of cardiac harm (arrhythmia), with the number needed to harm ranging from five to eight. We are unable to comment on the relationship between 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists and other cardiac harms, such as for PR prolongation and sudden cardiac death, as no studies reported these important outcomes.

### Current experience with 5-HT ₃ receptor antagonists in fibromyalgia [^113SHYmT]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Pain is perceived, transmitted, processed and modulated within an extensive network of neurotransmitters and hormones. Despite increasing knowledge about the biologic principles, even on the molecular level, the more we learn about the precise mechanisms of their interactions the more questions arise. It is also pertinent to remember that clinical scientists studying pain modulating pharmacologic agents always have to consider possible placebo effects [57–61]. Most of our knowledge regarding the function of neurotransmitter systems in the CNS has been provided by animal studies. Thus we cannot be sure that they have exactly parallel counterparts in humans. For instance, animal studies suggest an inverse relationship between brain and spinal cord concentrations of substance P. If these observations are converted to an interpretation of human fibromyalgia, low brain-tissue levels of both serotonin and substance P should be expected, while spinal cord serotonin concentrations would be low and spinal cord substance P would be high [1]. There is good evidence that 5-HT, its receptors, and their interactions with other neurotransmitters are essential for nociception and antinociception. The activities of 5-HT receptors can be studied by agonist and in humans especially by antagonist use. But even with a direct spinal application of selective agonists and antagonists, observations may still be confounded by (1) dose, as there can be a dose-dependent activation of different receptor subtypes; (2) type of nociceptive tests (e.g., thermal versus pressure versus chemical models), which may have differences in the way they are regulated; and (3) influences due to effects on temperature, blood flow or motor function. With this potential for variability, it is perhaps not surprising that there is some variability in the results of studies reporting on the effects of various 5-HT agonists and antagonists on nociceptive transmission within the spinal cord [62]. For instance, different 5-HT3 receptor densities could exist in various neuronal systems, one density type being completely inhibited at low concentrations, and the others only at higher concentrations of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, thus resulting in contrary effects. Finally, the "endogeneous 5-HT tone" may greatly influence agonist and antagonist action. Considering this complexity of serotonin-mediated reactions, it is not surprising that treatment of pain by 5-HT3 receptor antagonists appears to yield inconsistent results. As fibromyalgia is now regarded as a pain amplification syndrome with a broad variety of additional nonpain symptoms, the interrelations are complicated even more. Fibromyalgia associated symptoms (e.g., fatigue, insomnia, and irritable bowel syndrome) can be modulated by 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. From the data evaluated so far, there is evidence that 5-HT3 receptor antagonists provide significant benefit in some fibromyalgia patients. In our practice, the data justify a careful application in clinical use according to the study results. The dosage, route of application, long term adverse reactions and duration of therapy still need to be studied in greater detail. Recently reported adverse events from therapy of irritable bowel syndrome with alosetron [63–67] provide a note for caution before hastily using 5-HT3 receptor antagonists without more studies. One can surmise that, much as the biochemistry of depression has been elucidated by the development of the SSRIs, a greater understanding of the role of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in treating fibromyalgia patients may provide some insights into disease mechanisms of this enigmatic disorder.

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^116Aknjg]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Combination therapy — multimodal antiemetic prevention for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV): The panel continues to recommend the use of general multimodal PONV prevention in adults, and there is robust evidence that appropriate use of combination therapy is likely to be more effective than monotherapy, although not all combinations show superiority over their individual components. A NMA by Weibel et al reviewed monotherapy and combination options; based on the primary outcome of 24-hour POV, combinations that demonstrated superiority over at least one constituent antiemetic included NK-1 receptor antagonist plus 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, NK-1 receptor antagonist plus dexamethasone, and 5-HT3 antagonists plus dexamethasone. The combination of 5-HT3 antagonists and dexamethasone remains the most well-studied combination for PONV prophylaxis.

### Serotonin 5-HT (3) receptor mediation of pain and anti-nociception: implications for clinical therapeutics [^111gZoW6]. Pain Physician (2004). Low credibility.

The involvement of the serotonergic system in pain and anti-nociception has long been recognized. Throughout the nervous system, serotonin (5-HT) exerts effects through heterogeneous populations of receptors that have recently been categorized into distinct "families" based upon their molecular properties. Of these, the 5-HT(3) receptor is distinct in that it is inotropic, mediating a sodium current, and thus is exclusively excitatory, irrespective of the tissue(s) in which it is localized. Widely distributed within the brain, spinal cord, peripheral neurons and extraneural tissues, 5-HT(3) receptors have been localized to several anatomical loci within the peripheral and central neuraxes that subtend the afferent transmission and efferent modulation of pain. This review provides an overview of the anatomy and physiology of 5-HT(3) receptors and focuses upon the work of numerous groups, as well as summarizing our previous and ongoing studies, that have investigated the role of 5-HT(3) receptors in pain and anti-nociception. Data from in vitro studies of pharmacologic function and molecular mechanisms, ex vivo bioassays and animal studies are addressed. Of particular interest are those findings relevant to the possible utility of 5-HT(3)-acting agents in treating human pain and the results of clinical trials employing 5-HT(3) selective drugs for applied therapeutics.

### 5-HT (1F) receptor agonists: a new treatment option for migraine attacks? [^114zy3De]. Neurotherapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Migraine is a debilitating disorder of the CNS. Although therapeutic options for migraine attacks have tremendously advanced with the development of triptans more than a decade ago, several conditions (such as vascular disease) restrict their use. Moreover, some patients do not respond to triptans and other currently available medications. Therefore, treatment alternatives are needed. Study data show that 5-HT(1F) receptor agonists successfully abort migraine attacks. These data also suggest a favorable vascular side-effect profile of these substances, which could be beneficial for migraine treatment in subjects with cardiac or vascular disease. We discuss the current knowledge of 5-HT(1F) receptor-mediated effects, in part by comparing them to triptans, and we also summarize data from basic research and clinical trials.

### Getting it right the first time: recent progress in optimizing antiemetic usage [^115mzeNx]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Recent years have witnessed significant improvements in the prevention and management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), allowing patients to complete their prescribed chemotherapy regimens without compromising quality of life. This reduction in the incidence of CINV can be primarily attributed to the emergence of effective, well-tolerated antiemetic therapies, including serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT3) receptor antagonists, neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonists, and the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine. While 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are highly effective in the prevention of acute CINV, NK-1 receptor antagonists and olanzapine have demonstrated considerable activity against both acute and delayed CINV. Various combinations of these three types of agents, along with dexamethasone and dopamine receptor antagonists, are now becoming the standard of care for patients receiving moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy. Optimal use of these therapies requires careful assessment of the unique characteristics of each agent and currently available clinical trial data.

### Prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting: controversies in the use of serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine subtype 3 receptor antagonists [^116QUrxk]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) continues to be a "big little problem" despite recent advances in anesthesia. Because of an increased interest in, and the abundant publications on this topic, guidelines for the management of PONV were published in 2003. Several key but controversial issues regarding PONV prophylaxis were left unaddressed, however. These included whether clinical differences exist between the 5-hydroxytryptamine subtype 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists, concern over optimal dosage and timing of administration, optimal 5-HT3 receptor antagonist combination therapy, and whether rescue therapy is effective after prior administration of the same or a different 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. The application of these antiemetics in clinical practice has raised questions regarding the role of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in the treatment of postdischarge nausea and vomiting and opioid-induced nausea and vomiting. A brief overview of the incidence, risk factors and current management recommendations for PONV and current controversies with special emphasis on the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, is discussed.

### Electrocardiographic and cardiovascular effects of the 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptor antagonists [^115UHHbj]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the electrocardiographic (ECG) and cardiovascular effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine(3) (5-HT(3)) receptor antagonists preclinically, in healthy volunteers, and in patients undergoing chemotherapy or surgery.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search was performed of clinical trials and preclinical data published between 1963 and December 2002 assessing the ECG and cardiovascular effects of 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists, supplemented with reviews and secondary sources.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All of the articles identified were evaluated and all information deemed relevant was included in this review.

Data Synthesis

There are no clinically relevant differences in efficacy and safety among the available 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists for prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced and postoperative nausea and vomiting. As a class, they have well-defined electrophysiologic activity. Changes in ECG parameters (PR, QRS, QT, QTc, JT intervals) are small, reversible, clinically insignificant, and independent of the patient population studied, and patients are asymptomatic during these changes. ECG changes are most prominent 1–2 hours after a dose of dolasetron, ondansetron, and granisetron and return to baseline within 24 hours. Clinically important adverse cardiovascular events associated with these changes are rare. No serious cardiac events (including torsade de pointes) arising from ECG interval changes have been attributed to 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist use.

Conclusions

Clinical data demonstrate that ECG interval changes are a class effect of the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists. Theoretical concern regarding cardiovascular adverse events with these agents is not supported by clinical experience. The significant benefits of these agents outweigh the theoretical small risk of meaningful cardiovascular events.

### Prophylaxis of radiation-induced nausea and vomiting using 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 serotonin receptor antagonists: a systematic review of randomized trials [^113y8aeK]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To systematically review the effectiveness and safety of 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor antagonists (5-HT3 RAs) compared with other antiemetic medication or placebo for prophylaxis of radiation-induced nausea and vomiting.

Methods and Materials

We searched the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, and Web of Science. We also hand-searched reference lists of included studies. Randomized, controlled trials that compared a 5-HT3 RA with another antiemetic medication or placebo for preventing radiation-induced nausea and vomiting were included. We excluded studies recruiting patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy. When appropriate, meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager (v5) software. Relative risks were calculated using inverse variance as the statistical method under a random-effects model. We assessed the quality of evidence by outcome using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach.

Results

Eligibility screening of 47 articles resulted in 9 included in the review. The overall methodologic quality was moderate. Meta-analysis of 5-HT3 RAs vs. placebo showed significant benefit for 5-HT3 RAs (relative risk [RR] 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57–0.86 for emesis; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73–0.96 for nausea). Meta-analysis comparing 5-HT3 RAs vs. metoclopramide showed a significant benefit of the 5-HT3 RAs for emetic control (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.15–0.47).

Conclusion

5-Hydroxytryptamine-3 RAs are superior to placebo and other antiemetics for prevention of emesis, but little benefit was identified for nausea prevention. 5-Hydroxytryptamine-3 RAs are suggested for prevention of emesis. Limited evidence was found regarding delayed emesis, adverse events, quality of life, or need for rescue medication. Future randomized, controlled trials should evaluate different 5-HT3 antiemetics and new agents with novel mechanisms of action such at the NK(1) receptor antagonists to determine the most effective drug. Delayed nausea and vomiting should be a focus of future study, perhaps concentrating on the palliative cancer population.

### Comparative efficacy of serotonin (5-HT ₃) receptor antagonists in patients undergoing surgery: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115dp91t]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Prior to conducting a network meta-analysis, we evaluated the transitivity assumption by examining the comparability of the distributions of potential treatment-effect modifiers across comparisons. These included age (children versus adults), timing of administration (all time points versus during surgery), and risk of bias (all versus removing high risk of bias for randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding of outcome assessor). We evaluated transitivity in each network, by visually comparing the mode of the categorical potential effect modifiers across treatment comparisons. We also assessed statistical inconsistency between different sources of evidence in the network using a global χ² test derived from the design-by-treatment interaction model. In the presence of statistically significant inconsistency, we applied the loop-specific approach to locally assess the network and identify the treatment comparisons responsible for inconsistency. In the network meta-analysis and design-by-treatment interaction models, we assumed common within-network heterogeneity, whereas in loop-specific method we assumed common within-loop heterogeneity. We assumed common heterogeneity across treatment comparisons since the included treatments are of the same nature and it was clinically reasonable to share a common heterogeneity parameter. In all approaches, we estimated the magnitude of between-study heterogeneity using the REML method. Important heterogeneity and/or inconsistency would have been explored using network meta-regression analyses adjusting for potential effect modifiers. For each outcome, we carried out subgroup analyses using time of administration of antiemetics (all time periods versus during surgery) and age (all ages versus children), and sensitivity analyses excluding studies with high risk of incomplete outcome data bias. Although our primary analyses were restricted to RCTs only, as a secondary analysis, we included quasi-RCTs and non-RCTs to examine the robustness of the network meta-analysis results.

We present the network meta-analysis summary of treatment effects along with their 95% confidence interval (CI) and 95% predictive interval (PrI). The PrI captures both the uncertainty around the summary treatment effect and between-study variance, and shows the interval within which the treatment effect is expected to lie when a future study is conducted. To visually assess the presence of reporting bias (including publication bias and small-study effects), we used the comparison-adjusted funnel plot. We also ranked the effectiveness of the 5-HT 3 agonist receptors using the surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curve. Network meta-analyses were conducted in Stata 13.0 using the mvmeta command.

### Guidelines versus individualized care for the management of CINV [^114xJnWf]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

a If an NK-1 receptor antagonist is not available, palonosetron is the preferred 5-HT3 receptor antagonist for patients receiving AC-based chemotherapy in the MASCC/ESMO guidelines

All three consensus guidelines agree that patients receiving HEC, including anthracycline/cyclophosphamide (AC)-based chemotherapy, should be treated with at least a three-drug antiemetic regimen consisting of a neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonist, a 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT3) receptor antagonist, and dexamethasone. The 2017 updated ASCO guidelines recommend the inclusion of olanzapine for all patients receiving HEC or AC combinations. The MASCC/ESMO and NCCN guidelines also include the addition of olanzapine as an option for patients receiving HEC. If an NK-1 receptor antagonist is not available for prophylaxis in a patient receiving AC, the MASCC/ESMO guidelines recommend palonosetron as the preferred 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, while the other two guidelines do not specify a preferred agent.

For patients receiving MEC, NCCN guidelines recommend a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone with or without either an NK-1 receptor antagonist or olanzapine. The MASCC/ESMO guidelines and updated ASCO guidelines do not recommend incorporation of an NK-1 receptor antagonist for MEC unless carboplatin is used (discussed below). In all three guidelines, the use of dexamethasone after day 1 is optional and should be considered if the MEC has a known potential for delayed CINV.

General principles for breakthrough and refractory CINV include the addition of another antiemetic agent with a different mechanism of action. For example, adding in an NK-1 receptor antagonist, olanzapine, benzodiazepine, cannabinoid, or dopamine receptor antagonist, or changing the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist.

### The auspicious role of the 5-HT ₃ receptor in depression: a probable neuronal target? [^112mKhVo]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

The serotonergic mechanisms have been successfully utilized by the majority of antidepressant drug discovery programmes, while the search for newer targets remains persistent. The present review focused on the serotonin type-3 receptor, the only ion channel subtype in the serotonin family. Behavioural, neurochemical, electrophysiological and molecular analyses, including the results from our laboratory, provided substantial evidence that rationalizes the correlation between serotonin type-3 receptor modulation and rodent depressive-like behaviour. Nevertheless, the reports on polymorphism of serotonin type-3 receptor genes and data from clinical studies (on serotonin type-3 receptor antagonists) were insufficient to corroborate the involvement of this receptor in the neurobiology of depression. The preclinical and clinical studies that have contradicted the antidepressant-like effects of serotonin type-3 receptor antagonists and the reasons underlying such disagreement were discussed. Finally, this critical review commended the serotonin type-3 receptor as a candidate neuronal antidepressant drug target.

### Evidence-based recommendations for the use of antiemetics in radiotherapy [^112ZhUKW]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

To report recommendations given in the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) International Consensus Conference regarding the use of antiemetics in radiotherapy.

Patients and Methods

A steering committee under MASCC auspice chose panel participants for the guidelines development process on prevention of chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced emesis (RIE). Pertinent information from published literature as of March 2004 was reviewed for the guideline process. Both the MASCC level of scientific confidence and level of consensus, and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) type of evidence and grade for recommendation were adopted.

Results

Total body irradiation is classified at high risk, upper abdomen at moderate, lower thorax, pelvis, cranium (radiosurgery) and craniospinal at low, head and neck, extremities, cranium and breast at minimal risk. The recommendations for the use of antiemetics in radiotherapy are as follows: prophylaxis with a 5-HT3 antagonist in patients at high and moderate risk levels of RIE (± dexamethasone in the former group), prophylaxis or rescue with a 5-HT3 antagonist in the low risk group, and rescue with dopamine or a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist in minimal risk level.

Conclusions
