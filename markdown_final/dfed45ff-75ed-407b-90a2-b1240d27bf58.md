## Question

How should levothyroxine be adjusted when TSH is elevated?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to adjust levothyroxine when TSH is elevated in a treated patient with hypothyroidism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this is primary versus central hypothyroidism because monitoring differs. Then, I should verify the laboratory result and rule out assay or supplement interference. Next, I will assess adherence and administration technique. After that, I need to review drug, food, and disease interactions that could impair absorption or increase requirements. Then, I should define the appropriate TSH target for this specific patient. Next, I will calculate a prudent dose adjustment and timing for re-testing. I should also consider special scenarios such as pregnancy, older age, cardiac disease, and obesity. If TSH stays high despite these steps, I need to consider formulation switches and, finally, evaluate rare or refractory causes and when to refer to endocrinology.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. If this is primary hypothyroidism, TSH is the primary monitoring parameter and my goal is to titrate levothyroxine until the patient is clinically euthyroid with TSH in the reference interval, whereas in central hypothyroidism TSH is unreliable and I should monitor and target free T4 in the upper half of normal while assessing symptoms, so I must distinguish these up front to avoid misdirected dose changes [^117QfEeg] [^115iuzjg] [^notfound] [^111Wrp1V].

> Wait, let me verify the laboratory result before adjusting the dose. I need to ask about biotin use because it can artifactually lower TSH and raise T4; if present, I should have the patient stop biotin for at least 2 days and repeat testing, and I should be mindful that different TSH assays can differ by about 30%, so if the value is unexpected for the clinical picture I will confirm on the lab's platform or with an alternate method before acting on a single outlier [^117QfEeg] [^1127zjRW] [^111Wrp1V].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "dose failure" without checking adherence and technique. Poor compliance is the most common cause of elevated TSH on therapy, so I will nonjudgmentally review missed doses and confirm that levothyroxine is taken on an empty stomach 30–60 minutes before breakfast or consistently at bedtime several hours after the last meal, at the same time daily and with the same brand to minimize variability, and I will correct barriers before changing the dose [^114JDqUJ] [^117QfEeg] [^111cpkBq].

> I need to check for drug, food, and disease interactions next. Calcium and iron supplements, bile acid sequestrants, sucralfate, and agents that alter gastric acidity can reduce absorption, and several drugs can increase hormone requirements or alter pharmacokinetics; I should separate binding agents from levothyroxine dosing by several hours, address GI disorders such as celiac disease or atrophic gastritis if suspected, and reassess TSH after any interacting change in the regimen [^114JDqUJ] [^117QfEeg].

> Let me think about the right TSH target for this patient before I adjust the dose. For most adults with primary hypothyroidism, targeting TSH within the population reference interval is appropriate, but in older patients, especially over 70, a more relaxed target recognizing age-related upward drift in TSH is reasonable to reduce risks of overtreatment, whereas during pregnancy I should aim for trimester-specific lower targets and be proactive about dose increases to avoid fetal and maternal complications, and in women undergoing fertility treatment with ovarian stimulation, maintaining TSH below about 2.5 mIU/L is advisable [^111wnznq] [^117X9d1Y] [^1175z3UR] [^115au5P9].

> Now, I should calculate the dose adjustment. I initially thought about a very small tweak, like 6.25 mcg daily, but wait, the evidence base and guideline practice favor 12.5–25 mcg daily increments with reassessment at steady-state to avoid under-correction or oscillation, and because peak therapeutic effect occurs at about 4–6 weeks, I will recheck TSH at 6–8 weeks after the change and avoid chasing symptoms with minute dose changes once TSH is near target [^116GLqG2] [^117QfEeg] [^111cpkBq].

> I should confirm special dosing scenarios that need distinct action. In pregnancy, I will increase the total weekly dose by about 30% as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and monitor every 4–6 weeks to titrate further, whereas in older adults or those with ischemic heart disease I will use lower starting doses and smaller 12.5–25 mcg increments to minimize arrhythmia or ischemia risk, and in obesity I will individualize dosing considering lean mass rather than actual body weight alone to avoid over-replacement; in central hypothyroidism, I will titrate to keep free T4 in the upper half of normal rather than using TSH to guide therapy [^114oSEuT] [^113JDiSi] [^113285Rp] [^117QfEeg] [^115iuzjg].

> Next, I should review whether a formulation switch could help if TSH remains above range despite impeccable adherence and timing. Hold on, I should verify that counseling was optimal first; if so, switching from tablets to a liquid solution or softgel at the same dose may overcome subtle malabsorption and reduce variability, and keeping patients on a consistent brand or preparation helps minimize assay-to-assay noise and bioavailability changes with rechecking at about 6 weeks after any switch [^115V2h1X] [^111wnznq].

> I will now examine the follow-up cadence. After any dose change or formulation change, I should repeat TSH, and free T4 if needed, at 6–8 weeks to assess the new steady state, then once stable I can monitor about every 6–12 months in nonpregnant adults, and during pregnancy I should monitor every 4–6 weeks throughout gestation with earlier checks after dose changes to ensure on-target control [^117QfEeg] [^111cpkBq] [^114oSEuT].

> But wait, what if TSH stays high despite all of the above. I should double-check for hidden nonadherence, unrecognized drug interactions such as sertraline or enzyme inducers, and unaddressed GI causes; if these are excluded and symptoms persist, I will refer to endocrinology, avoid routine liothyronine addition given inconsistent benefit and unfavorable kinetics with once-daily T3 causing peaks and troughs, and reserve any T4/T3 combination trial for specialist care with careful monitoring if ever considered [^114JDqUJ] [^112DtQc5] [^1178EqN4] [^113yC48n].

> In summary, I need to ensure the diagnosis type is correct, confirm the lab validity, optimize adherence and administration, address interactions, set an individualized TSH target, adjust levothyroxine by 12.5–25 mcg with 6–8 week reassessment, apply special-case rules for pregnancy, older age, cardiac disease, and obesity, consider a formulation switch if needed, and escalate to specialty evaluation for refractory cases while avoiding unnecessary addition of T3, all while anchoring decisions in clinical status and assay-aware interpretation of TSH and free T4 values [^117QfEeg] [^111cpkBq] [^117X9d1Y] [^115V2h1X] [^1127zjRW].

When TSH is elevated on levothyroxine, **confirm adherence and check for interactions** (calcium, iron, PPIs, sucralfate, cholestyramine, antacids, or biotin) [^114JDqUJ] and check for interactions (calcium, iron, PPIs, sucralfate, cholestyramine, antacids, or biotin). If TSH remains high, **increase levothyroxine by 12–25 mcg** [^116GLqG2] and recheck in 6–8 weeks [^111wnznq]. For elderly or cardiac patients, use smaller increments (12.5 mcg) and titrate cautiously [^113JDiSi]; in pregnancy, **increase the dose by 30% immediately** and monitor TSH every 4 weeks. If TSH remains elevated despite adherence, consider malabsorption or drug interactions [^114JDqUJ], or switch to liquid/softgel formulations [^115V2h1X]. Once TSH is at goal, monitor every 6–12 months [^111wnznq] [^114VwJPF] and avoid frequent small adjustments [^111cpkBq].

---

## Confirm adherence and administration

- **Adherence**: Nonadherence is the most common cause of elevated TSH in treated hypothyroidism [^114JDqUJ].

- **Administration**: Levothyroxine should be taken fasting, 30–60 minutes before breakfast, with water only; separate from calcium, iron, PPIs, sucralfate, cholestyramine, antacids, and biotin.

- **Formulation**: Consider liquid or softgel formulations if absorption issues persist [^115V2h1X].

---

## Evaluate for interfering factors

Begin by reviewing **medications that reduce levothyroxine absorption** or interfere with assays — calcium, iron, PPIs, sucralfate, cholestyramine, antacids, and biotin. Then assess dietary contributors (high-fiber intake, soy, coffee) that can impair absorption. Finally, consider comorbid conditions that reduce absorption, including celiac disease, H. pylori, IBD, and a history of bariatric surgery.

---

## Dose adjustment strategy

- **Increment**: Increase by 12–25 mcg (about 10–20% of total dose).

- **Monitoring**: Recheck TSH in 6–8 weeks [^117QfEeg] after any change [^111wnznq].

- **Targets**: Aim for TSH 0.5–2.5 mIU/L in most adults; 0.5–2.5 mIU/L in pregnancy; 4–6 mIU/L in elderly or cardiac patients.

---

## Special populations

- **Pregnancy**: Increase dose by ~30% immediately; monitor TSH every 4 weeks.

- **Elderly/cardiac**: Use smaller increments (12.5 mcg) and titrate cautiously [^113JDiSi].

- **Central hypothyroidism**: Adjust to keep free T4 in the upper half of normal [^117QfEeg]; do not use TSH to guide dosing [^115iuzjg].

---

## Persistent elevated TSH despite adherence

With persistently elevated TSH despite adherence, **evaluate for malabsorption** (celiac disease, H. pylori, IBD, bariatric surgery) and review all medications and supplements for potential interactions [^114JDqUJ]. If issues persist, switch to a liquid or softgel levothyroxine formulation [^115V2h1X].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should include **checking TSH 6–8 weeks after any dose change** [^117QfEeg] and, once stable, every 6–12 months. Maintain consistency by using the same brand or formulation when possible [^111wnznq], and avoid overadjustment [^116SQwNu] — do not make frequent small changes once TSH is at goal [^111cpkBq].

## References

### Synthroid [^117QfEeg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The dosage of Synthroid for hypothyroidism or pituitary TSH suppression depends on a variety of factors including the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food, and the specific nature of the condition being treated. Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors, with dosage adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters.

- **Dosing considerations for adult patients with primary hypothyroidism**: Titrate until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal.
- **For secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism**: Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of Synthroid dosage adequacy and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free-T4 level to titrate Synthroid dosing until the patient is clinically euthyroid, and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.
- **Biotin supplementation inquiry**: Inquire whether patients are taking biotin or biotin-containing supplements. If so, advise them to stop biotin supplementation at least 2 days before assessing TSH and/or T4 levels.

The peak therapeutic effect of a given dose of Synthroid may not be attained for 4 to 6 weeks.

### Thyroid laboratory testing and management in women on thyroid replacement before pregnancy and associated pregnancy outcomes [^114oSEuT]. Thyroid (2021). Low credibility.

It is well recognized that titration of levothyroxine dose is often required during pregnancy in women with preexisting thyroid disease to replicate normal physiologic changes and maintain a normal TSH, although the optimal management strategy is not established. This study demonstrated that the most common timing for first levothyroxine dose adjustment in pregnancy was around five to six weeks of gestation. Among women who had at least one adjustment in thyroid hormone dosage during gestation, the median cumulative increase in levothyroxine from preconception to third trimester was 44%, consistent with previously published data.

The cohort in this study included pregnancies between 2014 and 2017. The ATA guidelines from 2011 and 2017 recommend that pregnant women on levothyroxine before conception should immediately increase their levothyroxine by two additional tablets a week at the time of conception, representing an approximate dosage increase of 30%. The efficacy and safety of this approach have been investigated in a prospective study in which women with treated hypothyroidism were randomized to increase levothyroxine by either two or three tablets per week once pregnant. Both interventions prevented TSH elevations in the first trimester, but resulted in TSH suppression below 0.10 mIU/L in 8% and 26% of women, in the two- and three-tablet increase groups, respectively. Observational studies have highlighted the association between overt hypothyroidism and adverse pregnancy complications, as well as negative childhood neurocognitive outcomes. However, there is a paucity of further data in this area.

### How do you approach the problem of TSH elevation in a patient on high-dose thyroid hormone replacement [^114JDqUJ]. Clinical endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Persistent elevation of TSH levels in patients under treatment for hypothyroidism is a relatively common clinical problem in endocrinology practice. The most common cause for this phenomenon is poor patient compliance with their thyroid hormone tablets. In the compliant patient, however, multiple aetiologies are possible, and a methodological and stepwise approach to the patient's problem will uniformly identify a cause, or at least a resolution.

### Study protocol; thyroid hormone replacement for untreated older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism - a randomised placebo controlled trial (TRUST) [^116GLqG2]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

The dose is adjusted based on the serum TSH level as follows:

- **TSH < 0.4 mU/L**: The treatment dose is reduced to 25 micrograms levothyroxine in those starting on 50 micrograms, and reduced to 0 in those starting on 25 micrograms, with blinding maintained by giving a placebo matching the 25 micrograms dose. These patients will have a further TSH check after 6–8 weeks. If TSH remains < 0.4 mU/L, the patient will be withdrawn from randomised treatment.

- **TSH ≥ 0.4 and < 4.6 mU/L**: No change to the treatment dose is made, and the patient is reviewed at 12 months.

- **TSH remains elevated (≥ 4.6 mU/L)**: An additional 25 micrograms of levothyroxine is administered, resulting in a total daily dose of 75 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 50 micrograms, or a total daily dose of 50 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 25 micrograms.

Titration of the levothyroxine dose (in 25 micrograms increments) against serum TSH is repeated up to a maximum of two occasions at 6–8 week intervals, with a serum TSH check performed 6–8 weeks after all dose titrations. The investigators remained blinded to the results of TSH measurements throughout the study.

The process described above (but with only a single up-titration) is repeated at 12 months (plus or minus 1 month), and then annually at 24 and 36 months (plus or minus 1 month). The maximum possible dose of levothyroxine prescribed is 150 micrograms.

A mock titration (by computer algorithm) is performed in the placebo group, aiming for approximately the same frequency as that likely to be required in the treatment group.

### Levothyroxine treatment for congenital hypothyroidism based on thyroid function: a 10-year clinical retrospective study [^1122y35z]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

In our retrospective observation of patients administered individualized dosages of levothyroxine according to their initial TSH level at diagnosis, after 1 month, there were four patients (10.8%) in group A, one patient (3.8%) in group B, four patients (23.5%) in group C, and three patients (8.3%) in group D who did not reach the normal TSH level. Furthermore, there were eight patients (21.6%) in group A, one patient (3.8%) in group B, and one patient (2.7%) in group D who had an FT4 level beyond the upper limit of normal values at 1 month following treatment. At the follow-up time, the dosage of levothyroxine for each patient was adjusted according to thyroid function, and their thyroid function eventually returned to a normal range.

Our study suggests that to reduce the risk of levothyroxine overdose, individualized levothyroxine dosage should be adjusted. Currently, there is no exact dosage for patients with different TSH levels; however, for most patients with mildly elevated TSH, low-dose thyroxine could restore their TSH level to normal 1 month after treatment. It is critical to follow up regularly during treatment to monitor thyroid function and adjust the thyroxine dosage to maintain thyroid function within the normal range.

Research performed by Soliman et al. (2012) revealed that 25% of the patients (n = 45) treated with a high dose of levothyroxine (10–15 μg/kg·d) developed hyperthyroidism. Craven and Frank (2018) reported that a high initial levothyroxine dosage (> 12.5 μg/kg·d) may have caused hyperthyroidism. After a period of follow-up, more than half of the patients…

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^113KWfGB]. Endocrine Practice (2012). High credibility.

In the management of subclinical hypothyroidism, particularly concerning levothyroxine therapy, the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend considering a daily dose of levothyroxine ranging from 25 to 75 mcg, depending on the degree of thyroid-stimulating hormone elevation. Further adjustments should be guided by clinical response and follow-up laboratory determinations, including thyroid-stimulating hormone values.

### Daily administration of short-acting liothyronine is associated with significant triiodothyronine excursions and fails to alter thyroid-responsive parameters [^1178EqN4]. Thyroid (2016). High credibility.

Although most studies of levothyroxine-liothyronine combination therapy employ once-daily hormone administration, the kinetics of once-daily liothyronine have been studied infrequently. The aim of this study was to document both the peak and trough serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels that occur with once-daily liothyronine administration, along with changes in thyroid-responsive parameters.

- **Methods**: Participants with hypothyroidism were studied prospectively at an academic institution. Patients were switched from levothyroxine monotherapy to liothyronine monotherapy with 15μg liothyronine for two weeks, and then continued liothyronine at doses of 30–45μg for a further four weeks in an open-label, single-arm study. Weekly trough levels of T3 were documented. In addition, hourly T3 concentrations immediately following liothyronine tablet administration were documented for eight hours during the sixth week of therapy. Serum thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine (fT4) concentrations were documented. Biochemical markers, markers of energy metabolism, anthropometric parameters, well-being, and hyperthyroid symptoms were also assessed.

- **Results**: Mean serum TSH levels increased from 1.56 ± 0.81 mIU/L at baseline to 5.90 ± 5.74 mIU/L at two weeks and 3.84 ± 3.66 mIU/L at six weeks. Trough T3 levels decreased from 99.5 ± 22.9 to 91.9 ± 40.2 at two weeks and recovered to 96.1 ± 32.2 at six weeks. The peak T3 concentration after dosing of liothyronine during week 6 was 292.8 ± 152.3ng/dL. fT4 levels fell once levothyroxine was discontinued and plateaued at 0.44ng/dL at week 4.

### ETA guidelines for the use of levothyroxine sodium preparations in monotherapy to optimize the treatment of hypothyroidism [^117X9d1Y]. European thyroid journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for hypothyroidism, specifically concerning TSH monitoring, the ETA 2025 guidelines recognize that serum TSH increases with age. It is recommended to individualize treatment based on the patient's age and degree of comorbidities. In patients older than 70 years with levothyroxine-treated hypothyroidism, a more relaxed TSH reference interval should be considered.

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations [^116SUZCg]. Clinical endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). It is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l); we suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively.

Together, these patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys. There are a number of causes for this picture, which include endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects, and concomitant nonthyroidal illness. Treatments commonly employed in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH but have not been shown to improve clinical outcome or symptoms.

There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance on whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

### Levothyroxine dosage is associated with stability of thyroid-stimulating hormone values [^114VwJPF]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In patients treated for hypothyroidism, the usual practice is to monitor thyroid-stimulating hormone values yearly once a therapeutic dosage of levothyroxine is determined. This study investigates whether there are any clinical predictors that could identify a subset of patients who might be monitored safely on a less frequent basis.

- **Methods**: Using a retrospective study design, 715 patients treated for hypothyroidism who had a normal (i.e. therapeutic) thyroid-stimulating hormone value in 2006 while taking levothyroxine were identified. All thyroid-stimulating hormone values were then obtained through December 31, 2012. Using a Cox proportional hazard model, gender, age, body mass index, history of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, initial thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and levothyroxine dose were analyzed for time to first abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone value.

- **Results**: Age, gender, history of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, and body mass index at the time of the initial normal thyroid-stimulating hormone were not significantly associated with time to abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone value. However, a levothyroxine dose greater than 125 μg/day had an increased hazard ratio of 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.7–3.4; P < 0.05), indicating a higher risk of abnormal values.

### Effects of altering levothyroxine dose on energy expenditure and body composition in subjects treated with LT4 [^116SQwNu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). High credibility.

It is unclear whether variations in thyroid status within or near the reference range affect energy expenditure, body mass, or body composition.

- **Methods**: 138 subjects treated with levothyroxine (LT4) for hypothyroidism with normal TSH levels underwent measurement of total, resting, and physical activity energy expenditure; thermic effect of food; substrate oxidation; dietary intake; and body composition. They were assigned to receive an unchanged, higher, or lower LT4 dose in randomized, double-blind fashion, targeting one of three TSH ranges (0.34 to 2.50, 2.51 to 5.60, or 5.61 to 12.0 mU/L). The doses were adjusted every 6 weeks to achieve target TSH levels. Baseline measures were reassessed at 6 months.

- **Results**: At study end, the mean LT4 doses and TSH levels were 1.50 ± 0.07, 1.32 ± 0.07, and 0.78 ± 0.08 µg/kg (P < 0.001) and 1.85 ± 0.25, 3.93 ± 0.38, and 9.49 ± 0.80 mU/L (P < 0.001), respectively, in the three arms. No substantial metabolic differences in outcome were found among the three arms, although direct correlations were observed between decreases in thyroid status and decreases in resting energy expenditure for all subjects. The subjects could not ascertain how their LT4 dose had been adjusted but preferred the perceived higher LT4 dose (P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Altering LT4 doses in subjects with hypothyroidism to vary TSH levels in and near the reference range did not have major effects on energy expenditure or body composition. Subjects treated with LT4 preferred the perceived higher LT4 doses despite a lack of objective effect.

### ETA guidelines for the use of levothyroxine sodium preparations in monotherapy to optimize the treatment of hypothyroidism [^115au5P9]. European thyroid journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypothyroidism, particularly in patients undergoing fertility treatment, the ETA 2025 guidelines recommend considering an increase in the dose of levothyroxine replacement during fertility treatment with ovarian stimulation. This adjustment aims to maintain TSH levels below 2.5 mIU/L and accommodate the significant rise in thyroid hormone binding proteins.

### Time for a reassessment of the treatment of hypothyroidism [^113wgRe5]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Using the observed historical narrower therapeutic range for an individual patient, we note that the treatment targets may overlap for patients in a group. If that is true, the general assumption that maintaining TSH anywhere within its broad reference limits to routinely achieve a satisfactory outcome for each and every patient may be ill-advised. We have refuted the applicability of treatment targets based on the consideration of the reference ranges in the healthy population by demonstrating dissociations between FT3 and FT4, and FT3 and TSH in LT4-treated athyreotic patients, and documenting altered equilibria between the hormones on LT4, compared to the healthy state. Others have arrived at similar conclusions.

In laboratory diagnostics, the high individuality of TSH and thyroid hormones has long been recognized since the pioneering work of Andersen and colleagues. However, this applies equally to the statistical analysis of associations involving thyroid parameters. Data clustering, whether in groups with similar properties or in subjects where multiple measurements are obtained over time, potentially masks the true relationship and abolishes the strong associations at the group level when the data are combined for analysis. This phenomenon, known as Simpson's paradox, is readily demonstrated with a fictitious random sample of two groups with a slightly shifted center showing the same strong inverse correlation. Unlike the correct analysis by individual groups, a combined analysis of the total cohort artificially weakens the correlation.

### Effect of low- and high-dose levothyroxine on thyroid nodule volume: a crossover placebo-controlled trial [^116C6fkD]. Clinical Endocrinology (2002). Low credibility.

The efficacy and effective dose of levothyroxine suppressive therapy in the treatment of benign thyroid nodules are controversial. In this study, we aimed to determine the response of solitary thyroid nodules to low- or high-level TSH suppression in a placebo-controlled, randomized crossover trial.

- **Design**: Forty-nine patients with solitary thyroid nodules on palpation were randomized to high-level and low-level TSH suppression groups. In each group, patients were further randomized to placebo and active levothyroxine subgroups. Patients in each subgroup were crossed over to placebo or active levothyroxine at the end of the first year and were then followed up for an additional year.

- **Methods**: TSH levels were suppressed to 0.4–0.6 mIU/ml and ≤ 0.01 mIU/ml in the low-level and high-level TSH suppression groups, respectively. Nodule volumes were measured at baseline and every 6 months after the desired level of TSH was reached if the patients were in the active levothyroxine treatment group or every 6 months if they were in the placebo group.

- **Results**: In high-level TSH suppression groups, nodule volume decreased significantly at the end of the active treatment periods (4.99 ± 2.02 mL vs. 3.20 ± 1.50 ml, P < 0.01, in Group 1; and 3.72 ± 1.79 mL to 2.05 ± 0.64 ml, P < 0.001, in Group 2). In the low-level TSH suppression groups, nodule volume also decreased significantly at the end of the active treatment periods (4.43 ± 1.76 mL vs. 3.04 ± 1.32 ml, P < 0.05, in Group 3; and 3.59 ± 0.89 mL to 2.22 ± 0.59 ml, P < 0.01, in Group 4).

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to levothyroxine therapy, the ETA 2025 guidelines recommend calculating the levothyroxine dose in thyroidectomized patients by considering body weight, underlying thyroid disorders, and the extent of thyroid resection.

### Levothyroxine dose and risk of fractures in older adults: Nested case-control study [^115qVYK2]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

Some limitations of our study merit mention. Laboratory and radiological data, such as serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels and radiology reports, were not available from our databases. Also, without access to clinical information, we were unable to verify the indication for levothyroxine treatment in cohort members that affects dosing. This might potentially explain the larger-than-expected proportion of people (nearly 8%) who had discontinued levothyroxine, given that it is generally continued lifelong when prescribed for hypothyroidism. However, we minimized variation of indication as much as possible by excluding people with previous hyperthyroidism or thyroid cancer, and less than 1% of the study participants had undergone thyroidectomy.

We were unable to measure other factors that may affect the association between levothyroxine and fracture risk, such as body mass index, family history, smoking, caffeine or alcohol use, or non-prescription drug use such as calcium and vitamin D. Misclassification and selection bias are also potential threats to validity in observational studies such as ours. We minimized the potential for misclassification by using hospital-based fractures as our outcome and by considering cumulative levothyroxine dosage over the previous year rather than a single prescription to estimate drug use. Cases and controls were matched on age, sex, and duration in the study cohort, and we used regression techniques to adjust for potential confounders. The nested case-control design is commonly used in pharmaco-surveillance research.

### Thyroid laboratory testing and management in women on thyroid replacement before pregnancy and associated pregnancy outcomes [^115qMCJs]. Thyroid (2021). Low credibility.

Women with hypothyroidism before pregnancy often require an increase in their levothyroxine dosage to maintain a euthyroid state during pregnancy. The objectives of this study were to investigate the frequency and distribution of thyrotropin (TSH) testing and levothyroxine dosage adjustment by gestational age, the magnitude of levothyroxine increase by the underlying etiology of hypothyroidism, and the relationship of overtreatment or undertreatment during pregnancy with adverse pregnancy outcomes among women using thyroid replacement before pregnancy.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study of pregnancies in women on thyroid replacement before pregnancy in Alberta, Canada, was performed. Women using thyroid replacement anytime during the two years before pregnancy who delivered between October 2014 and September 2017 were included. Delivery records, physician billing, and laboratory and pharmacy administrative data were linked. Outcomes included characteristics of TSH testing, levothyroxine dosing, and pregnancy outcomes. The frequency and gestational timing of TSH testing and levothyroxine adjustments were calculated. Multiple logistic regression was used to test whether pregnancies with TSH < 0.10 mIU/L (overtreatment) or TSH ≥ 10.00 mIU/L (undertreatment), compared with control pregnancies (TSH 0.10–4.00 mIU/L), were associated with adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes.

- **Results**: Of the 10,680 deliveries, 8774 (82.2%) underwent TSH testing at least once during pregnancy, at a median gestational age of six weeks. An adjustment of levothyroxine was d

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: Prepared by the American Thyroid Association Task Force on Thyroid Hormone Replacement [^113yC48n]. Thyroid (2014). High credibility.

A number of recent advances in our understanding of thyroid physiology may shed light on why some patients feel unwell while taking levothyroxine monotherapy. The purpose of this task force was to review the goals of levothyroxine therapy, the optimal prescription of conventional levothyroxine therapy, the sources of dissatisfaction with levothyroxine therapy, the evidence on treatment alternatives, and the relevant knowledge gaps. We wished to determine whether there are sufficient new data generated by well-designed studies to provide reason to pursue such therapies and change the standard of care. This document is intended to inform clinical decision-making on thyroid hormone replacement therapy; it is not a replacement for individualized clinical judgment.

- **Methods**: Task force members identified 24 questions relevant to the treatment of hypothyroidism. The clinical literature relating to each question was then reviewed. Clinical reviews were supplemented, when relevant, with related mechanistic and bench research literature reviews, performed by our team of translational scientists. Ethics reviews were provided, when relevant, by a bioethicist. The responses to questions were formatted, when possible, in the form of a formal clinical recommendation statement. When responses were not suitable for a formal clinical recommendation, a summary response statement without a formal clinical recommendation was developed. For clinical recommendations, the supporting evidence was appraised, and the strength of each clinical recommendation was assessed.

### Use of liothyronine (T3) in hypothyroidism: Joint British Thyroid Association/Society for Endocrinology consensus statement [^1155V2B7]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). Low credibility.

Persistent symptoms in patients treated for hypothyroidism are common. Despite more than 20 years of debate, the use of liothyronine for this indication remains controversial, as numerous randomized trials have failed to show a benefit of treatment regimens that combine liothyronine (T3) with levothyroxine over levothyroxine monotherapy. This consensus statement attempts to provide practical guidance to clinicians faced with patients who have persistent symptoms during thyroid hormone replacement therapy.

It applies to non-pregnant adults and is focused on care delivered within the UK National Health Service, although it may be relevant in other healthcare environments. The statement emphasizes several key clinical practice points for patients dissatisfied with treatment for hypothyroidism:

- **Diagnosis of overt hypothyroidism**: It is important to establish a diagnosis of overt hypothyroidism; patients with persistent symptoms during thyroid hormone replacement but with no clear biochemical evidence of overt hypothyroidism should first have a trial without thyroid hormone replacement.

- **Levothyroxine dose optimization**: In those with established overt hypothyroidism, levothyroxine doses should be optimized, aiming for a TSH in the 0.3–2.0 mU/L range for 3 to 6 months before a therapeutic response can be assessed. In some patients, it may be acceptable to have serum TSH below the reference range (e.g. 0.1–0.3 mU/L), but not fully suppressed in the long term.

We suggest that for some patients with confirmed overt hypothyroidism and persistent symptoms who have had adequate treatment with levothyroxine and in whom other comorbidities have been excluded, it may be necessary to explore other treatment options.

### The relevance of tin the management of hypothyroidism [^115rBNRf]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

Levothyroxine monotherapy has been the standard of care for the treatment of hypothyroidism for more than 40 years. However, patients treated with levothyroxine have relatively lower serum tri-iodothyronine (T3) concentrations than the general population, and symptoms of hypothyroidism persist for some patients despite normalization of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations. The understanding that maintenance of normal T3 concentrations is the priority for the thyroid axis has redirected the clinical focus to serum T3 concentrations in patients with hypothyroidism. This Personal View explores whether it is currently feasible to identify patients who could be considered for liothyronine supplementation in combination with levothyroxine.

Genetic profiling stands out as a potential future tool to identify patients who do not respond well to levothyroxine due to suboptimal peripheral thyroxine (T4) activation. Moreover, new slow-release liothyronine preparations are being developed to be trialed in these symptomatic patients, in an attempt to restore T3 concentrations and provide conclusive results for the use of T4 plus T3 combination therapy.

### Targeted levothyroxine therapy for treatment of congenital hypothyroidism [^111oA3ZZ]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine if infants with congenital hypothyroidism (CH), whose initial dose of levothyroxine (LT4) is based on thyroid gland anatomy, require fewer dose adjustments in the first six months of life than those who were started empirically on LT4.

Newborns with CH who had a thyroid ultrasound performed at diagnosis were eligible for this prospective, historical case-controlled study. The daily LT4 dose prescribed was based on results from the thyroid ultrasound as follows: 15 mcg/kg for athyreosis, 12 mcg/kg for a dysgenetic thyroid, and 10 mcg/kg for an anatomically normal gland. Routine labs according to standard guidelines were obtained, and the number of dose adjustments over the first six months of therapy was recorded. Each study participant was matched with two historical controls with CH based on sex and thyroid anatomy.

Twenty-two subjects (10 with athyreosis, 4 with dysgenetic glands, and 8 with anatomically normal glands) were matched to 44 controls. There was no significant difference in the overall number of adjustments in the study group compared to controls (P = 0.74). However, there were significantly fewer adjustments made for undertreatment (P = 0.03) and significantly more adjustments made for overtreatment (P = 0.006) in subjects with athyreosis compared to controls.

Targeted LT4 therapy does not appear to decrease the overall frequency of dose adjustments for infants with CH. However, 15 mcg/kg/day appears to exceed thyroid hormone requirements in infants with CH due to athyreosis.

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, specifically with respect to levothyroxine therapy (indications, abnormal TSH), the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend considering initiating treatment based on individual factors in patients with TSH levels between the upper limit of a given laboratory's reference range and 10 mIU/L. This is particularly advised if patients have symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism, positive anti-TPO antibodies, or evidence of ASCVD, heart failure, or associated risk factors for these diseases.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hypothyroidism in TSH deficiency compared to primary thyroid disease: Pituitary patients are at risk of under-replacement with levothyroxine [^113k1s5S]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Achieving optimal thyroid hormone replacement is more difficult in TSH deficiency compared to primary hypothyroidism because of the inability to be guided by serum TSH levels. A combination of clinical symptoms and free thyroxine levels (fT4) are typically used to make a diagnosis and monitor replacement. We investigated the diagnosis of TSH deficiency in patients with pituitary disease and the adequacy of levothyroxine replacement compared with primary thyroid disease.

- **Design**: Using our department's clinical information system, we identified all patients with a diagnosis of any type of pituitary tumour who had been seen in clinic over a 2-year period. We divided the patients into those at high risk and low risk of TSH deficiency based on the presence of macroadenoma and/or intervention by surgery or radiotherapy. We compared fT4 values in these patients with values in patients with primary thyroid disease in our thyrotoxicosis shared-care scheme (TSC) and hypothyroid register within the same timescale, assessing only those samples considered euthyroid in which TSH was in the normal range.

- **Results**: A database query identified 525 patients with a pituitary tumour, of whom 344 were considered at high risk of TSH deficiency. A free T4 (fT4) value was found for 514 patients (97.9%). TSC and thyroid register databases revealed fT4 values for comparison with simultaneous normal TSH in patients on no treatment (n = 3777 samples) or on levothyroxine alone (n = 11,805). fT4 levels overall were lower in pituitary patients than in equivalent controls.

### Patient-tailored levothyroxine dosage with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling: A novel approach after total thyroidectomy [^113NVeoS]. Thyroid (2021). Low credibility.

This is the first study to suggest LT4 dosage adjustment based on repeated fT4 and TSH measurements during the first two weeks after thyroidectomy. Application of the DAT enabled the clinician to make appropriate dosage adjustments after only two weeks. It is hard to compare the performance of our model directly against other published dosage schemes because they all use the entire TSH reference range as goal achievement, while we used a narrower TSH target for replacement therapy.

The reason we did not include TSH range > 2.0 mIU/L in our targets was that high normal TSH values are associated with comorbidity. We sought to make our TSH targets more applicable to all diagnoses in the study, including cancer. The study was thus not designed to evaluate our model against other published dosage schemes, but to evaluate whether computerized modeling would allow meaningful early LT4 dose adjustments before a steady state is reached.

When recalculating our eight-week data for patients with goiter using the entire TSH reference range as goal achievement, we found, however, that our model outperforms other published dosage schemes. Care must be taken when interpreting these data, as the number of patients is low both in our study groups and in comparable studies.

### Biochemical assessment of adequate levothyroxine replacement in primary hypothyroidism differs with different TSH assays: potential clinical implications [^1127zjRW]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Low credibility.

Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) assays provided by Abbott Laboratories and Roche Diagnostics are used by approximately 75% of laboratories in the UK. This study assessed the potential impact of Abbott and Roche TSH assay differences on the biochemical assessment of levothyroxine replacement in primary hypothyroidism.

- **Method**: Samples from 100 consecutive primary care patients (83 women, median age 64 years, IQR 51–73 years) with primary hypothyroidism on adequate levothyroxine based on an Abbott Architect TSH in the reference range were analyzed for TSH on Roche cobas within 24 hours. The Abbott and Roche TSH results were compared. Over one year, TSH results from patients in primary care laboratories using Abbott and Roche methods were compared.

- **Results**: The median (IQR) Roche TSH (2.5 (1.3–3.6) mIU/L) was 30% ± 10% higher (p < 0.001) than Abbott TSH (1.9 (1.1–2.6) mIU/L). Although all Abbott TSH results were in the Abbott-specific reference range, 14 patients (14%) had Roche TSH results above the Roche-specific reference range. In the one-year data collection, Roche TSH (1.9 (1.3–2.9) mIU/L, n = 103,932) results were significantly higher (p < 0.001) than Abbott TSH (1.5 (1.0–2.2) mIU/L, n = 110,544) results. The TSH results were above their assay-specific upper reference limit in 10.7% of Roche results and 4.2% of Abbott results.

- **Conclusion**: Biochemical assessment of levothyroxine replacement may depend on the type of TSH assay used. Laboratory personnel and clinicians should be aware that the lack of harmonization between TSH methods and their assay-specific reference ranges may potentially lead to different clinical interpretations.

### The ages and TSH values of patients being prescribed levothyroxine [^113YxiQr]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Levothyroxine is a commonly prescribed medication. Some data suggest that levothyroxine may be initiated for mild degrees of hypothyroidism and used without considering age-specific reference ranges or individual patient factors when prescribing.

- **Methods**: The electronic medical record of a healthcare system operating in the Washington, DC, and Maryland area was interrogated to determine the number of patients being prescribed levothyroxine during the period 2008–2016. This included the number of prescriptions supplied to these individuals, an associated diagnosis of hypothyroidism, and whether the prescriptions were new or existing. Information was also extracted about the age of patients receiving prescriptions and the thyroid-stimulating hormone level documented prior to levothyroxine initiation.

- **Results**: Although the number of levothyroxine prescriptions provided annually increased over this period, when corrected for the number of patients in the database, the percentage of patients receiving levothyroxine prescriptions showed a slight downward trend. Levothyroxine was most frequently prescribed and initiated in individuals aged 50–59 years and 60–69 years. The doses of levothyroxine most commonly prescribed were 50 µg and 100 µg. The pattern of levothyroxine doses being used was unaffected by whether a diagnosis of hypothyroidism was documented or not. Levothyroxine prescription initiation was associated with mean thyroid-stimulating hormone values that were modestly elevated, in the range of 7.5–13.8 mIU/L.

### Thyroid antibodies and levothyroxine effects in subclinical hypothyroidism: A pooled analysis of two randomized controlled trials [^116ss6pH]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Baseline data are expressed as the number of participants (percentage) for categorical characteristics or as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median (interquartile range [IQR]) for continuous characteristics.

In line with the protocol and first reports, the primary analysis considered all participants in the intention-to-treat population who had the 1-year follow-up visit within the protocol-specified window. In this study, only participants with an anti-TPO status at baseline were included.

Between-group comparisons on the difference between 1-year follow-up and baseline values were performed using linear mixed-effects regression models with an interaction term between the treatment group and baseline anti-TPO status. Adjustment was made for stratification variables (sex, country, and randomization dose) and the respective baseline values, given that randomization was not stratified by baseline antibody status as measured after the trial end, with the study as a random effect.

Basing the effect size for the interaction (i.e. the difference between the differences between the treatment groups) on the SD of the difference between the treatment groups in both anti-TPO groups and averaging the patient numbers within both groups, a difference in the difference of 6.9 points on the scale could be detected significantly with 80% power at a two-sided alpha of 0.05. The analysis was repeated for the per-protocol population, including all participants who pursued the trial regimen (i.e. on treatment at the time of the analysis being conducted).

### Evidence-based use of levothyroxine/liothyronine combinations in treating hypothyroidism: A consensus document [^112DtQc5]. Thyroid (2021). Low credibility.

Fourteen clinical trials have not shown a consistent benefit of combination therapy with levothyroxine (LT4) and liothyronine (LT3). Despite the publication of these trials, combination therapy is widely used, and patients reporting benefit continue to generate patient and physician interest in this area. Recent scientific developments may provide insight into this inconsistency and guide future studies.

- **Methods**: The American Thyroid Association (ATA), British Thyroid Association (BTA), and European Thyroid Association (ETA) held a joint conference on November 3, 2019 (live-streamed between Chicago and London) to review new basic science and clinical evidence regarding combination therapy with presentations and input from 12 content experts. After the presentations, the material was synthesized and used to develop summary statements of the state of knowledge. After review and revision of the material and summary statements, there was agreement that there was equipoise for a new clinical trial of combination therapy. Consensus statements encapsulating the implications of the material discussed with respect to the design of future clinical trials of LT4/LT3 combination therapy were generated. Authors voted upon the consensus statements. Iterative changes were made in several rounds of voting and after comments from ATA/BTA/ETA members.

- **Results**: Of 34 consensus statements available for voting, 28 received at least 75% agreement, with 13 receiving 100% agreement. Those with 100% agreement included studies being powered to study the effect of deiodinase and other factors.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^111Wrp1V]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

- **The clinical utility of TSH measurement**: Serum TSH is one of the most frequently measured analytes in the outpatient setting. Thyroid disease is common and can, in most cases, be easily diagnosed based on TSH measurement. In addition, the availability of high-quality, sensitive, specific, and inexpensive TSH assays makes screening for thyroid disease cost-effective. Because of the log-linear relationship of TSH to fT4, deviations of TSH concentration from population-specific reference intervals represent the preferred initial test for evaluation of thyroid function.

Understanding the indications for and limitations of TSH measurement and the interpretation of TSH results is essential for the practice of high-quality, cost-effective medicine. TSH is used to screen newborns for primary congenital hypothyroidism and to screen adults at risk for thyroid disease. It is important to note that primary congenital hypothyroidism is an endocrine emergency because delays in initiating treatment result in an irreversible loss of cognitive function. Accordingly, turnaround time from specimen collection to patient follow-up represents a major consideration in the implementation and quality assessment of newborn screening programs.

Interpreting the results for these apparently similar indications for TSH measurement is, however, very different. Patient age is an important factor that must be considered when interpreting TSH results. For example, TSH concentrations in newborns less than 3 days of age are difficult to interpret due to the postnatal TSH surge.

### Congenital hypothyroidism: Screening and management [^116WNecU]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

When considering medical management for congenital hypothyroidism, particularly in relation to levothyroxine dosing and administration, the AAP 2023 guidelines advise against the use of liothyronine in general practice. Liothyronine should only be initiated in consultation with a pediatric endocrinologist for patients exhibiting persistent severe resistance to thyroid hormone — characterized by elevated TSH levels despite elevated fT4 — if adequate control cannot be achieved with levothyroxine alone.

### Levothyroxine dose and risk of fractures in older adults: Nested case-control study [^113JDiSi]. BMJ (2011). High credibility.

As levothyroxine requirements decrease with age, iatrogenic hyperthyroidism becomes more common in older people. Despite this, studies show that levothyroxine dosage adjustments are often not made as individuals age, either because thyroid dysfunction monitoring is not conducted or dose adjustments identified by monitoring are not implemented.

While the optimal levothyroxine dose for adults is 1.6–1.8 µg/kg/day, older adults often require much lower doses to achieve euthyroidism. Most guidelines recommend a reduced dose of 0.5 µg/kg/day for seniors over the age of 65. While the dosages observed in our study were largely appropriate for younger adults, the average daily doses in the medium and high dose categories (0.076 and 0.122 mg/day, respectively) may have exceeded the recommendations for most people over 70.

It is also possible that levothyroxine treatment could have detrimental effects on bone, even in individuals who are biochemically euthyroid. Recent findings have shown that the risk of vertebral fractures in older adults increases when serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels are at the lower end of the normal range. Further research is necessary to determine whether bone health is affected by "euthyroid" doses of levothyroxine and if treatment targets should be adjusted for older individuals, whose true "normal" thyroid-stimulating hormone levels may be higher than previously thought.

### Study protocol: A randomised controlled trial on the clinical effects of levothyroxine treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism in people aged 80 years and over [^115MxVGg]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

A maximum of two levothyroxine up-titrations at the start of the trial and one up-titration at 12 and 24-month (± 1 month) intervals with repeated TSH measurements after 6–8 weeks ensures adequate levothyroxine treatment while avoiding potential over-replacement. The maximum possible dose of levothyroxine is 150 micrograms.

A mock titration adopting an adaptive schedule is performed in the placebo group by the data centre. A similar proportion of placebo patients will have up and down titrations of study medication as the intervention group to ensure the number of tablets and assessments is similar in both groups.

Because all thyroid function measurements are available only to the data centre, the clinical investigators remain fully blinded to the treatment allocation process during the trial.

Accountability logs recording the quantities of study medication dispensed to and returned from study participants, batch numbers, and expiry dates are available for all study drug movements.

- **Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated study medication**: If overt biochemical hypothyroidism is identified (TSH > 20 mU/L and/or fT4 below the reference range), a second TSH with fT4 within 2 weeks is requested. Upon confirmation of biochemical hypothyroidism, the participant will be withdrawn from the study treatment and referred to the General Practitioner (GP) for usual care. If overt biochemical hyperthyroidism is identified (TSH < 0.4 mU/L) in the placebo group, or consecutively in the treatment group despite downtitrations, the participant will be withdrawn from the study treatment.

### Treating hypothyroidism is not always easy: When to treat subclinical hypothyroidism, TSH goals in the elderly, and alternatives to levothyroxine monotherapy [^116E5fuv]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The majority of patients with hypothyroidism feel better when levothyroxine treatment restores thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations to normal. Increasingly, a significant minority of patients remain symptomatic and are dissatisfied with their treatment. Overzealous treatment of symptomatic patients with subclinical hypothyroidism may contribute to dissatisfaction among hypothyroidism patients, as potential hypothyroid symptoms in patients with minimal hypothyroidism rarely respond to treatment.

Thyroid hormone prescriptions have increased by 30% in the United States in the last decade. The diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism should be confirmed by repeat thyroid function tests ideally obtained at least two months later, as 62% of elevated TSH levels may revert to normal spontaneously. Generally, treatment is not necessary unless the TSH exceeds 7.0–10 mIU/L.

In double-blinded randomized controlled trials, treatment does not improve symptoms or cognitive function if the TSH is less than 10 mIU/L. While cardiovascular events may be reduced in patients under age 65 with subclinical hypothyroidism who are treated with levothyroxine, treatment may be harmful in elderly patients with subclinical hypothyroidism.

TSH goals are age-dependent, with a 97.5 percentile (upper limit of normal) of 3.6 mIU/L for patients under age 40, and 7.5 mIU/L for patients over age 80. In some hypothyroid patients who are dissatisfied with treatment, especially those with a polymorphism in type 2 deiodinase, combined treatment with levothyroxine and liothyronine may be preferred.

### Optimal levothyroxine dosing strategy for immune checkpoint inhibitor-related hypothyroidism: A retrospective study [^1163XWD9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-related hypothyroidism is mostly irreversible, and prompt thyroid hormone replacement therapy is crucial, especially for patients undergoing neoadjuvant immunotherapy. This study aimed to propose a novel titration strategy for ICI-related hypothyroidism, evaluate levothyroxine (LT4) dose differences between hypothyroidism patterns, and develop a predictive equation for the optimal LT4 dose.

The research was conducted as a retrospective study in a tertiary academic hospital and involved 109 patients with ICI-related hypothyroidism. The interventions compared rapid versus conventional titration strategies, with the main outcome measures being the time to achieve normal free thyroxine (FT4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels.

Results indicated that patients with transient thyrotoxicosis followed by overt hypothyroidism (Toxic-OHypo) required higher LT4 doses to achieve a euthyroid state compared to isolated overt hypothyroidism, with a mean difference of 0.23 μg/kg/day (95% confidence interval, 0.08–0.38). In patients with ICI-related overt hypothyroidism and no cardiac disease, who had elevated TSH levels within 4 weeks of the last documented low or normal TSH, a rapid titration strategy was implemented. This strategy significantly improved the cumulative incidence of achieving normal FT4 and TSH levels compared to the conventional titration strategy (hazard ratio [HR], 4.44; 95% CI, 2.24–8.82; HR, 4.11; 95% CI, 2.18–7.73, respectively), with a comparable safety profile. The predicted LT4 dose at euthyroid state (µg/kg/day) was calculated using the formula: (-0.016×body weight) + (0.109×baseline TSH level).

Among the strengths, our study is the largest RCT analyzing the effect of levothyroxine in subclinical hypothyroidism (SHypo) for older persons according to antibody status. Although SHypo is often found along with positive anti-TPO, very few studies have investigated this aspect, and they have been mostly small, often emphasizing young participants and having a short follow-up. Another strength is the use of the same laboratory assay for all antibody measurements, which minimizes measurement bias. The internal validity is strengthened by the use of standardized scores in two fully blinded RCTs to assess nonspecific symptoms such as hypothyroid symptoms and tiredness, which have been shown to be sensitive to change. In addition, we analyzed a wide range of patient-centered outcomes of clinical relevance in an elderly population.

This study has limitations. First, the participants were all ≥ 65 years old and mostly Caucasian, and it is unknown whether these results apply to other populations. Second, the number of participants with positive antibody status was relatively small (N = 180), albeit far larger than in all previous trials (N = 40–100), and our study had adequate power to detect a clinically meaningful difference in the treatment effect. Third, the randomization was not stratified by antibody status and some baseline imbalances were found, but adjustment for these imbalances yielded similar results. Fourth, there was no information on over-the-counter medications (e.g. multivitamin use such as biotin), which could interact with thyroid function measurements.

### The tablet trial: Limitations and implications [^117B7JMD]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The TABLET trial is a large, multicenter, double-blind RCT of levothyroxine treatment versus placebo in euthyroid thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO Ab)-positive women, conducted in 49 centers in the UK. The study enrolled 952 women with a history of miscarriage or infertility, aged 16–40, who were trying to conceive within the next year. Subjects were treated pre-pregnancy with a fixed dose of levothyroxine (50 μg) and continued that treatment throughout gestation. The primary outcome was live births after 34 weeks of gestation; secondary outcomes included miscarriage, preterm delivery, and neonatal outcomes. The study showed no significant difference between the two groups in any of the outcomes.

This study has several important strengths. First, it had a large sample size and was adequately powered to detect a difference in the primary outcome. Second, treatment with levothyroxine was started before conception. Third, high rates of follow-up (98.7%) were achieved for the primary outcome. Finally, subgroup analyses were performed with respect to important variables.

However, the study has some significant limitations. First, the dose of levothyroxine was fixed at 50 μg and was not adjusted during pregnancy, contrary to the American Thyroid Association guidelines. Second, the TPO Ab test was not standardized but ran on 22 different analyzers, with borderline or equivocal results considered positive. This could have resulted in some women without thyroid autoimmunity being misclassified in the TPO Ab-positive category.

### The magnitude of increased levothyroxine requirements in hypothyroid pregnant women depends upon the etiology of the hypothyroidism [^116mfndN]. Thyroid (2009). Low credibility.

In the United States, many women with hypothyroidism are on thyroid hormone replacement during pregnancy. The optimal management strategy for thyroid hormone dosing in hypothyroid women during pregnancy is controversial. We hypothesized that dosage requirements during pregnancy might differ depending upon the nature of the underlying hypothyroidism.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective review of 45 pregnancies from 38 women whose hypothyroidism was managed during pregnancy. Thyroid function tests were obtained when pregnancy was confirmed, then every 4–8 weeks. The thyrotropin (TSH) goal was 0.4–4.1 microU/mL (SI unit conversion: multiply TSH by 1.0 for mIU/L).

- **Results**: On average, the entire group required a cumulative increase from baseline in levothyroxine (LT(4)) dosage of 13% in the first trimester, 26% in the second trimester, and 26% in the third trimester (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively). Average baseline LT(4) dose for patients with primary hypothyroidism was 92.5 ± 32.0 microg daily. These patients required small cumulative dose increases of 11%, 16%, and 16% from baseline in each trimester, respectively (p values = 0.125, 0.016, 0.016). Average baseline LT(4) dose for patients with hypothyroidism resulting from treated Graves' disease or goiter was 140.4 ± 62.4 microg daily. These patients required the largest cumulative increases in LT(4) dosage (first trimester, 27%; second trimester, 51%; third trimester, 45%; p = 0.063, 0.063, 0.063, respectively). Average baseline LT(4) dose for patients with thyroid cancer was 153.2 ± 30.

### No effect of levothyroxine and levothyroxine-induced subclinical thyrotoxicosis on the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib in healthy male subjects [^115EZZwj]. Thyroid (2017). Low credibility.

Statistical analyses were conducted with the safety set defined as all subjects who received at least one dose of either study medication (sorafenib or levothyroxine). The pharmacokinetic analysis set, which evaluated the effect of levothyroxine on the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib, included subjects with valid pharmacokinetic profiles of sorafenib in both period 1 (sorafenib alone) and period 2 (sorafenib plus levothyroxine). The pharmacodynamic population comprised all subjects with valid baseline and at least one valid post-baseline thyroid function data point (TSH, total, and free T3 and T4). Approximately 25 eligible subjects were planned for treatment, anticipating around 20 evaluable individuals.

Statistical evaluation utilized SAS v9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC). Quantitative pharmacodynamic and laboratory safety data were summarized using arithmetic mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. These summary statistics were provided for both original data and changes from baseline when applicable. For pharmacodynamic variables, the baseline of pharmacodynamic parameters was defined as the last pre-dose measurements taken before the first administration of sorafenib in period 2. Qualitative data, such as adverse event data, were summarized by frequency.

The plasma concentration versus time profiles of sorafenib and its metabolite M-2 were separately summarized by treatment. Geometric means and coefficients of variation were calculated for the concentrations at each sampling time point.

### Should the levothyroxine starting dose be tailored to disease severity in neonates with congenital hypothyroidism [^113wst2w]. Nature Clinical Practice. Endocrinology & Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Early levothyroxine treatment is crucial to minimize neurocognitive impairment associated with congenital hypothyroidism. In this Practice Point commentary, I discuss the findings, implications, and limitations of the study of Mathai et al. in which neonates with congenital hypothyroidism were treated with variable initial doses of levothyroxine. A high initial levothyroxine dose was used for newborn babies with athyreosis, an intermediate dose for those with ectopic glands, and a low dose for those with dyshormonogenesis. Serum free T(4) levels normalized within 2 weeks, but serum TSH levels within up to 4 weeks. A dose adjustment (mostly a dose reduction) was required in about half of the neonates in the first 2 weeks of life. As Mathai et al. carried out no neuropsychological tests, we do not know if their approach has a more beneficial effect on neurocognitive outcomes than other treatment strategies. Nevertheless, as tailoring the levothyroxine dose to severity rapidly normalized serum free T(4) levels, one would predict a beneficial effect of this approach on neurocognitive outcome.

### Study protocol: A randomised controlled trial on the clinical effects of levothyroxine treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism in people aged 80 years and over [^111gP4aT]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Participants are blinded to treatment allocation by using matching tablets and packaging for levothyroxine and placebo. All study personnel remain blinded for the duration of the trial through remote analysis of laboratory results of TSH in the data centre, ensuring the trial stays double-blinded. GPs will remain blinded to treatment allocation and TSH tests unless otherwise required in the event of an emergency medical situation. An interactive voice response system at the data centre allows for individual emergency allocation information to be released to an unblinded study physician through 24-hour telephone access. All participants will learn the treatment allocation within 15 working days of receiving the final visit and completing all the data to aid in any further treatment decisions with the GP.

All laboratory tests for TSH and fT4 are performed at the local GP and clinical laboratories. The results in the treatment phase are uploaded to the independent data centre, which in turn advises the study site on dose titration through the dedicated trial web portal. The study team remains unaware of the results of the thyroid function testing. Additionally, all cooperating GPs are asked to refrain from additional thyroid function measurements to ensure adequate blinding.

### The ages and TSH values of patients being prescribed levothyroxine [^113mX8D4]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Levothyroxine is a commonly prescribed medication. Some data suggest that levothyroxine may be initiated for mild degrees of hypothyroidism and used without considering age-specific reference ranges or individual patient factors when prescribing.

- **Methods**: The electronic medical record of a health care system operating in the Washington, D.C., and Maryland area was interrogated to determine the number of patients who were being prescribed levothyroxine during the period 2008–2016. This included the number of prescriptions supplied, an associated diagnosis of hypothyroidism, and whether the prescriptions were new or existing. Information was also extracted about the age of patients receiving prescriptions and the thyroid-stimulating hormone level documented prior to levothyroxine initiation.

- **Results**: Although the number of levothyroxine prescriptions provided annually increased over this period, when corrected for the number of patients in the database, the percentage of patients receiving levothyroxine prescriptions showed a slight downward trend. Levothyroxine was both most frequently prescribed and initiated in those aged 50–59 years and 60–69 years. The doses of levothyroxine most commonly prescribed were 50 µg and 100 µg. The pattern of levothyroxine doses being used was unaffected by whether a diagnosis of hypothyroidism was documented. Levothyroxine prescription initiation was associated with mean thyroid-stimulating hormone values that were modestly elevated, ranging from 7.5 to 13.8 mIU/L.

- **Conclusion**: T

### Optimal thyroid hormone replacement [^115a2k8B]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common endocrinopathy, and levothyroxine is frequently prescribed. Despite the basic tenets of initiating and adjusting levothyroxine being agreed on, there are many nuances and complexities to consistently maintaining euthyroidism. Understanding the impact of patient weight and residual thyroid function on the initial levothyroxine dosage and consideration of age, comorbidities, thyrotropin goal, life stage, and quality of life as levothyroxine is adjusted can be challenging and continually evolving. Because levothyroxine is a lifelong medication, it is important to avoid risks from periods of overtreatment or undertreatment.

For the subset of patients not restored to baseline health with levothyroxine, causes arising from all aspects of the patient's life (coexistent medical conditions, stressors, lifestyle, psychosocial factors) should be broadly considered. If such factors do not appear to be contributing, and biochemical euthyroidism has been successfully maintained, there may be benefit in a trial of combination therapy with levothyroxine and liothyronine. This is not supported by the majority of randomized clinical trials but may be supported by other studies providing lower-quality evidence and by animal studies. Given this discrepancy, it is important that any trial of combination therapy be continued only as long as patient benefit is being enjoyed.

Monitoring for adverse effects, particularly in older or frail individuals, is necessary, and combination therapy should not be used during pregnancy. A sustained-release liothyronine preparation has

### Thyroid antibodies and levothyroxine effects in subclinical hypothyroidism: A pooled analysis of two randomized controlled trials [^113WyXiu]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SHypo), defined as an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level with free thyroxine (fT4) in the reference range, affects up to 6%–18% of older adults. Although clinical guidelines differ on which patients should be treated, SHypo is frequently treated with levothyroxine (LT4). This contributes to levothyroxine being one of the most prescribed medications in the United States and Europe.

In older adults, two recent international, double-blind, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) — The Thyroid Hormone Replacement for Untreated Older Adults with Subclinical Hypothyroidism (TRUST) and the IEMO80+ Thyroid Trial — and a meta-analysis found no benefit of levothyroxine on hypothyroid symptoms, tiredness, or quality of life, even among those with high symptom burden. However, specific subgroups might still benefit, such as patients with autoimmune thyroid disease.

### Thyroid hormones treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism: A clinical practice guideline [^114LBMH9]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomized controlled trials, which could alter practice.

- **Practice**: Guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

- **Recommendation**: The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH > 20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤ 30 years old).

- **How this guideline was created**: A guideline panel, including patients, clinicians, and methodologists, produced this recommendation in adherence to standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

- **The evidence**: The systematic review included 21 trials with 2,192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid-related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high-quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low-quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

### Thyroid laboratory testing and management in women on thyroid replacement before pregnancy and associated pregnancy outcomes [^111mqQyA]. Thyroid (2021). Low credibility.

Women with hypothyroidism before pregnancy often require an increase in their levothyroxine dosage to maintain a euthyroid state during pregnancy. The objectives of this study were to investigate the following:

- **The frequency and distribution of thyrotropin (TSH) testing and levothyroxine dosage adjustment by gestational age**: The study examined how often TSH testing occurred and how levothyroxine dosages were adjusted throughout pregnancy.

- **The magnitude of levothyroxine increase by the underlying etiology of hypothyroidism**: The research analyzed how different causes of hypothyroidism affected the required increase in levothyroxine.

- **The relationship of overtreatment or undertreatment during pregnancy with adverse pregnancy outcomes among women using thyroid replacement before pregnancy**: The study focused on determining the outcomes of improper TSH level management.

A retrospective cohort study of pregnancies in women on thyroid replacement before pregnancy was conducted in Alberta, Canada. Women using thyroid replacement anytime during the two years before pregnancy who delivered between October 2014 and September 2017 were included. Delivery records, physician billing, and laboratory and pharmacy administrative data were linked.

Outcomes included characteristics of TSH testing, levothyroxine dosing, and pregnancy outcomes. The frequency and gestational timing of TSH testing and levothyroxine adjustments were calculated. Multiple logistic regression was used to test whether pregnancies with TSH < 0.10 mIU/L (overtreatment) or TSH ≥ 10.00 mIU/L (undertreatment), compared with control pregnancies (TSH 0.10–4.00 mIU/L), were associated with adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes.

Results showed that of the 10,680 deliveries, 8774 (82.2%) underwent TSH testing at least once during pregnancy, at a median gestational age of six weeks.

### Patient-tailored levothyroxine dosage with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling: A novel approach after total thyroidectomy [^112Hggkk]. Thyroid (2021). Low credibility.

The development and validation of the DAT were based on pilot data, as detailed in the supplemental data. The model parameters were derived from four blood draws analyzed for TSH and fT4 during the first two weeks of LT4 therapy. A log-linear relationship between TSH and fT4 was assumed, and individual TSH-fT4 responses and fT4 pharmacokinetics were modeled using population data. Individual TSH-fT4 responses are illustrated in Figure 1.

The DAT's efficacy was tested in a prospective multicenter trial where participants were randomized to either the DAT application group or the control group. An automated stratified randomization was employed, based on diagnosis and participating hospital. Following surgery, before randomization, all participants received an initial LT4 dosage, usually between 100 and 150 μg/day, adjusted according to diagnosis, body weight, age, and comorbidities. Pre-LT4 ingestion blood samples were collected twice per week for two weeks postoperatively (Figure 2). To reduce measurement variation, patients were instructed to use the medication and provide all blood samples in the morning. On blood sample days, LT4 intake was postponed until after the blood draw.

Two to three weeks post-surgery, participants received a follow-up call advising them on whether to maintain or alter the dosage. In the DAT group, the surgeon was assisted by the DAT, which provided a graphical plot of the predicted fT4 and TSH levels based on the suggested dosage change (Figure 3). Conversely, the DAT was disabled in the control group.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116gv3zG]. Thyroid (2020). Low credibility.

This work addressed diagnosis alone. Extrapolation of our findings appears logical, and there is no apparent a priori reason as to why TSH levels should be preferred over thyroid hormone levels in the context of monitoring thyroid treatments. Randomized trials might, nevertheless, reveal that additional considerations apply in these circumstances. Though there was no suggestion in the studies we examined of a difference with individuals on thyroid hormone replacement, their numbers were small.

In summary, there is now matching theoretical and empirical evidence from a variety of sources suggesting that the thyroid status of an individual is better defined by thyroid hormone levels than TSH levels. There is evidence of a continuum of thyroid hormone effects along the continuum of thyroid hormone levels, with a possible optimum around the middle of the reference range. Though TSH levels remain good screening tests for overt thyroid dysfunction, it is theoretically and empirically more sound to rely on thyroid hormone and especially fT4 levels to classify the thyroid state.

This work should result in a simplification of the understanding of thyroid physiology and pathophysiology and bring it more into line with the understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of other parameters, whereby the status of a parameter is judged by its level rather than the level of any controlling factor. Reconsideration of the TSH-based diagnostic approach to thyroid function appears to be indicated. In turn, this would appear to have implications for clinical guidelines.

Regarding medical management for central hypothyroidism, and more specifically with respect to thyroid replacement therapy, the ES 2016 guidelines recommend initiating levothyroxine therapy at doses usually around 1.6 mcg/kg/day. This dosage should be adjusted based on clinical context, age, and free T4 levels to achieve serum free T4 levels in the mid-to-upper half of the reference range.

### Levothyroxine sodium [^1164w54X]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Drugs known to affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics**: Many drugs affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g. synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to levothyroxine sodium injection (see Tables 1–3).

- **Antidiabetic therapy**: Addition of levothyroxine to antidiabetic or insulin therapy may result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Careful monitoring of glycemic control is recommended.

- **Oral anticoagulants**: Levothyroxine increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy; therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments.

- **Digitalis glycosides**: Levothyroxine may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may be decreased when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides.

- **Antidepressant therapy**: Use of tricyclic (e.g. amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g. maprotiline) antidepressants and levothyroxine may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system stimulation. Levothyroxine may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on levothyroxine may result in increased effects.
