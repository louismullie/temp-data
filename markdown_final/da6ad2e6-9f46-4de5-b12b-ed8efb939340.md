## Question

lasb and workup for bad nutrition

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the laboratory workup and diagnostic assessment of malnutrition. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to frame the GLIM two-step process and validated screening in different populations. Then, I should verify the phenotypic and etiologic criteria and how physical exam and body composition methods fit. Next, I will check the role and limits of laboratory testing, followed by functional measures. After that, I need to confirm the GLIM diagnostic algorithm and its validity, distinguish malnutrition from related syndromes, and consider disease-specific nuances. Finally, I should ensure documentation, coding, and a plan for reassessment are clearly articulated with appropriate citations integrated at each step.

> Let me first confirm the screening foundation before ordering any labs or advanced assessments, because GLIM emphasizes a two-step pathway: screen to identify risk, then assess to diagnose and grade severity; I should not skip this, even if clinical suspicion is high [^112RkrTY]. I need to check that the tool matches the setting: NRS-2002 in hospitalized adults has high-grade evidence, while MST, MUST, and MNA-SF are also validated options; oncology outpatients can use PG-SGA or brief tools like MST, MUST, or NRS-2002, noting recommended cut-points; and I must remember that tool performance varies and can miss cases, so a negative screen does not fully exclude malnutrition when the bedside picture is concerning [^113i7cuf] [^114wWZiD] [^116tfseB] [^112aswhX].

> Wait, I should not generalize adult tools to pediatrics or very old adults without verification; the pediatric context requires pediatric-specific screens like PNST or STAMP and interpretation with z-scores across time, and for older adults the MNA-SF is commonly used and validated, while I also need to consider that growth references and anthropometry must be contextualized to population and trajectory rather than a single cross-sectional threshold [^116FQK9a] [^113i7cuf] [^111SKi8R] [^116JFLPV].

> Next, I will examine the clinical history to establish etiologic criteria, because GLIM requires me to pair at least one etiologic with at least one phenotypic criterion; I should document intake or assimilation deficits such as sustained intake below 50% of needs, dysphagia, malabsorption, or NPO status, and I should confirm the disease/inflammatory burden from conditions like cancer, infection, IBD, liver disease, recent surgery, or trauma, while quantifying weight loss over appropriate intervals to anchor the severity and noting functional decline as supportive information rather than a diagnostic anchor [^112RkrTY] [^111PAW93] [^114csJ1P].

> Hold on, I need to ensure the physical examination maps to phenotypic criteria correctly: I should measure weight and height to calculate BMI using age-specific thresholds, inspect for non-volitional weight loss, and assess muscle mass using feasible methods; in resource-limited settings, calf circumference or mid-arm muscle measures can be used, whereas in resource-available environments DXA, BIA, CT, or ultrasound are appropriate, being mindful that obesity can mask muscle depletion and lead to sarcopenic obesity that requires adjusted approaches [^111PAW93] [^114HHeae] [^113nuxPu] [^117X3G24].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said albumin and prealbumin diagnose malnutrition — let me correct that before proceeding; albumin and prealbumin primarily reflect inflammation and disease severity, not nutritional reserves, and should be used for prognosis and context rather than diagnosis, so I should order CRP to interpret negative acute phase reactants and reserve selective labs for specific deficiencies or risks like refeeding syndrome; electrolytes, phosphate, magnesium, hemoglobin, and targeted micronutrients are appropriate when clinically suspected, whereas a routine broad panel without a question in mind is low yield [^116kQyU5] [^117VkfDj] [^113rv9gM] [^1124WPV8] [^117FxJKk].

> I should double-check the role of functional and body composition assessments in this framework; GLIM excludes muscle strength from diagnostic criteria, so handgrip dynamometry is best used to monitor function and prognosis, while imaging-based muscle mass assessment such as CT at L3, when available from other indications, or DXA and BIA for whole-body composition, can substantiate low muscle mass, and simple performance tests like SPPB or gait speed track consequences rather than define the diagnosis [^113nuxPu] [^117X3G24] [^117VkfDj].

> Let me now apply the GLIM diagnostic algorithm carefully: diagnosis requires at least one phenotypic criterion — non-volitional weight loss beyond defined thresholds, low BMI for age, or confirmed low muscle mass — plus at least one etiologic criterion — reduced intake or assimilation or disease/inflammation; then I should grade severity based on phenotypic abnormalities, ensuring my weight loss and BMI thresholds are age-appropriate and that muscle mass reductions meet validated, population-specific cutoffs where available [^112RkrTY] [^111PAW93] [^1173aBzX].

> Hold on, I should verify GLIM's performance characteristics across settings so I don't overstate certainty; GLIM demonstrates good diagnostic accuracy versus SGA and PG-SGA in mixed settings and has construct validity in ICU cohorts when measured early, though ICU sensitivity varies and heterogeneity can limit estimates, which means I may need to supplement with clinical judgment and repeated assessments in critical illness [^113nRFyZ] [^117Q3Vod].

> But wait, what if I'm dealing with cachexia or primary sarcopenia; I need to distinguish overlap syndromes because treatments differ: cachexia typically includes inflammation-driven muscle loss and may be appraised with tools like CASCO, sarcopenia prioritizes low muscle mass plus reduced strength/performance, and starvation-related malnutrition is intake-driven without significant inflammation; clarifying the driver informs whether I should emphasize anti-catabolic strategies, treat underlying disease, or focus on repletion and rehabilitation [^115qM4fh] [^114csJ1P].

> Next, I should review disease-specific considerations since thresholds and strategies can shift by context; in chronic liver disease and ACLF, albumin is especially confounded and RFH-NPT is recommended for screening, oncology care benefits from PG-SGA integration and frequent reassessment under a persistent inflammatory milieu, ICU identification at admission is feasible but requires vigilance, dementia care should include routine weight monitoring and person-centered assessment, and pediatric pathways require z-scores, longitudinal change, and dietitian access [^113YzkwZ] [^114wWZiD] [^117Q3Vod] [^115jQxwi] [^111SKi8R].

> I need to ensure meticulous documentation and coding because under-recognition and under-coding of malnutrition are common and costly; I should explicitly record the phenotypic and etiologic criteria, severity grade, and objective measures such as percent weight loss, BMI, and muscle assessments, and use appropriate ICD-10-CM codes for protein-energy malnutrition while re-screening during hospitalization given the rapid trajectory changes seen with acute illness [^111BdY3G].

> Let me reconsider the cadence of reassessment and monitoring so I don't miss deterioration or refeeding complications; inpatients — especially critically ill — benefit from reassessment within 3–7 days or sooner if unstable, oncology outpatients warrant monthly reassessment, and across settings I should track weight trends, intake, functional markers like handgrip, and inflammatory markers such as CRP, while closely monitoring phosphate, magnesium, and potassium during nutrition initiation to detect and manage refeeding risk [^114csJ1P] [^117FxJKk] [^111BdY3G].

> Finally, I should double-check the key principles to avoid drift: screen first and assess second because no single test is diagnostic; treat labs as adjuncts with CRP context for albumin and prealbumin; prioritize muscle mass over strength for diagnosis while using strength for prognosis; let etiology guide therapy; and validate cutoffs and tools locally, particularly in pediatrics and diverse populations where growth and body composition references must be contextualized to avoid misclassification [^112RkrTY] [^116kQyU5] [^113nuxPu] [^116JFLPV].

For suspected malnutrition, use a **two-step approach**, first screening with a validated tool (NRS-2002, MUST, MST, or MNA-SF) to identify risk [^117Fgfdd] [^113i7cuf], then confirming and grading severity with GLIM criteria (≥ 1 phenotypic plus ≥ 1 etiologic criterion) [^112RkrTY]. Do not use **albumin or prealbumin** to **diagnose malnutrition**; they reflect inflammation, not nutrition status [^113rv9gM] [^116kQyU5] [^117VkfDj]. Instead, use CBC, CMP, CRP, and targeted micronutrients to identify deficiencies and **monitor refeeding risk** [^117FxJKk] [^112WsU7X]. Assess muscle mass with DXA, BIA, CT, or ultrasound [^115xJmdZ] [^114HHeae], and use handgrip strength for function [^113nuxPu]. Reassess regularly and tailor interventions to the underlying cause and severity [^114csJ1P].

---

## Recommended laboratory tests for malnutrition assessment

Laboratory tests identify deficiencies, monitor refeeding risk, and guide therapy [^112WsU7X], but **no single test diagnoses malnutrition** [^116kQyU5].

| **Laboratory test** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|
| Complete blood count (CBC) | Detects anemia, infection, inflammation |
| Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) | Assesses electrolytes, renal/hepatic function, glucose |
| C-reactive protein (CRP) | Indicates inflammation; interpret nutrition markers accordingly |
| Serum albumin and prealbumin | Reflect inflammation/disease severity, not nutrition status [^116kQyU5] [^113rv9gM] |
| Serum transferrin | Iron status; limited by inflammation |
| Serum ferritin | Iron stores; acute-phase reactant |
| Serum vitamin B12, folate, vitamin D | Identify specific deficiencies |
| Serum zinc, copper, selenium | Identify trace element deficiencies |
| Serum phosphate, magnesium, potassium | Monitor for refeeding syndrome risk [^117FxJKk] |

---

## Clinical assessment tools and criteria

Clinical tools complement labs by evaluating intake, weight change, and body composition, and **GLIM provides a standardized diagnosis** [^112RkrTY].

- **GLIM criteria**: Requires ≥ 1 phenotypic (weight loss, low BMI, reduced muscle mass) and ≥ 1 etiologic (reduced intake/assimilation, inflammation) criterion [^112RkrTY].
- **Subjective global assessment (SGA)**: Integrates history and exam to classify nutrition status [^116RThQY].
- **Patient-generated subjective global assessment (PG-SGA)**: Adds patient input, useful in oncology [^114y8UH7].
- **Handgrip strength**: Assesses function; not a surrogate for muscle mass [^113nuxPu].

---

## Recommended screening tools

Validated screening tools quickly identify risk and trigger assessment; **choose tools based on setting and population** [^112aswhX].

| **Screening tool** | **Population/setting** | **Clinical application** |
|-|-|-|
| Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002) | Hospitalized adults | Identifies risk; guides intervention [^117Fgfdd] |
| Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) | Adults, community/hospital | Assesses risk; guides intervention [^113i7cuf] |
| Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF) | Older adults | Screens risk; guides intervention [^113i7cuf] |
| Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST) | Oncology outpatients | Screens risk; guides intervention [^114wWZiD] |

---

## Frequency of reassessment

Regular reassessment tracks changes and guides care; **the frequency depends on setting and risk**.

- **Hospitalized patients**: Reassess every 3–7 days or with clinical change.
- **Outpatients**: Reassess every 1–3 months or with clinical change [^114csJ1P].
- **Critically ill patients**: Reassess daily or with clinical change.

---

## Clinical implications of malnutrition

Malnutrition increases complications, length of stay, and mortality, and **early identification improves outcomes**.

- **Increased complications**: Higher infection and complication rates [^113rv9gM].
- **Longer hospital stay**: Prolonged LOS and higher costs [^114cNDx7].
- **Higher mortality**: Increased short- and long-term mortality [^112WsU7X].

---

## Conclusion

A structured approach — screening, assessment, and targeted labs — is essential for accurate diagnosis and management [^112RkrTY]. Early identification and intervention reduce **complications, LOS, and mortality**, improving patient outcomes [^114YAFvU] [^113rv9gM].

### Glim criteria for the diagnosis of malnutrition: A consensus report from the global clinical nutrition community [^112RkrTY]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). High credibility.

This initiative aims to build a global consensus around core diagnostic criteria for malnutrition in adults in clinical settings.

- **Methods**: The Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) was convened by several major global clinical nutrition societies. Empirical consensus was reached through a series of face-to-face meetings, telephone conferences, and e-mail communications.

- **Results**: A 2-step approach for the malnutrition diagnosis was selected. First, screening is used to identify at-risk status through any validated screening tool. Second, assessment is conducted for diagnosis and grading the severity of malnutrition. The malnutrition criteria were retrieved from existing approaches for screening and assessment. Potential criteria were subjected to a ballot among GLIM participants, resulting in the selection of three phenotypic criteria (non-volitional weight loss, low body mass index, and reduced muscle mass) and two etiologic criteria (reduced food intake or assimilation, and inflammation or disease burden). To diagnose malnutrition, at least one phenotypic criterion and one etiologic criterion should be present. Phenotypic metrics for grading severity are proposed, with the recommendation that etiologic criteria guide intervention and anticipated outcomes. The recommended approach supports the classification of malnutrition into four etiology-related diagnosis categories.

- **Conclusions**: A consensus scheme for diagnosing malnutrition in adults in clinical settings on a global scale is proposed. The next steps include securing endorsements from leading nutrition organizations.

### Perioperative nutritional assessment and management of patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery [^117VkfDj]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Biochemical markers**: In the past, serum albumin (Alb) was used as a nutritional indicator. However, today, we know that it leads to erroneous conclusions for two reasons: firstly, it has a relatively long half-life of about 20 days, and secondly, its values are also impacted by the presence of inflammation. Alb serves as a potent alternative measure for underlying disease burden, as inflammation is a significant factor in the development of protein-energy undernutrition (PEU) through its impact on dietary intake, protein use, and net protein catabolism. It is well known that acute injury can cause a radical decrease in Alb levels within 24 hours; therefore, Alb reflects the severity of disease and is not a direct measure of malnutrition. However, the concentration of Alb and serum prealbumin are used as indicators of nutritional status, albeit without great sensitivity. Nonetheless, it is recommended by the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) as a prognostic tool for complications and for use in surgical patients.

- **Other biochemical markers**: These include elevated C-reactive protein, high white blood cell count, or excessive blood glucose levels.

- **Clinical signs**: Clinical signs of inflammation may appear, including fever, hypothermia, or tachycardia, which may facilitate a causative-based diagnosis.

- **Subjective professional assessment**: This screening process can detect malnutrition when performed by experienced specialists. Hand grip strength should be used to document the reduction in physical function.

- **Specific malnutrition evaluation indices**: There are no clear boundaries that lead to safe conclusions about a patient's degree of malnutrition. More than 70 nutrition evaluation indices exist, but ambiguity remains in defining specific parameters.

### Malnutrition risk screening in adult oncology outpatients: An ASPEN systematic review and clinical recommendations [^114wWZiD]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

Malnutrition screening is not widely practiced in outpatient cancer centers. This review aims to determine the validity of malnutrition screening tools and provide recommendations for clinical use.

- **Methods**: Studies identified by a systematic review assessed the general validity of screening tools in adult oncology outpatients from five databases through 2022. The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) convened a working group of members from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Academy of Oncology Nurse and Patient Navigators, American Cancer Society, American Society for Clinical Oncology, American Society for Nutrition, American Society for Radiation Oncology, Association of Cancer Care Centers, and Oncology Nursing Society to answer the following questions: (1) should clinicians screen for malnutrition, (2) which malnutrition screening tools are recommended, and (3) what are the clinical applications for malnutrition risk screening in adult oncology outpatients?

- **Results**: Twenty of 738 studies met the criteria and were reviewed. Six screening tools with specific cut-points demonstrated validity and are recommended, including the Mini Nutritional Assessment (≤ 23.5), Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST; MST ≥ 2 and patient-led MST ≥ 2), Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST; MUST ≥ 1 and MUST ≥ 2), Nutrition Risk Screening-2002 (NRS-2002; NRS-2002 ≥ 2 and NRS-2002 ≥ 3), NUTRISCORE ≥ 5, and Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment Short Form (PG-SGA SF; PG-SGA SF ≥ 7 and PG-SGA SF ≥ 8).

- **Conclusion**: Six screening tools are valid for malnutrition risk screening in adult oncology outpatients.

### Prevalence and prognostic value of malnutrition in patients with IPF using three scoring systems [^116Fa1yP]. Respiratory Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

To describe the nutritional status of IPF patients, report clinical associations, and evaluate the prognostic value of their nutritional status in IPF.

- **Methods**: A total of 264 patients diagnosed with IPF at the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University between January 2011 and January 2021 were recruited. Three different scoring systems, including the nutritional risk index (NRI), controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score, and prognostic nutritional index (PNI), were used to describe the nutritional status of IPF patients.

- **Results**: This study investigated the prevalence of malnutrition in 264 IPF patients. The percentage with malnutrition varied from 37.5% with the NRI to 47.4% with the CONUT score and to 6.4% with the PNI. The moderate to severe malnutrition ranged from 10.2% to 31.1% across these indices, with PNI identifying only 4.9% in this category. Worsening malnutrition status was associated with a significantly higher incidence of all-cause mortality and IPF death regardless of the malnutrition index used, such as NRI (p < 0.05). When the normal nutrition of NRI was used as a reference, patients in the moderate to severe risk category remained at a higher risk of all-cause death (HR = 2.06 [1.25–3.41]) and IPF death (HR = 2.36 [1.35–4.15]). The adjusted multivariate analysis identified age (HR = 1.13 [1.08–1.20]), DLCO < 60% predicted (HR = 3.31 [1.24–9.42]), and the use of anti-fibrotic drugs (HR = 0.25 [0.10–0.60]) as independent predictors of mortality.

- **Conclusions**: Malnutrition is common among patients with IPF, and the baseline diagnosis of IPF is strongly related to increased mortality.

### Aspen-FELANPE clinical guidelines [^115cF7Fn]. JPEN Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for enterocutaneous fistula, and more specifically with respect to nutritional evaluation, the Aspen/FELANPE 2017 guidelines recommend diagnosing malnutrition based on nutrition history, which includes unintentional weight loss and estimation of energy/nutrient intake, as well as physical examination.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on acute-on-chronic liver failure [^113YzkwZ]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute-on-chronic liver failure, more specifically concerning nutritional assessment, the EASL 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining screening for malnutrition using validated tools, such as the RFH-NPT, in all patients with ACLF.

### Assessment and monitoring of uremic malnutrition [^112fUMJC]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Assessment and monitoring of protein and energy nutritional status are essential to prevent, diagnose, and treat uremic malnutrition, a condition highly prevalent and associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced kidney failure. Comprehensive assessments of protein and energy nutritional status can be achieved by several measurements to quantitatively and qualitatively estimate protein content in visceral and somatic body compartments, in addition to measurements of energy balance.

However, uremic malnutrition is a complex metabolic disorder in which not only is net nutrient intake lower than nutrient requirements, leading to decreased tissue function and loss of body mass, but it is also associated with many comorbid conditions. Therefore, a clinically meaningful assessment of uremic malnutrition should include methods that are able to assess clinical outcomes, identify the underlying diseases, and determine whether there is potential benefit from nutritional interventions.

Such assessment usually requires using multiple measurements concomitantly, with no definitive single method that can be considered a "gold standard". In this review, we describe the various types of methods to assess uremic malnutrition, expanding and updating data on the readily available methods, and discuss more precise techniques to estimate protein and energy homeostasis. Special considerations of specific methods related to their clinical and/or research applicability as they pertain to renal failure are also addressed.

### Adult nutrition assessment tutorial [^111VFemM]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

This tutorial presents a systematic approach to nutrition assessment based on a modern appreciation for the contributions of inflammation that serve as the foundation for newly proposed consensus definitions for malnutrition syndromes. Practical indicators of malnutrition and inflammation have been selected to guide diagnosis. These include medical/surgical history and clinical diagnosis, clinical signs and physical examination, anthropometric data, laboratories, dietary assessment, and functional outcomes. Knowledge of systematic nutrition assessment and appropriate diagnosis of malnutrition will help to guide proper interventions and expected outcomes.

### Glim consensus approach to diagnosis of malnutrition: A 5-year update [^117YBVYG]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). Low credibility.

The implementation survey identified that having another malnutrition diagnostic approach in place that was fully endorsed at the institutional or regional level was a barrier to the use of GLIM. However, the GLIM consensus approach was mainly intended to provide a feasible alternative for clinicians in clinical sites with more limited nutrition knowledge and resources rather than to displace other valid methods used by nutrition experts.

GLIM endorses core phenotypic and etiologic criteria that are already in widespread use throughout the world. It promotes the global use of these criteria that may, in turn, be readily used with other approaches. Some centers have harmonized the GLIM approach with preexisting methods, such as the AAIM and SGA. Because GLIM, AAIM, and SGA use similar variables, having staff members gather data using these established AAIM or SGA frameworks enables a crosswalk to the GLIM structure. Depending on the degree of regional investment in preexisting validated approaches to malnutrition diagnosis like AAIM or SGA, either adoption of GLIM or integration with GLIM may be considered.

### A practical approach to identifying pediatric disease-associated undernutrition: A position statement from the ESPGHAN special interest group on clinical malnutrition [^111SKi8R]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Disease-associated undernutrition (DAU) is still common in hospitalized children and is generally accepted to be associated with adverse effects on disease outcomes; hence, making proper identification and assessment essential in the management of the sick child. There are several barriers to routine screening, assessment, and treatment of sick children with poor nutritional status or DAU, including limited resources, lack of nutritional awareness, and lack of agreed nutrition policies.

We recommend all pediatric facilities to implement procedures for the identification of children with (risk of) DAU, including nutritional screening, criteria for further assessment to establish the diagnosis of DAU, and follow-up. Additionally, assessing weight and height in all children as a minimum is essential. There should also be opportunities for children at risk to be assessed by a hospital dietitian. An updated descriptive definition of pediatric DAU is proposed as follows: "Undernutrition is a condition resulting from imbalanced nutrition or abnormal utilization of nutrients which causes clinically meaningful adverse effects on tissue function and/or body size/composition with subsequent impact on health outcomes".

To facilitate comparison of undernutrition data, it is advised that, in addition to commonly used criteria for undernutrition such as z-scores, changes in these z-scores over time should be considered as an indicator requiring further assessment to establish a DAU diagnosis. Since the etiology of DAU is multifactorial, it is crucial to take a comprehensive approach in addressing it.

### Factors that impact patient outcome: Nutrition assessment [^116xjUa9]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Defining malnutrition and nutrition risk has been a topic of many papers and discussions throughout the modern literature. Multiple definitions have been proposed, ranging from simple body weight measurements to a more all-encompassing concept looking at disease-specific inflammatory states. Biochemical markers, elements of a history examination, physical examination findings, calculations, and technical tests have all been proposed to help further characterize and delineate those who might be at risk for malnutrition, translating to an increased risk of adverse outcomes after major surgery. The purpose of this paper is to summarize some of the most utilized and most reliable ways to determine nutrition status within the scope of the North American Surgical Nutrition Summit (2012) and discuss how to incorporate these methods into the way that patients are screened preoperatively for elective surgery.

### Cancer cachexia in adult patients: ESMO clinical practice guidelines [^114csJ1P]. ESMO Open (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for cancer-associated cachexia, particularly in terms of malnutrition risk, the ESMO 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining an objective assessment of nutritional and metabolic status. This should include weight, weight loss, body composition, inflammatory state, nutritional intake, and physical activity. Additionally, an examination for factors that interfere with maintaining or improving nutritional status should be conducted. These factors include nutrition impact symptoms, gastrointestinal dysfunction, chronic pain, and psychosocial distress in patients identified as being at nutritional risk. Nutritional assessments should be repeated regularly, typically monthly, to guide multicomponent anti-cachexia treatment.

### Nutritional assessment and support during continuous renal replacement therapy [^116kNNTw]. Seminars in Dialysis (2021). Low credibility.

Malnutrition is highly prevalent in patients with acute kidney injury, especially in those receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT). For the assessment of nutritional status, a combination of screening tools, anthropometry, and laboratory parameters is recommended rather than a single test. To avoid underfeeding and overfeeding during RRT, energy expenditure should be measured by indirect calorimetry or calculated using predictive equations. Nitrogen balance should be periodically measured to assess the degree of catabolism and to evaluate protein intake.

However, there is limited data for nutritional targets specifically for patients on RRT, such as protein intake. The composition of commercial solutions for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) varies. CRRT itself can be associated with both nutrient losses into the effluent fluid and caloric gain from dextrose, lactate, and citrate. The role of micronutrient supplementation and potential use of micronutrient-enriched CRRT solutions in this setting is unknown.

This review provides an overview of existing knowledge and uncertainties related to nutritional aspects in patients on CRRT and emphasizes the need for more research in this area.

### Espen guideline on nutrition and hydration in dementia - update 2024 [^115jQxwi]. Clinical Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for dementia, more specifically with respect to screening for malnutrition, the ESPEN 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining a systematic assessment in patients who screen positive. They suggest offering personalized intervention to reduce the risk and treat malnutrition and/or dehydration, along with monitoring and corresponding adjustment of interventions.

### Simple nutrition screening tool for pediatric inpatients [^116FQK9a]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Pediatric nutrition risk screening tools are not routinely implemented throughout many hospitals, despite prevalence studies demonstrating malnutrition is common in hospitalized children. Existing tools lack the simplicity of those used to assess nutrition risk in the adult population. This study reports the accuracy of a new, quick, and simple pediatric nutrition screening tool (PNST) designed to be used for pediatric inpatients.

- **Materials and methods**: The pediatric Subjective Global Nutrition Assessment (SGNA) and anthropometric measures were used to develop and assess the validity of 4 simple nutrition screening questions comprising the PNST. Participants were pediatric inpatients in 2 tertiary pediatric hospitals and 1 regional hospital.

- **Results**: Two affirmative answers to the PNST questions were found to maximize the specificity and sensitivity to the pediatric SGNA and body mass index (BMI) z scores for malnutrition in 295 patients. The PNST identified 37.6% of patients as being at nutrition risk, whereas the pediatric SGNA identified 34.2%. The sensitivity and specificity of the PNST compared with the pediatric SGNA were 77.8% and 82.1%, respectively. The sensitivity of the PNST at detecting patients with a BMI z score of less than -2 was 89.3%, and the specificity was 66.2%. Both the PNST and pediatric SGNA were relatively poor at detecting patients who were stunted or overweight, with the sensitivity and specificity being less than 69%.

- **Conclusion**: The PNST provides a sensitive, valid, and simpler alternative to existing pediatric nutrition screening tools.

### What is the level of nutrition care provided to older adults attending emergency departments? A scoping review [^115keL7b]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Following a malnutrition screening, a full nutrition assessment was reported in five studies. This included a nutritional assessment completed by a dietitian.

Seven studies reported that older adults identified as malnourished or at risk of malnutrition were discharged home, with rates ranging from 4% to 50%. These studies did not report a full nutrition assessment or describe a dietetic intervention.

- **Factors associated with malnutrition**: Factors reported to contribute to the risk of malnutrition included functional dependence, the severity of the acute episode related to emergency department admission, chronic diseases, anxiety and depressive syndromes, polypharmacy, assisted living, food insecurity, poor oral health, lack of transportation, frailty, and hospitalization.

A nutrition diagnosis was not reported in any of the included studies. In relation to the documentation by healthcare professionals, one study made a reference to malnutrition in healthcare records.

Pereria et al. (2015) conducted an independent review of physician and nursing records kept on patients with an MNA-SF score of 7 or lower. They screened for a positive response to a single-item question about malnutrition in the triage nursing note. They also looked for any other information in the records indicating a diagnosis or treatment for malnutrition. Among the malnourished patients, the single-item assessment either failed to identify malnutrition or was not completed.

### Should a single growth standard be used to judge the nutritional status of children under age 5 years globally? No [^116JFLPV]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Low credibility.

Universal growth standards for children under five years, considering the worldwide variation in healthy growth and numerous determinants of anthropometry, are imprecise measures of nutritional status, especially when used cross-sectionally. In constructing the global-use WHO growth standard, linear growth differences between contributing sites and the pooled mean were greater than 0.2 standard deviations in 37% of observations. Systematic reviews confirm even greater variability, notably amplified for weight-for-age and head-circumference-for-age metrics. Unsurprisingly, developed nations had higher growth dimensions, while low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) had lower ones.

Contextual growth references are better at predicting neonatal morbidities, pathological short stature, macrocephaly, cardiometabolic risk factors, and adult noncommunicable diseases compared to WHO standards. Child body composition also varies contextually, with greater adiposity despite comparable weights in South Asian populations. Hence, contextual references, although not perfect, are better suited for everyday practice and nutrition policy. Growth standards should only be used as a screening tool for clinical judgments, which should be aided by precise biomarkers.

### When is parenteral nutrition appropriate [^114CkXkH]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for parenteral nutrition, particularly concerning indications for initiation, ASPEN 2017 guidelines recommend initiating PN as soon as feasible in patients with baseline moderate-to-severe malnutrition if oral intake or enteral nutrition is not possible or sufficient.

### Glim consensus approach to diagnosis of malnutrition: A 5-year update [^1173aBzX]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

A final round of revision resulted in 100% of the working group supporting the conclusions of the update. Figure 1 summarizes the updates performed after the reevaluation process. In this update, each step and suggested amendments are discussed based on the new experience and knowledge accrued over the past 5 years.

- **Glim diagnostic scheme for screening, diagnostic assessment, and grading of malnutrition**: First, identify subjects with risk factors for malnutrition. Second, apply the two etiologic criteria and the three phenotypic criteria. When at least one of each set of criteria is fulfilled, the diagnosis of malnutrition is confirmed. Third, determine severity, i.e. moderate or severe malnutrition based on the degree of aberration in the phenotypic criteria. This figure is adapted from the original 2019 consensus paper.

### Aspen-FELANPE clinical guidelines [^114kvPT4]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for enterocutaneous fistula, and more specifically with respect to nutritional evaluation, the ASPEN/FELANPE 2017 guidelines recommend assessing patients with ECF for malnutrition at the time of diagnosis. Periodic nutrition assessments should be obtained if malnutrition is not present at baseline, as patients with fistulas have a high likelihood of becoming malnourished due to nutrient malabsorption, fluid and electrolyte losses, and sepsis.

### Nutritional assessment: its role in the provision of nutritional support [^116kQyU5]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Generalized undernutrition is common in hospital patients and in the community. It is frequently unrecognized and is associated with a range of adverse consequences that contribute to increased morbidity and mortality. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommends that all individuals engaging with healthcare or admitted to residential homes in the community should be screened for undernutrition. Laboratory investigations have little place in the diagnosis of undernutrition; this is primarily a clinical process.

In particular, the measurement of serum albumin concentration, though widely promulgated in the past as an index of nutritional status, is worthless for this purpose. Laboratory investigations are, however, useful to diagnose specific nutritional deficiencies (e.g. of trace elements) and to monitor the provision of nutritional support, detect metabolic complications, and assess its adequacy, for which the measurement of serum prealbumin concentrations, particularly in conjunction with measurements of C-reactive protein, may be of value.

### Should a single growth standard be used to judge the nutritional status of children under age 5 y globally? Debate consensus [^111JC5ti]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Low credibility.

- **Points of agreement**: Key points of agreement are summarized in Box 1. The need for target-based advocacy for countries' engagement and political commitments toward the reduction of child malnutrition across the globe is indisputable. Advocacy needs to be balanced, taking into consideration countries' priorities, available resources, and contexts. Further, the tools used for monitoring progress should be accurate and not lead to any risk of harmful consequences.

It is also agreed that physical growth is not the only dimension of nutritional status to be monitored in clinical and public health practice; anthropometry is thus only one of the diagnostic indicators of nutritional status. When evaluating children in clinical settings, the entire spectrum of anthropometry needs to be considered, namely, stature-for-age, weight-for-age, weight-for-stature or BMI-for-age, and head circumference-for-age.

Moreover, both authors agree that, for global monitoring of public health, there are standard definitions of the different indicators such as stunting, wasting, and overweight. However, to avoid misinterpretation and prevent misuse in routine clinical and public health settings, appropriate usage and implications of all growth-related indicators need to be understood by all stakeholders.

### Use of 3 tools to assess nutrition risk in the intensive care unit [^115ArKkZ]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Identifying patients at nutrition risk proves difficult in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to the nature of critical illness. No consensus exists on the most appropriate method to identify these patients as traditional screens and assessments are often limited due to their subjective nature. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to compare proportions of ICU patients deemed at nutrition risk using three different tools.

- **Material and methods**: A convenience sample of 294 patients admitted to the ICU was used. Patients were assessed using the institution's routine nutrition screening method, the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA), and the NUTrition Risk in Critically ill (NUTRIC) score. Information was collected on demographics, severity of illness, hospital and ICU length of stay (LOS), and disposition. Descriptive statistics were used to examine counts and proportions of risk categories; means ± SD were used to summarize demographic and clinical variables.

- **Results**: A total of 139 patients (47%) were deemed at nutrition risk or malnourished by at least one tool. Patients identified were older and had a lower body mass index, more weight loss, more fat and muscle wasting, more fluid accumulation, and lower average handgrips than those not at nutrition risk. They also had longer hospital and ICU LOS, higher rates of requiring further rehabilitation upon discharge, and higher mortality during hospitalization.

In conclusion, traditional screening and assessment tools did not uniformly identify patients as malnourished or at nutrition risk in the ICU.

### Recognition and prevention of nosocomial malnutrition: A review and a call to action [^111BdY3G]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Nosocomial malnutrition in hospitalized adults is a morbid, costly, and potentially preventable and treatable problem. Although it is recognized as contributing to many serious complications of hospitalization, malnutrition is often missed when present on admission and is rarely diagnosed if it occurs during the hospital stay. Many routine clinical practices, such as holding nutrition for testing or failing to address poor intake, when combined with acute inflammatory disease states, can cause rapid deterioration in nutritional status in up to 70% of inpatients.

Malnutrition during hospitalization is associated with increased mortality for years after discharge. In addition, unrecognized and under-coded malnutrition is linked to potential lost revenues for hospital systems. Low-cost interventions, such as recognizing at-risk patients and providing adequate nutrition, have the potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Physicians must champion the implementation of these interventions using guidance from national organizations.

### Glim consensus approach to diagnosis of malnutrition: A 5-year update [^114HHeae]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Low muscle mass is a critical component of malnutrition as the skeletal muscles are the largest organ in the body, essential for protein regulation, physical function, and daily activities. Muscle size and function rely heavily on sufficient nutrient intake, including protein and energy. Malnourished patients, particularly those with significant inflammation, often experience elevated muscle catabolism due to severe illness or injury leading to devastating muscle mass loss.

The original GLIM (Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition) consensus did not detail methods for measuring or defining low muscle mass. A GLIM working group later published guidance prioritizing specific methods and feasibility in clinical practice. These methods recommended for GLIM implementation should depend on the availability of local expertise, resources, and applicable cutoff values for the population being assessed. While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a gold-standard method for accuracy, it is not routinely available for muscle mass assessment. Consequently, the working group suggested alternative methods including dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), computed tomography (CT), or ultrasound. CT evaluation of muscle mass should be considered when scans are performed for other reasons, such as abdominal CTs for oncologic or gastrointestinal indications.

### Glim consensus approach to diagnosis of malnutrition: A 5-year update [^1111zvG9]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). Low credibility.

The new approach to malnutrition diagnosis uses variables similar to those of other validated tools to provide an opportunity to standardize language about the condition. The intention is also to offer a simplified version for use by clinicians with less nutrition expertise and to serve settings with limited staffing and measurement resources. The GLIM approach was primarily intended not to supplant other diagnostic methods in use by nutrition experts but rather to integrate the shared variables when possible.

The original consensus document stated, "The GLIM consensus should be re‐evaluated based upon review of new studies and advances in screening and assessment every 3–5 years". The aim of this paper is to report the Consensus of the GLIM Consortium and to share discussions on possible revisions and amendments.

### Toward precision in nutrition therapy [^117FxJKk]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

To characterize nutrition biomarkers that can be measured at the bedside, a number of single targets, each associated with inflammation, metabolism, or organ injury, have been studied and recommended by different international nutrition guidelines. Although such biomarkers may exhibit prognostic value or may be used to assess "metabolic readiness", their dynamics in critically ill patients are complex, and their kinetics in response to nutrition support have not been optimally evaluated.

For instance, increased lactate and CRP levels or decreased albumin levels may identify patients who are less likely to experience favorable clinical outcomes, but these biomarkers were not independently affected by the initiation of nutrition interventions, nor did they modify effects on outcomes in post hoc analyses of large RCTs. Interestingly, in a post hoc analysis of the EFFORT Protein trial, a greater than two-fold increase in urea levels over six days was associated with an increased risk of death in patients receiving high-dose protein, suggesting that biomarker trajectories might serve as useful prognostic or predictive markers in the nutrition field.

Other metabolic markers include measures of anabolic resistance, such as the dose of insulin required to maintain serum glucose levels. A reduction in insulin requirements, for instance, might identify patients capable of anabolic responses at a given time. Phosphate levels serve as a marker of refeeding syndrome, which has been observed when nutrition is reintroduced.

### Glim consensus approach to diagnosis of malnutrition: A 5-year update [^112aswhX]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

The international clinical nutrition community has, until recently, focused on the introduction of procedures for nutrition screening into regular clinical practice in hospitals, outpatient care, primary care, and other care settings. This is intended to identify individuals at a higher risk for malnutrition who require nutrition assessment and intervention. Many validated screening tools are now available, with most focusing on the identification of individuals who already have signs of malnutrition, whereas others identify risk factors for developing malnutrition. Tools focusing on identifying existing malnutrition mostly use similar sets of variables (weight loss, low BMI, and disease burden), but these variables are combined in various manners and applied with different cutoff values.

The experience collected after the introduction of the GLIM procedure indicates that the screening tool selected — i.e. tools that identify "risk of malnutrition" vs. tools that identify "malnutrition" — affects the prevalence of malnutrition diagnosed by GLIM. In addition, conservative screening methods with limited specificity might result in false negative diagnosis outcomes.

Global consensus to define the "risk of malnutrition" is not established. For this reason, a new GLIM working group initiative is ongoing with the aim to provide clarity on how, when, and if screening should be used within the GLIM approach. Results from this initiative are expected in 2025.

### Multicentre prospective study on the diagnostic and prognostic validity of malnutrition assessment tools in surgery [^116RThQY]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). High credibility.

The absence of a gold standard for the diagnosis of malnutrition is a limitation. Alternative reference standards include a full nutritional evaluation by a trained professional and assessment methods like SGA and GLIM. Assessments by dieticians and muscle mass measurements are time-consuming and costly, making them difficult to implement in hospitals with limited resources. In the present study, hand grip strength was used to indirectly assess muscle mass to calculate GLIM, which might explain the inferior construct and predictive validity of this tool. The SGA was employed as a reference standard and is arguably the most widely used method in studies evaluating nutritional screening tools. SGA is valid, comprehensive, and a good predictor of outcomes in different clinical settings. However, some of the components in all screening tests in the present study are also included in the SGA, which may have raised the sensitivity, specificity, and AUC estimates. Moreover, SGA relies on clinical judgment and lacks objective measurements, potentially leading to heterogeneity of the results. To limit interrater variation, SGA was performed by a single surgical registrar in each study centre. Finally, the study was conducted on a Caucasian population, which might limit the generalizability of the findings.

The next step is to implement standardized malnutrition management strategies based on the MUST screening tool and to assess its impact on long-term outcomes, including quality of life and healthcare costs. The potential of combining several screening tools, such as GLIM or expert consultation, should also be explored.

### A roadmap for integrating nutritional assessment, counselling, and support into the care of people with tuberculosis [^114sUfGx]. The Lancet Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Undernutrition — the leading risk factor for tuberculosis worldwide — is associated with impaired immunity, more extensive disease, delayed sputum conversion, and worse treatment outcomes, including mortality. In this Health Policy, we propose a comprehensive roadmap for integrating nutritional assessment, counselling, and support into tuberculosis treatment as part of person-centred care.

At treatment initiation, we recommend standard nutritional assessment with anthropometric measurements and hemoglobin estimation, in addition to macronutrient and micronutrient support alongside nutritional counselling. Weight should be monitored during treatment, and a lack of weight gain at the end of the intensive phase should prompt an investigation of causes, such as food insecurity, poor treatment adherence, malabsorption, uncontrolled diabetes, or drug resistance. At the end of treatment, we recommend reassessing anthropometric measures to assess nutritional recovery.

People with tuberculosis who remain underweight should receive close follow-up to detect early relapse. We call for annual reporting of nutritional metrics by WHO, explicit inclusion of nutritional assessment and care in national strategic plans, domestic or international support of nutritional programmes for people with tuberculosis, increased support for operational research initiatives, and integration of nutritional care into the WHO Multisectoral Accountability Framework at national and regional levels.

### Admission serum albumin concentrations and response to nutritional therapy in hospitalised patients at malnutrition risk: Secondary analysis of a randomised clinical trial [^113rv9gM]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). High credibility.

For decades, serum albumin concentration has been used as a surrogate marker to quantify the amount of circulating proteins in the plasma and was, therefore, thought to reflect nutritional status. Historically, low albumin concentrations were viewed as an indicator of malnutrition, suggesting the need for nutritional support interventions. However, these considerations were largely based on pathophysiological assumptions, and more recent data suggest that albumin is also a negative acute-phase protein. It may reflect inflammation or acute disease severity, and not necessarily nutritional status alone. There is still a significant lack of data from randomised controlled trials investigating whether low albumin concentrations can effectively identify patients who would benefit from nutritional support.

Malnutrition is common among hospitalised elderly patients and is strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In recent years, several trials and meta-analyses have provided evidence that nutritional support reduces risks associated with malnutrition. The largest trial, the Effect of Early Nutritional Therapy on Frailty, Functional Outcomes, and Recovery of Malnourished Medical Inpatients Trial (EFFORT), included 2,028 medical inpatients at nutritional risk and reported significant reductions in severe complications and mortality for patients receiving nutritional support compared to those in the control group receiving usual hospital nutrition.

### Nutritional status at diagnosis of children with malignancies in Casablanca [^1157cf3Z]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Nutritional assessment is an essential component of the initial assessment of children with cancer. Malnutrition may be present at diagnosis due to the effects of the malignancy or, in low-income countries (LIC), due to poverty and an inadequate diet.

- **Purpose**: The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of malnutrition at diagnosis in children with cancer in Morocco.

- **Procedure**: Nutritional status of 100 children aged less than 18 years with newly diagnosed malignancy between January 2005 and January 2006 was evaluated by anthropometric and biochemical parameters before initiating therapy. We measured weight, height, weight-for-height using z-scores index for children, and body mass index for adolescents, triceps skinfold thickness, mid-upper arm circumference, and serum albumin.

- **Results**: A total of 100 patients were included. The mean age was 7 years (range 1 to 18 years). Sixty percent were boys. The diagnosis was: Burkitt lymphoma (n = 19), acute myeloblastic leukaemia (n = 18), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n = 14), rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 13), Ewing sarcoma (n = 7), nephroblastoma (n = 6), Hodgkin disease (n = 5), osteosarcoma (n = 5), retinoblastoma (n = 4), neuroblastoma (n = 3), germ cell tumor (n = 3), orbital lymphoma (n = 1), cerebral lymphoma (n = 1), ependymoma (n = 1). Incidence of malnutrition ranged from 20 to 50%, depending upon the measurement used.

- **Conclusion**: The prevalence of malnutrition in this study was high, so interventions are being implemented to improve the nutritional status of these patients.

### Recognizing malnutrition in adults with critical illness: Guidance statements from the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition [^117Q3Vod]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). Low credibility.

The Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) diagnostic approach was designed to provide a simple diagnostic tool for clinicians, regardless of staffing levels or technological resources, with the intention to recognize malnutrition as the catalyst for eventual management. GLIM requires the identification of at least one phenotypic criterion (unintended weight loss, low body mass index, or low muscle mass) as evidence of loss of nutrition reserve and one etiologic criterion (disease- or injury-related inflammation or inadequate food intake/assimilation).

Thresholds are provided for the phenotypic criteria to discern whether malnutrition is moderate or severe in degree. GLIM phenotypic and etiologic variables are congruent with other approaches used by nutrition experts to identify malnutrition risk, such as the Nutritional Risk Screening 2002, and malnutrition diagnosis, such as the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) indicators of malnutrition and Subjective Global Assessment. To the extent that variables used to diagnose malnutrition are evaluated and reported using consistent terminology, the global community will be empowered to identify optimal medical nutrition strategies to improve outcomes of patients experiencing malnutrition.

Although GLIM was not conceived for use primarily in critical illness, diagnosing malnutrition using GLIM criteria is feasible. The GLIM approach has construct validity in identifying malnutrition in this population when measured early upon ICU admission, with over 80% sensitivity.

### Seven-point subjective global assessment is more time sensitive than conventional subjective global assessment in detecting nutrition changes [^116ks9Sg]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

It is important for nutrition intervention in malnourished patients to be guided by accurate evaluation and detection of small changes in the patient's nutrition status over time. However, the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) is unable to detect changes in a short period. The aim of the study was to determine whether the 7-point SGA is more time sensitive to nutrition changes than the conventional SGA.

- **Methods**: In this prospective study, 67 adult inpatients assessed as malnourished using both the 7-point SGA and conventional SGA were recruited. Each patient received nutrition intervention and was followed up after discharge. Patients were reassessed using both tools at 1, 3, and 5 months from baseline assessment.

- **Results**: It took significantly less time to see a 1-point change using the 7-point SGA compared to the conventional SGA (median: 1 month vs. 3 months, P = 0.002). The likelihood of at least a 1-point change is 6.74 times greater in the 7-point SGA compared with the conventional SGA after controlling for age, sex, and medical specialties (odds ratio, 6.74; 95% confidence interval, 2.88–15.80; P < .001). Fifty-six percent of patients who had no change in SGA score had changes detected using the 7-point SGA. The level of agreement was 100% (κ = 1, P < .001) between the 7-point SGA and the 3-point SGA, and 83% (κ = 0.726, P < .001) between two blinded assessors for the 7-point SGA.

- **Conclusion**: The 7-point SGA is more time sensitive in its response to nutrition changes than the conventional SGA. It can be used to guide nutrition intervention for patients more effectively.

### Guidance for assessment of the muscle mass phenotypic criterion for the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition diagnosis of malnutrition [^115xJmdZ]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). Low credibility.

The Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) provides consensus criteria for the diagnosis of malnutrition that can be widely applied. The GLIM approach is based on the assessment of three phenotypic (weight loss, low body mass index, and low skeletal muscle mass) and two etiologic (low food intake and presence of disease with systemic inflammation) criteria, with diagnosis confirmed by any combination of one phenotypic and one etiologic criterion fulfilled. Assessment of muscle mass is less commonly performed than other phenotypic malnutrition criteria, and its interpretation may be less straightforward, particularly in settings that lack access to skilled clinical nutrition practitioners and/or to body composition methodologies.

In order to promote the widespread assessment of skeletal muscle mass as an integral part of the GLIM diagnosis of malnutrition, the GLIM consortium appointed a working group to provide consensus-based guidance on the assessment of skeletal muscle mass. When such methods and skills are available, quantitative assessment of muscle mass should be measured or estimated using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, computerized tomography, or bioelectrical impedance analysis. For settings where these resources are not available, the use of anthropometric measures and physical examination is also endorsed. Validated ethnic- and sex-specific cutoff values for each measurement and tool are recommended when available. Measurement of skeletal muscle function is not advised as a surrogate measurement of muscle mass.

### Admission serum albumin concentrations and response to nutritional therapy in hospitalised patients at malnutrition risk: Secondary analysis of a randomised clinical trial [^1124WPV8]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). High credibility.

The main aims of our study were twofold: first, to investigate the role of albumin as a prognostic indicator for mortality, and second, as a predictor for the response to nutritional support. For this purpose, we divided the patient population into two groups based on their admission serum albumin concentration, choosing a cut-off of 30 g/L. Because albumin is highly influenced by inflammation, we further grouped patients according to the level of inflammation based on a CRP cut-off value of 100 mg/L, according to a previous study.

Endpoints were in line with the original publication, collected through a structured telephone interview at 30 and 180 days after inclusion in the trial. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality within 180 days for prognostic analyses and all-cause mortality within 30 days for the predictive analysis regarding treatment response. Secondary endpoints included the composite endpoint of adverse outcomes (consisting of all-cause mortality, admission to intensive care, readmission, major complications, functional decline), major complications (nosocomial infection or abscess requiring antibiotic treatment, major cardiovascular events, acute renal failure), length of hospital stay (LOS), and non-elective hospital readmission after 30 and 180 days.

### Validated screening tools for the assessment of cachexia, sarcopenia, and malnutrition: a systematic review [^115qM4fh]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

There is great overlap between the presentation of cachexia, sarcopenia, and malnutrition. Distinguishing between these conditions would allow for better-targeted treatment for patients.

- **Objectives**: The aim was to systematically review validated screening tools for cachexia, sarcopenia, and malnutrition in adults and, if a combined tool is absent, make suggestions for the generation of a novel screening tool.

- **Design**: A systematic search was performed in Ovid Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science. Two reviewers performed data extraction independently. Each tool was judged for validity against a reference method. Psychometric evaluation was performed as was appraisal of the tools' ability to assess the patient against consensus definitions.

- **Results**: Thirty-eight studies described 22 validated screening tools. The Cachexia Score (CASCO) was the only validated screening tool for cachexia and performed well against the consensus definition. Two tools assessed sarcopenia [the Short Portable Sarcopenia Measure (SPSM) and the SARC-F (Strength, Assistance with walking, Rise from a chair, Climb stairs, and Falls)] and scored well against the 1998 Baumgartner definition. The SPSM required large amounts of equipment, and the SARC-F had a low sensitivity. Nineteen tools screened for malnutrition. The 3-Minute Nutrition Score performed best, meeting consensus definition criteria (European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism) and having a sensitivity and specificity of > 80%. No tool contained all of the currently accepted components to screen for all three conditions.

### Clinical and biochemical markers of risk in uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition [^117T3sqy]. Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Use of mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) as a single screening tool for severe acute malnutrition (SAM) assumes that children with a low weight-for-height z score (WHZ) and normal MUAC have lower risks of morbidity and mortality. However, the pathophysiology and functional severity associated with different anthropometric phenotypes of SAM have never been well characterized. We compared clinical characteristics, biochemical features, and health and nutrition histories of nonedematous children with SAM who had (1) low WHZ only, (2) both low WHZ and low MUAC, or (3) low MUAC only.

- **Methods**: In Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, and Liberia, we conducted a multicentric cohort study in uncomplicated, nonedematous children with SAM and low MUAC only (n = 161), low WHZ only (n = 138), or a combination of low MUAC and low WHZ (n = 152). Alongside routine anthropometric measurements, we collected a wide range of critical indicators of clinical and nutritional status and viability; these included serum leptin, an adipocytokine negatively associated with mortality risk in SAM.

- **Results**: Median leptin levels at diagnosis were lower in children with low WHZ only (215.8 pg/mL; P < .001) and in those with combined WHZ and MUAC deficits (180.1 pg/mL; P < .001) than in children with low MUAC only (331.50 pg/mL). The same pattern emerged on a wide range of clinical indicators, including signs of severe wasting, dehydration, serum ferritin levels, and caretaker-reported health deterioration, and was replicated across study sites.

Conclusions reflect the likely implications of these findings, emphasizing the need for a nuanced approach to screening and treatment strategies for children with SAM.

### Nutritional risk screening (NRS 2002): A new method based on an analysis of controlled clinical trials [^117Fgfdd]. Clinical Nutrition (2003). High credibility.

The Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 (NRS 2002) is a clinical calculator used to assess the risk of malnutrition in hospitalized adult patients. It is particularly useful in identifying patients who may benefit from nutritional intervention, thereby improving their clinical outcomes and reducing hospital stay. The NRS 2002 takes into account factors such as age, body mass index, weight loss, dietary intake, and severity of disease. It is not recommended for use in children, pregnant women, or patients with certain conditions such as edema or ascites, which can affect weight and therefore skew the results.

The Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 (NRS 2002) tool evaluates an individual's nutritional risk by considering four critical input factors: initial screening criteria, nutritional impairment, severity of disease, and age. Each factor's response corresponds to a predefined score that contributes to the overall risk assessment, guiding the necessary nutritional interventions.

Here's how the scoring works:

- **Initial screening**: All options under this category result in a score of 10, whether the criterion is a body mass index under 20.5 kg/m², recent weight loss, reduced dietary intake, or being in an intensive care unit…

### Early identification of cancer-related malnutrition in patients with colorectal cancer before and after surgery: A literature review [^111HHXoo]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Low credibility.

Nutritional anthropometric measurements and laboratory chemistry diagnostics:

A variety of nutritional anthropometric measurements have been performed in all studies, but not all researchers have undertaken the measurement of muscle mass (see Table 2). Body composition analysis, including fat, protein, minerals, and body water, provides complementary and more accurate information about nutritional status than just weight or BMI. Changes in fat-muscle mass and body fat percentage were described in these studies.

In practice, this would mean that, in addition to parameters like weight or BMI, body composition would be essential for the early identification of malnutrition. Overweight and obesity are relevant risk factors for people suffering from cancers such as colon cancer. Weight loss in these patients is often overlooked or not identified early enough because fat may hide the loss of muscle mass. Comparison between the original weight and weight at diagnosis is therefore important to identify malnutrition early.

As shown in Table 2, a number of the anthropometric measures are included in most available instruments. It remains unclear whether these were assessed twice or whether they have been adopted from the nutrition instruments.

### Glim consensus approach to diagnosis of malnutrition: A 5-year update [^111H6dRb]. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). Low credibility.

In 2016, the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) was founded. GLIM builds on efforts to address the priority for the development of a consensus approach for the diagnosis of malnutrition and to consolidate consensus around nutrition concepts and terminology. The lack of consensus has hindered the development of a common nutrition language to support the sharing of meaningful prevalence data, the testing of targeted interventions, and the monitoring of outcomes across the globe. Breakthroughs in our understanding of malnutrition in settings of disease or inflammation have supported a changing paradigm in how we fundamentally characterize malnutrition in clinical settings. These insights culminated in the 2019 GLIM consensus papers that provided a framework for a globally accepted diagnostic process that should be valid for adults in most settings, irrespective of methodological availability and resources.

Four major clinical nutrition societies — the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN), the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN), Federación Latinoamericana de Terapia Nutricional, Nutrición Clinica Y Metabolismo (FELANPE), and the Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition Society of Asia (PENSA) — convened in 2016 to establish a core leadership committee composed of two representatives from each society and an expert working group composed of 24 physicians and dietitians.

### Assessment of nutritional indices for predicting clinical outcomes in critically ill elderly patients: a prospective cohort study [^114mHy1Y]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Low credibility.

Malnutrition is defined as the inadequate intake of macro- and micronutrients, resulting in a reduction of both fat and muscle mass, which negatively affects physical and mental performance, as well as overall clinical outcomes. Factors such as starvation, illness, or aging can contribute to the development of malnutrition.

In recent decades, malnutrition among elderly patients has become a significant concern, closely linked with increased mortality and morbidity. Nutritional deficiencies are prevalent among older adults, with studies indicating that 35–65% of hospitalized elderly individuals are malnourished. As with other hospital wards, malnutrition and its nutritional management are critical in the intensive care unit (ICU). Among critically ill patients, particularly the elderly, 38–78% experience varying severity of malnutrition. A systematic review found that malnutrition in ICU patients is significantly associated with prolonged ICU length of stay (LOS), higher rates of ICU readmission, increased rates of infections, and increased hospital mortality.

There is no established diagnostic criteria for malnutrition. Various nutrition screening tools are used to assess malnutrition risk, including the Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002), the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST), the Nutrition Risk in the Critically Ill (NUTRIC) or mNUTRIC (modified NUTRIC), Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT), and Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI). The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) recommends using the NRS-2002 and the…

### Glim consensus approach to diagnosis of malnutrition: A 5-year update [^113nRFyZ]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). Low credibility.

Two meta-analyses focus on criterion validity. One included a general sample (mixed settings) of 20 studies with 10,781 patients from 13 countries, showing a sensitivity of 72% with a range of 51%–92% (i.e. capacity to identify true positive cases) and a specificity of 82% with a range of 73%–98% (i.e. capacity to identify true negative cases) relative to SGA or Patient-Generated SGA as the mainly used semi-gold standard, with an area under the curve of 0.82. The authors stated that GLIM has good diagnostic accuracy. Malnutrition prevalence was 44% in the total sample. A smaller meta-analysis that included five intensive care unit studies concluded that the small sample of 337 patients and the heterogeneity limited the resulting sensitivity to 65.5% (95% CI, 35%–86.8%) and specificity was 86.9% (95% CI, 59.3%–96.9%).

### Effectiveness of dietary counseling with or without nutrition supplementation in hospitalized patients who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114YAFvU]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Most of the studies used validated nutrition screening tools (Mini Nutritional Assessment–Short Form [MNA‐SF], Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 [NRS‐2002], and Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool [MUST]) or assessment tools (MNA, Patient‐Generated Subjective Global Assessment [PG‐SGA], and SGA). Vázquez‐Sánchez et al. and Sharan Kumar et al. recruited patients with a malnutrition diagnosis, whereas Neelemaat et al. used a combination of low BMI and weight loss as an indicator for malnutrition.

Study duration ranged from a few days (in the hospital) to six months. Six studies did not meet a priori planned sample-size recruitment, although one study performed an interim analysis and indicated no significant differences in the primary outcome (mortality) between the study groups. Two studies did not perform sample-size and power calculation. Finally, 11 studies analyzed the results based on an intention-to-treat methodology.

The frequency of dietary counseling varied from one to three or more sessions. Seven studies did not report the frequencies of the follow-up sessions. Additionally, Holyday et al. reported a mean of 43.0 ± 4.5 minutes per session, whereas Sharma et al. reported that each follow-up call lasted an average of 30 minutes. All studies used a face-to-face session for the first session. Four studies used telephone calls for follow-up sessions. Most dietary counseling was performed by dietitians or nutritionists, with two studies by nurses, and one by a physician.

Only 12.5% (2 of 16) of the RCTs had a low risk of bias across the trials.

### Perioperative nutritional assessment and management of patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery [^1145wsgb]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Nutritional evaluation is the procedure of acquiring, validating, and interpreting the data needed to determine any nutrition-associated challenges. This evaluation should be performed using the most appropriate tool, as judged by the attending physician. It is evident that the nutritional tool used should have been previously validated for the population to which it will be applied. However, the nutritional diagnosis depends not only on a single finding of nutritional evaluation but also on the diagnosis of malnutrition, which is recommended as a two-stage procedure.

ASPEN reported that nutritional diagnosis is an integrated multifactorial methodology to identify nutritional abnormalities using a combination of the following parameters: medical and nutritional history, medication, physical examination, anthropometric measurements, and laboratory data. Therefore, for an integrated approach to nutrition problems, a nutritional control tool is needed, comprising the following factors:

- **BMI**: According to the World Health Organization, a subject with a BMI > 30 kg/m² is considered obese. Special consideration is given to geriatric patients aged over 70 years, combined with a weight loss of more than 10%.

- Apart from BMI, it is worth noting that various anthropometric measurements, such as the circumference of various body parts (such as calf, thighs, hands), and the skin fold of the triceps, are important measurements.

### Incidence and course of child malnutrition according to clinical or anthropometrical assessment: A longitudinal study from rural DR Congo [^116bYGHN]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

While the worldwide prevalence of child malnutrition from 1990 to 2010 declined significantly, there has been only minimal change in sub-Saharan Africa. It is therefore important to improve our understanding of child malnutrition in these settings. Many studies from sub-Saharan Africa have determined the national, regional, or local occurrence frequencies of child malnutrition. Typically, these studies provide prevalence rates of low anthropometric scores in population cross-sections as the measure of the burden of malnutrition. In contrast, longitudinal studies looking at the incidence and natural course of malnutrition are few. Such studies are useful because they allow for a better understanding of season- and age-dependent risks for developing malnutrition. The study of the natural course of malnutrition is considered to be of particular value for nutritional programs in planning interventions. There are very few such studies, and according to Isanaka et al, only one population-based study has been published concerning the duration of untreated malnutrition.

Studies defining malnutrition clinically (marasmus, kwashiorkor, moderate clinical malnutrition) rather than anthropometrically are also scarce, despite the fact that anthropometric assessment alone lacks specificity in the diagnosis of malnutrition. Given that clinical assessment of malnutrition is a comparatively inexpensive method suitable for regions with a significant burden of malnutrition, the lack of attention to this method is remarkable.

The aim of this paper is to address, in a large…

### Quick and easy is not without cost: Implications of poorly performing nutrition screening tools in hip fracture [^116tfseB]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). Low credibility.

The study aimed to evaluate the performance of commonly applied nutrition screening tools and measures, and to consider the potential costs of undiagnosed malnutrition in a case-based reimbursement funding environment. The design was a diagnostic accuracy study that compared various nutrition screening techniques against primary, secondary, and comparative measures of nutritional status. This was conducted in a public metropolitan hospital orthogeriatric unit.

The participants included individuals with acute hip fracture admitted to the orthogeriatric unit. A total of 150 prospective, consecutively admitted individuals were considered, with eight exclusions, resulting in a sample size of 142 participants.

Measurements involved screens such as the Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form, Malnutrition Screening Tool, Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool, Nutrition Risk Screen 2002, anthropometric measures, and albumin. Malnutrition was diagnosed using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Health Related Problems, Tenth Edition, Australian Modification (ICD-10-AM) criteria. Healthcare coders calculated malnutrition-related diagnostic related groups and cost-weight changes for individual participants.

The results indicated a malnutrition prevalence of 48%. The screening tools displayed only slight to moderate agreement with ICD-10-AM diagnosis of malnutrition. None of the screening tools tested met the a priori requirement of 80% sensitivity and 60% specificity. The estimated cost effect of poor screening tool sensitivity on a 16-bed hip fracture unit ranged from AUS$46,506 to AUS$228,896 per year.

### Nutrition screening tools: an analysis of the evidence [^113i7cuf]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

In response to questions about tools for nutrition screening, an evidence analysis project was developed to identify the most valid and reliable nutrition screening tools for use in acute care and hospital-based ambulatory care settings. An oversight group defined nutrition screening and literature search criteria. A trained analyst conducted structured searches of the literature for studies of nutrition screening tools according to predetermined criteria.

Eleven nutrition screening tools designed to detect undernutrition in patients in acute care and hospital-based ambulatory care were identified. Trained analysts evaluated articles for quality using criteria specified by the American Dietetic Association's Evidence Analysis Library. Members of the oversight group assigned quality grades to the tools based on the quality of the supporting evidence, including reliability and validity data.

One tool, the NRS-2002, received a grade I, and four tools — the Simple Two-Part Tool, the Mini-Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF), the Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST), and the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) — received a grade II. The MST was the only tool shown to be both valid and reliable for identifying undernutrition in the settings studied. Thus, validated nutrition screening tools that are simple and easy to use are available for application in acute care and hospital-based ambulatory care settings.

### Is nutritional depletion by nutritional risk index associated with increased length of hospital stay? A population-based study [^114cNDx7]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Malnutrition is common at hospital admission and tends to worsen during hospitalization. This controlled population study aimed to determine if serum albumin or moderate and severe nutritional depletion by the nutritional risk index (NRI) at hospital admission are associated with increased length of hospital stay (LOS) and increased hospital costs in patients admitted to hospitals in two European countries.

- **Methods**: Serum albumin levels and recent weight loss were prospectively determined at hospital admission in Geneva (n = 652) and Berlin (n = 621). Patients were classified as having no, mild, moderate, or severe risk by NRI. Multiple logistic regressions were used to determine the association between albumin and nutritional risk category and LOS.

- **Results**: Patients (24%) were at moderate or severe nutritional risk by NRI. Nutritional risk by NRI, adjusted for age, was associated with a LOS of 11 days (moderate: odds ratio [OR] 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4 to 2.7). Nutrition screening should take place at hospital admission to determine nutritional risk and risk for longer LOS.

### Accuracy of nutritional screening tools in assessing the risk of undernutrition in hospitalized children [^113yuQRA]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the predictive accuracy of screening tools for assessing nutritional risk in hospitalized children in developed countries.

- **Methods**: The study involved a systematic review of literature (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central databases up to January 17, 2014) of studies on the diagnostic performance of pediatric nutritional screening tools. Methodological quality was assessed using a modified QUADAS tool. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each screening tool per validation method. A meta-analysis was performed to estimate the risk ratio of different screening result categories of being truly at nutritional risk.

- **Results**: A total of 11 studies were included on ≥ 1 of the following screening tools: Pediatric Nutritional Risk Score, Screening Tool for the Assessment of Malnutrition in Paediatrics, Paediatric Yorkhill Malnutrition Score, and Screening Tool for Risk on Nutritional Status and Growth. Because of variation in reference standards, a direct comparison of the predictive accuracy of the screening tools was not possible. A meta-analysis was performed on 1,629 children from seven different studies. The risk ratio of being truly at nutritional risk was 0.349 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.16–0.78) for children in the low versus moderate screening category and 0.292 (95% CI 0.19–0.44) in the moderate versus high screening category.

- **Conclusions**: There is insufficient evidence to choose one nutritional screening tool over another based on their predictive accuracy. The estimated risk of being at "true nutritional risk" is outlined in the results, but no singular tool proves superior.

### Anthropometric and biochemical assessment of nutritional status in pediatric cancer patients [^114Rjzwv]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Children are at greater risk for malnutrition due to increased nutrient needs to support appropriate growth, and they exhibit elevated substrate needs due to cancer and its treatment. This study aimed to report the anthropometric and biochemical evaluation of nutritional status in children with cancer at initial presentation and during treatment.

A prospective, controlled study was performed in the pediatric oncology department of a tertiary care center. The control group consisted of the siblings of patients. Weight, height, body mass index, triceps skinfold thickness, and serum levels of total protein, albumin, prealbumin, serum lipids, trace minerals, C-reactive protein (CRP), and vitamins were compared in patients and controls at initial presentation and at the 6th month after the onset of treatment.

According to weight for height, the frequency of malnutrition was 16% at initial presentation and 22% at the 6th month. Triceps skinfold thickness was significantly thinner in patients than in controls at both measurements. Patients had lower levels of prealbumin, albumin, iron, folate, zinc, and vitamin C, and higher levels of ferritin, vitamin B12, and copper. Serum CRP levels were significantly higher in cancer patients at initial presentation and seemed to be correlated with copper levels. Compared with other patients, malnourished patients had significantly higher levels of vitamin B12 at the 6th month.

Results of the study demonstrate that trace minerals, vitamins, and anthropometric measures may yield important clues for nutritional status and disease activity in pediatric oncology.

### Which assessment method of malnutrition in head and neck cancer [^117X3G24]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the value of several diagnostic methods of nutritional status during the initial management of head and neck cancer. The study was designed as a single-center prospective study, conducted at a tertiary referral center. Ninety patients with head and neck cancer participated. Nutritional status was assessed using anthropometric, biological, body, and muscle measurements, with muscle mass index determined via computed tomography (L3 muscle mass index, L3MMI). Muscle performance, reflecting functional nutritional status, was evaluated using the Short Physical Performance Battery test. Malnutrition thresholds were based on existing literature.

The results indicated a mean body mass index (BMI) of 24.6 ± 5.4 kg/m². Mean weight loss and albumin levels were -4.5 ± 10.5 kg and 37.1 ± 5.2 g/L, respectively. Fourteen percent of patients were diagnosed as malnourished based on BMI, 54% according to the Nutritional Risk Index (NRI), and 58% by L3MMI. There was a 64% agreement between NRI and L3MMI (P < .001). All patients identified as malnourished by BMI were also identified as such by other assessment methods; however, many malnourished patients had normal or high BMI. The Short Physical Performance Battery score was particularly low among patients deemed most undernourished by other methods.

In conclusion, the Nutritional Risk Index and L3 muscle mass index are the best methods to identify malnutrition in patients. Functional muscle assessment can determine the severity of malnutrition.

### Glim consensus approach to diagnosis of malnutrition: A 5-year update [^111PAW93]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). Low credibility.

Because the phenotypic and etiologic criteria were selected from widely accepted diagnostic models introduced over the past 50 years, the GLIM Consortium decided in 2019 to recommend immediate implementation while promoting ongoing validation studies. To support the performance of sound validation studies, the GLIM Consortium provided a guidance paper on how to perform studies targeting construct or criterion validity (i.e. to assure that the model identifies malnutrition) and predictive validity (i.e. that the model identifies cases with adverse clinical outcomes).

A literature search of PubMed used "Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition or GLIM" as the search term for the period of 2019 to May 2024. The search identified over 400 validity and feasibility studies, not taking reviews or commentaries into account. These publications provide evidence that GLIM has good criterion validity when compared with established models, such as Subjective Global Assessment (SGA), Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF), and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and ASPEN Indicators to Diagnose Malnutrition (AAIM). Likewise, predictive validity is comparable to other malnutrition diagnostic instruments.

During the same period, the three original GLIM consensus papers have been cited over 5000 times in Google Scholar, over 2300 times in Scopus, and over 3000 times in Web of Science.

- **Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of validation studies**: The large number of individual validation studies has provided comprehensive evidence for the robustness of the GLIM consensus approach.

### Examining guidelines and new evidence in oncology nutrition: A position paper on gaps and opportunities in multimodal approaches to improve patient care [^114y8UH7]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Low credibility.

Nutrition assessment can be conducted using several available tools to evaluate nutrition status, such as the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) and the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA). Nutrition assessment is different from nutrition screening in that it determines the presence, severity, and causes of malnutrition and is used to plan nutrition intervention, while screening indicates the presence or absence of malnutrition risk.

Nutrition societies recommend early nutrition assessment for all at-risk patients before anticancer treatments (including surgery) begin, with reassessments at regular intervals throughout the cancer trajectory (Supplementary Table 2). ESPEN also recommends dual X-ray absorptiometry, anthropometry, bioelectrical impedance analysis, or CT scans to assess muscle mass, and walking tests or dynamometers (i.e. hand-grip strength) for muscle function.

With the lack of consensus on the diagnostic criteria for malnutrition, a framework such as the one proposed by the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) can be used to help diagnose malnutrition through:

- **Identifying at-risk patients**: Using any validated screening tool.
- **Conducting a nutrition assessment**: Utilizing validated assessment tools to diagnose and grade the severity of malnutrition.

GLIM's diagnostic criteria include three phenotypic criteria (involuntary weight loss, low BMI, and reduced muscle mass) and two etiologic criteria (reduced food intake or assimilation and inflammation or disease burden).

### Biomarkers for individualized nutritional therapy in disease-related malnutrition: A narrative review [^112WsU7X]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Disease-related malnutrition in hospitalized adult medical patients is a syndrome associated with substantially higher morbidity, disability, both short- and long-term mortality, delayed recovery, and increased healthcare costs compared to individuals without malnutrition. Research on malnutrition has aimed to translate existing knowledge of its pathophysiology into improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize evidence on the use of biomarkers to individualize nutritional therapy. There is particular interest in developing nutritional interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of disease-related malnutrition within hospital environments.

Recent high-quality randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that nutritional therapy significantly reduces morbidity and other complications associated with malnutrition in selected patient populations. Additionally, there is growing evidence that phenotyping patients through assessing nutritional biomarkers or adapted risk screening scores may enhance our ability to characterize them in terms of prognosis and likelihood of treatment response.

Current research has identified several promising biomarkers, including markers of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6); indicators of chronic disease, such as creatinine, prealbumin, albumin, and red cell distribution width; measures of muscle health, such as hand grip strength and CT scan results; endocrine and exocrine markers; estimates of catabolism; and emerging metabolomic indicators.

### Glim consensus approach to diagnosis of malnutrition: A 5-year update [^113nuxPu]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). Low credibility.

The guidance papers clarified that low muscle strength, although often closely associated with loss of muscle mass and included in full nutrition assessment after malnutrition diagnosis, is not a component of the GLIM diagnostic algorithm. For this reason, it should not be used as a surrogate for muscle mass assessment. Still, muscle strength testing — i.e. hand dynamometry — is vital if sarcopenia is a diagnostic consideration.

Most body composition assessment tools have limitations in their application to adults living with obesity and may need specific adjustments for muscle mass assessment. Calf circumference with BMI adjustments has been proposed for use in clinical practice and could represent an appealing approach once additional validation is available. DXA and BIA with population-specific equations are also options for muscle mass assessment in patients with obesity that is not severe. A recent consensus initiative on sarcopenic obesity proposed to normalize muscle mass for total body weight. Validation of this approach to diagnose sarcopenic obesity and its relevant clinical outcomes is underway, and it could represent a potential future refinement for muscle mass assessment in persons with obesity and malnutrition.

Preliminary recommendations on cutoffs for muscle mass, using various methods, are provided in Table 2. Cutoffs should be specific to sex, ethnicity, and device. As different approaches can be used to establish cutoffs for low muscle mass definition, global consensus initiatives on sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity are underway.
