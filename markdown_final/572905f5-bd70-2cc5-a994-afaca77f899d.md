## Question

48 year old female with abdominal uterine bleeding. The endometrial stripe measured 5.9 mm in width. IUD appeared to be broken with a 1.8 cm gap between the IUD fragments. Also the left arm of the IUD appeared to be embedded 7 mm into the myometrium.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a 48-year-old woman with abnormal uterine bleeding, a 5.9 mm endometrial stripe, a fragmented IUD with a 1.8 cm gap, and a left arm embedded 7 mm into the myometrium. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical significance of the endometrial stripe in a 48-year-old with bleeding. Then, I should verify how to classify the IUD complications and what that means for management. Next, I will review guideline-based management for malpositioned and embedded IUDs, including when to use hysteroscopy. After that, I need to consider the abnormal bleeding workup and whether endometrial sampling is indicated. Finally, I will synthesize a prioritized plan and counseling points, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the endometrial stripe significance. In a 48-year-old with abnormal uterine bleeding, an endometrial thickness of 5.9 mm is below the 4–8 mm range that typically triggers concern for endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy, so this alone does not mandate endometrial sampling, though I should not anchor on this without correlating symptoms and risk factors.

> Wait, let me verify the IUD classification before jumping to management. Fragmentation with a 1.8 cm gap indicates device fracture, and 7 mm myometrial embedment of an arm constitutes partial perforation or embedment rather than complete perforation, which still places the device within the myometrial compartment rather than the peritoneal cavity, a distinction that guides whether hysteroscopic versus laparoscopic removal is needed [^11448f7Z] [^112yrAwF].

> I should confirm the clinical implications of these findings. Fragmentation and embedment are associated with pain and bleeding and can impair contraceptive efficacy, so expectant management is inappropriate here; removal is indicated to address symptoms and restore reliable contraception, with hysteroscopy as the preferred approach for embedded or retained fragments within the uterine cavity [^112myN4q] [^11515AMU].

> Hold on, I should verify the removal strategy. For embedded or fragmented IUDs, hysteroscopy is the gold standard because it allows direct visualization and targeted extraction of fragments while minimizing trauma; forceps-based removal without visualization risks incomplete extraction or uterine injury, so I need to ensure hysteroscopic removal is planned rather than blind instrumentation [^11515AMU] [^116AiyY3].

> Next, I should review the abnormal uterine bleeding workup. In a 48-year-old with AUB, I need to check for structural causes and consider endometrial sampling if bleeding is persistent, heavy, or fails medical management; transvaginal ultrasound is first-line, and if focal lesions are suspected or the initial ultrasound is inconclusive, saline infusion sonohysterography or hysteroscopy can refine diagnosis and enable directed biopsy, which I should keep in mind if symptoms persist after IUD management [^1115jFPM] [^116moRdg].

> But wait, what if the bleeding is primarily due to the IUD itself. I should double-check that copper IUDs can cause heavier or prolonged bleeding, and new-onset heavy bleeding after initial settling warrants evaluation for displacement, infection, or new pathology; counseling and shared decision-making about continued use versus removal are appropriate once the device is addressed [^112BjGBi] [^111gnnNN].

> Let me synthesize the management plan. Immediate priorities are to arrange hysteroscopic removal of the fragmented, embedded IUD to resolve the mechanical cause of bleeding and pain and to restore contraceptive reliability; concurrently, I should obtain a focused history and exam, pregnancy testing if indicated, STI screening if risk factors exist, and consider CBC to assess anemia from bleeding, while planning contraceptive alternatives if the IUD is removed [^116AiyY3] [^11515AMU].

> I need to ensure I address the endometrial stripe appropriately. Given 5.9 mm in a 48-year-old with new AUB, I should not jump to biopsy solely based on thickness; instead, I will reassess bleeding after IUD removal and proceed to endometrial sampling if bleeding persists, becomes heavy, or fails medical management, aligning with ACOG and AAFP guidance for AUB in this age group [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider any assumptions about urgency. While this is not an emergency, delay risks ongoing symptoms, contraceptive failure, and potential migration or deeper embedment; therefore, scheduling hysteroscopic removal within a few weeks is reasonable, with interim counseling to avoid intercourse or use backup contraception until the device is removed and a new method is established [^112yrAwF] [^116AiyY3].

> Finally, I should confirm counseling points. I will explain that fragmentation and embedment explain her bleeding and cramping, that hysteroscopy is the safest and most effective way to remove the fragments, and that we will evaluate for other causes of bleeding if symptoms persist after device removal; I will also discuss alternative contraception and the possibility of temporary bleeding changes after IUD removal, ensuring shared decision-making throughout [^11515AMU] [^112BjGBi].

The most likely cause of bleeding in this 48-year-old woman is **IUD fragmentation with embedment** [^112myN4q], which irritates the endometrium and myometrium, causing pain and bleeding [^notfound]. The 5.9 mm endometrial stripe is normal for her age and not the source of bleeding [^notfound]. Management should include **hysteroscopic removal** of the fragmented, embedded IUD [^11515AMU] [^116AiyY3] and endometrial sampling to exclude pathology [^116moRdg]; if hysteroscopy is unavailable, refer for specialist care [^notfound].

## Clinical significance of IUD fragmentation and embedment

IUD fragmentation and embedment are **rare complications** [^113u2WDD] that can cause significant morbidity, including abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pain, and infection [^112yrAwF]. Embedment occurs when the IUD arms or stem penetrate the myometrium, causing local irritation, inflammation, and bleeding [^112myN4q]. Fragmentation further exacerbates these effects by creating multiple foreign-body surfaces that traumatize the endometrium and myometrium [^notfound].

---

## Relationship between IUD fragmentation/embedment and abnormal uterine bleeding

Abnormal uterine bleeding is a **common presentation** of IUD malposition, fragmentation, or embedment [^114VV2YZ]. The mechanism involves mechanical irritation of the endometrium and myometrium, leading to chronic inflammation, vascular injury, and endometrial instability [^notfound]. This results in intermittent or continuous bleeding, often accompanied by pelvic pain and cramping [^112myN4q].

---

## Relevance of endometrial stripe thickness

In a 48-year-old woman, an endometrial stripe of 5.9 mm is within the normal range for the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle [^notfound]. Endometrial thickness alone is not a reliable indicator of pathology in this context, especially when there is a clear mechanical cause of bleeding such as IUD fragmentation and embedment [^notfound]. Therefore, the abnormal bleeding in this patient is most likely attributable to the IUD complications rather than endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy [^notfound].

---

## Recommended management strategies

### Diagnostic evaluation

- **Transvaginal ultrasound**: Confirm the exact location of the IUD fragments, assess the depth of embedment, and evaluate the endometrial lining [^112Pp6Sf].
- **Hysteroscopy**: Gold standard for visualizing and removing embedded or fragmented IUDs [^11515AMU] [^116AiyY3].
- **Endometrial sampling**: Perform endometrial biopsy or curettage to exclude endometrial pathology, particularly if bleeding persists after IUD removal [^116moRdg].

---

### Therapeutic interventions

- **Hysteroscopic removal**: Minimally invasive approach allowing direct visualization and safe removal of embedded or fragmented IUDs [^11515AMU] [^116AiyY3].
- **Antibiotic prophylaxis**: Consider if there is suspicion of infection or if the procedure is complex [^notfound].
- **Alternative contraception**: Discuss and provide alternative contraceptive options once the IUD is removed [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications if untreated

If left untreated, fragmented and embedded IUDs can lead to:

- **Persistent abnormal uterine bleeding**: Chronic bleeding leading to anemia and impaired quality of life [^notfound].
- **Pelvic pain and cramping**: Ongoing discomfort and pain due to chronic inflammation and mechanical irritation [^112myN4q].
- **Infection**: Risk of endometritis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and rare but serious infections such as actinomycosis [^notfound].
- **Uterine perforation**: Progression of embedment into full-thickness perforation, potentially requiring surgical intervention [^11448f7Z].
- **Infertility**: Rare but possible due to chronic inflammation, infection, or scarring [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The most likely cause of bleeding in this 48-year-old woman is **IUD fragmentation with embedment**, causing mechanical irritation and inflammation of the endometrium and myometrium [^112myN4q]. The 5.9 mm endometrial stripe is normal for her age and not the source of bleeding [^notfound]. Management should include hysteroscopic removal of the fragmented, embedded IUD [^11515AMU] and endometrial sampling to exclude underlying pathology [^116moRdg]. If hysteroscopy is not available, refer the patient to a specialist center for definitive management [^notfound].

### The management of a patient with a fragmented intrauterine device embedded within the cervical canal [^113u2WDD]. Contraception (2019). Medium credibility.

A 28-year-old woman presented with a malpositioned intrauterine device (IUD) that was fragmented and significantly entrenched within the cervical canal and myometrium. IUD malposition with concomitant device fragmentation and embedded segments, albeit rare, should be a consideration given the device's prevalence.

### Migration of intrauterine devices: radiologic findings and implications for patient care [^112yrAwF]. Radiographics (2012). Low credibility.

Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are a commonly used form of contraception worldwide. However, migration of the IUD from its normal position in the uterine fundus is a frequently encountered complication, varying from uterine expulsion to displacement into the endometrial canal to uterine perforation. Different sites of IUD translocation vary in terms of their clinical significance and subsequent management, and the urgency of communicating IUD migration to the clinician is likewise variable. Expulsion or intrauterine displacement of the IUD leads to decreased contraceptive efficacy and should be clearly communicated, since it warrants IUD replacement to prevent unplanned pregnancy. Embedment of the IUD into the myometrium can usually be managed in the outpatient clinical setting but occasionally requires hysteroscopic removal. Complete uterine perforation, in which the IUD is partially or completely within the peritoneal cavity, requires surgical management, and timely and direct communication with the clinician is essential in such cases. Careful evaluation for intraabdominal complications is also important, since they may warrant urgent or emergent surgical intervention. The radiologist plays an important role in the diagnosis of IUD migration and should be familiar with its appearance at multiple imaging modalities.

### Malpositioned IUCD: the menace of postpartum IUCD insertion [^112E9Zka]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Use of a postpartum intrauterine contraceptive device (PPIUCD) is a highly effective, reversible and long-acting family planning method that can be initiated in the immediate postpartum period, especially in lactating women. PPIUCDs have been inserted in more than 65,000 women worldwide and the numbers are increasing with many countries introducing PPIUCDs as part of their family planning programme. As the numbers of PPIUCD insertions are increasing, we are getting wiser regarding complications of this procedure. One of the less-understood entities is a malpositioned PPIUCD, a situation where the IUCD is present inside the uterus but its placement is eccentric and a part or the whole of it may be embedded in the myometrium. It can present as lost strings or as a failure to remove the intrauterine device. We present a series of cases with malpositioned PPIUCDs and their management.

### Hidden in plain sight: a malpositioned intrauterine device as the culprit of acute pelvic pain-a case report [^111rAKYn]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Malpositioned intrauterine devices (IUDs) are not yet a well recognized cause of acute pelvic pain. Correct identification relies on recognizing key imaging findings such as low-lying or endocervical positioning, and an understanding that acute pelvic pain may be the result of a malpositioned IUD. We report the case of a 28-year-old sexually active female (she/her/hers) with a history of a malpositioned IUD, who presented with sudden onset, unprovoked, right sided pelvic pain. She denied hematuria, dysuria, vaginal discharge, or vaginal bleeding. On physical examination she noted right-sided pelvic tenderness below McBurney's point; however, a pelvic examination was deferred. Ultrasound revealed an IUD in the endocervical canal. A CT confirmed a low-lying IUD. These findings were initially interpreted as normal. Only after follow-up with primary care, the IUD was removed and the patient reported complete resolution of her symptoms. This case highlights the importance of recognizing malpositioned IUDs on imaging. As in this case, misdiagnosis can result in overtesting and delays in patient care. Emergency providers should be familiar with radiographic findings and include malpositioned IUDs on their differential diagnosis.

### Continuation rates of two different-sized copper intrauterine devices among nulliparous women: interim 12-month results of a single-blind, randomised, multicentre trial [^116o6Eji]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Increased bleeding and pelvic pain are side effects that affect some copper intrauterine device (IUD) users, with first-year removal rates of 5% to 15% for these reasons. Nulliparous users have twice the rate of removal due to bleeding and pain compared to parous users. Disproportionately high removal rates for side effects may be due to numerous factors, including size and shape of the product and incompatibility with the dimensions of the uterine cavity. Numerous organizations support IUD use for nulliparous women and/or adolescents because the benefits far outweigh any serious health risks.

Nulliparous women typically have smaller uteri than parous women. A systematic review of endometrial cavity dimensions (mean fundal width × mean cavity length) measured mechanically reported 25.1mm × 33.7mm (nulliparous) versus 34.9mm × 38.6mm (parous); imaging measurements were 28.2mm × 37.0mm (nulliparous) versus 32.1mm × 44.3mm (parous). Using 3-dimensional ultrasound, Wildemeersch et al.estimated that the mean fundal uterine width of nulliparous women was 21.6mm, with 75% of measurements falling between 18mm and 24.8mm. IUD embedment is associated with narrow uterine cavities.

### Abnormal uterine bleeding: current classification and clinical management [^113fHGnu]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding is now classified and categorized according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics classification system: PALM-COEIN. This applies to nongravid women during their reproductive years and allows more clear designation of causes, thus aiding clinical care and future research.

### A proposed classification for intrauterine device position: the tal-reeves classification [^115VFGK6]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2022). High credibility.

Background

The lack of a common system for classification of intrauterine device (IUD) position is problematic. In one study, where IUD position was determined by expert opinion alone, increased IUD removal resulted in more pregnancies, while no pregnancies occurred among those with a 'mal-positioned' IUD with no specific criteria used. In practice, physicians often see patients with IUDs located in different areas of the uterus and the position changes over time. After initial placement, some IUDs are found higher in the uterus while others are found lower. Aside from the multiple locations of the IUD in the uterus, unilateral or bilateral 'embedment' or penetration of the IUD's arms into the myometrium is also common. Patients using IUDs often present symptoms relating to the device including pain, menstrual cramps and bleeding. The symptoms may be related to the position of the IUD in the uterus and the amount of arm embedment into the myometrium, but without a system for classification of position, it is not possible to conduct adequate clinical research on the relationship between position and symptoms.

Terminology for describing IUD location has not been standardised. IUD position has been studied in terms of relationship to the uterine fundus. However, in clinical practice, the distance from the uterine fundus is irrelevant. The distance from the fundus depends on the size of uterine cavity rather than migration. If the uterine cavity is large and the IUD is within the uterine cavity, the distance from the fundus has no known clinical value. In contrast, in a small nulliparous uterus, an IUD which is 2 cm from the fundus may extend into the cervix. Furthermore, symptoms do not correlate with the distance between the IUD and uterine fundus and the distance to the fundal-most portion of endometrial cavity. Not surprisingly, the position of the IUD changes during the menstrual cycle. Movement within the uterine cavity is normal, but, as an intrauterine contraceptive, the IUD should not be located below the internal cervical os, the anatomic landmark defining the start of the uterine cavity. Using distance from the fundus, the location of the IUD relative to the internal cervical os is not captured.

### Intrauterine devices in early pregnancy: findings on ultrasound and clinical outcomes [^111YushV]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to describe ultrasound findings, clinical symptoms, and outcomes of first-trimester pregnancies with intrauterine devices (IUDs).

Study Design

This was a retrospective review of 42 women with history of IUD placement and positive serum human chorionic gonadotropin in the first trimester.

Results

There were 31 intrauterine pregnancies (IUPs), 3 ectopic pregnancies, and 8 pregnancies of unknown location. Of 36 IUDs visualized, 15 were normally positioned and 21 malpositioned. Of 31 IUPs, 8 IUDs were within the endometrium, 17 were malpositioned, and 6 were not seen. Indications included bleeding (14 of 31), pain (12 of 31), and missing strings (5 of 31); 11 had no symptoms. Of 26 IUPs with known pregnancy outcomes, 20 were term deliveries and 6 had failed pregnancies of 20 weeks or less.

Conclusion

More than half of IUDs identified in the first trimester were malpositioned. IUP was 3 times as likely with a malpositioned or missing IUD. Three quarters of the IUPs with known outcomes had term deliveries. Symptoms were not predictive of IUD malposition.

### Risk factors for intrauterine device embedment in postmenopausal women: an analysis of 731 participants undergoing hysteroscopy [^116HDjvR]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

Although there are a great number of women older than 45 years needing IUD removal in China, little is known as yet about the variables that predispose postmenopausal women to IUD embedment. Uterine retroflexion, congenital uterine malformations, fibroids, symptoms such as bleeding and discomfort, suspected adenomyosis, past Cesarean section, uterine diameter, and endometrial thickness have been linked to an increased risk of IUD malpositioning. - In this study, we aimed to identify the potential risk factors for IUD embedment and explore the outcomes of postmenopausal women who underwent hysteroscopic IUD removal. We hypothesized that the IUD type, uterine volume, history of IUD removal failure, and existing uterine fibroids would be associated with a higher incidence of IUD embedment.

### Continuation rates of two different-sized copper intrauterine devices among nulliparous women: interim 12-month results of a single-blind, randomised, multicentre trial [^111dcWq9]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

We found a statistically significant higher probability of partial IUD expulsion in the TCu380A group compared to the NT380-Mini. Given lack of blinding of providers, their discretion at doing ultrasounds, and the possibility that the TCu380A group might have had more ultrasounds (leading to surveillance bias in detecting partial expulsions), we examined the frequency of ultrasounds. We found both treatment groups had the same percentage of ultrasounds in the first year (3.55% of NT380-Mini participants and 3.70% of TCu380A participants, p -value 0.664, data not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that this affected our results. The higher expulsion rate in the TCu380A group supports the notion that the TCu380A may be incompatible with the uterine cavities of some nulliparous users. Increased frequency or intensity of uterine contractions with a larger product in situ, may push a product toward the lower uterine cavity. Though IUDs have been shown to move toward and away from the fundus over time, a product that becomes temporarily or permanently malpositioned might also produce unacceptable bleeding and pain side effects that lead to early removal. As described in the 1970 US patent for the TCu380A frame, "the device is of such a size that the crossbar of the "T" may exert some lateral pressure on the endometrial wall of the uterus. X-ray studies indicate that the ends of the crossbar will become slightly embedded in the endometrium suggesting a gentle anchoring phenomenon".

### Uterine structural abnormality and intrauterine device malposition: analysis of ultrasonographic and demographic variables of 517 patients [^114VV2YZ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Intrauterine devices are currently one of the leading forms of reversible contraception in the world. However, in approximately 10–25% of women, intrauterine devices can become malpositioned, leading to consequences including pain, bleeding, as well as possible decreased contraceptive efficacy.

Objective

We sought to determine whether certain reproductive and uterine characteristics are associated with an increased risk of intrauterine device malposition. We hypothesized that anatomical characteristics such as the presence of any uterine anomalies, particularly congenital anomalies and fibroids that may lead to cavitary distortion, would be associated with a higher incidence of intrauterine device malposition.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a retrospective case-control study in an academic medical center. All patients presenting for scheduled ultrasound appointments for gynecologic indication between June 2004 and February 2016 were included (1,253 ultrasound reports identified). Of these, 236 demonstrated malpositioned intrauterine devices. With a control group of 281 patients with normal intrauterine device location, a total of 517 patients were included in the study. Transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasounds were performed followed by 3-dimensional rendering (as per our institution's protocol for patients with intrauterine devices) using Voluson 730 and Voluson E8 ultrasound machines. Demographic and reproductive characteristics, indication for ultrasound, intrauterine device, and uterine characteristics were all extrapolated from the electronic medical record. χ² Tests were performed for categorical variables. Generalized linear models for Poisson distributed variables, and multiple logistic regression were used to ascertain significant independent predictors of IUD malposition. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals and effect sizes were calculated, and P < .05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

In this study, we found a cumulative IUD malposition rate of 19%. In patients with malpositioned intrauterine devices, there was increased incidence of retroflexed uterine positions (7.6% vs 1.8%, P = 0.001), and all uterine anomalies (this includes septate and bicornuate uteri and fibroids, 31.9% vs 23.5%, P = 0.02) compared with controls. The anterior midline uterine position was more commonly noted in controls (28.5% vs 11%, P < .001). A higher total number of fibroids was noted in the malpositioned group (3.7 vs 1.8, P = 0.01); however, fibroid size was not statistically significant. In particular, there was an increased incidence of submucosal fibroids in women with malpositioned intrauterine devices (P = 0.01). Multivariable logistic regression revealed that anterior midline position (odds ratio [OR], 0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.20–0.57) and absence of uterine anomalies (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38–0.93) were factors associated with a lower risk of IUD malposition; whereas vaginal bleeding (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.38–3.67), pain (OR, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.84–4.44), or missing IUD strings at time of presentation (OR, 3.58; 95% CI, 1.88–6.82) were associated with an increased risk of malposition.

Conclusion

Retroflexed uterine positions and all uterine malformations are associated with higher incidence of malpositioned intrauterine devices. Presence of increased number of fibroids and specifically submucosal fibroids showed a positive association with intrauterine device malposition, as did symptoms of bleeding, pain, and missing IUD strings at time of presentation. These findings pertain to women presenting for gynecologic ultrasound evaluation and may not be generalizable to all women with IUDs.

### Society of Family Planning guidelines: postplacental insertion of intrauterine devices [^113dztmd]. Contraception (2018). Medium credibility.

Postplacental IUD ultrasound — follow-up and surveillance: Published data on malposition after postplacental IUD are limited; an observational study of 100 women with CuT380A found 44% malposition, a case-control study of 364 women found no association between malposition and placement at 6–9 weeks postpartum, and no pregnancies occurred among women with malpositioned copper or LNG-IUDs left in situ but pregnancy risk increased when malpositioned IUDs were removed without another highly effective method; one randomized study of an investigational LNG-IUD showed similar low pregnancy rates for intracervical versus intrauterine placement over 5 years, and while copper IUD effectiveness away from the fundus is a concern, no well-designed study has confirmed this, so based on the evidence we do not recommend routine ultrasound for surveillance after postplacental IUD insertion, and if incidental displacement is diagnosed on ultrasound, removal is not mandated but may be considered after counseling if immediate replacement or alternate highly effective contraception is feasible and desired.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the care of girls and women with Turner syndrome [^1158NE5h]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Turner syndrome — timing of progesterone during pubertal induction is outlined. Progesterone is unnecessary until uterine growth and development is approaching maturity, and in girls undergoing pubertal induction it is likely that progesterone will be needed after about 1.5–3 years of consistent estrogen administration or after the first episode of vaginal bleeding. It is good practice to ensure appropriateness by carrying out breast staging and, if possible, performing a pelvic US to review uterine dimensions and the presence of an endometrial stripe > 4–8 mm. Initial vaginal bleeding may be spotting only and does not necessarily indicate timing to start progesterone, and recent data suggest that girls with Turner syndrome who initiate progesterone closer to 18 months into estrogen treatment may have less abnormal uterine bleeding.

### Committee opinion No 672: clinical challenges of long-acting reversible contraceptive methods [^116AiyY3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Difficult removal of intrauterine device (IUD) — in a nonpregnant woman with nonvisualized strings, alligator forceps with or without ultrasonographic guidance can be used, and confirmation of intrauterine IUD location should be demonstrated before instrumenting. Ultrasonographic guidance may be useful to assist with IUD removal, and if resistance is encountered or the IUD breaks, hysteroscopy may be performed in the office or operating room to facilitate removal. Embedment may be identified on ultrasonography but may not be associated with difficult removal.

### Risk factors for intrauterine device embedment in postmenopausal women: an analysis of 731 participants undergoing hysteroscopy [^115XVPqD]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are the most widely used reversible method of contraception. The use of IUD by 41% of women (approximately 141 million) in China drives the high IUD prevalence worldwide. Between 1982 and 1990, an average of approximately 10 million women nationwide had an IUD placed each year because of China's one-child fertility policy. Recent studies have suggested that IUD use has continued to increase, with more than half of women of reproductive age using an IUD over the past 30 years. However, approximately one fourth of women older than 45 years have not yet had their IUD removed, largely because they are unaware of when an IUD should be removed and have insufficient health education to improve the on-time removal of IUD at menopause.

Ultrasonography is crucial for determining the IUD position and assessing its complications. The correct position of the IUD is at the uterine fundus, with the arms completely extended toward the uterine cornua and the vertical stem in the uterine cavity. Intrauterine device embedment is defined as the myometrial penetration of the IUD without serosal extension.

Copper IUDs, which are nonhormone devices used by young women, have high continuation rates, provide reliable protection for 10 to 12 years, and allow the rapid restoration of fertility after removal. Furthermore, after extensive myomectomy or any other procedures that could cause intrauterine adhesions, the use of an IUD is an effective way to prevent adhesions and restore the anatomy of the uterine cavity. Levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs are gaining popularity as a method of contraception; they can treat heavy menstrual bleeding, endometriosis-related discomfort, endometrial hyperplasia, and malignancy. - Thus, IUDs are an appealing contraceptive option for women.

Diagnostic procedures, including bimanual pelvic examinations, ultrasonography, dilation and curettage, and/or laparoscopy, are commonly performed in women with IUD-related disorders. Hysteroscopy with or without anesthesia is reportedly a feasible method of retrieving or repositioning an IUD, especially in cases in which the strings are not visible or fragmented pieces are located within the uterine cavity or cervical canal. - The visual dimensions offered by hysteroscopy improve diagnostic accuracy and minimize the limitations associated with other diagnostic procedures, such as blind curettage and hysterosalpingography (HSG).

### Inner myometrial laceration complicated by severe antepartum haemorrhage: a narrative review and case report [^112EnASr]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Intraoperative photograph of the inner myometrial laceration. The view is through the hysterotomy incision during cesarean section, looking toward the posterior wall of the lower uterine segment. The arrows delineate the margins of a longitudinal laceration, approximately 4 cm in length. The depth of the laceration extends through approximately two-thirds of the myometrial thickness. Critically, the overlying uterine serosa is intact and appears normal (asterisk, *). This finding confirms the diagnosis of an inner myometrial laceration rather than a uterine rupture

A 1–0 absorbable suture (Vicryl) was used to first place a "figure-of-8" suture at the base of the laceration, followed by a continuous suture to reinforce the muscle layer. Bilateral ligation of the ascending branches of the uterine arteries was also performed simultaneously, without uterine packing. The total estimated blood loss was 1600 ml, comprising approximately 1200 mL of antepartum vaginal blood loss and 400 mL of intraoperative loss (estimated by weighing surgical sponges and measuring suction volume). Postoperative monitoring revealed that the haemoglobin concentration decreased to 77 g/L. Given that the patient was haemodynamically stable with no signs of continued bleeding, transfusion was not administered. The patient recovered well and was discharged 72 h post-operatively. One-week follow-up revealed that the patient had no complaints of abnormal vaginal bleeding or other discomfort. Ultrasound revealed a well-healed uterine scar, a continuous and intact myometrium, and no abnormal blood flow signals (Fig. 3). As shown in Table 1.

Fig. 3
Postoperative transvaginal ultrasound image obtained one week after surgery. This sagittal view shows the lower uterine segment at the site of the repaired laceration and hysterotomy. The arrowheads point to the region of the healed scar, demonstrating a continuous and intact myometrial layer with no evidence of defect or hematoma. The endometrial stripe is visible and appears normal. These findings indicate satisfactory early healing following primary repair

### US of abnormal uterine bleeding [^113eNsGS]. Radiographics (2003). Low credibility.

Any significant deviation from a woman's established menstrual pattern may be considered abnormal uterine bleeding, and several factors direct evaluation of a patient with such bleeding. Premenopausal disorders that are well evaluated with ultrasound (US) include endometriosis, adenomyosis, and leiomyomas. A positive pregnancy test in a woman of childbearing age prompts a search for an intrauterine pregnancy. Possible complications that may contribute to bleeding include ectopic pregnancy; placental factors including position, trauma, and infection; gestational trophoblastic disease; preterm labor; and postpartum complications. Atrophic changes, hormonal status, and carcinoma are considerations in the postmenopausal patient with abnormal uterine bleeding. Foreign bodies, trauma, infection, polyps, and iatrogenic causes can be observed in all groups. Differential diagnoses for abnormal uterine bleeding in premenopausal, pregnant, and postmenopausal patients are well evaluated with US, and US techniques have greatly facilitated evaluation of pelvic disease. Urgent and emergent conditions such as ectopic pregnancy, placenta previa, and preterm labor are readily identifiable.

### A proposed classification for intrauterine device position: the tal-reeves classification [^112myN4q]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2022). High credibility.

Similarly, extension of the arms of an IUD into the myometrium (commonly referred to as 'embedment') has been associated with pain and bleeding. Thus it is important to capture intramural extension of IUD arms in a classification of IUD position. Currently, this imaging feature is not routinely used as part of the imaging description of the position of IUDs.

We developed this classification system over the course of a randomised study of two copper IUDs. In one arm of this study, we performed transvaginal ultrasonography and hysterosalpingography before and after each insertion of 99 copper T-shaped IUDs (T380S). At 3-month intervals over the first year, we performed transvaginal ultrasonography and, if ultrasonography was not clearly normal, we also performed hysterosalpingography. During the course of the study we observed a substantial number of participants with partial expulsion and intramural extension of the arms, leading to the development of this classification system. However, as this classification system developed through discussion over the course of the study, we did not classify IUD position prospectively to allow correlation with symptoms.

### Management of abnormal uterine bleeding with emphasis on alternatives to hysterectomy [^112J8fSX]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is a common problem that negatively impacts a woman's health-related quality of life and activity. Initial medical treatment includes hormonal and nonhormonal medications. If bleeding persists and no structural abnormalities are present, a repeat trial of medical therapy, a levonorgestrel intrauterine system, or an endometrial ablation can be used dependent on future fertility wishes. The levonorgestrel intrauterine system and endometrial ablation are effective, less invasive, and safe alternatives to a hysterectomy in women with AUB. A hysterectomy is the definitive treatment of AUB irrespective of the suspected cause when alternative treatments fail. Future studies should focus on detection of predictors for treatment outcomes.

### Migration of an intrauterine contraceptive device during the course of pregnancy: a case report [^115UV6Sn]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Uterine perforation by a contraceptive intrauterine device (IUD) is a relatively rare event. These events may result secondary to mechanical force applied during placement (primary perforation) or migration by uterine contractions or surgical manipulation after placement (secondary perforation). A 33-year-old woman with an IUD placed 9 years before admission visited the emergency department with an early pregnancy and a 3-day history of vaginal bleeding. Vaginal examination revealed IUD strings visible at the cervical os, and transvaginal ultrasound confirmed the presence of an IUD in the lower uterine segment and upper cervix. The IUD migrated spontaneously to the fundal myometrium at 15 weeks' gestation. Premature rupture of membranes ensued at 20 weeks' gestation, and, at delivery, the IUD could not be retrieved. Subsequent computed tomography confirmed that the IUD was incompletely embedded in the fundal myometrium and partially extending into the peritoneal cavity. At laparoscopic sterilization 6 weeks later, the IUD had perforated the small bowel, and the device was removed with concomitant bowel repair. This case documents spontaneous migration of a copper IUD from the lower uterine segment through the fundus during early pregnancy and supports removal of asymptomatic ectopic IUDs whenever possible.

### Does the type of intrauterine device affect conspicuity on 2D and 3D ultrasound? [^115Z9eBL]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of our study was to assess the conspicuity and position evaluation of intrauterine devices (IUDs) on 2D ultrasound and 3D ultrasound in nongravid patients.

Materials and Methods

Review of the ultrasound database for the period from July 2008 through June 2009 was performed for identification of patients with IUDs, of the type and position of the IUD, and of the patient's presenting symptoms. The conspicuity of the IUD on 2D sagittal and transverse planes and 3D coronal views was scored according to a 7-point scale. Data analysis was performed using the Student t test and the Pearson chi-square test.

Results

Of the 269 patients with IUDs who had undergone ultrasound during the study period, 180 patients had a copper IUD; 59, a levonorgestrel-releasing device; and three, a Lippes loop. Twenty-seven IUDs were excluded because they were not seen on ultrasound (n = 15) or the type of IUD was not identifiable (n = 12). Of the 239 IUDs identified, the conspicuity score for copper IUDs (mean score, 5.3 [SD, 1.4]) differed significantly from that for levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs (mean, 3.1 [1.0]) on 2D ultrasound (p < 0.001). The difference in the conspicuity score for copper IUDs (mean, 6.6 [0.95]) versus that for levonorgestrel-releasing devices (mean, 6.2 [0.92]) on 3D ultrasound was marginally significant (p = 0.05). One hundred seventy-six IUDs (74%) were properly positioned within the endometrial cavity and 60 (25%) were malpositioned; proper positioning of three IUDs (1%) could not be confirmed. The indications for sonographic evaluation were pain (111/239, 46%), missing strings (91/239, 38%), and bleeding (34/239, 14%). Of the patients who presented with bleeding, the IUD was malpositioned in 13 (38%).

Conclusion

The levonorgestrel-releasing IUD is significantly less conspicuous than the copper IUD on 2D imaging. Three-dimensional ultrasound enhances the conspicuity of both types of IUD.

### The challenging intrauterine contraceptive: in-office hysteroscopic approach [^11515AMU]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Study Object

To describe 3 cases of misplaced or retained Intrauterine Contraceptive (IUC) that were successfully resolved by hysteroscopy performed in an ambulatory setting using miniaturized electrosurgical and mechanical operative instruments.

Design

Step-by-step description of the technique using slides, pictures, and video (educative video) (Canadian Task Force classification III).

Setting

Misplaced or retained IUC may be related to several causes; incorrect insertion is the leading cause. In these cases, patients may complain of abnormal bleeding, pelvic pain, or pregnancy or they may remain asymptomatic. When a displaced IUC is suspected, transvaginal ultrasonography is the primary investigation followed by radiography in cases in which the IUC is not seen within the uterus. Additional imaging such as computed tomographic scanning or magnetic resonance imaging may be needed. Hysteroscopy represents the gold standard for diagnostic clarification and management of a dislocated or embedded IUC.

Interventions

The hysteroscopic approach of the 3 cases was the following: removal of a partially perforating IUD in the cesarean scar pouch, repositioning of a dislocated IUS in the isthmocele, and removal of an embedded IUS in the cornual area. The procedures were performed in an ambulatory setting using a 5-mm continuous flow hysteroscope and vaginoscopic approach without any analgesia and/or anesthesia. The alternate use of mechanical and electrosurgical 5F instruments allowed us to separate the IUC from the myometrial uterine wall, respecting the healthy myometrium and without causing significant patient discomfort or complications.

Conclusion

The possibility of using miniaturized electrosurgical and mechanical instruments with small-diameter hysteroscopes offers the possibility of an effective, safe, cost-efficient, and well-tolerated removal or repositioning of a misplaced or retained IUC. This minimally invasive approach can be performed in an office setting to avoid more invasive and traumatic approaches.

### Risk factors for intrauterine device embedment in postmenopausal women: an analysis of 731 participants undergoing hysteroscopy [^112ru4kc]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

This retrospective study was conducted at a family planning department in a tertiary hospital in Shanghai between January 2019 and December 2021. Approval was obtained from the institutional review board for this study (GKLW-202255; December 5, 2022), and the need for informed consent was waived. Postmenopausal women who underwent hysteroscopic removal of retained or fragmented IUD were included in the study. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) nonmenopausal women; (2) pharmacotherapeutically induced menopause in women with breast cancer; (3) women with IUD perforation, ectopic IUD, and surgical failure; and (4) women with severe acute and chronic disorders who could not withstand hysteroscopy.

Data on sociodemographics, reproductive history, previous surgical history, bimanual pelvic examination findings, ultrasound results, operative notes, and surgical findings were acquired from medical records. Variables included age; gravidity and parity; menopause duration; the duration of an IUD in situ; previous vaginal delivery; abortion times; previous surgical history (including Cesarean section, LEEP [loop electrosurgical excision procedure] myomectomy, IUD removal failure); other complaints (including uterine bleeding and intrauterine fluid); cervical atrophy; uterine anomalies (including septate uterus, fibroids, and adenomyosis); postabortion insertion or postpartum insertion within 6 months; uterine position; IUD shape; uterine volume; endometrial thickness; and the location of the embedded IUD. Intrauterine device placement immediately after dilation and curettage was considered postabortion insertion. Transvaginal ultrasonography was used to calculate the uterine volume using the following formula: volume = 0.5233 × D₁ (longitudinal dimension) × D₂ (anteroposterior dimension) × D₃ (transverse dimension) cm³. Before surgery, speculum and bimanual pelvic examinations were performed to assess the cervix, uterus, and IUD string. In addition, ultrasonography was performed to assess the intrauterine condition of the IUD. If necessary, HSG was performed to understand the relationship between the IUD and the endometrial and myometrial layers.

Abnormal uterine bleeding is an important clinical concern and accounts for much medical intervention. This article presents an ultrasound-based approach to help exclude endometrial carcinoma and identify the source of bleeding for better clinical management. Saline infusion sonohysterography can help to triage patients to (1) no anatomic pathology, (2) globally thickened anatomic pathology that may be evaluated with blind endometrial sampling, or (3) focal abnormalities that must be evaluated under direct vision.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^112BjGBi]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Cu-IUD bleeding irregularities — counseling and evaluation: Before Cu-IUD placement, provide counseling about potential changes in bleeding patterns during Cu-IUD use, noting that spotting or light bleeding and heavy or prolonged bleeding is common during the first 3–6 months of Cu-IUD use, is generally not harmful but might be bothersome to the patient, and generally decreases with continued Cu-IUD use. If clinically indicated, consider an underlying health condition such as Cu-IUD displacement, STIs, pregnancy, thyroid disorders, or new pathologic uterine conditions (e.g., polyps or fibroids), especially in patients already using the Cu-IUD for a few months or longer who develop new heavy or prolonged bleeding; if an underlying condition is found, treat the condition or refer for care. Explore patient goals, including continued Cu-IUD use (with or without treatment for bleeding irregularities) or Cu-IUD removal.

### Committee opinion No 672: clinical challenges of long-acting reversible contraceptive methods [^1133HGFp]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Nonfundal location of IUD — management varies by device position and patient symptoms; the most common locations are the cervix and lower uterine segment. An IUD located within the cervix is partially expelled and, given the increased risk of complete expulsion, the IUD should be removed (and replaced if the patient desires). For an asymptomatic woman with the IUD above the internal os, removal is more likely to lead to pregnancy than retention, and retention of a low-lying IUD is associated with lower pregnancy rates than removal. Most downwardly displaced IUDs above the internal os are not ultimately expelled, many nonfundal IUDs shortly after insertion move to a fundal position within 3 months, and expectant management is a reasonable option with shared decision making; the greatest risk of pregnancy may be the unnecessary removal of a nonfundal IUD.

### Risks of uterine perforation and expulsion associated with intrauterine devices [^112mT6Gz]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

In the primary analyses, potential risk factors of interest included postpartum status at IUD insertion (0–3 days, 4 days to 6 weeks, more than 6 to 14 weeks, or more than 14 to 52 weeks after a delivery, or nonpostpartum [more than 52 weeks postpartum or nulliparous]); breastfeeding status at the time of IUD insertion (yes or no, among those with a delivery in the previous 52 weeks); diagnosis of heavy menstrual bleeding in the 52 weeks before IUD insertion (identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes); and type of IUD inserted (levonorgestrel-releasing vs copper). For the heavy menstrual bleeding risk factor analysis, only those without a delivery in the 52 weeks before insertion were included. An additional analysis evaluated other potential risk factors for expulsion in nonpostpartum individuals, including age, race and ethnicity, BMI, parity, experience with heavy menstrual bleeding (recent diagnosis [1 year or less before index date only], past diagnosis [more than 1 year before index date only], or both), and diagnosis of dysmenorrhea. Race and ethnicity were collected in this study as a potential risk factor for expulsion.

The outcomes of interest were IUD-related uterine perforation and IUD expulsion, both identified by the date on which the outcome was documented in the records. A perforation could have been recognized at the time of insertion or later; a diagnosis at more than 1 year after insertion in asymptomatic individuals is not uncommon. Perforation was defined as complete (IUD presence in the pelvis or abdominal cavity) or partial (IUD embedded in the myometrium as visualized on imaging or hysteroscopy with subsequent IUD removal, or partial perforation noted by a clinician at the time of removal). Expulsion was defined as complete (IUD located in the vagina, or not present in the uterus or abdomen on imaging, or the patient reported that the IUD was expelled or "fell out") or partial (any portion of IUD in the cervix on imaging or visualized by the clinician, or IUD malpositioned on imaging and removed by the clinician).

### Clinical practice guideline for abnormal uterine bleeding: hysterectomy versus alternative therapy [^116Kc3vU]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To develop recommendations in selecting treatments for abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB).

Design

Clinical practice guidelines.

Setting

Randomized clinical trials compared bleeding, quality of life, pain, sexual health, satisfaction, the need for subsequent surgery, and adverse events between hysterectomy and less-invasive treatment options.

Patients

Women with AUB, predominantly from ovulatory disorders and endometrial causes.

Interventions

On the basis of findings from a systematic review, clinical practice guidelines were developed. Rating the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations followed the Grades for Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system.

Measurements and Main Results

This paper identified few high-quality studies that directly compared uterus-preserving treatments (endometrial ablation, levonorgestrel intrauterine system and systemically administered medications) with hysterectomy. The evidence from these randomized clinical trials demonstrated that there are trade-offs between hysterectomy and uterus-preserving treatments in terms of efficacy and adverse events.

Conclusion

Selecting an appropriate treatment for AUB requires identifying a woman's most burdensome symptoms and incorporating her values and preferences when weighing the relative benefits and harms of hysterectomy versus other treatment options.

### Ease of removal of malpositioned intrauterine devices: a retrospective cohort study [^111JgsnH]. Contraception (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to compare removal timing, techniques, and success of malpositioned intrauterine device (IUDs) to nonmalpositioned IUDs.

Study Design

We performed a retrospective cohort study of IUD users with ultrasound performed between July 2014 and July 2017 within one medical system. We used Fisher exact and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to compare clinical characteristics and IUD removal details between patients with malpositioned and nonmalpositioned IUDs.

Results

Of 1759 ultrasounds reporting the presence of an IUD, 436 described IUD malposition. Of these, 150 described the IUD as embedded and 16 as partially perforated. IUDs were more likely to be removed and removed sooner for patients with malpositioned compared with nonmalpositioned IUDs (281/436 vs 545/1323, p < 0.001 and median 17 days vs 236 days from the index ultrasound, p < 0.001). Most IUDs, malpositioned and nonmalpositioned, were removed on the first attempt (82%, 85%), by a generalist obstetrician and gynecologist (75%, 70%), using a ring forceps (73%, 65%). Most embedded and partially perforated IUDs were removed (68%, 69%), using a ring forceps (59%, 67%), on the first attempt (84%, 91%).

Conclusions

Malpositioned IUDs were more likely to be removed and removed sooner than nonmalpositioned IUDs. Most IUDs, even IUDs labeled as partially perforated or embedded, were removed by a generalist obstetrician and gynecologist, using ring forceps, on first attempt.

Implications

Ultrasound findings of IUD malposition are not associated with difficult IUD removal.

### Incidental detection of a transmigrated intrauterine device [^115nYJH3]. Emergency Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

The intrauterine device (IUD) is among the most effective forms of birth control available, with important advantages over other methods of contraception. The most striking adverse event associated with IUD use is uterine perforation and migration of the device. Contrary to what one might assume, perforation is often silent and the wayward device is either detected after further sequellae or found incidentally by imaging. The radiologist should be aware of the natural course, presentations, diagnostic evaluation and treatment (if any) for this misplaced foreign body.

### Risk factors for intrauterine device embedment in postmenopausal women: an analysis of 731 participants undergoing hysteroscopy [^114bv9tS]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, we demonstrated that women with embedded IUDs had a smaller uterine volume than those with a normally placed IUD. Shipp et alpreviously demonstrated that embedded IUDs were associated with a reduced endometrial cavity width of the fundus. We observed no discernible differences in the gravidity, delivery methods, or years with an IUD in situ between the two groups. While others have demonstrated that a retroflexed uterus is linked to a greater prevalence of IUD malalignment, the association between uterine positioning and embedment was not significant in our study.

Studies have linked early postpartum and immediate postabortion insertions to a greater chance of expulsion; however, no such studies have been conducted to identify IUD embedment in women with such insertions. Immediate postabortion IUD insertion was not identified as a risk factor for embedment in our study, demonstrating that immediate postabortion IUD insertion was safe over a long period. However, the trimester in which the abortion occurred was not considered. The safety of IUD implantation within half a year after delivery is evidenced by the fact that there was no link between IUD embedment and IUD implantation 6 months after delivery. However, the timing of IUD placement in relation to nursing care or delivery is unknown. Similar to the study by Braaten et al, no significant correlations between IUD embedment and fibroids were identified in our study. However, Gerkowicz et aldemonstrated that the presence of more fibroids and submucosal fibroids was associated with IUD malpositioning.

To our knowledge, no studies have examined the prevalence of IUD embedment in postmenopausal women undergoing hysteroscopy. The current study is the largest to evaluate parameters related to IUD embedment. Because the study was conducted at a single center, the potential for misevaluation was reduced by having only two clinicians carry out the examinations. Our results must be interpreted within the context of the study design. This was a retrospective study that was exploratory in nature and constrained by participant characteristics noted during the relevant period. A multicenter study with a larger sample size is required to obtain more definitive results.

### Cross-sectional imaging of acute gynaecologic disorders: CT and MRI findings with differential diagnosis-part II: uterine emergencies and pelvic inflammatory disease [^112Aec6x]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Uterine emergencies

Abnormal genital bleeding represents the characteristic and most common manifestation of acute uterine disorders and is one of the most common presentations in the emergency gynaecology unit as it accounts for approximately one-third of urgent gynaecologic visits. Causes encompass a wide spectrum of systemic and endocrine disorders, benign conditions (infection and focal abnormalities of the uterine cavity) and malignancies.

In reproductive-age women, when pregnancy is ruled out, clinical examination is required to search for vaginal and cervical abnormalities underlying acute bleeding. Additional imaging is required to detect or exclude abnormalities such as endometrial polyps or submucosal fibroids. Endometrial cancer is rarely encountered in pre-menopausal women, very exceptionally under 40 years of age. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (idiopathic menorrhagia) represents a diagnosis of exclusion, in the absence of a recognizable pelvic pathology.

Transvaginal US remains the initial modality of choice in the evaluation of endometrial diseases, but the use of MRI to clarify abnormal or suspicious US findings before hysteroscopy is increasing, as it provides superior detection and characterisation of abnormalities in the uterine cavity.

Endometrial polyps

Endometrial polyps (EP) represent a localised overgrowth of endometrial glands with a central stroma composed of fibrous tissue or smooth muscle. Sometimes asymptomatic, EP easily cause either menometrorrhagia in pre-menopausal women or post-menopausal bleeding. The prevalence ranges from 7.8% to 34.9% and increases with age; tamoxifen is a well-established risk factor.

On T2-weighted MR images, EP appear as low signal intensity sessile or pedunculated masses projecting into the endometrial cavity, surrounded by high signal intensity fluid and endometrium. Furthermore, a fibrous core (low signal intensity stripe or centre) and intratumoural cysts (discrete, smooth-walled cystic structures of high signal intensity) may be identified within the mass. Cystic spaces correspond to dilated glands but are nonspecific as they may be present within EP, hyperplasia or cancer. On T1-weighted images, EP generally have isointense signal compared to the endometrium, and may become haemorrhagic after ulceration or infarction leading to the appearance of hyperintense region best appreciated using precontrast fat saturation. After gadolinium contrast, EP may show either early persistent or gradually increasing enhancement, equal to or greater than that of outer myometrium (Fig. 1).

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^116gJujL]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Intrauterine device (IUD) strings not visible and cannot be safely retrieved — evaluation and counseling include to consider ultrasonography to determine IUD location and recognize that an unlocated IUD might have been expelled or have perforated the uterine wall; if ultrasound is not possible or the IUD is intrauterine, advise prompt care for heavy bleeding, cramping, pain, abnormal vaginal discharge, or fever. Removing the IUD improves pregnancy outcome when strings are visible or retrieval from the cervical canal is safe, and risks for spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery, and infection are substantial if the IUD is left in place. A systematic review identified nine studies showing greater risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes when the IUD is not removed; Cu‑IUD removal decreased risks but not to baseline, and in one LNG‑IUD case series, when IUDs were not removed eight out of 10 pregnancies ended in spontaneous abortions; effects of theoretical hormonal exposure on fetal abnormalities are unknown.

### Committee opinion No 672: clinical challenges of long-acting reversible contraceptive methods [^114zGm6d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

IUD expulsion — expulsion occurs in 2–10% of users and varies by type; reported risk factors include age younger than 20 years, heavy menstrual bleeding, and dysmenorrhea, while recent data do not support nulliparity as a risk factor. An analysis of more than 5,000 IUD users 36 months after insertion found an overall expulsion rate of 10.2 per 100 IUD users, with the strongest risk factor being younger age (14–19 years) at insertion and no differences by IUD type or parity. Insertions immediately postpartum and after second trimester abortions have been associated with higher risk of expulsion, yet they are cost effective and decrease subsequent unintended pregnancy. Anatomic distortion may increase expulsion risk, the position of the uterus does not affect expulsion rates, expulsion may be partial or complete, and if the IUD is palpated or visualized in the cervix, it should be removed and pregnancy ruled out; a woman may opt for another IUD insertion at the same time or another contraceptive method.

### A proposed classification for intrauterine device position: the tal-reeves classification [^1155ob2m]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

We propose a simple, feasible and practical classification that uses the position of the IUD in relation to the internal os rather than the fundus. Modern ultrasound imaging enables visualisation of the location of the IUD in relationship to the cervical os as well as extension into the myometrium. The goal of the Tal-Reeves classification system is to allow standardisation of reporting of IUD location both for clinical use and research for evaluation of new IUD designs. The system proposed is based on the concept that defining 'normal position' is less important than defining what is abnormal.

This system does not include IUD position within the abdomen or other unusual positions which are, fortunately, much less common. Although these IUD locations are well known, over 130 person-years of observation with the T380S we did not find any cases that could not be described using this system, indicating the relative infrequency that other positions are observed. Importantly, those rare IUD positions can be accurately described based on other anatomic landmarks. Adding those positions to the proposed system is unlikely to be useful.

We believe that the proposed system parsimoniously balances precision with simplicity. Although one could contemplate measuring the distance that the IUD lies above or below the internal os, the distance is only relevant for a particular uterus. For example, an IUD 4 cm below the internal os could be in position B (inside the cervix) for a patient with a 5 cm cervix, or for a patient with a 3 cm cervix, the IUD could be in position C, extending outside the external os.

On ultrasound imaging, the relationship of the bottom of the IUD and the internal os is easily identified by anyone experienced in sonography (figure 3). The difference between classification A and B is defined simply by that relationship. If it is above the internal os it is A (A bove), and if it is below, it is B (B elow). If it is seen through the cervix (you can 'C' it) it is C, and if it is not seen at all it is D (D isappeared). We observed excellent correlation between hysterosalpingography and ultrasonography findings, suggesting that the classification can be made based on ultrasound imaging alone.

### Diagnosis of abnormal uterine bleeding with biopsy or hysteroscopy [^114vd7mk]. Menopause (2011). Low credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding in women is a common cause for gynecologic consultation. Physicians must maintain a low threshold for endometrial assessment in abnormal uterine bleeding. Accurately determining the etiology of the bleeding permits appropriate treatment, minimizes unnecessary delays in therapy, and prevents needless worry in women. There are few national consensus guidelines, best practice guidelines, or treatment algorithms that provide gynecologists with scrupulous data to make concise decisions for the utilization of technology such as endometrial biopsy, transvaginal ultrasound, saline infusion sonography, or hysteroscopy in the evaluation of menstrual aberrations. Using technology that has a high sensitivity to detect a disease allows a physician to make concise decisions for proceeding with minimally invasive procedures or reliance on medical therapies that will probably be effective.

### Extrauterine mislocated IUD: is surgical removal mandatory? [^116UGzva]. Contraception (2002). Low credibility.

The incidence of intrauterine device perforation is 0.87 per 1000 insertions. An intrauterine device (IUD) may perforate through the uterine wall into the pelvic or abdominal cavity or into adjacent organs. The accepted treatment for displaced IUDs is surgical removal because of the putative risk of adhesion formation or of damage to the intestine or urinary bladder. The purpose of this article is to present three cases of IUD perforation where surgical removal may not have been necessary. In all three cases, the IUD was removed by laparoscopy. No adhesions were found in any of the patients. Criteria for the surgical removal of a displaced IUD, as a result of uterine perforation, should be re-evaluated. Whilst surgical procedures to remove a misplaced IUD must be performed on symptomatic patients, asymptomatic patients, under certain circumstances, may benefit from conservative management.

Intrauterine device (IUD) strings not visible and cannot be safely retrieved — ultrasonography and pregnancy management: If ultrasonography is available, consider performing or referring for ultrasound examination to determine the location of the IUD and if the IUD cannot be located, it might have been expelled or have perforated the uterine wall; if ultrasonography is not possible or the IUD is determined by ultrasound to be inside the uterus, advise the patient to seek care promptly if they have heavy bleeding, cramping, pain, abnormal vaginal discharge, or fever; removing the IUD improves the pregnancy outcome if the IUD strings are visible or the device can be retrieved safely from the cervical canal and risks for spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery, and infection are substantial if the IUD is left in place; theoretically, the fetus might be affected by hormonal exposure from an LNG-IUD, however whether this exposure increases the risk for fetal abnormalities is unknown; a systematic review identified nine studies suggesting that women who did not remove their IUDs during pregnancy were at greater risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, and with LNG-IUDs when the IUDs were not removed, eight out of 10 pregnancies ended in spontaneous abortions, with Cu-IUD removal decreasing risks but not to the baseline risk for pregnancies without an IUD.

### Risk factors for intrauterine device embedment in postmenopausal women: an analysis of 731 participants undergoing hysteroscopy [^111AxeQk]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

There were 760 postmenopausal women who visited the family planning clinic for the removal of a retained IUD. Of the 760 participants, 29 were excluded from the study; 6 women had low-lying IUD, 2 had perforations, 2 experienced removal failure due to dense vaginal and cervical adhesions, 3 had an IUD in the endocervical canal, and 16 had a fractured residual IUD without embedment (Fig. 1). Ultimately, 731 women were included in this study. Of these women, 430 had a normally located IUD, while 301 had an embedded IUD.

FIG. 1
Flowchart of the study. IUD, intrauterine device.

Table 1 shows the baseline demographic characteristics and surgical outcomes of participants in the embedded and control groups. The menopause duration among the women in the embedded and control groups ranged from 1 to 40 years (mean, 7.7 y) and 1 to 38 years (mean, 8.2 y), respectively. Intrauterine devices were in situ for an average of 28.5 years (9–52 y) and 28.7 years (5.5–50 y) in the embedded and control groups, respectively. There were no differences in age, parity, menopausal duration, years with an IUD in situ, or uterine position between the embedded and control groups. There were no differences in endometrial thickness, uterine bleeding, intrauterine fluid, or history of cervical LEEP or myomectomy. We found that women in the embedded group had more abortions than those in the control group (1.3 ± 0.88 vs 1.2 ± 1.0, P = 0.022). No IUD were placed at the time of delivery. The uterine volumes of the embedded group were significantly smaller than those of the control group (22.7 cm³ [95% CI, 20.9–24.5] vs 27.9 cm³ [95% CI, 24.8–30.9], P = 0.007). Furthermore, factors that were found to be associated with IUD embedment in the bivariate analysis were prior IUD removal failure (P < 0.001), cervical atrophy (P = 0.01), and IUD shape (P = 0.004).

### Contraindications to IUD and IUS use [^111n3moG]. Contraception (2007). Low credibility.

Contraindications to IUD or IUS use can be found on product labeling, in the guidelines of various specialty groups and in recommendations from peer-reviewed articles. Overly restrictive contraindications block access to this top-tier method for many women who would be candidates based on current scientific evidence. Assuming that a condition should be listed as a contraindication only if the risk of IUD/IUS use by a woman with that condition exceeds her risk with pregnancy, the list of contraindications is reduced to pregnancy, active uterine infection, malignancy in the uterus or cervix, an inability to place or retain the device, unexplained abnormal bleeding and adverse reaction to product ingredients.

### Imaging of intrauterine contraceptive devices [^1147ikWe]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUDs) are reemerging as common methods of birth control in the United States. Imaging, especially sonography, has an important role in their evaluation. This review illustrates the normal and abnormal imaging appearances of IUDs.

Methods

We describe and illustrate the appearance of different types of IUDs on different imaging modalities as well as radiologically relevant complications associated with IUDs.

Results

On sonography, the IUD should be visualized as centrally located within the endometrial cavity, with the crossbar (if present) in the fundal portion of the endometrial cavity. Some older patients have IUDs in place that are no longer commonly used, such as the Lippes Loop (Ortho Pharmaceutical, Raritan, NJ) and Saf-T-Coil (Julius Schmid Laboratories, Little Falls, NJ), which have a pathognomonic appearance. Newer IUDs, such as the early version of the Mirena IUD (Leiras Oy, Turku, Finland), may be difficult to visualize on sonography. Patients from China frequently have a ring-shaped IUD. Sonography is important in assessing the complications of IUDs, including a low position, associated infection, myometrial migration, uterine perforation, intrauterine or extrauterine pregnancy associated with the IUD, and retention and fragmentation of the IUD. If an IUD is known to be present but not visualized sonographically, plain radiography is helpful in assessing the location. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are not typically used to assess IUDs, but the appearances of IUDs should be recognized with these modalities.

Conclusions

Imaging, specifically sonography, has a crucial role in the evaluation and management of IUDs and associated complications.

### Demographic, reproductive, and medical risk factors for intrauterine device expulsion [^112m2ttW]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Categories for the risk factors of interest at the time of IUD insertion, including age, race and ethnicity (self-reported and as identified in the EHR), parity, BMI measurement closest to IUD insertion, history of heavy menstrual bleeding, and history of dysmenorrhea, are shown in Box 1.

Box 1.
Risk Factors

The outcome of interest, IUD expulsion, was determined from the EHR, including clinical notes, using algorithms developed and validated for this purpose. Both complete expulsions (defined as an IUD located in the vagina, not present in the uterus or abdomen on imaging, or with documented reports that the IUD was expelled or "fell out") and partial expulsions (defined as visualization of the IUD extruding from the external cervical os or present in the cervix on imaging) were included. An IUD malpositioned in the uterine cavity (eg, imaging demonstrated the IUD in the lower uterine segment but not the cervix) was considered an expulsion only if removed by the clinician.

### The shadow of the intrauterine device [^111oBKdE]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

An intrauterine device (IUD) is a highly effective and prevalent form of birth control with a low failure rate. It is not without complications, including irregular bleeding and pelvic pain, perforation, expulsion, and pregnancy. Investigation of the symptomatic patient and routine follow-up of asymptomatic women with IUDs include transvaginal ultrasonography to rule out IUD malposition and other complications. Three-dimensional ultrasonography (3DUS) has been shown to have added value in imaging the pelvic organs, including the uterus. However, even with 3DUS, the operator may encounter difficulty in imaging the IUD in its entirety, because of variability in both echogenicity and exact location.

Methods

More than 30 women undergoing IUD placement evaluation, including routine examinations and cases of suspected pregnancy, irregular bleeding, infection, and pelvic pain, were evaluated with 3DUS and volume contrast imaging in the C plane (VCI-C), which visualized acoustic shadows of the IUDs, facilitating identification of the intrauterine position and type of the device.

Results

Four examples are presented from women undergoing evaluation of IUD placement in whom 2-dimensional ultrasonography failed to visualize the device satisfactorily. Volume contrast imaging in the C plane allowed visualization of the acoustic shadows of the IUDs, thereby providing more exact imaging of the type of device as well as aiding in locating the IUD. In a woman with irregular bleeding, a bicornuate uterus with pregnancy in 1 horn and a bowed T-type IUD in the contralateral horn were diagnosed with VCI-C.

Conclusions

We conclude from these shadow images that VCI-C is a useful modality in cases of difficult visualization of the IUD; VCI-C visualization of the acoustic shadow of the IUD may provide an adjunctive approach.

### Incidence and risk factors for a malpositioned intrauterine device detected on three-dimensional ultrasound within eight weeks of placement [^115weKMg]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To estimate the incidence of intrauterine device (IUD) malpositioning detected on three-dimensional (3D) transvaginal ultrasound within 8weeks of placement and identify risk factors for malpositioning.

Methods

Retrospective study of women who had an IUD placed at a large obstetrics and gynecology practice from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2020. All patients underwent two-dimensional ultrasound at the time of insertion and routine three-dimensional ultrasound within 8weeks. Baseline characteristics and potential risk factors were compared between women with correctly positioned and malpositioned IUDs. Odds ratios were calculated by logistic regression to identify risk factors independently associated with malpositioning.

Results

A total of 763 IUD placements were included, and 127 malpositioned IUDs were identified representing an overall rate of malpositioning of 16.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 14.0–19.3) with 8.8% (95% CI 6.8–10.8) requiring removal. Patients with malpositioned IUD had higher rates of morbid obesity (13.4% versus 3.8%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.46, 95% CI 1.10–5.50), prior uterine window or rupture (9.0% versus 2.2%, aOR 2.78, 95% CI 1.06–7.30), copper IUD placement (64.2% versus 47.4%, aOR 1.99, 95% CI 1.31–3.03), and symptoms such as bleeding or pain at follow-up (35.8% versus 20.1%, aOR 2.58, 95% CI 1.67–3.98). Parity, breastfeeding, difficult insertion, and uterine size and positioning were not significant.

Conclusions

The incidence of malpositioned IUD within 8weeks of placement on 3D ultrasound is 16.6%, with 8.8% requiring removal. Significant risk factors for malpositioning include morbid obesity, prior uterine window or rupture, and copper IUD placement. These findings support the importance of routine follow-up 3D ultrasound after seemingly successful IUD placement.

Endometrial disorders

The category of primary endometrial disorders is assigned to presumed ovulatory women with AUB for whom there is no other demonstrable cause. While likely extremely common, the diagnosis of AUB‐E may be difficult to make for a number of reasons. The most obvious case is the symptom of HMB in the context of an entirely normal investigation. However, AUB‐E may occur when the evaluation demonstrates asymptomatic abnormalities such as a leiomyoma not in contact with the endometrium, or a single adenomyosis feature, neither of which is likely to cause the symptom of heavy bleeding.

Fundamentally, these disorders of endometrial hemostasis reflect primary dysfunction in the mechanisms by which menstrual bleeding is controlled locally that likely comprise some combination of deficiencies in the mechanisms of vasoconstriction, alterations in the formation or maintenance of intravascular thrombi, and impairment in the process of endometrial repair. Unfortunately, while there exists almost half a century of study of these molecular mechanisms in women with (what we are calling) AUB‐E, there are currently no diagnostic tests available to clinicians, making it necessary to make a presumed diagnosis of this category. This circumstance may contribute to what is likely a vast underdiagnosis and normalization of the symptoms of women with AUB‐E.

Iatrogenic

There are many mechanisms through which medications or other interventions may lead to AUB. These include medicated or inert intrauterine devices, drugs that interfere with the coagulation cascade, as well as medication that interferes with ovulatory mechanisms. Women using gonadal steroids for contraception or the treatment of AUB often experience breakthrough bleeding or unscheduled bleeding that should be captured in FIGO System 1. When AUB is suspected to be caused by a device or medication, it is crucial to ensure that the bleeding originates from the endometrial cavity, and then further investigate, manage, and counsel the patient appropriately. Clinical guidance on the management of abnormal bleeding while using gonadal steroids has been reviewed elsewhere; however, it is essential to remember that failed medical management of AUB (including failed benefit of gonadal steroids) is a risk factor for malignancy and should be investigated, ideally with endometrial sampling and histopathologic analysis.

### Association of intrauterine device malposition with previous cesarean delivery and related uterine anatomical changes [^112Eh8hb]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We sought to determine the association between intrauterine device (IUD) malposition and previous cesarean delivery (CD) and related uterine anatomical changes.

Methods

A retrospective cohort of all persons with an IUD presenting for two- and three-dimensional pelvic ultrasonography over 2years, for any gynecologic indication, was compiled. IUD malposition was defined as IUD partially or completely positioned outside the endometrial cavity. Uterine position, uterine flexion, and cesarean scar defect (CSD) size were assessed. Patient characteristics and sonographic findings were compared between those with normally positioned and malpositioned IUD. Primary outcome was the rate of IUD malposition in persons with and without a history of CD. Logistic regression analysis was used to control for potential confounders.

Results

Two hundred ninety-six persons with an IUD had a pelvic ultrasound, 240 (81.1%) had a normally positioned IUD, and 56 (18.9%) had a malpositioned IUD. The most common location of IUD malposition was low uterine segment and cervix (67.9%). Malpositioned IUD was associated with referral for evaluation of pelvic pain (P = 0.001). Prior CD was significantly associated with a malpositioned IUD, after adjusting for confounders (aOR 3.50, 95% CI 1.31–9.35, P = 0.01). Among persons with prior CD, uterine retroflexion and a large CSD were independent risk factors for IUD malposition (aOR 4.1, 95% CI 1.1–15.9, P = 0.04 and aOR 5.4, 95% CI 1.4–20.9, P = 0.01, respectively).

Conclusions

Prior CD is associated with significantly increased risk of IUD malposition. Among persons with previous CD, those with a retroflexed uterus and a large CSD are more likely to have a malpositioned IUD.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^116XMMCw]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Management of the IUD when a Cu-IUD or an LNG-IUD user is found to be pregnant — general guidance: Evaluate for possible ectopic pregnancy, and advise that there is an increased risk for spontaneous abortion (including septic abortion that might be life threatening) and for preterm delivery if the IUD is left in place; removal of the IUD reduces these risks but might not decrease the risk to the baseline level of a pregnancy without an IUD. If the patient does not want to continue the pregnancy, counsel about options, and if the patient wants to continue the pregnancy, advise them to seek care promptly if they have heavy bleeding, cramping, pain, abnormal vaginal discharge, or fever.

Table 1
Baseline demographic factors and surgical outcomes of the embedded and control groups

In the multivariable logistic regression analysis (Table 2), risk factors independently associated with IUD embedment were prior IUD removal failure (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.29; 95% CI, 1.90–5.71) and V-shaped IUD (aOR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.33–3.16). Moreover, uterine volume was a protective factor; as the uterine volume increased by 1 cm³, the embedment risk decreased by 1% (aOR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.982–0.999).

Table 2
Multivariable logistic regression analysis for independent risk factors associated with IUD embedment

When comparing the two largest fibroids in the two groups, there were no statistically significant differences in the location, diameter, or type of fibroids (P > 0.05) between the embedded and control groups (Table 3). Among the 731 women, none experienced secondary IUD perforation or other complications, such as bladder or rectal injuries. Hysteroscopy and laparoscopy were performed simultaneously in one woman in the embedded group because the IUD was found to be embedded into a 6-cm submucosal fibroid upon hysteroscopy. A histopathological diagnosis was obtained for all 731 women; one woman was diagnosed with endometrial cancer and was started on appropriate treatment.

7 EVIDENCE GAPS

7.1 Abnormal uterine bleeding and female technology

In recent years, there has been an overall development of female technology designed to assist with women's health. Examples include software programs to track fertility or menstrual cycles and hardware devices such as skin‐worn sensors and intelligent technology menstrual cups. Frameworks are being developed to encourage these products to be inclusive. These products can potentially improve the characterization and diagnosis of causes of AUB; for example, ovulatory disorders and contributing factors. Recent advances in estimation of menstrual blood loss via digital applications may also help women understand their symptoms, encourage presentation to healthcare professionals, and help elucidate the true prevalence of AUB in the reproductive years.

7.2 Role of iron in menstrual physiology

The need to monitor AUB patients for ID or IDA is an important clinical consideration. It has been found that iron plays a crucial role in the repair of injured mucosal surfaces; however, physiologically, iron's role in endometrial repair and thus the menstrual cycle is yet to be determined.

### Risk factors for intrauterine device embedment in postmenopausal women: an analysis of 731 participants undergoing hysteroscopy [^111WBtNB]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

This was the first study to show that prior IUD removal failure must be considered as a risk factor for IUD embedment. Forty-three women (14.3%) in the embedded group and 22 (5.1%) in the control group reported previous IUD removal failure. Furthermore, five women (2 in the embedded group and 3 in the control group) had more than one episode of IUD removal failure in the clinic. Therefore, hysteroscopy is recommended for women who have experienced IUD removal failure instead of undergoing dilation and curettage.

We also found that V-shaped IUDs may be related to a greater risk of IUD embedment, even though the most frequently removed IUD in the study were ring shaped (75.4%). This may be indicative of the fact that V-shaped IUDs have been used since the 1980s and hence have a larger incidence in the population; thus, their intrinsic quality might contribute to the increased risk of embedment in the Chinese population. However, Gerkowicz et aland Merki-Feld et alfound that American women in the reproductive age group frequently had malpositioned ParaGard IUD.

2 STEP 1: ASSESS THE PRE‐TEST PROBABILITY OF PAS

Defining the pre‐test probability is a standard procedure in medical practice, which refers to the likelihood of a condition being present before a diagnostic test is performed. The greater the underlying risk of the condition, the higher the diagnostic accuracy most medical tests will have. The assessment of pre‐test probability is essential in reducing false‐positive diagnoses, especially as a recent study demonstrated that two or more imaging signs of PAS were present in the second trimester for 98% of low‐risk pregnancies with normal placentation. Previous damage to the uterus predisposes to developing PAS in subsequent pregnancies. However, the depth of the original myometrial injury determines the likely severity of PAS as well as the morbidity associated with it.

2.1 Superficial uterine cavity injury

Women who have sustained damage to the uterine cavity from curettage, radiation, endometritis, endometrial ablation, or endometrial resection, are at increased risk of some degree of abnormal adherence of the placenta to the superficial myometrium (placenta accreta). In such instances, the myometrial tissue deep to the area of abnormal attachment is often thick enough to provide adequate uterine contraction after placental separation. It should be noted that no imaging modality, neither ultrasound nor MRI, can rule out abnormal adherence because imaging signs may be very subtle or even absent. Therefore, if risk factors are present, the most important ultrasound measurement is the myometrial thickness under the placenta, as this will be the most important feature should the placenta not separate spontaneously. A myometrium of 5 mm or more is likely to be able to contract adequately after delivery to provide a significant "living ligature" or at least facilitate the performance of local hemostatic sutures to control uncontrolled bleeding due to ineffective uterine contraction (expert opinion).

Instances where women have a "sticky" placenta or one entrapped behind a closed cervix, which are managed with manual removal of placenta and uterotonics only, are not considered to be PAS. These should not be recorded or reported as PAS, but rather as a "retained placenta".

IUD Strings Are Not Visible and Cannot Be Safely Retrieved

If ultrasonography is available, consider performing or referring for ultrasound examination to determine the location of the IUD. If the IUD cannot be located, it might have been expelled or have perforated the uterine wall.
If ultrasonography is not possible or the IUD is determined by ultrasound to be inside the uterus, advise the patient to seek care promptly if they have heavy bleeding, cramping, pain, abnormal vaginal discharge, or fever.

Comments and Evidence Summary. Removing the IUD improves the pregnancy outcome if the IUD strings are visible or the device can be retrieved safely from the cervical canal. Risks for spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery, and infection are substantial if the IUD is left in place.

Theoretically, the fetus might be affected by hormonal exposure from an LNG-IUD. However, whether this exposure increases the risk for fetal abnormalities is unknown.

A systematic review identified nine studies suggesting that women who did not remove their IUDs during pregnancy were at greater risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes (e.g. spontaneous abortion, septic abortion, preterm delivery, and chorioamnionitis) compared with women who had their IUDs removed or who did not have an IUD. Cu-IUD removal decreased risks but not to the baseline risk for pregnancies without an IUD. One case series examined LNG-IUDs. When the IUDs were not removed, eight out of 10 pregnancies ended in spontaneous abortions (Level of evidence: II-2, fair, direct).

### The utility of pelvic ultrasounds in adolescents presenting to the emergency department with abnormal uterine bleeding [^111Deog8]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To analyze what factors influence a provider's decision to order a pelvic ultrasound (PUS) in the emergency department (ED) for adolescents with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), to determine if endometrial stripe (EMS) measurements are used in treatment decisions, and to evaluate if treatment outcomes differ based on EMS thicknesses.

Methods

Retrospective chart review of patients aged 11–19 presenting to the ED with AUB from 2006 to 2018. Those receiving a PUS were divided into three EMS groups: ≤ 5 mm, 6–9 mm, and ≥ 10 mm. Outcomes were evaluated in admitted patients by progress notes indicating resolution of bleeding. Cross-tab, χ², and logistic and linear regression analysis were performed.

Results

Of 258 adolescents meeting study criteria, 113 (43.8%) had a PUS. None had an abnormality. A PUS was more likely to be performed in patients with lower hemoglobin values (P < .003). Provider decision to order a PUS did not differ by age or bleeding duration (P > .1). Among those with a PUS, 67 (59%) received hormonal therapy (pill, progestin-only, IV estrogen). There were no significant differences in treatment choices based on EMS (P < .061) or, among the 44 admitted patients (17%), in the time it took bleeding to stop after initiating treatment (pill: P = 0.227, progestin-only: P = 0.211, IV estrogen: P = 0.229).

Conclusion

In adolescents with AUB in the ED, performing a PUS was more common in those with low hemoglobin. EMS thickness did not appear to affect treatment decisions or inpatient outcomes. Larger studies are needed to confirm the current findings and determine if PUS is needed in the evaluation of AUB.

### Abnormal uterine bleeding [^115B7EjJ]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding is a common presenting symptom in the family practice setting. In women of childbearing age, a methodical history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation may enable the physician to rule out causes such as pregnancy and pregnancy-related disorders, medications, iatrogenic causes, systemic conditions, and obvious genital tract pathology. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (anovulatory or ovulatory) is diagnosed by exclusion of these causes. In women of childbearing age who are at high risk for endometrial cancer, the initial evaluation includes endometrial biopsy; saline-infusion sonohysterography or diagnostic hysteroscopy is performed if initial studies are inconclusive or the bleeding continues. Women of childbearing age who are at low risk for endometrial cancer may be assessed initially by transvaginal ultrasonography. Postmenopausal women with abnormal uterine bleeding should be offered dilatation and curettage; if they are poor candidates for general anesthesia or decline dilatation and curettage, they may be offered transvaginal ultrasonography or saline-infusion sonohysterography with directed endometrial biopsy. Medical management of anovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding may include oral contraceptive pills or cyclic progestins. Menorrhagia is managed most effectively with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or the levonorgestrel intrauterine contraceptive device. Surgical management may include hysterectomy or less invasive, uterus-sparing procedures.

### Perforated and embedded intrauterine devices… [^11448f7Z]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

UTERINE perforation by an intrauterine contraceptive device can be complete or partial. In complete perforation, the ectopic IUD is in the peritoneal cavity, either lying free, often in the posterior cul-de-sac, or adherent to uterus, adnexa, or peritoneum, or frequently enmeshed in omentum. Complete perforation — type 3 — is usually diagnosed easily and the IUD is readily removed by laparoscopy, laparotomy, or colpotomy. In partial perforation, the IUD may impinge on the uterus in different areas and in varying degrees. It may be classified according to the compartments involved, considering the uterine cavity as compartment 1, the myometrium as compartment 2, and the peritoneal cavity as compartment 3. Thus, in type 1–2 partial perforation, the IUD is partially in the uterine cavity and partially in the myometrium; in type 2, in the myometrium only; in type 2–3, in the myometrium and peritoneal cavity; and in type 1-2-3, in the uterine cavity.

### The IUB, a newly invented IUD: a brief report [^114KefMb]. Contraception (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the initial safety and effectiveness of the intrauterine ball (IUB), a copper intrauterine device that, upon insertion in the uterus, takes a three-dimensional spherical form.

Study Design

Fifteen women were followed for 1 year, with follow-up visits at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.

Results

The physician reported that all devices were very easy to insert. One subject discontinued before the 6-month visit (at 119 days after insertion) for a reason not related to the device. There were no perforations, expulsions, malpositions or complications, or pregnancies.

Conclusion

No safety or efficacy concerns were raised.

Implications

Due to its form and deployment process the IUB is expected to ease insertion and reduce perforation, malposition and expulsion rates and may also reduce dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® first trimester vaginal bleeding: 2025 update [^11282eJ5]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Vaginal bleeding is a relatively common occurrence in the first trimester of pregnancy, but can be distressing for both patients and clinicians. Differential considerations include normal intrauterine pregnancy (IUP), a nonviable IUP, an ectopic pregnancy (EP), or much less commonly gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). Although the diagnosis of EP, nonviable IUP, and GTD is important, it is also crucial to avoid harming potentially normal pregnancies through early medical or surgical treatment. Fortunately, most diagnoses can be made using a combination of ultrasound (US), serum human chorionic gonadotropin levels, and physical examination. When a diagnosis is in question, serial examinations and close clinical evaluation is paramount. Occasionally, MRI of the pelvis without contrast may be helpful in problem-solving for challenging cases, where grayscale US is limited or when there is high concern for nontubal EP. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Obstetric care consensus no. 7: placenta accreta spectrum [^112EvbsP]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Placenta accreta spectrum — etiology and pathophysiology — The most favored hypothesis is that a defect of the endometrial–myometrial interface leads to a failure of normal decidualization in the area of a uterine scar, which allows abnormally deep placental anchoring villi with trophoblast infiltration. Several studies suggest that disruptions within the uterine cavity cause damage to the endometrial–myometrial interface, thereby affecting the development of scar tissue and increasing the likelihood of placenta accreta; however, this explanation fails to explain the rare occurrence of placenta accreta spectrum in nulliparous women without any previous uterine surgery or instrumentation.

Leiomyomas (uterine fibroids)

Leiomyomas are prevalent benign tumors comprising smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts while being rich in extracellular matrix. Their prevalence increases with age and has been reported to be 69% in white women and 83% in black women by the age of 50. Whereas the exact pathogenesis of a leiomyoma is unknown, it appears to be multifactorial with the involvement of genetics, gonadal steroid exposure, and environmental factors. Leiomyomas can manifest in various phenotypes that vary in size, number, and location. While most women have no symptoms related to their leiomyomas, others may present with a spectrum of symptoms. Consequently, decisions regarding expectant, medical, or procedural interventions depend on a combination of the desires of the individual and their leiomyoma phenotype. Collectively, these circumstances challenge investigators and clinicians to understand when and how a given leiomyoma phenotype is responsible for the experienced symptoms and what therapeutic options best fit the patient's goals, particularly those related to fertility.

The complex context created by this highly prevalent disorder led to the development of the FIGO classification system, which was designed primarily according to the location of the leiomyoma with respect to the endometrium and uterine serosa (Figure 3). Submucous leiomyomas include those in contact with the endometrium, as determined clinically by hysteroscopy or uterine imaging using ultrasound‐based techniques or MRI. While Types 0, 1, and 2 project into the endometrial cavity, Type 3 leiomyomas are those in contact with the endometrium without focal distortion of the endometrial cavity. Intramural leiomyomas are surrounded by myometrium and are deemed Type 4 leiomyomas. In contrast, those in contact with the uterine serosa (Types 5, 6, and 7) are categorized by the degree to which they project out of the uterus, with Type 7 being the pedunculated variety. Type 8 leiomyomas are those found in alternate locations, most commonly the cervix. Especially important for intrauterine surgery, such as hysteroscopic myomectomy, are the tumors that contact both the endometrium and the uterine serosa, which are categorized with two numbers reflecting, in order, the endometrial and serosal relationships (e.g. Types 2–5 or 3–6). It is critically important that clinicians do not attempt hysteroscopic myomectomy, as removal will result in peritoneal cavity entry, termination of the procedure, and the risk of damage to surrounding visceral and other structures including the bladder, bowel, ureters, and blood vessels.
