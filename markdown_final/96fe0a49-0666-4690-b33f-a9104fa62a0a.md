## Question

SOB THAT WAKES YOU UP

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about nocturnal shortness of breath that wakes you up, preserving the thinking process and self-verification language. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the symptom precisely and distinguishing nocturnal awakenings from other night-time respiratory complaints. Then, I should construct a prioritized differential diagnosis with pathophysiology and distinguishing features. Next, I will outline a focused history and examination strategy, followed by a tiered diagnostic workup. After that, I need to consider special populations and red flags, and finally synthesize a practical decision pathway and management implications, ensuring each step is supported by guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the symptom construct and its clinical significance. Nocturnal awakenings with shortness of breath can reflect paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea from heart failure, asthma-related nocturnal symptoms, sleep-disordered breathing such as obstructive or central sleep apnea, gastroesophageal reflux with laryngospasm, or less commonly pulmonary embolism, upper airway obstruction, or anxiety-related hyperventilation, so I need to ensure I characterize timing, triggers, relief with upright posture, and associated features like choking, snoring, or orthopnea to separate these entities [^111Nc4ry] [^115YkPkW] [^116tttP7] [^114RceQb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the most likely etiologies first. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea from heart failure typically awakens the patient from sleep with uncomfortable breathing relieved by sitting upright, often coexists with orthopnea and exertional dyspnea, and carries a positive likelihood ratio around 2.6 in ED dyspnea cohorts, which meaningfully increases pretest probability when present [^111Nc4ry] [^114Wjz9q]. Asthma frequently worsens at night or on waking, with variable symptoms and identifiable triggers, and GINA explicitly lists nocturnal or early-morning symptoms as typical of asthma, which helps distinguish it from COPD where nocturnal awakening is less common and symptoms are more fixed and progressive [^115YkPkW] [^115RoZma]. Obstructive sleep apnea presents with witnessed apneas, loud snoring, nocturnal choking or gasping, fragmented sleep, and daytime sleepiness, and untreated OSA increases cardiovascular risk, so I should actively screen for these features and pursue diagnostic sleep testing when suspected [^116tttP7] [^1118GU4W].

> Wait, let me verify the role of reflux-related laryngospasm because it is often underrecognized. Nocturnal laryngospasm can abruptly awaken patients with stridor, choking, and a sense of impending suffocation, often resolving within minutes; GERD-related nocturnal events can mimic asthma or anxiety, so I should ask about reflux symptoms, positional triggers, and whether episodes abate with upright posture or water sips, and consider that reflux can coexist with asthma and worsen nocturnal symptoms [^114RceQb] [^111QByKB]. I should also remember that in children, nocturnal breath-holding spells may reflect seizures, reflux-laryngospasm, or parasomnias, which requires a different diagnostic approach including video EEG and polysomnography when indicated [^113yxruu].

> I will now examine the initial bedside assessment elements that efficiently narrow the differential. Vital signs including oxygen saturation, a focused cardiopulmonary exam for S3, JVD, rales, wheeze, and signs of volume overload, and a quick screen for orthopnea and bendopnea can rapidly raise or lower suspicion for heart failure, while observing for obesity, crowded oropharynx, and neck circumference supports OSA risk stratification; a normal ECG modestly lowers the likelihood of cardiac disease but does not exclude it, so I should integrate pretest probability with exam findings [^112KCweP] [^114Wjz9q]. But wait, what if the lungs are clear and the heart exam is unrevealing? In that scenario, I should reconsider upper airway or sleep-related etiologies and escalate to targeted testing rather than anchoring on cardiac or pulmonary parenchymal disease prematurely [^116tttP7].

> Next, I should review first-line diagnostics that are high-yield and readily available. Chest radiography helps distinguish pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly from parenchymal disease, ECG can reveal ischemia, arrhythmia, or LV hypertrophy, and natriuretic peptides are most useful when low to exclude acute heart failure, with BNP less than 100 pg/mL providing a strong negative likelihood ratio; spirometry with bronchodilator response supports asthma when obstruction and reversibility are present, whereas fixed obstruction suggests COPD, and I should interpret BNP cautiously in the setting of COPD where baseline values may be higher [^114Wjz9q] [^116Eo8Xp]. I need to ensure I do not overinterpret a mildly elevated BNP in COPD without corroborative clinical or imaging evidence of heart failure, as specificity is limited in that context [^116Eo8Xp].

> Let me consider advanced testing guided by initial results and pretest probability. If heart failure remains likely, transthoracic echocardiography assesses systolic function, diastolic dysfunction, and valvular disease, and focused cardiac ultrasound in the ED can rapidly identify global LV dysfunction to guide acute management, though comprehensive echocardiography is needed for definitive valve or wall motion assessment [^113fHRVP]. If sleep-disordered breathing is suspected, home sleep apnea testing or in-lab polysomnography should be pursued, with guidelines emphasizing comprehensive sleep evaluation and follow-up to phenotype obstructive versus central apnea, especially relevant in heart failure where central sleep apnea is prevalent [^116tttP7] [^116BXWV8]. If asthma is suspected but the diagnosis is uncertain, I should confirm variable airflow limitation with spirometry, FeNO, or challenge testing, and if the patient is already on ICS, follow GINA's step-up-for-3-months-then-reassess approach before labeling as difficult-to-treat asthma [^111vLXZb] [^115YkPkW].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of point-of-care ultrasound beyond focused cardiac views. A structured thoracic ultrasound approach evaluating B-lines, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, and IVC dynamics can narrow the differential in undifferentiated dyspnea, and in patients with normal thoracic ultrasound, the added value of a chest radiograph may be minimal, which can expedite disposition when combined with clinical judgment [^117Y6jfL]. I should also remember that in COPD exacerbations presenting with dyspnea, integrating bedside ultrasound with natriuretic peptides can help differentiate concomitant heart failure, acknowledging that higher BNP thresholds are often needed in COPD [^116Eo8Xp].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and mimics. In children, nocturnal awakenings with respiratory distress require evaluation for asthma, OSA, seizures, and reflux-related laryngospasm, and diagnostic sleep studies should meet minimum continuous sleep duration criteria to avoid false negatives, particularly in younger children with dispersed REM [^111CUvKd] [^113yxruu]. In patients with COPD, morning-dominant symptoms are common, but nocturnal awakenings should still prompt screening for comorbid heart failure, OSA, and anxiety or GERD, as these are frequently underrecognized and alter management [^1172ipgU] [^117Kiicx]. Post-COVID patients may have persistent dyspnea with normal imaging and testing; in the absence of alternative explanations, supportive rehabilitation and longitudinal follow-up are reasonable while avoiding unnecessary invasive workups [^116nGfYK].

> Let me reconsider red flags that mandate urgent action. Hemoptysis, syncope, chest pain, new neurologic deficits, or severe hypoxemia should trigger expedited pathways for PE, ACS, or acute heart failure, and in suspected ANCA-associated vasculitis with dyspnea, I should urgently evaluate for alveolar hemorrhage even if hemoptysis is absent, given the potential for rapid deterioration [^111da6uC] [^116fTe6y]. I should double-check that my threshold for CT pulmonary angiography, high-sensitivity troponin, and echocardiography is appropriately low in these scenarios to avoid delays in life-saving therapy [^111da6uC].

> Next, I should review a practical decision pathway without oversimplifying. If orthopnea, PND, elevated JVP, rales, or an S3 are present, prioritize heart failure with chest radiograph, ECG, and natriuretic peptides, proceeding to echocardiography if positive or if clinical suspicion remains high despite normal peptides, because a low BNP strongly argues against acute HF in the ED setting [^114Wjz9q]. If nocturnal symptoms are accompanied by wheeze, cough, and trigger variability, prioritize asthma with spirometry and response to bronchodilator, and consider FeNO or challenge testing if baseline testing is nondiagnostic, using GINA's stepwise approach for patients already on controllers [^115YkPkW] [^111vLXZb]. If snoring, witnessed apneas, daytime sleepiness, or morning headaches predominate, prioritize OSA with sleep testing and concurrent screening for hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure, given guideline-endorsed links between OSA and cardiovascular disease [^116tttP7] [^116BXWV8]. If choking, stridor, or abrupt nocturnal awakenings suggest laryngospasm, evaluate GERD and consider laryngoscopy or empiric reflux therapy when appropriate, recognizing overlap with asthma and upper airway cough syndrome [^114RceQb] [^111QByKB].

> I should confirm management implications once the etiology is identified. For heart failure, initiate guideline-directed medical therapy, address volume status, and treat comorbid sleep-disordered breathing, as OSA and central sleep apnea are common and influence outcomes; in selected HF patients, formal sleep assessment is recommended to phenotype and tailor therapy [^116BXWV8]. For asthma, optimize controller therapy, review inhaler technique and adherence, and manage comorbid rhinitis, reflux, and obesity that perpetuate nocturnal symptoms, following GINA's stepwise treatment and reassessment strategy [^115YkPkW] [^111vLXZb]. For OSA, offer CPAP where indicated, counsel on weight loss and positional therapy, and coordinate cardiovascular risk reduction, with diagnostic testing embedded in comprehensive sleep evaluation and follow-up to ensure effective longitudinal care [^116tttP7] [^116BXWV8].

> Finally, I need to ensure the patient receives clear safety-netting instructions. Any new chest pain, worsening orthopnea, syncope, or severe nocturnal dyspnea should prompt urgent evaluation, and patients with intermediate to high cardiovascular risk who present with chest pain equivalents, including exertional or nocturnal dyspnea, should be directed to evidence-based diagnostic pathways for ACS risk stratification without delay [^111da6uC]. I should double-check that follow-up is arranged within an appropriate interval to review test results, treatment response, and adherence, adjusting the diagnostic trajectory if the initial hypothesis proves incorrect or if new red flags emerge [^111da6uC].

Waking up with shortness of breath (paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea) most often reflects **heart failure** [^114Wjz9q] or **obstructive sleep apnea** [^116tttP7], with asthma, COPD, pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, anxiety, and GERD as additional causes [^115YkPkW] [^1172ipgU] [^117QQ5K3] [^113qXGEN] [^114RceQb] [^116Eo8Xp]. Immediate evaluation should include **history, exam, ECG, chest X-ray, BNP/NT-proBNP, and pulse oximetry** [^114Wjz9q]; echocardiography, polysomnography, spirometry, or CT angiography are added based on suspicion [^113fHRVP] [^116tttP7] [^113qXGEN]. Red flags (chest pain, hemoptysis, syncope, severe hypoxemia) require **urgent care** [^111da6uC]; management targets the underlying cause, with diuretics and guideline-directed therapy for heart failure [^116Eo8Xp], CPAP for OSA [^notfound], and bronchodilators/ICS for asthma/COPD [^117MgdF1].

## Common medical conditions associated with waking up short of breath

Several **medical conditions** can cause individuals to wake up with shortness of breath:

- **Heart failure**: Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) is a classic symptom of heart failure, occurring due to fluid redistribution and pulmonary congestion when lying flat [^114Wjz9q].

- **Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)**: Repeated apneas cause hypoxemia and hypercapnia, triggering arousals with shortness of breath [^112N1hkQ].

- **Asthma**: Nocturnal asthma symptoms, including wheezing and shortness of breath, are common and often worsen at night [^115YkPkW].

- **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**: Nighttime symptoms, including breathlessness, are frequent in COPD patients [^1172ipgU].

- **Pulmonary edema**: Fluid accumulation in the lungs can cause sudden shortness of breath upon awakening [^notfound].

- **Pulmonary embolism**: Sudden shortness of breath at night may indicate a pulmonary embolism, a medical emergency [^117QQ5K3].

- **Anxiety and panic disorders**: Nocturnal panic attacks can cause sudden awakening with shortness of breath [^notfound].

- **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: Reflux-induced aspiration or laryngospasm can cause nocturnal breathlessness [^114RceQb].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A thorough **diagnostic evaluation** is essential to identify the underlying cause:

- **History and physical examination**: Detailed history of symptoms, comorbidities, and risk factors, followed by a focused physical examination [^111Z7ANP].

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: To assess for cardiac arrhythmias or ischemia [^114Wjz9q].

- **Chest X-ray**: To evaluate for pulmonary edema, cardiomegaly, or other pulmonary conditions [^114Wjz9q].

- **Echocardiography**: To assess cardiac function and detect heart failure or valvular disease [^113fHRVP].

- **Polysomnography (sleep study)**: To diagnose obstructive sleep apnea or other sleep-related breathing disorders [^116tttP7].

- **Pulmonary function tests (spirometry)**: To evaluate for asthma or COPD [^113qXGEN].

- **Blood tests**: BNP or NT-proBNP levels to assess for heart failure; arterial blood gases to evaluate oxygenation and ventilation status [^114Wjz9q].

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring immediate medical attention

Certain symptoms accompanying nocturnal shortness of breath indicate **urgent medical evaluation**:

- **Chest pain or pressure**: May indicate myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism [^114kpKVi].

- **Hemoptysis (coughing up blood)**: Suggests pulmonary embolism, pulmonary edema, or severe respiratory infection [^notfound].

- **Severe hypoxemia (low oxygen saturation)**: Indicates critical respiratory or cardiac compromise [^112bzwYo].

- **Syncope or loss of consciousness**: May indicate severe cardiac or pulmonary event [^notfound].

- **Rapidly worsening symptoms**: Suggests acute decompensation requiring immediate intervention [^112bzwYo].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Heart failure**: Diuretics, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, lifestyle modifications, and monitoring of fluid intake [^notfound].

- **Obstructive sleep apnea**: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, weight loss, positional therapy, and lifestyle changes [^notfound].

- **Asthma/COPD**: Inhaled bronchodilators, corticosteroids, smoking cessation, and pulmonary rehabilitation [^notfound].

- **Anxiety/panic disorders**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy, anxiolytic medications, and stress management techniques [^notfound].

- **GERD**: Proton pump inhibitors, dietary modifications, and elevation of the head of the bed [^notfound].

---

Waking up with shortness of breath is a **concerning symptom** with a broad differential — including cardiac, pulmonary, and psychological causes. Prompt, structured evaluation and targeted management are essential to address the underlying condition and reduce morbidity and mortality.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 73-year-old man who sought evaluation for 1 month of shortness of breath, bilateral lower-extremity edema, and weight gain of 14kg. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges. As the clinical course progresses, the differential is refined until a diagnosis is made.

Background

Dyspnea is a common and ambiguous complaint that results in 3.4 million emergency department (ED) visits annually. While learners may encounter lists of differential diagnoses to consider while in training, often these lists are not empirically based. We sought to establish an evidence-based differential diagnosis for dyspnea and to determine whether normal vital signs can rule out a life-threatening diagnosis.

Methods

We analyzed data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 2005 to 2014 for ED visits with a chief complaint of dyspnea and tallied the principal discharge diagnosis. We included 10,170 sampled ED visits by adults with a chief complaint of dyspnea, representing nearly 42 million visits nationally. We then calculated the most common principal discharge diagnoses by age group and the frequency of abnormal respiratory vital signs in cases with life-threatening diagnoses.

Results

The most represented age group was 45 to 64 years (31.6%). Most visits were discharged directly from the ED (57.5%), while 8.1% required admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). The most common diagnosis in patients aged 18 to 44 was acute asthma exacerbation (14.8%). Obstructive chronic bronchitis was the most common specified diagnosis in both patients ages 45 to 64 (11.1%) and patients ages 65 to 79 (12.4%), while congestive heart failure was the most common for patients ages 80 and over (15.9%). Respiratory vital signs were frequently normal in the 44.6% of visits that resulted in a potentially life-threatening diagnosis but corresponded to increased ICU utilization when abnormal.

Conclusions

For patients with dyspnea, the high utilization of ICUs highlights the importance of an accurate differential. The frequencies established here can be used as pretest probabilities in Bayesian analysis to improve the accuracy of differential diagnosis lists.

### Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction: prevalence, pathophysiology, patient impact, diagnosis and management [^117MkRSx]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Distinguishing EIB from asthma

A key consideration for physicians when a patient presents with symptoms of wheeze and shortness of breath triggered by exercise is whether a diagnosis of asthma with EIB or EIB alone is appropriate. The management of EIB in patients without asthma is very different from the management of patients who experience EIB in association with poorly controlled asthma. As such, it is crucial to avoid over-diagnosis of asthma and subsequent over- or under-treatment.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Guidelines outline several symptoms that increase or decrease the probability of a patient having asthma. Most notably, symptoms that often worsen at night or in the early morning, that vary over time and in intensity, and that are triggered by exercise, viral infections, irritants and allergens increase the probability of asthma. Conversely, exercise-induced dyspnoea with noisy inspiration decreases the probability of asthma. The guidelines also highlight the importance of determining if the patient's symptoms occur only during or after exercise, and if the patient has any other risk factors for exacerbations. If symptoms are solely related to exercise, and there is no additional risk of exacerbation, a diagnosis of EIB rather than asthma should be considered.

Differential diagnosis

In the absence of airway hyperresponsiveness to challenge, differential diagnoses must be considered, particularly in adolescent athletes. Consideration must be given to the following conditions: bronchial hyperresponsiveness (the occurrence of cough or phlegm after intense exercise); exercise-induced vocal cord dysfunction (symptoms disappear when exercise is stopped and there is no observed effect of pre-exercise inhaled bronchodilator); and exercise-induced arterial hypoxaemia (occurring typically in well-trained athletes with high maximum oxygen uptake).

A Joint Task Force for defining practice parameters for the management of EIB (2016) suggested physicians can also consider cardiopulmonary exercise testing to determine if symptoms are resulting from exercise-induced dyspnoea and hyperventilation, particularly in children and adolescents. Shortness of breath during exercise can also be associated with underlying conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or restrictive lung conditions (e.g. obesity). A history of shortness of breath alongside other systemic symptoms (e.g. pruritus, urticaria and hypotension) may rarely be indicative of exercise-induced anaphylaxis. Finally, if EIB has been ruled out, referral to a specialist should be considered for patients who present as breathless when exercising (with or without chest pain) and for whom heart disease or other conditions are suspected.

### BRIPPED scan for evaluation of ED patients with shortness of breath [^115x6bJK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The BRIPPED scan is an ultrasound evaluation of pulmonary B-lines, right ventricle size, inferior vena cava collapsibility, pleural and pericardial effusion, pneumothorax, left ventricle ejection fraction, and lower extremity deep venous thrombosis. The primary goal was to evaluate the effect of the BRIPPED scan on the physician's list of differential diagnoses for patients presenting with shortness of breath.

Methods

This prospective randomized control trial was performed on patients presenting to the emergency department with shortness of breath. Primary data analysis was performed using an ordinal quasi-symmetry model to compare the magnitude of change in the differential diagnoses between 2 groups. Secondary outcome measures included changes in physician orders or interventions, time to disposition, time to perform the BRIPPED scan, and the interrater reliability of the interpretation of the scan.

Results

A total of 104 patients and 24 physicians were enrolled in this study. Fifty-two patients were randomly assigned to each cohort. Among the BRIPPED cohort, there was significant movement of likelihood for several etiologies of shortness of breath on the physician differential. There was no significance in the change of differential diagnosis between the BRIPPED and control cohorts. The average (SD) time to perform the scan was 5.7 (1.3) minutes (95% confidence interval, 5.4–6 minutes).

Conclusion

The BRIPPED scan is a rapid ultrasound evaluation of shortness of breath in the emergency department. BRIPPED influenced physician differential diagnoses to the same degree as laboratory and radiographic testing. BRIPPED did not alter the final diagnosis in this patient population.

Diagnosing asthma in children aged 5 years and under

It can be challenging to make the diagnosis of asthma in some children aged ≤ 5 years. Recurrent wheezing is very common in this age group, including in children without asthma, typically with viral upper respiratory tract infections. Routine assessment of airflow limitation or bronchodilator responsiveness in this age group is difficult and is not practical in primary care.

Asthma diagnosis in children aged ≤ 5 years can be based on symptom patterns, the presence of risk factors, therapeutic response to controller treatment, and exclusion of alternative diagnoses

A diagnosis of asthma in young children with a history of wheezing is more likely if they have wheezing or coughing that occurs with exercise, laughing or crying, or in the absence of an apparent respiratory infection, a history of other allergic disease (eczema, food allergy, or allergic rhinitis), atopy or asthma in first-degree relatives, clinical improvement during 2–3 months of controller treatment, and worsening after cessation.

The following questions can be used to elicit features suggestive of asthma in young children and features that help support the diagnosis:
Does your child have wheezing? Wheezing is a high-pitched noise that comes from the chest and not the throat. Use of a video questionnaire, or asking a parent to record an episode on a smartphone if available can help to confirm the presence of wheeze and differentiate from upper airway abnormalities.
Does your child wake up at night because of coughing, wheezing, or difficult breathing, heavy breathing, or breathlessness?
Does your child have to stop running, or play less hard, because of coughing, wheezing or difficult breathing, heavy breathing, or shortness of breath?
Does your child cough, wheeze or get difficult breathing, heavy breathing, or shortness of breath when laughing, crying, playing with animals, or when exposed to strong smells or smoke?
Has your child ever had eczema, or been diagnosed with allergy to foods?
Has anyone in your close family had asthma, hay fever, food allergy, eczema, or any other disease with breathing problems?

In preschool children with wheeze, phenotypes have been proposed based on short-term symptom patternsor on symptom pattern trends over time –, but these have not proved to be clinically useful or accurate in predicting asthma in later childhood.

Asthma — questions to elicit features suggestive of asthma: Ask whether the child has wheezing, noting that wheezing is a high-pitched noise which comes from the chest and not the throat; whether the child wakes at night because of coughing, wheezing, or difficult breathing, heavy breathing, or breathlessness; whether the child has to stop running or play less hard because of coughing, wheezing or difficult breathing, heavy breathing, or shortness of breath; and whether coughing, wheezing or difficult breathing, heavy breathing, or shortness of breath occurs when laughing, crying, playing with animals, or when exposed to strong smells or smoke. Additional prompts include whether the child has ever had eczema or been diagnosed with food allergy, and whether anyone in the family has had asthma, hay fever, food allergy, eczema, or any other disease with breathing problems.

### Respiratory emergencies in HIV-infected persons [^115hVZfi]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Respiratory complaints are a common reason for patients with HIV infection to present to an emergency department (ED). "HIV and shortness of breath" is one of the most frequent chief complaints on ED triage sheets, and the differential diagnosis is broad. Pulmonary etiologies include infectious and noninfectious causes that are related and unrelated to underlying HIV infection and range from the minor to the life threatening. This article focuses on respiratory emergencies among HIV-infected patients and discusses their typical presentation and diagnostic evaluation as well as therapeutic interventions that should be initiated in an ED.

### 2021 AHA / ACC / ASE / CHEST / SAEM / SCCT / SCMR guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111da6uC]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain evaluation and diagnosis — top take-home messages include that pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, as well as shortness of breath and fatigue should all be considered anginal equivalents. High-sensitivity cardiac troponins are the preferred standard for establishing a biomarker diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, allowing for more accurate detection and exclusion of myocardial injury. Patients with acute chest pain or chest pain equivalent symptoms should seek medical care immediately by calling 9–1–1, and the evaluation of all patients should focus on the early identification or exclusion of life-threatening causes. Clinically stable patients presenting with chest pain should be included in decision-making; information about risk of adverse events, radiation exposure, costs, and alternative options should be provided to facilitate the discussion. For patients with acute or stable chest pain determined to be low risk, urgent diagnostic testing for suspected coronary artery disease is not needed. Clinical decision pathways for chest pain in the emergency department and outpatient settings should be used routinely. Chest pain is the dominant and most frequent symptom for both men and women ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, and women may be more likely to present with accompanying symptoms such as nausea and shortness of breath. Patients with acute or stable chest pain who are at intermediate risk or intermediate to high pre-test risk of obstructive coronary artery disease, respectively, will benefit the most from cardiac imaging and testing. "Noncardiac" should be used if heart disease is not suspected, and "Atypical" is a misleading descriptor of chest pain, and its use is discouraged. For patients presenting with acute or stable chest pain, risk for coronary artery disease and adverse events should be estimated using evidence-based diagnostic protocols.

### Breathing SPACE-a practical approach to the breathless patient [^112KCweP]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Cardiac causes

A cardiac cause of breathlessness is suggested by a history of hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia or ischaemic heart disease, and by physical findings such as lung crepitations, the presence of oedema, tachycardia, cardiac murmurs, or atrial fibrillation. A normal electrocardiogram (ECG) reduces the likelihood of cardiac disease but consider investigations such as blood natriuretic peptide (BNP) and echocardiography if there is clinical suspicion.

Lung disease is also common in people with heart disease, so the possibility of a dual diagnosis should be considered. For example, 15–24% of people with COPD also have ischaemic heart diseaseand one-third of people with atrial fibrillation have a diagnosis of asthma or COPD. Evidence suggests systematic undertreatment of patients with COPD following myocardial infarction; they are less likely to receive beta blockers, although these can be safely administered.

Hyperinflation caused by airflow obstruction restricts cardiac outputand the "cardiac" aspects of lung diagnoses should be considered. In patients with COPD, low oxygen saturations, especially if they are disproportionate to the degree of airflow obstruction, may represent pulmonary hypertension that can lead to right-sided heart failure. Consider sleep-disordered breathing with nocturnal hypoxia in individuals with a high body mass index (BMI), oedema, or a history of type II respiratory failure. Ask about daytime somnolence, morning headaches, and confusion.

### An uncommon cause of dyspnea in the emergency department [^114kpKVi]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Chest pain and shortness of breath are chief complaints frequently evaluated in the emergency department. ACS, pulmonary embolism, and disorders involving the lung parenchyma are some of the disease processes commonly screened for. Occasionally, patients presenting with histories and clinical exams consistent with these common illnesses may end up having more rare pathology. We present the case of a young patient who presented with chest pain and dyspnea with ECG changes and history concerning for pulmonary embolism who was ultimately diagnosed with idiopathic primary pulmonary hypertension. The importance of a prompt diagnosis of this condition along with emergency department management of complications related to the disease is discussed in this report.

### A 56-year-old, otherwise healthy woman presenting with light-headedness and progressive shortness of breath [^1116i96a]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

A 56-year-old white woman was referred to the pulmonary clinic for evaluation of unexplained shortness of breath. She enjoyed good health until 3 months prior to this visit when she reported experiencing recurrent episodes of shortness of breath and oppressive retrosternal chest discomfort with radiation to the neck. Episodes lasting 5 to 10 min often occurred at rest and were inconsistently related to physical activity. These symptoms became progressively worse and were often associated with light-headedness and presyncope. Her past medical history was uneventful apart from a prior diagnosis of breast cysts and suspected prolactinoma. Her symptoms escalated to such a level that she was forced to seek urgent medical attention at our institutional ED on two separate occasions in the preceding weeks. These visits precipitated a number of investigations and, eventually, a referral to the pulmonary clinic.

### Mechanical circulatory assist devices: a primer for critical care and emergency physicians [^115fS9MX]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Symptom approach

The following section describes a symptom-oriented approach for critical care providers to use in determining differential diagnoses and treating patients with LVADs.

Shortness of breath

Shortness of breath (dyspnea or tachypnea) in an LVAD patient can be caused by the following three pathophysiologic conditions: reduced oxygen delivery, increased oxygen consumption, and inadequate carbon dioxide exchange. Causes of reduced oxygen delivery include hypoxic respiratory failure, acute anemia, and reduced cardiac output (CO). Increased oxygen consumption may be caused by adrenergic stress or vasodilation due to sepsis, anaphylaxis, acidosis, adrenal insufficiency, or liver dysfunction. Inadequate carbon dioxide exchange may be due to neurologic causes; neuromuscular issues; extrinsic causes, such as ascites; ileus; or reduced blood flow through pulmonary capillaries, such as in shock.

Patients who have shortness of breath should have their arterial blood gas and lactate levels measured, should be monitored with continuous pulse oximetry (although this may not be accurate because of continuous flow), and have a chest radiograph and, if necessary, a computed tomography (CT) scan. Supplemental oxygen (i.e. nasal cannula, face mask, high-flow oxygen, noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation, or mechanical ventilation) should be used according to the usual standard of care. When acute hypoxic respiratory failure is the cause of shortness of breath, it may be helpful to assess the effect of an increased fraction of inspired oxygen (F 2), which will improve dead space versus increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), which will improve a pulmonary shunt. If neither increased F 2 nor PEEP improves oxygenation, a cardiac shunt, such as an open patent foramen ovale, may be the cause and should be considered in the diagnosis of the shortness of breath.

### Integrating point-of-care ultrasound in the ED evaluation of patients presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath [^117Y6jfL]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The differential diagnoses of patients presenting with chest pain (CP) and shortness of breath (SOB) are broad and non-specific. We aimed to 1) determine how use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) impacted emergency physicians' differential diagnosis, and 2) evaluate the accuracy of POCUS when compared to chest radiograph (CXR) and composite final diagnosis.

Methods

We conducted a prospective observational study in a convenience sample of patients presenting with CP and SOB to the Emergency Department (ED). Treating physicians selected possible diagnoses from a pre-indexed list of possible diagnoses of causes of CP and SOB. The final composite diagnosis from a chart review was determined as the reference standard for the diagnosis. The primary analysis involved calculations of sensitivity and specificity for POCUS identifiable diagnoses in detecting cause of CP and SOB. Additional comparative accuracy analysis with CXRs were conducted.

Results

128 patients with a mean age of 64 ± 17 years were included in the study. Using a reference standard of composite final diagnoses, POCUS had equal or higher specificity to CXR for all indications for which it was used, except for pneumonia. POCUS correctly identified all patients with pneumothorax, pleural effusion and pericardial effusion. In patients with a normal thoracic ultrasound, CXR never provided any actionable clinical information. Adding POCUS to the initial evaluation causes a significant narrowing of the differential diagnoses in which the median differential diagnosis from 5 (IQR 3–6) to 3 (IQR 2–4) p < 0.001.

Conclusion

In evaluation of patients with CP and SOB, POCUS is a highly feasible diagnostic test which can assist in narrowing down the differential diagnoses. In patients with a normal thoracic ultrasound, the added value of a CXR may be minimal.

Case Presentation

A 59-year-old woman presented to the ED with syncope. She had progressive shortness of breath with minimal activity and precordial resting chest pain for 1 month prior to presentation. She had a medical history of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, severe OSA well controlled with CPAP of 11 cm H 2 O, and a history of DVT and pulmonary embolism, diagnosed 10 years ago for which she was maintained on warfarin. The patient also had chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase; she had initially been treated with imatinib but was later switched to dasatinib about 4.5 years prior to presentation. The patient had achieved major molecular remission with dasatinib 140 mg daily. Her family history was noncontributory and specifically negative for pulmonary hypertension and heart failure. She had a history of smoking (50 pack years) but had quit 23 years ago.

### Causes and evaluation of chronic dyspnea [^113qXGEN]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic dyspnea is shortness of breath that lasts more than one month. The perception of dyspnea varies based on behavioral and physiologic responses. Dyspnea that is greater than expected with the degree of exertion is a symptom of disease. Most cases of dyspnea result from asthma, heart failure and myocardial ischemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, or psychogenic disorders. The etiology of dyspnea is multifactorial in about one-third of patients. The clinical presentation alone is adequate to make a diagnosis in 66 percent of patients with dyspnea. Patients' descriptions of the sensation of dyspnea may be helpful, but associated symptoms and risk factors, such as smoking, chemical exposures, and medication use, should also be considered. Examination findings (e.g., jugular venous distention, decreased breath sounds or wheezing, pleural rub, clubbing) may be helpful in making the diagnosis. Initial testing in patients with chronic dyspnea includes chest radiography, electrocardiography, spirometry, complete blood count, and basic metabolic panel. Measurement of brain natriuretic peptide levels may help exclude heart failure, and D-dimer testing may help rule out pulmonary emboli. Pulmonary function studies can be used to identify emphysema and interstitial lung diseases. Computed tomography of the chest is the most appropriate imaging study for diagnosing suspected pulmonary causes of chronic dyspnea. To diagnose pulmonary arterial hypertension or certain interstitial lung diseases, right heart catheterization or bronchoscopy may be needed.

### Left atrial myxoma: an unusual cause of postpartum tachycardia and shortness of breath [^112W8B7V]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Primary cardiac tumours are exceedingly rare in clinical practice and a myxoma is certainly not the first suspected diagnosis on a list of differentials in a patient presenting with breathlessness and tachycardia. Naturally, a structured work-up to rule out much more common conditions will take place. Nonetheless, an index of clinical suspicion is required especially when a clear-cut diagnosis is not forthcoming. We describe a case of a postpartum woman who presented with shortness of breath and palpitations, and was eventually diagnosed with a left atrial tumour. She underwent a successful surgical excision of the mass which was found to be a myxoma on histological examination. We review and present an up-to-date literature review on epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis and treatment options for cardiac myxomas.

Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2021). High credibility.

ACC/AHA heart failure patient assessment — current symptoms and signs (clinical symptoms) defines standardized data elements and operational definitions for patient-reported symptoms: dyspnea at rest (patient "describes frequent uncomfortable awareness of breathing while resting in a sitting position"), dyspnea on exertion ("uncomfortable awareness of breathing while exerting him/herself") with the activity threshold specified ("Indicate degree of activity required to elicit dyspnea symp- tom") using options such as "Difficulty breathing while recumbent", "Running or other sport (specify sport)", "Walking up an incline (specify distance)", "Walking on a flat surface (specify distance)", "Stopping to rest while dressing", "Standing (specify length of time)", or "Other activity (eg, shopping or housework; specify)". Orthopnea is "Difficulty breathing while recumbent" with supine discomfort usually requiring "positioning with 2–3 pillows or in a chair or recliner to maintain comfortable breathing during sleep", and "Recurrent supine cough with other known cause may be an orthopnea equivalent". Bendopnea is "shortness of breath while bending over". Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea is "awakening suddenly from sleep with uncomfortable awareness of breathing, or with general distress relieved by the upright position", with "Any report of this symptom lasting > 5 min is considered positive". Weight change records patient-reported gain or loss ("weight gain (+ value) or loss (− value)") with units "Numeric, kg". Fatigue is "Unusual tiredness and inability to perform usual activities".

### ANCA associated vasculitis [^116fTe6y]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

How is it diagnosed?

Clinical

The diagnosis of AAV is clinical, supported by serological and histological data. There are many possible presenting symptoms — none more important than another for making the diagnosis — and no isolated discriminating symptoms of AAV. Rather, the key to diagnosis is prompt recognition of an inflammatory disease pattern when multiple symptoms emerge, especially if more than one organ system is implicated or in combination with chronic systemic symptoms. Therefore, when two or more of these symptoms develop concurrently, the index of suspicion should be high(box 1).

Two clinical scenarios pose particular diagnostic difficulty. The first is alveolar haemorrhage: it can be hard to recognise and is devastating if missed. Alveolar haemorrhage may present with haemoptysis, but this symptom is absent in up to half of cases. Some patients with extensive airspace bleeding will report only of shortness of breath or cough and have a near normal chest examination. Patients with haemoptysis plus other features of AAV warrant same day hospital assessment to rule out pulmonary haemorrhage without further primary care investigations if these would delay referral (box 2). All other patients with suspected vasculitis and dyspnoea or cough should have a full blood count; if there is a recent drop in haemoglobin (or a low haemoglobin with no historic comparator) then we advise urgently discussing the possibility of pulmonary haemorrhage with a specialty service.

### Identifying cases of undiagnosed, clinically significant COPD in primary care: qualitative insight from patients in the target population [^1156kQmX]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Results

Eight focus groups (n = 44) and six one-on-one telephone interviews (n = 6) were conducted. Sample characteristics are summarised in Tables 2 and 3. For the COPD patients, mean post-bronchodilator FEV 1 was 68% predicted (s.d. = 10) (mean FEV 1 = 2.2 l (s.d. = 0.8)), and time since diagnosis averaged three months.

Spirometric values for three cases in the non-COPD groups suggested possible airway obstruction; these participants were referred to their physician for follow-up. In two cases, spirometry was performed after their focus groups. The third case was uncovered after screening and enrolment, and the decision was made to have him participate in the originally assigned no-COPD group so that he could share his experiences in an environment of people without COPD experience. Data from these three cases were also examined separately, comparing their responses with others.

Six major themes were identified in the data: (1) exposure to smoke and other pollutants (e.g. chemicals, paint, gasoline), either through a friend/relative, work environment or living condition; (2) personal and family history of respiratory health conditions, such as emphysema, pneumonia, frequent colds and sinus infections; (3) recent history of respiratory events, including factors that may trigger an event (perfumes, cigarette smoke, exertion) and recent clinic visits or hospitalisations owing to respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath, coughing and chest tightness that continued to worsen; (4) symptoms, including respiratory (e.g. shortness of breath with and without exertion, sputum and phlegm production, wheezing, chest tightness and congestion) and nonrespiratory (e.g. feeling tired after slight exertion, low energy, sleeping problems such as waking up at night feeling short of breath); (5) impact of breathing-related problems on daily life (e.g. slowing down or stopping owing to breathlessness, unable to complete daily chores, unable to keep up with others); and (6) the attribution of symptoms or experiences (e.g. breathless, being tired or slowing down attributed to age or weight; cough attributed to smoking or smoke exposure).

### A case of plateau heart disease misdiagnosed as chronic pulmonary heart disease [^113SWv2j]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis and differential diagnosis

Diagnosis

Plateau heart disease

Plateau pulmonary hypertension

Cardiac function class II

Type I Respiratory Failure

Hyperuricemia

Hypertension

Diagnostic principles: The patient is a middle-aged man and has a chronic course of the disease. The condition is recurrent with main symptoms of chest tightness and shortness of breath that become worse after activity. Cardiac ultrasound suggests moderate pulmonary hypertension. Chest CT suggests no apparent emphysema. Pulmonary angiography also suggests no abnormalities. Therefore, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchial asthma, pulmonary embolism and sleep apnoea hypoventilation syndrome could be excluded. High altitude related hypertension is confirmed because the patient has worked at high altitude (3000 m) for 10 years and lived at middle and high altitude (2500 m) for a long time.

Differential diagnosis

Plateau heart disease should be differentiated from plateau chronic pulmonary heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, and plateau congenital heart disease.

Treatment

Oxygen therapy (low-flow oxygen,2 l/min) and intermittent diuresis (spironolactone 20 m/day and furosemide 20 mg/day) were prescribed to reduce cardiac afterload, and alisentan (5 mg/day) was prescribed to reduce pulmonary arterial pressure after admission.

Treatment outcomes and follow-up

After treatment, the symptoms of chest tightness and shortness of breath were relieved. The patient was advised to take oral diuretics intermittently for a long period and oral anolisentan regularly, and followed up to monitor heart, liver and kidney function and blood pressure.

### Assessment of the frequency and variety of persistent symptoms among patients with COVID-19: a systematic review [^116nGfYK]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the frequency and variety of persistent symptoms after COVID-19 infection?

Findings

In this systematic review of 45 studies including 9751 participants with COVID-19, the median proportion of individuals who experienced at least 1 persistent symptom was 73%; symptoms occurring most frequently included shortness of breath or dyspnea, fatigue or exhaustion, and sleep disorders or insomnia. However, the studies were highly heterogeneous and needed longer follow-up and more standardized designs.

Meaning

This systematic review found that COVID-19 symptoms commonly persisted beyond the acute phase of infection, with implications for health-associated functioning and quality of life; however, methodological improvements are needed to reliably quantify these risks.

### The challenge of objective confirmation of asthma diagnosis in primary care [^114JhUon]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Case Presentation

A 48-year-old woman with no smoking history reported cough and feeling short of breath with exertion beginning several months before her clinic visit. It was not clear whether she experienced any episodes of wheezing or chest tightness in association with her shortness of breath. She also reported longstanding nasal congestion and throat irritation, which are symptoms consistent with postnasal drip syndrome. She did not complain of chest pain or respiratory symptoms associated with nocturnal or early-morning awakening.

Her past medical history included eczema and a single episode of generalised hives. She reported sensitivities to trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole as well as to metronidazole. Skin prick testing revealed positive responses to house dust mites. There was no family history of atopy or asthma. She did not report a history of cardiovascular illness. On physical examination, the blood pressure was 130/90 bilaterally, heart rate was 76 beats/min and regular, with a respiratory rate of 10 breaths/min. Her body mass index was 32 kg/m 2. Air entry was equal bilaterally with no audible wheeze. There was mild nasal mucosal oedema and erythema without evidence of nasal polyps. Simple spirometry was carried out in the clinic for further assessment according to the American Thoracic Society Criteria. A chest X-ray and 12-lead electrocardiogram obtained at the initial visit were both normal.

### Rigid bronchoscopy and Y-stent for severe central malignant airway obstruction as a bridge to surgery requiring general anaesthesia [^113qgpyA]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Our patient was found to have an anterior mediastinal mass causing airway obstruction, resulting in her ongoing symptoms of shortness of breath and cough. Anterior mediastinal mass causes can be summarised in 4 Ts: Thymoma, Teratoma, Thyroid and Terrible lymphoma. The most common anterior mediastinal mass in females between the age of 10–39 is lymphoma. For the same age group in males, there is no dominant tumour type. Thymomas do happen in patients of all groups, with a peak incidence between 40–60 years old.

Anterior mediastinal mass can be found incidentally or can cause symptoms either related to mass effect or systemic symptoms such as fevers or night sweats. Our patient lacked systemic symptoms. With the degree of airway narrowing, the decision was made to proceed with a surgical biopsy as soon as possible to establish a diagnosis and start appropriate treatment. At that point, lymphoma was highly concerning, given her age and gender.

A diagnosis of lymphoma requires a biopsy for flow cytometry. Our patient did undergo a surgical biopsy in a timely fashion, helping in establishing a diagnosis and starting treatment right away. For diagnosis and sufficient tissue acquisition, ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy can serve as an alternative to surgical biopsy. However, a surgical biopsy is the gold standard as it is most likely to yield sufficient tissue for delineation of lymph node architecture, which oncology will find useful for deciding on specific lymphoma treatment.

### My child cannot breathe while sleeping: a report of three cases and review [^114RceQb]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Here we described 3 cases of childhood nocturnal breath-holding episodes, each related to a different diagnosis. A major conclusion of this report is that the differential diagnosis for paroxysmal breath-holding spells during sleep should consider nocturnal seizures and sleep disorders, such as parasomnia, sleep-related laryngospasm associated with GERD, and obstructive sleep apnea.

Insufficient or lack of sleep is a common trigger factor for developing seizures and epileptiform discharges on EEG. Children with epilepsy commonly complain of sleep disturbances, including nighttime awakening, particularly when seizures are poorly controlled. Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy and benign focal childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes are a few more common epileptic syndromes that present with nocturnal seizures.

Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy is characterized by various motor behaviors during sleep, including pedaling movement of the limbs, dystonic posturing, and tremors after sudden arousal. Because the interictal EEGs are usually normal in cases with nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, the differentiation of this disorder from partial arousal parasomnias or sleep-related movement disorders may be difficult when the nocturnal symptoms are nonspecific.

Benign focal childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes is characterized by partial seizures with sensorimotor symptoms of the face and oropharynx, hemiconvulsions, and tonic-clonic seizures during NREM sleep. Seizures usually occur on a nightly basis during sleep or upon awakening.

When nocturnal seizures are eliminated as a diagnostic possibility, the suggested differential diagnosis includes sleep-related choking syndrome or laryngospasm, which can be associated with GER during sleep. Although GER commonly occurs in infants and resolves with age, the persistence of nocturnal GERD is a known cause of sleep disturbances in children. Sleep-related choking syndrome or laryngospasm has been described in the diagnostic and coding manual of the American Sleep Disorder Association as a dramatic attack that produces breathing difficulties, awakening, stridor, apnea, fear, and agitation that typically resolves within 1–3 min. Reflux-induced apnea affects approximately 1% of infants and is related to airway closure or laryngospasm. Recently, GER studies have revealed that weak acid reflux during the nighttime occurs more frequently than was previously considered and may trigger nocturnal episodes of laryngospasm. The extreme reported cases of laryngospasm related to GERD include Sandifer syndrome, sleep-related laryngospasm, refractory asthma, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Sandifer syndrome is often misdiagnosed as epilepsy and is characterized by the head rotation and tonic posture. Manifestations of this syndrome typically occur in the postprandial period.

### Niacin (niaspan) [^114BPRsf]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

If you wake up at night because of flushing, get up slowly, especially if you:

feel dizzy or faint
take blood pressure medicines

To lower your chance of flushing:

Ask your doctor if you can take aspirin to help lower the flushing side effect from NIASPAN. You can take aspirin (up to the recommended dose of 325 mg) about 30 minutes before you take NIASPAN to help lower the flushing side effect.
Do not drink hot beverages (including coffee), alcohol, or eat spicy foods around the time you take NIASPAN.
Take NIASPAN with a low-fat snack to lessen upset stomach.

People with high cholesterol and heart disease are at risk for a heart attack. Symptoms of a heart attack may be different from a flushing reaction from NIASPAN. The following may be symptoms of a heart attack due to heart disease and not a flushing reaction:

chest pain
pain in other areas of your upper body such as one or both arms, back, neck, jaw or stomach
shortness of breath
sweating
nausea
lightheadedness

The chest pain you have with a heart attack may feel like uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness or pain that lasts more than a few minutes, or that goes away and comes back. Heart attacks may be sudden and intense, but often start slowly, with mild pain or discomfort.

### Magnesium: an overlooked electrolyte [^112tZQmt]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hypermagnesemia is rare and usually iatrogenic. Due to decreased renal function, older patients are generally more susceptible to hypermagnesemia than are younger patients. Because it is not one of the commonly assessed electrolytes in the blood work panel of patients, high levels are usually missed.

Case Report

An elderly gentleman with history of leukemia presented with complaints of shortness of breath and extreme weakness while walking. He was diagnosed with severe hypermagnesemia, but unfortunately succumbed to cardiorespiratory arrest. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Thorough history taking is crucial in evaluating weakness in elderly patients because the differential diagnosis is vast. Prompt consultation for emergent dialysis is critical to avoiding unfavorable outcomes due to electrolyte abnormalities.

### Cavitary lung lesions caused byin a patient with myelofibrosis on ruxolitinib [^116Zxpu6]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Patient's perspective

The fungal infection I have been experiencing has made a difference in my health, initially causing many symptoms that truly affected me, chills, loss of appetite, shortness of breath, coughing, night sweats, loss of energy. Once I was diagnosed and doctors found medication, I gradually improved. Thanks so much for the care I received.

Learning points

In immunocompromised patients presenting with nodular or cavitary lesions, clinicians should consider Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) in their differential diagnosis.
Parathyroid hormone-independent hypercalcaemia should prompt clinicians to consider granulomatous PJP in immunocompromised patients.
If initial diagnostics fail to confirm suspected granulomatous PJP, clinicians should weigh repeating less-invasive biopsy techniques against proceeding to potentially higher-yield thoracoscopic biopsies, considering the urgency for a definitive diagnosis.
The optimal duration of treatment for PJP infections causing necrotising granulomas warrants further investigation, with factors such as degree of immunosuppression and extent of infection potentially influencing the necessity for prolonged therapy.

### British thoracic society guideline for diagnosing and monitoring paediatric sleep-disordered breathing [^111CUvKd]. Thorax (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for obstructive sleep apnea, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (pulse oximetry and cardiorespiratory sleep studies, technical considerations), BTS 2023 guidelines recommend to obtain sleep studies (pulse oximetry or cardiorespiratory sleep studies) with 4–6 hours of continuous sleep duration for diagnosing moderate-to-severe sleep-disordered breathing. Define sleep duration as continuous to allow adequate opportunity for all sleep stages to occur. Do not combine short episodes of sleep interspersed with wake to create 4–6 hours of sleep recording, as it may miss parts of the sleep cycle, including in < 2 years old pediatric patients in whom REM cycles are more evenly dispersed through the night. Consider allowing a period of > 6 hours if the patient is > 2 years old (when REM sleep is greater in the latter half of the night) or if a mild disease is to be excluded.

History should assess time of onset of symptoms; associated symptoms and triggers for dyspnea (e.g., exertion, exercise, lying flat); history of asthma or other breathing disorders; choking or other evidence of upper airway obstruction; history of trauma; prior similar episodes and what has helped in the past, including home interventions; and severity of shortness of breath or sensation of dyspnea. Physical examination should assess for abnormal respiratory pattern, rate and/or effort; use of accessory muscles; ability to speak words or sentences; quality of air exchange including depth of respiration and equality of breath sounds; and abnormal breath sounds such as wheezing, rhonchi, rales, or stridor.

### Changes in symptoms of asthma and rhinitis by sensitization status over ten years in a cohort of young Chilean adults [^113uFBvd]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Symptoms of asthma severity were very infrequent and therefore excluded from our analyses. This may happen because of the limited health care resources available in a semi-rural area. This was one of the reasons why we focused analysis in the question 'waking up at night with shortness of breath'. This symptom has been used with other questions to estimate asthma severity, but we found no evidence of association between waking with shortness of breath and between wheeze, and sensitization at baseline, in contrast to rhinitis or nasal allergy in 2011. This finding highlights the need to investigate the accuracy of the responses to the question waking up at night with shortness of breath in the general population, especially in rural and semi-rural areas in intermediate development countries. We found no association between having a positive BHR at baseline and changes in asthma symptoms at follow-up, which might suggests that changes in asthma prevalence could be related to other environmental exposures in this population.

### My child cannot breathe while sleeping: a report of three cases and review [^113yxruu]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Sudden breath-holding episodes during sleep in young children are potentially related to sudden infant death syndrome and other life-threatening events. Additionally, these episodes can negatively affect child's growth and development.

Case Presentation

Here, we present 3 cases of preschool children with similar paroxysmal nocturnal waking events associated with choking that had different etiologies (nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux disease, and parasomnia, respectively).

Conclusions

It is important to take into consideration the fact that breath spells during sleep can occur as a rare manifestation of parasomnia due to gastroesophageal reflux or as a symptom of nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy. Full video electroencephalography, polysomnography, and simultaneous gastric pH monitoring should be used for the differential diagnosis of sleep-related disorders, such as breath spells, in children.

### Differential diagnosis of suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations in the acute care setting: best practice [^116Eo8Xp]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

A chest X-ray can help distinguish an ECOPD from acute HF, with cardiomegaly supporting structural heart damage and HF likely present if there is pulmonary edema. The best laboratory markers of HF are elevation of natriuretic peptides (brain natriuretic peptide and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide), with thresholds supportive of acute HF, consistent with European Society of Cardiology Guidelines on HF, shown in Figure 3. Importantly, natriuretic peptides are commonly elevated in patients with stable COPD or pneumonia and increase further in patients with ECOPD even without acute HF. As such, higher thresholds are needed to accurately diagnose concomitant acute HF and ECOPD. More informative is the presence of low peptide concentrations, which have excellent negative predictive value for acute HF, even in patients with an ECOPD. Patients with elevated natriuretic peptides during an ECOPD have a worse prognosis, including a risk of death. Finally, point-of-care ultrasonography can help differentiate ECOPD from acute HF, although more research is required to establish their impact on health outcome benefits. A diagnostic algorithm to evaluate a patient with suspected acute HF is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3.
Algorithm reflecting the clinical features of a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presenting with increased respiratory symptoms and suspected acute heart failure. Recommendations are on the basis of the most recent European and American Guidelines on heart failure. *The thresholds for N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and BNP are intended for the diagnosis of acute heart failure (HF) and may need correction with age. Thresholds for new onset stable HF are much lower (i.e. NT-proBNP > 125 pg/ml and BNP > 35 pg/ml) and should be used outside the context of an exacerbation of COPD. Note that the presence of COPD may raise these values. Please see text for further details. ECG = electrocardiogram; ECOPD = exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; GDMT = guideline-directed medical treatment; HJ reflux = hepatojugular reflux; JVD = jugular vein distention; PND = paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea; WBC = white blood cell count.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^117MgdF1]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — suggestive features distinguishing COPD from common mimics are listed as follows. COPD presents with symptoms slowly progressive and a history of tobacco smoking or other risk factors. Asthma shows variable airflow obstruction with symptoms that vary widely from day to day, symptoms worse at night/early morning, allergy, rhinitis, and/or eczema also present, often occurs in children, and family history of asthma. Congestive heart failure is suggested by chest X-ray showing a dilated heart and pulmonary edema, and pulmonary function tests indicating volume restriction, not airflow obstruction. Bronchiectasis features large volumes of purulent sputum, is commonly associated with bacterial infection, and chest X-ray/HRCT shows bronchial dilation. Tuberculosis can have onset at all ages, chest X-ray shows lung infiltrate, microbiological confirmation, and high local prevalence of tuberculosis. Obliterative bronchiolitis can occur in children, is seen after lung or bone marrow transplantation, and HRCT on expiration shows hypodense areas. Diffuse panbronchiolitis is predominantly seen in patients of Asian descent; most patients are male and nonsmokers; almost all have chronic sinusitis; and chest X-ray & HRCT show diffuse small centrilobular nodular opacities & hyperinflation. These features are characteristic but not mandatory; for example, a person who has never smoked may develop COPD, especially in LMICs where other risk factors may be more important than cigarette smoking.

### Mechanical circulatory assist devices: a primer for critical care and emergency physicians [^116u1hQ9]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

The patient's hematocrit and hemoglobin levels should be assessed to rule out bleeding and hemolysis as causes of shortness of breath. Patients with LVADs take anticoagulation medications and have a bleeding diathesis in addition to the risk of hemolysis from the device–blood interaction.

Reduced CO may also cause shortness of breath. Cardiogenic Shock needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis. These patients may also have co-existent hypotension (see the " Shock " section below for the approach to management of this condition).

The patient should be intubated for mechanical ventilation when hypoxia, hypercarbia, or acidosis worsens or when the airway cannot be protected. Rapid sequence intubation should be performed. Any anesthetic induction agent can be considered, although etomidate or a narcotic and benzodiazepine combination like fentanyl plus midazolam is often preferred. Lung-protective ventilation strategies which include a low tidal volume (V) and adequate PEEP should be used. A very high PEEP can cause worsening of RV dysfunction and should be avoided. Therapeutic management may include draining a pleural effusion, inserting a chest tube for pneumothorax, performing a bronchoscopy procedure, and optimizing hemodynamics.

### Acute cardiopulmonary failure from sleep-disordered breathing [^112eskdy]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) comprises a diverse set of disorders marked by abnormal respiration during sleep. Clinicians should realize that SDB may present as acute cardiopulmonary failure in susceptible patients. In this review, we discuss three clinical phenotypes of acute cardiopulmonary failure from SDB: acute ventilatory failure, acute congestive heart failure, and sudden death. We review the pathophysiologic mechanisms and recommend general principles for management. Timely recognition of, and therapy for, SDB in the setting of acute cardiopulmonary failure may improve short- and long-term outcomes.

### Traumatic diaphragmatic rupture: a rare cause of postoperative shortness of breath [^11413yPs]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Shortness of breath is a common symptom reported by patients after gynecologic procedures. Delayed traumatic diaphragmatic rupture is a rare cause of shortness of breath.

Case

This report describes the diagnosis and management of a patient with a delayed presentation of a ruptured right hemidiaphragm after a laparotomy for a pelvic mass.

Conclusion

Although rare, delayed presentation of traumatic diaphragmatic rupture should be considered in patients with a history of blunt chest or abdominal trauma as a possible cause of shortness of breath in the postoperative setting.

### Differential diagnosis of suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations in the acute care setting: best practice [^114X6SDj]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may suffer from acute episodes of worsening dyspnea, often associated with increased cough, sputum, and/or sputum purulence. These exacerbations of COPD (ECOPDs) impact health status, accelerate lung function decline, and increase the risk of hospitalization. Importantly, close to 20% of patients are readmitted within 30 days after hospital discharge, with great cost to the person and society. Approximately 25% and 65% of patients hospitalized for an ECOPD die within 1 and 5 years, respectively. Patients with COPD are usually older and frequently have concomitant chronic diseases, including heart failure, coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, interstitial lung diseases, bronchiectasis, asthma, anxiety, and depression, and are also at increased risk of developing pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and pneumothorax. All of these morbidities not only increase the risk of subsequent ECOPDs but can also mimic or aggravate them. Importantly, close to 70% of readmissions after an ECOPD hospitalization result from decompensation of other morbidities. These observations suggest that in patients with COPD with worsening dyspnea but without the other classic characteristics of ECOPD, a careful search for these morbidities can help detect them and allow appropriate treatment. For most morbidities, a thorough clinical evaluation supplemented by appropriate clinical investigations can guide the healthcare provider to make a precise diagnosis. This perspective integrates the currently dispersed information available and provides a practical approach to patients with COPD complaining of worsening respiratory symptoms, particularly dyspnea. A systematic approach should help improve outcomes and the personal and societal cost of ECOPDs.

Patient's perspective

I only remember the moment before I was connected to the ventilator. I will do what I can to ensure the success of my treatment and rehabilitation.

Learning points

We should consider tracheal tumour as a differential diagnosis in patients with symptoms such as shortness of breath and wheezing similar to bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
We should add tracheal tumours in the list of differential diagnosis in post-irradiated cases with tumour of larynx, hypopharynx, and supraglottic region.
We should treat cases of such difficult malignant tumour with specialists through tumour board meeting.
There have been few reports of primary tracheal tumours related to epithelial–mesenchymaltransition, and we need to investigate further.
We need to develop effective treatments for tracheal tumours that are difficult to resect.

### Focused cardiac ultrasound in the emergent setting: a consensus statement of the American Society of Echocardiography and American College of Emergency Physicians [^113fHRVP]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2010). Medium credibility.

Focused cardiac ultrasound — global left ventricular systolic function assessment states that FOCUS can be used for global assessment of LV systolic function and relies on overall assessment of endocardial excursion and myocardial thickening, using multiple windows, including the parasternal, subcostal, and apical views; FOCUS is performed to assess global function and differentiates patients into "normal" or minimally impaired function versus "depressed" or significantly impaired function, and this descriptive nomenclature when used by non-echocardiographers has good correlation with echocardiographer interpretations; the goal of the focused exam is to facilitate clinical decision-making to decide if a patient with acute shortness of breath or chest pain has impaired systolic contractility and thus would benefit from pharmacologic therapies or other interventions; evaluation of segmental wall motion abnormalities and other causes of shortness of breath (e.g., valvular dysfunction) can be challenging and should be assessed by performing a comprehensive echocardiogram.

### Morning and night symptoms in primary care COPD patients: a cross-sectional and longitudinal study. An UNLOCK study from the IPCRG [^115b1wQW]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Strengths and limitations of this study

We designed this real-life study using patients from a primary care population in order to ensure a high external validity. To our knowledge, it is also the first study that assessed longitudinally the role of both morning and night symptoms in predicting exacerbations and health status. This study enroled patients independent of disease severity, from the usual consultations in primary care, and therefore these findings may be applicable to a wider population. However, as a cross-sectional study, there is a lack of ability to show cause and effect. The longitudinal analysis provides valuable additional information.

Our study used the ACQ questions to assess morning and night symptoms. This may be considered invalid because the ACQ is not designed nor validated for the use in COPD patients. However, no validated instrument exists that assesses both morning and night symptoms in COPD patients, and all patients completed both questionnaires in the study at baseline, as the diagnosis had not yet been established. Up until now, studies conducted to assess those symptoms used different tools, questionnaires, patient record forms, the clinical symptom questionnaire, interviews, or the a 'Night-time/Morning and Day-time Symptoms of COPD questionnaire'. Questions similar to the ACQ questions have been used in the majority of these studies to assess morning and night symptoms. Some examples are shown in the study by Kim et al' hen were your symptoms the most troublesome for you? On waking / In the morning / In the afternoon / In the evening / At night' and in the study by Lange et al. 'do you sometimes wake up in the night because of breathlessness/difficulties with breathing'? Nevertheless, we believe that these possible limitations do not invalidate the results obtained.

### 'Long COVID' syndrome [^116jXbCu]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global pandemic and an unprecedented public health crisis. Recent literature suggests the emergence of a novel syndrome known as 'long COVID', a term used to describe a diverse set of symptoms that persist after a minimum of 4 weeks from the onset of a diagnosed COVID-19 infection. Common symptoms include persistent breathlessness, fatigue and cough. Other symptoms reported include chest pain, palpitations, neurological and cognitive deficits, rashes, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. We present a complex case of a previously well 28-year-old woman who was diagnosed with COVID-19. After resolution of her acute symptoms, she continued to experience retrosternal discomfort, shortness of breath, poor memory and severe myalgia. Investigations yielded no significant findings. Given no alternative diagnosis, she was diagnosed with 'long COVID'.

Q2: What is the differential diagnosis of CS?

The most common symptoms in CS (flushing, diarrhoea, their combination) may represent manifestations of other clinical entities. Also, patients with an established CS, on treatment, can experience deterioration of their symptoms from other causes.
Diarrhoea in CS is always secretory, persists with fasting, may occur during the night and is associated with abdominal discomfort and faecal urgency. Sometimes, to prove "secretory" diarrhoea, an estimation of faecal fluid "osmotic gap" is needed, with an "osmotic gap" of < 50 mOsm kg –1 being diagnostic for secretory diarrhoea. 4C However, in other NETs (e.g. VIPomas, gastrinomas, medullary thyroid carcinomas [MTC]), as well as in systemic mastocytosis, diarrhoea is also secretory, and the differential diagnosis should be based primarily on laboratory findings.
Patients with CS treated with somatostatin analogues (SSA) may experience deterioration of previously controlled diarrhoea, or ongoing diarrhoea which never responded to SSA. Other causes of diarrhoea, NET‐related (steatorrhoea secondary to SSA, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, mesenteric ischaemia, bile salt malabsorption or short‐bowel syndrome), or NEN‐unrelated (colitis, gastroenteritis), need to be excluded. 5A The diagnosis of steatorrhoea as a result of SSA‐induced pancreatic insufficiency is based on stool features (pale, "oily", difficult to be flushed from the toilet) and may be confirmed by low faecal elastase or pragmatically by a trial of pancreatic enzymes. 5B Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is noted in patients with mesenteric fibrosis or multiple previous surgery, being associated also with bloating and/or flatulence and its diagnosis is established with an "H2 breath test". 4B Mesenteric ischaemia‐related diarrhoea can be suspected by the patient's history and abdominal CECT findings. Patients who have undergone right hemicolectomy may develop bile salt malabsorption‐associated diarrhoea. This diagnosis is usually based on history and confirmed, when available, with tauroselcholic (selenium‐75) acid (SeHCAT) scan, or pragmatically by a trial with bile acid sequestrants. 4B A short bowel syndrome, defined as a length of functional small bowel < 200 cm may occur after extensive intestinal resection.
Flushing in the context of CS has been described in Section B. Flushing can be noted in other NENs (MTC) as well as in some non‐NENs entities (menopause, systemic mastocytosis, anxiety). The key characteristics allowing the distinction of CS‐associated flushing from flushing from other causes are summarised in Table 5.

### Differential diagnosis of suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations in the acute care setting: best practice [^116nE5Lv]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory Morbidities

Asthma Exacerbation

The prevalence of comorbid bronchial asthma in patients with COPD ranges from 3.8% to 38.8% depending on the definitions used, with a family history of asthma, younger age, and the presence of atopy or childhood asthma suggesting comorbid asthma in a patient with COPD. Patients with both diseases are more symptomatic, have poorer lung function, and are at increased risk of exacerbation and hospitalization compared with patients with either disease.

No publication has addressed whether exacerbations in patients with comorbid COPD and asthma are different from exacerbations of asthma or ECOPD, and guidelines define asthma exacerbations and ECOPDs similarly. The most frequent cause of both ECOPDs and asthma exacerbations are viral infections and/or pollutants, and although sputum/purulence, one of the typical features of ECOPD, could help distinguish the two events, sputum/purulence has also been reported in asthma exacerbations. Thus, the management of concomitant COPD and asthma is similar to that of asthma.

ILDs

ILDs occur in approximately 8% of individuals with tobacco smoke exposure. Despite marked differences in static respiratory mechanics between ILDs and COPD, patients with both diseases characteristically describe dyspnea and dry cough as their major symptoms, with dyspnea likely because of an uncoupling between the effort needed to breathe and the effective respired volume of inspired air. As in COPD, the natural course of ILDs (especially idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [IPF]) is punctuated by exacerbations, usually severe, which are associated with clinical deterioration, although IPF exacerbations have a worse prognosis than ECOPDs.

Some patients may present with combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema. When these patients experience an exacerbation, it may be difficult to differentiate an ECOPD from an IPF exacerbation. The evidence of new widespread alveolar abnormalities (ground-glass) in imaging studies in a patient with symptoms consistent with ECOPD supports an important role of an ILD exacerbation in the patient's event.

### Sleep disturbances in craniopharyngioma: a challenging diagnosis [^115GAxB4]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Sleep evaluation and differential diagnosis

The diagnostic work-up involved a long-term Video-EEG monitoring including polygraphic measurements, which recorded a severe alteration of the sleep–wake cyclic organization and the sleep structure. The occurrence of short sleep cycles, reduced representation of N2 and N3 NREM sleep phases, frequent episodes of undetermined state of vigilance, and the concurrence of elements typical of different sleep stages (i.e. spindles in a wake-like state and REM sleep, and rapid eye movements quickly followed by N2 NREM sleep) were registered.

From the respiratory point of view, polysomnography revealed a severe breathing disorder with both central and obstructive apneas with desaturations (AHI 19/h, obstructive apneas 2.1/h, central apneas 4.3/h, mixed apneas 0.2/h, hypopneas 12.6/h, ODI 20.5/h, mean oxygen saturation value 94.1%, minimum oxygen saturation value 77%).

We observed episodes characterized by jerks of the trunk and lower limbs and repeated movements of the pelvis occurring in the transition from wake to sleep, with no associated epileptic discharges.

Moreover, frequent nocturnal arousals and parasomnia episodes, accompanied by hypersynchronous delta waves during NREM sleep, could occur both spontaneously or in association with apneas or hypopneas. During some events, the patient sat on the bed in a state of confusion.

Brain MRI showed volumetric increase in the post-surgical interpeduncular fossa and right paramedian cysts (Fig. 1 b, c).

Therefore, these investigations confirmed that the patient's complex clinical features were expression of the alteration of the sleep–wake rhythm, and the destruction of the wake-NREM sleep-REM sleep boundaries requiring a multifactorial therapeutic plan.

Treatment and follow-up

Education on environmental stimulation and proper sleep hygiene was provided. Moreover, an initial pharmacological approach with slow-release melatonin improved night-time sleep but marked daytime sleepiness persisted. Then, the patient underwent surgical treatment of cyst fenestration with sleep–wake rhythm and behavioral improvement. Finally, a non-invasive overnight ventilatory support with bi-level pressure support ventilation was initiated, with a very poor adherence. In the following months, he presented a new worsening of symptoms, and the MRI showed a further volumetric increase in cysts. A few months later the patient died due to complications of acute pancreatitis and pneumonia.

### Distinct shortness of breath profiles in oncology outpatients undergoing chemotherapy [^114rY8mW]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2023). Medium credibility.

Context

Shortness of breath is a distressing symptom that occurs in 10% to 70% of oncology patients. Despite this broad range in its occurrence, little is known about inter-individual variability in shortness of breath and associated risk factors among patients receiving chemotherapy.

Objectives

Identify subgroups of patients with distinct shortness of breath profiles; evaluate for differences among these subgroups in demographic and clinical characteristics; evaluate for differences among symptom dimensions of shortness of breath, and evaluate for differences in quality of life outcomes.

Methods

Outpatients (n = 1338) completed questionnaires six times over two chemotherapy cycles. Occurrence of shortness of breath was assessed using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale. Latent class analysis was used to identify subgroups of patients with distinct shortness of breath profiles.

Results

Four distinct shortness of breath profiles were identified (None [70.5%], Decreasing [8.2%], Increasing [7.8%], High [13.5%]). Risk factors for membership in High class included: history of smoking, self-reported diagnosis of lung disease, having lung cancer, and receipt of a higher number of cancer treatments. Compared to the None class, High class reported poorer physical, psychological, and social functioning.

Conclusions

Almost 14% of patients with heterogeneous types of cancer receiving chemotherapy had persistently high occurrence rates of shortness of breath for almost two months. In addition, compared to the Decreasing and Increasing classes, the High class' episodes of shortness of breath were more frequent and more severe. Clinicians need to assess all oncology patients for shortness of breath and provide targeted interventions.

### Role of precision medicine in obstructive sleep apnoea [^1118GU4W]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Sources and selection criteria

We searched PubMed and Medline databases for peer reviewed, English language studies of adult obstructive sleep apnoea, published from 1 January 2012 to 31 May 2022, and manually searched the references of selected articles for relevant articles for our narrative review. We used the following medical subject headings search terms in combination with the term "precision medicine": "pathophysiology", "cluster analysis", "polysomnography", "biomarker/blood", "classification", and "treatment". We also included highly cited papers published before 2012 based on our narrative review of the literature.

Symptom clusters

A symptom cluster is defined as two or more concurrent symptoms that are related to each other. Clinical symptom subtypes are associated with differential risks for prevalent and incident cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease among patients with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnoea. Ye and colleagues first used latent class analysis, an unsupervised cluster analysis, to identify clinical phenotypes of obstructive sleep apnoea based on symptoms and comorbidities. With this data driven approach, they originally explored the differences in the clinical presentation of obstructive sleep apnoea by classifying individuals into three groups: disturbed sleep, minimally symptomatic, and excessive daytime sleepiness. The three clusters were not substantially different for apnoea-hypopnoea index, body mass index, or sex. Most individuals in the disturbed sleep and minimally symptomatic clusters reported classic obstructive sleep apnoea symptoms (ie, pauses in breathing at night and loud snoring), but less often than patients in the excessive daytime sleepiness cluster.

### Daytime symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review [^113R8Ppg]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Summary of key findings

This systematic review and literature analysis identified 56 articles reporting daytime COPD symptoms. Taken together, the accumulated evidence demonstrates that the symptomatic burden of COPD appears to be most acute in the morning, particularly at the time of waking. The prevalence of COPD symptoms tends to fluctuate over the course of the day, and is generally higher in the morning and/or daytime compared with at night. These morning symptoms have a substantial impact on patients' ability to function normally (both in the morning and through the remainder of the day) and negatively affect patients' QoL and health status. The literature confirms that pharmacotherapy can help patients to function normally during the day. Additionally, our analysis showed that the measures and tools used to evaluate daytime COPD symptoms are not uniform and vary widely across studies. We propose that there is need for a validated tool to better assess COPD symptoms, particularly morning symptoms.

Variability in daytime COPD symptoms

The literature searches we conducted revealed a pattern of daytime symptomatology for patients with COPD. All characteristic symptoms (breathlessness, cough, increased sputum) and some of the associated symptoms (wheezing and chest tightness/congestion) are most prevalent and/or burdensome upon waking, with a gradual tapering off through the remainder of the morning and through lunchtime, before wheezing and chest tightness/congestion become prevalent and/or burdensome again in the afternoon or evening and into the night (Fig. 2). In another recent review, Singh et al.concluded that COPD symptoms are troublesome, variable, and can occur at any time during a 24-h period.

Daytime COPD symptoms.

Burden of daytime COPD symptoms

The literature showed a clear trend for the greatest burden from COPD occurring in the morning. This is perhaps an area that needs increased attention from both general practitioners and respiratory specialists. Indeed, Partridge et al.showed, via quantitative Internet interviews of > 800 patients with COPD across multiple countries, that only 22–44% reported being asked by their physician whether they experience symptoms in the morning, and only 9–22% said they had been asked how they manage their morning routines. It should be noted that the article by Partridge et al. was published 10 years ago; however, there remains a strong argument for treating physicians to discuss with their patients with COPD when their symptoms are most troublesome and how this can be best managed.

Assessment of ECOPD Severity

Based on a thorough review of the available literature and using a Delphi approach to agree on the variable thresholds, the Rome proposal suggests using easy-to-obtain clinical variables to define the severity of ECOPD (mild, moderate, or severe) at the point of care (Figure 8). In the primary care setting, severity can be determined with the easily obtainable dyspnea intensity (using a VAS 0 to 10 dyspnea scale with zero being not short of breath at all and 10 the worst shortness of breath you have ever experienced), respiratory rate, heart rate, and oxygen saturation level. Where available, measuring blood C-reactive protein (CRP) levels is recommended (Figure 8). To determine the need for ventilatory support (usually in the emergency department or hospital setting), arterial blood gases should be measured. To move from a mild to a moderate level, three of the variables must exceed the established thresholds.

It is hoped that prospective validation will help better define exacerbations and their severity at the point of contact and that documented validation may confirm or help modify the proposed thresholds of the variables now included. Likewise, it is proposed that prospective research can help determine a more specific marker of lung injury than the more generic CRP, as has been true for acute events of other organs (e.g. troponin level in patients with acute myocardial infarction).

Management of ECOPD

Treatment setting

Depending on the episode severity, as well as that of the underlying COPD and comorbidities, an ECOPD can be managed in either the outpatient or inpatient setting. The following are indications for hospitalization: (1) severe symptoms such as sudden worsening of resting dyspnea, high respiratory rate, decreased oxygen saturation, confusion, and drowsiness; (2) acute respiratory failure; (3) onset of new physical signs (e.g. cyanosis, peripheral edema); (4) failure to respond to initial medical management; (5) presence of serious comorbidities (e.g. heart failure, newly occurring arrhythmias); and (6) insufficient home support.

In the emergency department, hypoxemic patients should be provided with the appropriate concentration of supplemental oxygen and be assessed to determine if the increased work of breathing or impaired gas exchange requires noninvasive ventilation. If so, healthcare providers should consider admission to an area where proper monitoring and care can be provided. In less severe cases, the patient may be managed in the emergency department or hospital ward unit.

Why do the parents request a referral?

A host of reasons may underpin the parent's request. Is their concern that the wheezy episodes are harmful? Are they unable to sleep because the child is disturbed at night? Is it the lack of a clear diagnosis and uncertainty about the boy's long-term prognosis that is causing the worry? Do the parents want advice on avoiding triggers or information on what to do when the wheezing recurs, or is the main focus of this consultation the (perceived) additional value of a referral to a specialist? Or all of these?

### Daytime symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review [^116MxSBT]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disorder characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In 2012, more than 3 million people died of COPD, accounting for 6% of all deaths globally, and projections suggest that COPD will be the third leading cause of death in the world by 2020. The primary symptoms of COPD are breathlessness, cough, and increased sputum; many patients also experience wheezing and chest tightness or congestion, the latter particularly at times of exertion. Other secondary symptoms and related comorbidities include sleep disorders/disturbances and associated daytime sleepiness, increased anxiety and/or depression, and in severe and very severe cases, fatigue, weight loss, and anorexia.

Over the past 30 years, studies have recognized that the presence of variations in circadian and diurnal lung function generally coincide with exacerbations in patients with COPD. – The prevalence and/or burden of COPD symptoms have been shown to reflect this circadian and diurnal variability in their tendency to fluctuate over time throughout the day and night.– Moreover, temporal symptom spikes, especially those occurring in the early morning and late at night, have been associated with some of the aforementioned secondary symptoms or comorbidities (e.g. sleep disturbance and increased anxiety or depression). These spikes have also been linked with worse overall health status, and reduced ability to complete normal daily activities.

### Cardiac or pulmonary dyspnea in patients admitted to the emergency department [^116dK7wr]. Respiratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

A simple and quick way of discrimination between cardiac and pulmonary causes of dyspnea is essential in patients admitted to the emergency department. We aimed to assess the utility of easily applicable diagnostic tools in the differential diagnosis of cardiac and pulmonary causes of dyspnea in patients presenting with shortness of breath. Clinical and radiologic evaluation, peak expiratory flow (PEF), PaO2, PaCO2 measurements were performed in 94 patients admitted to the emergency room with dyspnea. All the patients were hospitalized for accurate diagnosis and later were categorized into cardiac and pulmonary dyspnea groups. PEF, %PEF (percent of predicted PEF), dyspnea differentiation index (DDI = PEF x PaO2/1000), %DDI (%PEF x PaO2/1000), PaO2 and PaCO2 measurements were compared between the two groups. When cardiac and pulmonary dyspnea groups were compared, considering 1.6 as the cut-off value for DDI, measurements above this value imply cardiac pathology with 76.7% sensitivity and 67.2% specificity. The sensitivity and specificity for cardiac dyspnea calculated according to the cut-off values were 96.7% and 40.6% for %DDI; 86.7% and 60.9% for PEF; 86.7% and 54.7% for %PEF; 66.7 and 68.7 for PaO2. Also for pulmonary dyspnea, sensitivity and specificity values for PaCO2 were 50% and 93%. We conclude that DDI, %DDI, PEF, %PEF, PaO2 and PaCO2 are simple and easily applicable tools for differential diagnosis of cardiac and pulmonary dyspnea. Adjunctive utility of these tests in the emergency department with clinical and radiologic evaluation contributes to this discrimination.

Daytime COPD symptoms: prevalence, variability, and burden

Information on the prevalence (number of patients reporting symptoms) of common daytime symptoms of COPD was collated from 18 articles that had extractable data (Supplementary Table 4). In nine articles, the relative prevalence rates of COPD symptoms (both for all symptoms and for individual symptoms) were generally higher in the morning and/or daytime (when defined, this was usually the time between the morning period and when the patient goes to bed) compared with at night (Supplementary Table 4). For example, a prevalence of 81.4% for morning symptoms and 63.0% for night-time symptoms was reported by Miravitlles et al. Similar trends of morning and/or daytime versus night-time symptom prevalence were reported by Bateman et al.(94.4 versus 88.3%), Marth et al.(91.7 versus 70.6%), Soler-Cataluna et al.(71.3–83.5% versus 59.0–63.8%), Stephenson et al.(67.3 versus 50.0% of those completing the survey), Tsiligianni et al.(51.9 versus 39.4%), and Miravitlles et al.(71 versus 48%). Moreover, where prevalence rates were provided separately for morning and daytime, they were usually relatively similar. However, one study based on physician reports (not patient self-reporting) went against this trend. In this study by Roche et al. physicians reported morning symptoms for only 40% of their patients with COPD, compared with daytime symptoms for 97% of patients and night-time symptoms for 58% of patients. Breathlessness, cough, and increased sputum usually made up the top three most prevalent COPD symptoms reported for both morning and daytime, though relative proportions varied based on differences in populations and study designs (Supplementary Table 4). Wheezing and chest tightness/congestion were usually less commonly reported for morning and daytime.

### Management of asthma and COPD exacerbations in adults in the ICU [^113ApcHi]. CHEST Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Evidence Review

Definition and Triggers

Asthma exacerbations are defined as episodes of increased symptoms (eg, shortness of breath, cough, wheezing) and progressive decrease in lung function that require a change in treatment. Similarly, COPD exacerbations are episodes of increased dyspnea, cough, and sputum production, often accompanied by tachypnea, tachycardia, or both, that worsen within 2 weeks from symptom onset. These heterogenous events are caused by complex interactions between a trigger and the patient's immune response. – Viruses are implicated in 40% to 50% of asthma and COPD exacerbations, and virus-induced COPD exacerbations are associated with increased health care use and a prolonged course. – Bacterial infections are thought to be a more important trigger for COPD exacerbations; however, uncertainty remains around the role of bacteria in both diseases, particularly severe asthma exacerbations in which bacterial infections have been identified more frequently. In addition, environmental or food allergens can trigger asthma exacerbations, and recognition has been growing around the importance of air pollution and extreme heat in inducing both asthma and COPD exacerbations.–

### Does this dyspneic patient in the emergency department have congestive heart failure? [^114Wjz9q]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Dyspnea is a common complaint in the emergency department where physicians must accurately make a rapid diagnosis.

Objective

To assess the usefulness of history, symptoms, and signs along with routine diagnostic studies (chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and serum B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP]) that differentiate heart failure from other causes of dyspnea in the emergency department.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE (1966-July 2005) and the reference lists from retrieved articles, previous reviews, and physical examination textbooks.

Study Selection

We retained 22 studies of various findings for diagnosing heart failure in adult patients presenting with dyspnea to the emergency department.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently abstracted data (sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios [LRs]) and assessed methodological quality.

Data Synthesis

Many features increased the probability of heart failure, with the best feature for each category being the presence of (1) past history of heart failure (positive LR = 5.8; 95% confidence interval, 4.1–8.0); (2) the symptom of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (positive LR = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5–4.5); (3) the sign of the third heart sound (S(3)) gallop (positive LR = 11; 95% CI, 4.9–25.0); (4) the chest radiograph showing pulmonary venous congestion (positive LR = 12.0; 95% CI, 6.8–21.0); and (5) electrocardiogram showing atrial fibrillation (positive LR = 3.8; 95% CI, 1.7–8.8). The features that best decreased the probability of heart failure were the absence of (1) past history of heart failure (negative LR = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.38–0.53); (2) the symptom of dyspnea on exertion (negative LR = 0.48; 95% CI, 0.35–0.67); (3) rales (negative LR = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.37–0.70); (4) the chest radiograph showing cardiomegaly (negative LR = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.23–0.48); and (5) any electrocardiogram abnormality (negative LR = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.47–0.88). A low serum BNP proved to be the most useful test (serum B-type natriuretic peptide < 100 pg/mL; negative LR = 0.11; 95% CI, 0.07–0.16).

Conclusions

For dyspneic adult emergency department patients, a directed history, physical examination, chest radiograph, and electrocardiography should be performed. If the suspicion of heart failure remains, obtaining a serum BNP level may be helpful, especially for excluding heart failure.

Data extraction and analysis

Data relating to study design, patient population characteristics, and outcomes of interest were extracted from abstracts or full-text articles by a reviewer into a standardized data extraction form. Each form was then checked by two independent reviewers. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion. Data from the final data extraction forms were tabulated and are discussed in this review in a purely descriptive fashion. Due to the heterogeneity of the data and the diversity of the clinical trial designs, no additional subanalyses or meta-analyses were planned or performed.

Terms such as "on waking", "early morning", "later in the morning", and "morning" were all used in the identified articles; data related to these time points are discussed together in this review as "morning" symptoms, although the exact descriptions used in the source material are used wherever possible. With regards to descriptions of symptoms, the terminology used in the original source materials varied significantly; therefore, to simplify the reading of this review, standardized terms are used throughout. A glossary of these standardized terms is provided in Table 2.

### Assessment and diagnosis of chronic dyspnoea: a literature review [^111K35mr]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This literature review revealed the scarce research that has been undertaken to help clinicians develop an accurate and efficient approach to the diagnosis of dyspnoea. The research we report here has, however, demonstrated that a stepwise approach to dyspnoea assessment that starts with simple and then more expensive or invasive tests only as the initial steps fail, could achieve an accurate diagnosis in the majority of patients.

Our review suggests detailed history taking, physical examination, full blood count along with spirometry, chest X-ray and electrocardiogram are the most appropriate initial clinical assessments to establish a cause of dyspnoea (> 30%). While history taking and physical examination were reported to be essential components in all studies, no study aimed to validate a high yield approach to it which is important considering the time constraints in primary care. Even so, several expert reviews on history taking and physical examination for chronic breathlessness such as the Breathing SPACE framework, IMPRESS frameworkand a review by Baxter et al.from the Primary Care Respiratory Society are available as references for clinical practice.

### Cpap machine… [^112N1hkQ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Do you feel tired or have a headache when you wake up in the morning. Something might be going wrong while you sleep that you don't know about: obstructive sleep apnea. What is Obstructive Sleep Apnea. The Greek word "apnea" means "without breath. " An apnea is defined as a pause in breathing for at least 10 seconds. Obstructive sleep apnea, also called OSA, causes you to stop breathing in your sleep for several seconds, up to many times an hour. People diagnosed with OSA have at least five breathing pauses an hour and can have many more. During these breathing pauses, your brain, heart, kidneys, and other essential organs do not get enough oxygen, and carbon dioxide can build up in your body. When your brain notices there is not enough oxygen and too much carbon dioxide in your body, it sends out a signal to take a breath. You wake up enough to take a few breaths, but not enough to remember it the next morning.

This cycle repeats itself many times each night, making you feel tired or exhausted in the morning. When you have OSA, the apnea is caused by an obstruction or blockage. Usually the blockage is tongue muscles, soft palate or parts of your throat that relax too much during sleep and block your airway. A less common form of sleep apnea, called central sleep apnea, happens if the area of your brain that controls breathing does not send the correct signals to the muscles that help you breathe. If you have OSA, a person sleeping near you may notice that you snore loudly, and occasionally pause breathing and make a snort or choking sound when you start breathing again. These symptoms may happen less often or go unnoticed in women with OSA. Other symptoms include:

- More than usual daytime sleepiness
- Waking up with a dry throat or headache
- Waking up often during the night
- Waking up often during the night to urinate
- Difficulty concentrating or mood changes during the day.

Getting treatment for OSA is key because OSA not only affects your sleep but also increases your risk of serious health problems and even death. Chronic, untreated OSA may increase your risk of heart attack, stroke, type 2 diabetes, glaucoma, and some types of cancer along with other serious health conditions.

### Label: NUVIGIL-armodafinil tablet… [^1173Q9gq]. FDA (DailyMed) (2011). Low credibility.

Armodafinil and modafinil have wake-promoting actions similar to sympathomimetic agents including amphetamine and methylphenidate, although their pharmacologic profile is not identical to that of the sympathomimetic amines. In addition to its wake-promoting effects and ability to increase locomotor activity in animals, modafinil produces psychoactive and euphoric effects, alterations in mood, perception, thinking, and feelings typical of other CNS stimulants in humans. CLINICAL TRIALS The effectiveness of NUVIGIL in improving wakefulness has been established in the following sleep disorders: obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy and shift work disorder. For each clinical trial, a p-value of ≤ 0. 05 was required for statistical significance.

Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome The effectiveness of NUVIGIL in improving wakefulness in patients with excessive sleepiness associated with OSA was established in two 12-week, multi-center, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind studies of outpatients who met the International Classification of Sleep Disorders criteria for OSA. In the first study, a total of 395 patients with OSA were randomized to receive NUVIGIL 150 mg/day, NUVIGIL 250 mg/day or matching placebo. Patients treated with NUVIGIL showed a statistically significant improvement in the ability to remain awake compared to placebo-treated patients as measured by the MWT at final visit. Patients treated with NUVIGIL showed a statistically significantly enhanced ability to remain awake on the MWT at each dose compared to placebo at final visit.

A statistically significant greater number of patients treated with NUVIGIL at each dose showed improvement in overall clinical condition as rated by the CGI-C scale at final visit. Shift Work Disorder The effectiveness of NUVIGIL in improving wakefulness in patients with excessive sleepiness associated with SWD was demonstrated in a 12-week, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, clinical trial. A total of 254 patients with chronic SWD were randomized to receive NUVIGIL 150 mg/day or placebo. INDICATIONS AND USAGE NUVIGIL is indicated to improve wakefulness in patients with excessive sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy and shift work disorder.
