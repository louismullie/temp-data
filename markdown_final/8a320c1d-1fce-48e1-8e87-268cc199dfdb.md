## Question

Can you explain this: a low-attenuation lesion within the pancreatic body, probable side-branch intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm; follow-up pancreatic protocol MRI without and with contrast is recommended?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what this CT finding means — a low-attenuation lesion in the pancreatic body suspected to be a side-branch IPMN — and what to do next, including whether pancreatic protocol MRI with and without contrast plus MRCP is appropriate, how to risk stratify, and how to surveil or escalate care accordingly [^111pttvV] [^114wBdTL] [^114SW6w3] [^113fRG8n]. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what a low-attenuation lesion on CT in the pancreatic body implies and its differential, especially cystic versus solid, and the limits of CT for IPMN characterization. Then, I should verify when MRI with MRCP, without and with IV contrast, is preferred and why. Next, I will review risk stratification per Fukuoka and related frameworks to decide who needs EUS or surgery. After that, I should determine surveillance intervals and duration across AGA, European, and Fukuoka guidance. Finally, I will outline specific MRI reporting elements, growth thresholds, and patient-centered modifiers such as age and comorbidity, and conclude with a clear management recommendation [^111pttvV] [^114wBdTL] [^114SW6w3] [^114jnoEy] [^112kprPR].

> Let me first confirm the imaging implication of a low-attenuation pancreatic body lesion on CT, because low attenuation typically suggests a fluid-containing cyst rather than a solid mass and is consistent with a mucinous cyst such as a branch-duct IPMN, although CT alone is limited in defining ductal communication, mural nodules, and subtle solid components that drive management decisions [^111pttvV] [^114SW6w3]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions, since CT detection is acceptable but detailed characterization for IPMN hinges on MRCP to demonstrate communication with the main pancreatic duct and on contrast-enhanced sequences to assess enhancing mural nodules that upstage risk [^113fRG8n] [^114wBdTL].

> I will now examine the suspected pathology and make sure BD-IPMN is the right working diagnosis, noting that branch-duct IPMN is a mucin-producing epithelial neoplasm arising from branch ducts, often multifocal, with cystic dilation that communicates with the main pancreatic duct and a lower malignant potential than main-duct or mixed-type IPMN, yet still with nontrivial long-term risk of high-grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma and a recognized field defect with risk of separate PDAC elsewhere in the gland [^116na1zK] [^113DGv8E] [^111GQe2k]. Wait, let me verify the malignant potential difference again, because multiple cohorts consistently show higher risk in main-duct or mixed-type disease and support surveillance rather than upfront resection for most BD-IPMN, provided high-risk features are absent [^113DGv8E] [^113fRG8n].

> Next, I should review why pancreatic protocol MRI with MRCP, without and with IV contrast, is recommended as the next step, since MRI provides superior soft-tissue contrast, no radiation for lifelong surveillance, and MRCP to confirm ductal communication and measure main duct caliber, making MRI the preferred modality across ACR, European, and Fukuoka-consistent summaries for nonoperative management of IPMN [^111pttvV] [^114SW6w3] [^113fRG8n]. I need to ensure we are not overlooking the role of CT entirely, but for serial follow-up and detection of subtle mural nodules or ductal communication, MRI is prioritized in contemporary guidelines and reviews [^114SW6w3] [^113HCiiY].

> Hold on, I should verify the rationale for obtaining both non-contrast and contrast-enhanced sequences, because non-contrast MRCP delineates ductal anatomy and communication while contrast-enhanced phases help confirm true enhancement of mural nodules, wall thickening, and solid components that constitute worrisome features or high-risk stigmata and would otherwise be underdetected on non-contrast imaging alone [^111pttvV] [^114wBdTL]. Let me double-check abbreviated MRI claims, since recent data suggest some abbreviated protocols can detect degeneration signs efficiently, but comprehensive protocols with dynamic contrast remain standard in guidelines to minimize missed enhancing nodules and optimize risk categorization in BD-IPMN surveillance [^114AKD8m] [^111pttvV].

> I need to check the risk stratification next, using the revised Fukuoka framework that separates high-risk stigmata from worrisome features, where enhancing mural nodules, main pancreatic duct diameter of 10 mm or greater, and obstructive jaundice constitute high-risk indicators for surgical consultation if the patient is fit, while cyst size 3 cm or more, non-enhancing mural nodules, main duct 5–9 mm, thickened or enhancing wall, abrupt duct caliber change with distal atrophy, lymphadenopathy, elevated CA 19–9, and pancreatitis represent worrisome features that prompt EUS and closer interval imaging [^114wBdTL] [^113fRG8n]. Let me verify the negative predictive value of no high-risk features, since early data suggested a very high NPV when consensus resection indications were absent, supporting surveillance in low-risk presentations [^113323at].

> Next, I should review how MPD diameter thresholds inform escalation, because while 5 mm or greater on imaging defines main-duct involvement in the consensus framework, a diameter of 10 mm or greater is a high-risk stigma favoring resection when feasible, whereas 5–9 mm alone is not an automatic indication for surgery but is categorized as a worrisome feature that warrants EUS and closer monitoring [^117D64pF] [^114wBdTL]. Wait, I should confirm that BD-IPMN can secondarily dilate the MPD via mucin, which can simulate mixed-type disease, underscoring the need for careful MRCP and EUS correlation before labeling mixed-type IPMN [^115ugYsq].

> Let me consider the surveillance strategy for presumed low-risk BD-IPMN without worrisome features, since European guidelines advise MRI at 6 months in year one and yearly thereafter while the patient remains fit for surgery, whereas AGA suggests MRI at one year then every two years for a total of five years if stable, with ongoing debate about whether surveillance should continue beyond five years given persistent cancer risk over time [^114SW6w3] [^114jnoEy] [^113fRG8n]. I should double-check long-term risk estimates, because meta-analytic data show cumulative pancreatic cancer risk of approximately 3 percent at five years and nearly 8 percent at ten years for low-risk IPMN, which supports extended or indefinite surveillance in suitable candidates and aligns with observational cohorts reporting late progression beyond five years [^111sjr4k] [^115y9hv3] [^113HCiiY].

> I will now examine when to add EUS and possibly FNA, recognizing that EUS is recommended when worrisome features are present or MRI is indeterminate, and that EUS can detect mural nodules or main-duct abnormalities missed by cross-sectional imaging and provide cytologic or cyst fluid biomarker assessment to refine risk when imaging is equivocal [^114wBdTL] [^113qwkra]. Wait, let me verify the ACR perspective here, as ACR also places EUS in the initial evaluation when main duct dilatation is suspected, which is directly relevant if MRCP shows MPD in the 5–9 mm range or other concerning features [^111pttvV].

> Next, I should review exactly what the MRI report must include to enable guideline-based decisions, namely the maximal cyst diameter in three planes, multiplicity and distribution, definite communication with the main duct, main pancreatic duct diameters in head, body, and tail, presence and size of mural nodules with enhancement characteristics, wall thickness and enhancement, septations and enhancement, surrounding parenchymal atrophy, lymph nodes, and any change from prior studies because these elements map directly to Fukuoka features and malignancy predictors identified in meta-analysis such as size over 3 cm, mural nodules, and MPD dilation [^114wBdTL] [^116nSpm8]. Hold on, I should verify that multifocality is common and that surveillance must cover the entire gland even when targeting one index lesion, given the propensity for new or remote neoplasia in IPMN cohorts [^112RxEmR] [^111GQe2k].

> Let me consider growth kinetics and what constitutes clinically relevant progression, because contemporary surgical series propose that growth of 5 mm or greater in two years is a clinically relevant progression signal, whereas size of 3 cm or greater alone, without other features, is not necessarily associated with high-grade dysplasia or invasive cancer, reinforcing that change and ductal or nodular features trump size alone [^112kprPR] [^114LmTCz]. Hmm, wait a minute, some earlier frameworks emphasized size more strongly, but accumulating evidence suggests that isolated size over 3 cm is insufficient for predicting high-grade disease without corroborating features, which is why EUS is often interposed before surgery in size-driven scenarios [^114wBdTL] [^112kprPR].

> I should confirm how duration of surveillance is individualized, since European guidance advises continued follow-up until the patient is no longer fit for surgery, while ACG recommends discontinuing surveillance when patients cease to be surgical candidates, and competing-risk analyses highlight that advanced age and comorbidity can outweigh the low but persistent risk of malignant progression in some patients [^114SW6w3] [^115PVpkA] [^113hMVC3]. Let me reconsider whether a hard stop at five years is reasonable, because while AGA permits it if stable, several meta-analyses and longitudinal cohorts show late emergence of worrisome features or cancer, arguing for shared decision-making about extended surveillance in fit patients [^114jnoEy] [^111sjr4k] [^115y9hv3].

> But wait, what if the lesion is not the source of eventual cancer and a separate PDAC arises elsewhere, as has been documented in IPMN populations, which means surveillance should not only characterize the index cyst but also scout the entire gland and regional nodes at each interval [^111GQe2k] [^112RxEmR]. I need to ensure the MRI protocol and interpretive approach remain vigilant for interval parenchymal changes, ductal strictures, or new lesions that might represent concomitant or metachronous PDAC during follow-up [^113ta69W] [^114SW6w3].

> Putting this together, my management recommendation is as follows, and I will double-check each step against guidelines before concluding: obtain pancreatic protocol MRI without and with IV contrast plus MRCP as the next diagnostic step to confirm branch-duct communication, measure MPD, and evaluate for enhancing mural nodules or solid components, because this directly informs Fukuoka risk categorization and need for EUS or surgery [^111pttvV] [^114SW6w3] [^114wBdTL]. If MRI confirms BD-IPMN under 3 cm with no worrisome features, pursue surveillance with MRI at six months then annually while the patient is fit for surgery per European guidance, or MRI at one year then every two years for a total of five years per AGA, with shared decision-making about extended surveillance given persistent long-term risk evidenced in meta-analyses and observational cohorts [^114SW6w3] [^114jnoEy] [^111sjr4k] [^115y9hv3]. If any worrisome features are present, arrange EUS with or without FNA and repeat MRI in three to six months; if high-risk stigmata such as an enhancing mural nodule or MPD of 10 mm or greater are present, refer for surgical consultation if the patient is a candidate, recognizing that duct size 5–9 mm alone is not a surgical mandate but does require intensified evaluation [^114wBdTL] [^113qwkra] [^117D64pF]. Throughout surveillance, treat growth of 5 mm or greater in two years as clinically relevant progression that should trigger re-evaluation for EUS and potential surgical consideration rather than relying on size threshold alone, and counsel the patient that surveillance also aims to detect separate pancreatic cancers that can arise remote from the index cyst [^112kprPR] [^111GQe2k] [^116nSpm8].

A low-attenuation pancreatic body lesion, likely a side-branch IPMN, is a **mucin-producing cystic neoplasm** [^116na1zK] with a low but real malignant potential [^111sjr4k]. MRI with and without contrast [^111pttvV] is recommended to confirm **ductal communication** [^115ugYsq], evaluate for **mural nodules** [^114wBdTL], and further characterize the lesion. If no high-risk stigmata or worrisome features are present, surveillance is appropriate [^111pttvV] [^114jnoEy]; surgery is reserved for lesions with high-risk features [^114wBdTL] or for fit patients with worrisome features [^113HCiiY].

---

## Clinical significance and malignant potential

- **Malignant potential**: Side-branch IPMNs have a lower risk than main-duct IPMNs [^113fRG8n], but can progress to invasive carcinoma [^111sjr4k].
- **Risk factors**: Cyst size > 3 cm [^116nSpm8], mural nodules, and main duct dilation [^117D64pF] increase malignancy risk [^111sjr4k].
- **Progression risk**: Low-risk IPMNs have a 3.12% 5-year and 7.77% 10-year cancer risk [^111sjr4k].

---

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

MRI with and without contrast [^111pttvV] is recommended to confirm **cyst–duct communication** [^115ugYsq] and detect **mural nodules** or **ductal changes** that suggest higher risk [^1135cCYh]. It also avoids radiation and is generally well tolerated [^113fRG8n].

---

## Management guidelines

Management depends on **risk features**:

| **Risk category** | **Features** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|-|
| High-risk stigmata | - Enhancing mural nodule <br/> - Main duct ≥ 10 mm <br/> - Obstructive jaundice | Surgical resection if fit [^111pttvV] [^113fRG8n] |
| Worrisome features | - Cyst ≥ 3 cm <br/> - Non-enhancing mural nodule <br/> - Main duct 5–9 mm <br/> - Thickened cyst wall <br/> - Abrupt duct change with atrophy <br/> - Lymphadenopathy | EUS ± FNA; consider surgery if high-risk features on EUS [^114wBdTL] [^111pttvV] |
| Low-risk | - No high-risk or worrisome features | Surveillance with MRI or EUS [^111pttvV] [^114jnoEy] |

---

## Surveillance protocols

Surveillance intervals are based on **cyst size** and features:

- **< 1 cm**: MRI every 2–3 years [^113dKJNr].
- **1–2 cm**: MRI every 1–2 years [^114jnoEy].
- **2–3 cm**: MRI every 6–12 months [^111pttvV].
- **> 3 cm or worrisome features**: MRI every 3–6 months; consider EUS.

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgery is indicated when **high-risk stigmata** are present on imaging [^114wBdTL] [^111pttvV]; it is also indicated when **worrisome features** are accompanied by **high-risk EUS findings** [^113323at] [^111pttvV]. Patient factors also influence management; surgery is favored for young, fit individuals or those with a strong preference for resection [^114SW6w3] [^113HCiiY].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Low-risk lesions have a **favorable prognosis** [^112kprPR] and a low risk of progression [^111sjr4k]. High-risk lesions carry a higher progression risk [^111sjr4k], and surgery improves outcomes in appropriate candidates. For low-risk lesions, surveillance is effective [^116A7kmg], balancing cancer risk against operative morbidity [^111sjr4k].

A low-attenuation pancreatic body lesion, likely a side-branch IPMN, **warrants MRI with and without contrast** [^111pttvV] to confirm the diagnosis and risk-stratify [^113fRG8n]. Management is **guided by risk features** [^114wBdTL], with surveillance for low-risk lesions [^114jnoEy] and surgery for high-risk or selected worrisome-feature lesions [^111pttvV].

### ACR appropriateness criteria® pancreatic cyst [^111pttvV]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neoplastic pancreatic cysts, specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, the ACR 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining the following investigations for the initial evaluation of patients with incidentally detected main pancreatic duct dilation greater than 7 mm in size with suspected main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm:

- **EUS**: Endoscopic ultrasonography should be performed.
- **Abdominal MRI**: This should be done without and with IV contrast in conjunction with MRCP (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography).
- **Abdominal MRI without IV contrast**: Conducted with MRCP to aid in diagnosis.

### Cystic pancreatic lesions: MR imaging findings and management [^113HCiiY]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

All patients "fit for surgery" with high-risk stigmata should undergo surgery. Young patients fit for surgery with worrisome features should also undergo resection, due to their long life expectancy and higher cumulative risk of malignant progression of IPMN or de novo development of PDAC.

Patients fit for surgery without high-risk stigmata or worrisome features should undergo surveillance both for early detection of malignant progression of IPMN and for early detection of concomitant PDAC. Surveillance for PDAC is needed also in patients who have undergone resection, even for noninvasive IPMN.

The interval and period of surveillance are still controversial. IAP guidelines recommend intervals stratified by the cyst size, which can be lengthened after two years of stability. Other guidelines recommend discontinuation after two years [American College of Radiology, 2010] or five years [American Gastroenterology Association, 2015] of stability because, according to the authors, the small risk of malignant progression in stable cysts is outweighed by the costs of surveillance. However, according to Tanaka, discontinuing or lengthening surveillance may be dangerous because of the long-lasting risk of concomitant PDAC in patients with IPMN, and even a six-month interval might be insufficient for an early diagnosis of PDAC. In particular, patients with IPMN or patients who have been resected for IPMN need follow-up not only to detect early malignant degeneration of IPMN but also to detect early concomitant PDAC, synchronous or metachronous.

### Cystic pancreatic lesions: MR imaging findings and management [^115ugYsq]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Segmental MD-IPMN is identified through MRCP, showing a segmental dilatation of the MPD in the body of the pancreas. The MPD upstream displays symptoms of chronic obstructive pancreatitis, characterized by finger-like dilatation of branch ducts; however, the pancreatic gland thickness remains normal. After 20 months, the upstream MPD dilatation is no longer visible, due to atrophy of the pancreatic gland.

- **Evolution of a mixed MD-IPMN**: At T2-weighted imaging and MRCP, there is a dilatation of a branch duct in the tail of the pancreas, along with a slight enlargement of the MPD in the tail. Five years later, a diffuse dilatation of the MPD is observed. Mixed-type IPMN is characterized by a segmental or diffuse dilatation of the MPD and branch ducts. However, BD-IPMN can cause MPD dilatation due to mucin overproduction, which may simulate mixed-type IPMN but doesn't involve the MPD itself.

BD-IPMN presents as unifocal or multifocal cystic lesions that communicate with the MPD. These cysts, which can be unilocular or multilocular, range from a few millimeters to some centimeters in diameter, often forming grape-like clusters separated by thin septa that typically enhance post-contrast administration. Confirming communication with the MPD is crucial for diagnosing BD-IPMN, making high-quality MRCP an essential and sensitive sequence of the MRI protocol.

- **Unifocal BD-IPMN**: On T2-weighted and MRCP imaging, a cystic lesion with tiny septa is observed in the head of the pancreas. After paramagnetic contrast media injection, the septa are further evaluated.

### Cystic pancreatic lesions: MR imaging findings and management [^114wBdTL]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

IPMN has heterogeneous malignant potential; therefore, the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP), with the Fukuoka consensus in 2012, proposed two-tier criteria to predict malignancy.

- **Worrisome features**: The first tier consists of "worrisome features", a group of imaging findings suggesting that the lesion is not yet malignant but could evolve into malignant form. Thus, further work-up by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is required to better stratify the lesion risk and ensure strict follow-up.

- **High-risk stigmata**: The second tier consists of "high-risk stigmata", a group of imaging findings suggesting the possibility that the lesion is malignant. Surgical resection is required if the patient is fit.

The 2012 Fukuoka consensus guidelines were widely accepted and had high sensitivity in predicting invasive carcinoma and high-grade dysplasia. However, they had relatively low specificity, resulting in many unnecessary pancreatic resections. Consequently, the revised Fukuoka consensus was proposed in 2017. Nevertheless, this new consensus needs future cohort studies to determine whether the revised criteria can increase specificity without compromising sensitivity.

At the time of writing, the management of IPMN remains controversial. To simplify, according to the 2017 Fukuoka revised consensus, patients with IPMN exhibiting high-risk stigmata should undergo resection if fit, those with worrisome features require further workup, and patients with IPMN without worrisome features need careful monitoring.

### European evidence-based guidelines on pancreatic cystic neoplasms [^114SW6w3]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

- **Imaging modality for the follow-up of IPMN**: MRI is the preferred imaging modality for the follow-up of IPMN. EUS can be used in selected cases (GRADE 1B, strong agreement). See section 3 for details.

- **Progress monitoring of IPMN**: The risk of IPMN progression increases over time; therefore, patients affected by IPMN without an indication for surgery should be followed up until they are no longer fit for surgery (GRADE 1B, strong agreement). The risk of progression of IPMN increases over time as does the risk of developing indications for surgical resection. Interruption of surveillance is not recommended if the patient is fit for potential surgical resection. A single study on IPMN concluded that patients with a Charlson-age comorbidity index ≥ 7 have an 11-fold risk of comorbidity-related death within 3 years, and only 6% of patients will die from malignant IPMN.

- **Screening for other tumors in patients with IPMN**: The incidence of new extra-pancreatic neoplasms during the follow-up evaluation of pancreatic IPMN is not significantly greater than in the general population. Comprehensive screening outside the national protocols might not be necessary. Patients with IPMN are at risk of developing pancreatic cancer, and attention should be paid to its concomitant development even when an IPMN has been successfully resected (GRADE 1C, strong agreement). A systematic review concluded that the available data remain inconclusive.

### Branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN): Are cyst volumetry and other novel imaging features able to improve malignancy prediction compared to well-established resection criteria [^112CZgxg]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Guidelines base the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) on several well-established resection criteria (RC), including cyst size. However, malignancy may occur in small cysts. Since branch-duct (BD) IPMN are not perfect spheres, volumetric and morphologic analysis might better correlate with mucin production and grade of dysplasia. Nonetheless, their role in malignancy (high-grade dysplasia/invasive cancer) prediction has been poorly investigated. Previous studies evaluating RC also included patients with solid-mass-forming pancreatic cancer (PC), which may affect the RC yield. This study aimed to assess the role of volume, morphology, and other well-established RC in malignancy prediction in patients with BD- and mixed-type IPMN after excluding solid masses.

- **Methods**: Retrospective ethical review-board-approved study of 106 patients (2008–2019) with a histopathological diagnosis of BD- and mixed-type IPMN (without solid masses) and preoperative MRI available. Standard imaging and clinical features were collected, and the novel imaging features cyst-volume and elongation value [EV = 1 − (width/length)] calculated on T2-weighted images. Logistic regression analysis was performed. Statistical significance set at two-tails, p < 0.05.

### Incidental cystic neoplasms of pancreas: What is the optimal interval of imaging surveillance [^1151eJNr]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

The optimal interval of imaging studies for the surveillance of incidental pancreatic cystic neoplasms is not known.

- **Objective**: A retrospective analysis of longitudinal medical records of patients with pancreatic cystic neoplasms was performed. The aim was to examine the natural history of incidentally detected cystic pancreatic neoplasms concerning the development of significant growth and to identify predictors of such growth.

- **Results**: After excluding patients with small (< 10 mm) cysts (N = 144), those with inadequate clinical follow-up of less than 6 months (N = 79), and those with a clinical diagnosis of pancreatic pseudocysts, serous cystadenoma, main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (N = 29), and neuroendocrine tumor (N = 3), a total of 166 cysts in 150 patients were available for analysis. The working diagnoses on these cysts, based on clinical, radiological features, aspiration cytology, cyst fluid analysis, and surgical pathology data when available, were mucinous cystic neoplasm in 117 and branch-type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm in 49. The mean standard error (SE) initial size of these cysts was 2 (0.1) cm. Over a median follow-up period of 32 (IQR [interquartile range] 19–48) months, 89% of the cysts did not show significant growth during the follow-up. In a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, the initial size of the cystic lesion was an independent predictor of significant growth during follow-up (relative risk 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08–1.61, P = 0.01); the only other significant variable was the presence of intracys.

### Cyst features and risk of malignancy in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas: a meta-analysis [^116nSpm8]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

International guidelines for the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas recommend surgical resection of those with specific characteristics. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the risk of malignancy associated with each of these features of IPMNs.

We conducted a comprehensive search of MEDLINE from January 1, 1996, to November 11, 2011, for studies that included any features mentioned in the consensus guidelines for surgical resection of main duct and branch duct IPMNs. Data were analyzed from 41 studies for the following features: cyst size greater than 3 cm, the presence of mural nodules, dilated main pancreatic duct, symptoms, and main duct versus branch duct IPMNs. Malignant IPMNs were defined as those with carcinoma in situ or more advanced histology. A separate meta-analysis was performed for each risk factor to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs). A random-effects model was used, based on the assumption of variation among study populations.

The risks of malignancy associated with individual cyst features were as follows: cyst size greater than 3 cm (OR, 62.4; 95% confidence interval, 30.8–126.3), presence of a mural nodule (OR, 9.3; 95% CI, 5.3–16.1), dilatation of the main pancreatic duct (OR, 7.27; 95% CI, 3.0–17.4), and main versus branch duct IPMN (OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 3.3–6.9). There was a moderate level of heterogeneity among studies (I^2 range, 34–67).

Based on a meta-analysis, cyst features proposed by the international guidelines for resection of IPMN were identified as significant risk factors for malignancy.

### Survival analysis and risk for progression of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia of the pancreas (IPMN) under surveillance: A single-institution experience [^113DGv8E]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas is a disease with a high prevalence. It is estimated that the prevalence of pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs) in the general population is approximately 20–30%, and half of these are IPMNs. While it is recognized that IPMNs can progress to cancer, the high prevalence of IPMNs and the low incidence of pancreatic cancer (PC) in the general population indicate that only a minority of IPMNs progress to invasive carcinoma.

Considering that IPMN of the pancreas was defined by the World Health Organization only as recently as in 1996, there is a lack of information regarding the natural history of these neoplasms, particularly concerning long-term prognosis. Published data show that the risk for cancer differs according to the epithelial type of IPMN and is higher in IPMNs affecting the main pancreatic duct, either in isolation or combined with branch duct involvement (main-duct or mixed-type IPMNs, respectively). For this reason, guidelines recommend surgical resection for all IPMNs with involvement of the main pancreatic duct, provided the patient is fit for surgery.

In contrast, the risk for cancer is significantly lower for IPMNs that are limited to branch ducts (branch-duct IPMN); therefore, surgical resection is considered to be an indication in only a minority of patients with branch-duct IPMN. However, because it is currently not possible to predict which of the IPMNs that do not require surgical resection will progress to cancer, a large proportion of patients require life-long follow-up.

### The landmark series: Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas-from prevalence to early cancer detection [^11138usP]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Low credibility.

Guidelines for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) management were defined in the 2015 American Gastroenterological Association Guideline on the Diagnosis and Management of Asymptomatic Neoplastic Pancreatic Cysts. These guidelines were established by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) for the diagnosis and management of asymptomatic PCNs (Table 1). The AGA guidelines only address asymptomatic cysts and do not evaluate the impact of symptoms on the management of these cysts.

The AGA guidelines were established following a systematic evaluation of the relevant evidence on the management of these pancreatic cysts. An expert consensus was acquired on clinically relevant questions regarding diagnosis and management. The conclusions of the systematic reviews are reported in the AGA's technical review and were used by the AGA's Clinical Practice Guideline Committee as the basis for the formal guidelines. Specifically, the recommendations use the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Notably, the committee graded all the evidence related to the management of pancreatic cysts to be very low in quality because most of the data were collected from case series. Thus, all their statements were considered conditional and dependent on each patient's situation.

### The landmark series: Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas-from prevalence to early cancer detection [^113fRG8n]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

For non-operative surveillance, all three sets of guidelines state that MRI is the preferred modality over CT because MRI does not expose patients to radiation and is better able to confirm the structural relationship between the cyst and pancreatic duct.

At baseline, the revised Fukuoka guidelines suggest that BD-IPMN patients without high-risk stigmata or worrisome features (greater than 3 cm, enhancing mural nodularity or cyst wall, main duct dilation, stricture, lymphadenopathy, elevated CA19–9, significant growth rate, jaundice, or symptoms) undergo short interval (3–6 months) pancreatic MRI/MRCP or CT to confirm stability. However, unlike the European and AGA guidelines, the revised Fukuoka guidelines provide recommendations on subsequent surveillance according to cyst size.

- **European guidelines**: For patients without an indication for immediate resection, the European guidelines recommend a 6-month follow-up the first year, with subsequent annual follow-ups as long as no risk factors are present that would prompt surgery. In addition, in patients with only relative indications for resection, older patients, and those with severe comorbidity, continual 6-month follow-up is suggested.

- **AGA guidelines**: In cases where there are no indications for resection, the AGA guidelines recommend that patients with cysts less than 3 cm without a solid component or dilated pancreatic duct receive MRI surveillance in 1 year, followed by every 2 years, for a total period of 5 years if there are no changes in size or characteristics.

### Do consensus indications for resection in branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm predict malignancy? A study of 147 patients [^113323at]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Recent consensus guidelines suggest that the presence of one or more of the following is an indication for resection (IR) of branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN-Br): cyst-related symptoms, a main pancreatic duct diameter of 10 mm or more, cyst size of 30 mm or more, intramural nodules, or cyst fluid cytology suspicious or positive for malignancy. Among a cohort of patients with IPMN-Br, we determined if the consensus IR (CIR), presence of multifocal IPMN-Br, or growth of cyst size on follow-up predicts malignancy.

- **Methods**: We identified 147 patients with IPMN-Br, of whom 66 underwent surgical resection at diagnosis and 81 were followed conservatively, with 11 resected during follow-up. Clinical, imaging, histological, and cyst fluid characteristics from all 147 patients with IPMN-Br were obtained from clinical records and/or by contacting the patients. In all cases, the presence of CIR at baseline and during follow-up (N = 66), presence of multifocal cysts (N = 57), and increase in cyst size (N = 38) were noted.

- **Results**: Among the 77 resected IPMN-Brs, at initial evaluation, 61 had at least one CIR and 16 had none. Malignancy was present in 9 out of 61 (15%) with CIR and 0 out of 16 without IR (P = 0.1). When the presence of any one CIR was taken as an indicator of malignancy, the CIR had a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 100%, 23%, 14%, and 100%, respectively. The prevalence of malignancy in those with single versus multifocal IPMN-Br was similar (13% vs. 11%). No patient developed malignancy following a median follow-up.

### Assessment of a revised management strategy for patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms involving the main pancreatic duct [^117D64pF]. JAMA Surgery (2017). High credibility.

According to the 2012 International Consensus Guidelines, the diagnostic criterion of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) involving the main duct (MD IPMNs) or the main and branch ducts (mixed IPMNs) of the pancreatic system is a main pancreatic duct (MPD) diameter of 5.0 mm or greater on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, surgical resection is recommended for patients with an MPD diameter of 10.0 mm or greater, which is characterized as a high-risk stigma. An MPD diameter of 5.0 to 9.0 mm is not an indication for immediate resection.

- **Objectives**: To determine an appropriate cutoff (i.e. one with high sensitivity and negative predictive value) of the MPD diameter on CT or MRI as a prognostic factor for malignant disease and to propose a new management algorithm for patients with MD or mixed IPMNs.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This retrospective cohort study included 103 patients who underwent surgical resection for a preoperative diagnosis of MD or mixed IPMN and in whom IPMN was confirmed by surgical pathologic findings at a single institution from July 1, 1996, to December 31, 2015.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Malignant disease was defined as high-grade dysplasia or invasive adenocarcinoma on results of surgical pathologic evaluation. An appropriate MPD diameter on preoperative CT or MRI to predict malignant disease was determined using a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The prognostic value of the new management algorithm that incorporated the new MPD diameter cutoff was evaluated.

### Cystic pancreatic lesions: MR imaging findings and management [^113ta69W]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Tada et al, in a study on 197 patients with IPMN and other CPLs, observed that this population is "at high risk" of developing a PDAC, with an incidence of pancreatic cancer 22.5 times higher than expected mortality in the general population. Miyasaka et al, in a surveillance study on 195 patients who underwent partial pancreatectomy for IPMN, demonstrated that the risk of malignant progression of IPMN and of developing a PDAC may even rise after 5 years. He J et al, in a study on a surveillance of 130 patients in follow-up after pancreatic resection for IPMN, observed that the risk of developing a new IPMN requiring surgery or PDAC was 0%, 7%, and 38% at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively.

Thus, all patients with IPMN who are fit for treatment, even those who have been resected for a noninvasive IPMN, require indefinite surveillance, which should be stopped only when the patient becomes unfit for surgery. The interval of follow-up is still a matter of discussion; however, it should be kept in mind that a long (more than 1 year) interval is dangerous, as after such a long follow-up, a new appearing lesion could already be unresectable at diagnosis.

While follow-up strategies for early detection of malignant degeneration of IPMN are well established on the basis of dimensional criteria, there are no screening criteria for early detection of concomitant PDAC yet. Different studies have demonstrated that IPMN is a major risk factor for PDAC, with a 1% annual prevalence of concomitance with IPMN. However, some patients with IPMN have an even higher risk of developing PDAC, particularly those with specific risk factors.

### Progression of unresected intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas to cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111sjr4k]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

The management of patients with low-risk intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas remains unclear due to limited knowledge about their progression to cancer. This study aims to determine the cumulative incidence of pancreatic cancer development in individuals with unresected IPMNs, particularly those considered low-risk.

A systematic search was conducted in the MEDLINE and Embase databases up to November 30, 2016, focusing on studies that reported the cumulative incidence of pancreatic cancer in patients with unresected IPMNs. Studies providing sufficient data to calculate cumulative incidence values were included. Patient series were categorized as studies on low-risk IPMNs (lesions without main pancreatic duct involvement or mural nodules) and non-low-risk IPMNs. Meta-analytic cumulative incidence values for pancreatic cancer at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years of follow-up were calculated using the inverse variance method and random-effects model.

Among 1514 articles screened, 10 studies of low-risk IPMNs (n = 2411) and 9 studies of non-low-risk IPMNs (n = 825) were identified. For low-risk IPMNs, the meta-analytic cumulative incidence values for pancreatic cancer were found to be 0.02% at 1 year (95% confidence interval, 0.0%-0.23%; I² = 0.0%), 1.40% at 3 years (95% CI, 0.58%-2.48%; I² = 58.5%), 3.12% at 5 years (95% CI, 1.12%-5.90%; I² = 88.0%), and 7.77% at 10 years (95% CI, 4.09%-12.39%; I² = 79.8%). These values were significantly higher in studies of non-low-risk IPMNs, with a 1-year cumulative incidence value for pancreatic cancer of 1.95%.

### Management of incidental pancreatic cysts: A white paper of the ACR incidental findings committee [^113dKJNr]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The ACR Incidental Findings Committee (IFC) presents recommendations for managing pancreatic cysts that are incidentally detected on CT or MRI. These recommendations represent an update from the pancreatic component of the JACR 2010 white paper on managing incidental findings in the adrenal glands, kidneys, liver, and pancreas. The Pancreas Subcommittee, which included abdominal radiologists, a gastroenterologist, and a pancreatic surgeon, developed this algorithm.

The recommendations draw from published evidence and expert opinion and were finalized by informal iterative consensus. Algorithm branches successively categorize pancreatic cysts based on patient characteristics and imaging features. They terminate with an ascertainment of benignity and/or indolence (sufficient to discontinue follow-up), or a management recommendation. The algorithm addresses most, but not all, pathologies and clinical scenarios. Our goal is to improve quality of care by providing guidance on how to manage incidentally detected pancreatic cysts.

### Branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN): Are cyst volumetry and other novel imaging features able to improve malignancy prediction compared to well-established resection criteria [^1153WvCm]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Guidelines base the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) on several well-established resection criteria (RC), including cyst size. However, malignancy may occur in small cysts. Since branch-duct (BD) IPMN are not perfect spheres, volumetric and morphologic analysis might better correlate with mucin production and grade of dysplasia. Nonetheless, their role in malignancy (high-grade dysplasia/invasive cancer) prediction has been poorly investigated. Previous studies evaluating RC also included patients with solid-mass-forming pancreatic cancer (PC), which may affect the RC yield. This study aimed to assess the role of volume, morphology, and other well-established RC in malignancy prediction in patients with BD- and mixed-type IPMN after excluding solid masses.

A retrospective, ethical review-board-approved study involved 106 patients (2008–2019) with a histopathological diagnosis of BD- and mixed-type IPMN (without solid masses) and preoperative MRI available. Standard imaging and clinical features were collected. Novel imaging features such as cyst volume and elongation value (EV = 1 - [width/length]) were calculated on T2-weighted images. Logistic regression analysis was performed, with statistical significance set at two-tails, p < 0.05.

### Active surveillance beyond 5 years is required for presumed branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms undergoing non-operative management [^115y9hv3]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

To evaluate the results of active surveillance beyond 5 years in patients with branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (BD-IPMNs) without worrisome features (WF) and high-risk stigmata (HRS) undergoing non-operative management, patients with a minimum follow-up of 5 years who underwent surveillance with at least yearly magnetic resonance imaging were included. New onset and predictors of WF/HRS during follow-up as well as long-term survival were analyzed.

In all, 144 patients were followed for a median of 84 months. At diagnosis, multifocal BD-IPMNs were found in 53% of cases, and the mean size of the largest cyst was 15.5 mm. Changes during follow-up were observed in 69 patients (48%). New onset of WF/HRS was observed in 26 patients (18%), but the rate of HRS was only 4%. WF and HRS developed following a median follow-up of 71 and 77.5 months from diagnosis, respectively, and without previous changes in 19 of the 26 patients. Independent predictors of WF/HRS development were size at diagnosis greater than 15 mm, an increase in the number of lesions, main pancreatic duct growth rate ≥ 0.2 mm/year, and cyst growth rate > 1 mm/year. Overall, the rate of pancreatic invasive malignancy was 2%, and the 12-year disease-specific survival was 98.6%.

Long-term non-operative management is safe for BD-IPMNs without WF and HRS. Discontinuation of surveillance cannot be recommended since one out of six patients developed WF/HRS far beyond 5 years of surveillance and without previous relevant modifications. An intensification of follow-up should be considered after 5 years.

### Biomarker risk score algorithm and preoperative stratification of patients with pancreatic cystic lesions [^11355Bjz]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2021). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cysts are incidentally detected in up to 13% of patients undergoing radiographic imaging. Of the most frequently encountered types, mucin-producing (mucinous) pancreatic cystic lesions may develop into pancreatic cancer, while nonmucinous ones have little or no malignant potential. Accurate preoperative diagnosis is critical for optimal management but has been difficult to achieve, resulting in unnecessary major surgery. Here, we aim to develop an algorithm based on biomarker risk scores to improve risk stratification.

- **Study design**: Patients undergoing surgery and/or surveillance for a pancreatic cystic lesion, with diagnostic imaging and banked pancreatic cyst fluid, were enrolled in the study after informed consent (n = 163 surgical, 67 surveillance). Cyst fluid biomarkers with high specificity for distinguishing nonmucinous from mucinous pancreatic cysts (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], glucose, carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], amylase, cytology, and DNA mutation) were selected. Biomarker risk scores were used to design an algorithm to predict preoperative diagnosis. Performance was tested using surgical (retrospective) and surveillance (prospective) cohorts.

- **Results**: In the surgical cohort, the biomarker algorithm outperformed the preoperative clinical diagnosis in correctly predicting the final pathologic diagnosis (91% vs. 73%; p < 0.000001). Specifically, nonmucinous serous cystic neoplasms (SCN) and mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN) were correctly classified more frequently by the algorithm than clinical diagnosis (96% vs. 30%; p < 0).

### Natural history of branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with mural nodules: A Japan Pancreas Society multicenter study [^112MaaVV]. Pancreas (2014). Low credibility.

A diagnosis of IPMN was made by imaging when a dilated MPD or a cystically dilated branch duct was recognized in association with the secretion of mucin from the major or minor papilla or mobile filling defects in the pancreatic duct on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP); or when multilocular cystic lesions were recognized on EUS, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), and/or CT. Branch duct IPMN was defined as a condition in which the main lesion was a cystically dilated branch duct with an MPD diameter of less than 10 mm. The size of the dilated branch duct was measured en bloc in patients with multilocular cysts. The presence or absence of MNs in cystic branches was determined based on morphological features on EUS at the initial diagnosis.

Color Doppler imaging or contrast-enhanced EUS was not applied in most cases because of the dominant use of a mechanical radial scanner. The change in the height of MNs was assessed essentially by follow-up EUS at registration, as available. In patients who underwent surgery after follow-up, the diagnosis of IPMN was confirmed histologically. Pathologic results were determined by the World Health Organization criteria published in 2010; these are as follows: low-grade dysplasia ("intraductal papillary mucinous adenoma"), intermediate-grade dysplasia ("IPMN with moderate dysplasia"), high-grade dysplasia ("intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma, noninvasive", "carcinoma in situ"), and PDAC. The highest pathologic grade was adapted when there were multifocal lesions.

### Small (Sendai negative) branch-duct IPMNs: not harmless [^115pZFye]. Annals of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate existing management guidelines for branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs).

According to treatment guidelines, specifically the Sendai criteria, patients with asymptomatic branch-duct type IPMNs of the pancreas less than 3 cm in diameter without suspicious features in preoperative imaging should undergo conservative treatment with yearly follow-up examinations. Nevertheless, the risk of harboring malignancy or invasive cancer remains a significant concern.

All patients who underwent surgical resection for branch-duct IPMNs between January 2004 and July 2010 at the University Clinic of Heidelberg were analyzed. Clinical characteristics of the patients and preoperative imaging were examined with regard to the size of the lesions, presence of mural nodules, thickening of the wall, dilation of the main pancreatic duct, and tumor markers. Results were correlated with histopathological features and were discussed in the context of the literature.

Among a total of 287 consecutively resected IPMNs, 123 branch-duct IPMNs were identified through the analysis of preoperative imaging. Of these, 69 branch-duct IPMNs were less than 3 cm in size, without mural nodules, thickening of the wall, or other features characteristic of malignancy, referred to as "Sendai negative". Of all the Sendai negative branch-duct IPMNs, 24.6% (17/69) showed malignant features (invasive carcinoma or carcinoma in situ) upon histological examination of the surgical specimens.

Although many branch-duct IPMNs are small and asymptomatic, a significant proportion still demonstrate malignant features, underscoring the need for careful management and possibly a re-evaluation of the guidelines.

### Branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN): Are cyst volumetry and other novel imaging features able to improve malignancy prediction compared to well-established resection criteria [^114p9Gtg]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Imaging analysis**: The pancreatic MRI closest to the date of surgery was chosen for analysis. Since our institution is a tertiary high-volume center, some patients were referred for evaluation for surgery with outside MRI examinations using MR equipment from different vendors, sequences, and technical parameters. Therefore, an institutional standard protocol for preoperative MRI was not available for this study. The minimum criteria for including a non-institutional MRI were: (1) magnetic field strength ≥ 1.5 T; (2) availability of an axial and coronal T2-weighted sequence acquired with the single-shot technique (HASTE, Single-Shot Fast Spin Echo or Single-Shot Turbo Spin Echo) or multi-shot PROPELLER technique; and (3) slice thickness and interslice gap not larger than 6 mm and 20%, respectively.

All MR images were evaluated on a picture archiving and communication system (Sectra Workstation, IDS7 version 23.1, Sectra AB) by two radiologists in consensus reading (R.P.M. and N.K. with 15 and 12 years of post-residency experience in abdominal imaging, respectively). One cyst per patient was chosen for analysis (the largest or the one with the most suspicion for malignancy appearance based on guidelines at the time of surgery). The collected imaging parameters are listed in the now-removed Table 1.

- **Clinical features**: From each patient's electronic medical record, the following clinical parameters were collected: age at surgery, gender, and presentation.

### Is it necessary to follow patients after resection of a benign pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm [^114SWqr1]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

Little is known about the risk of subsequently developing a new or progressive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) after partial pancreatic resection of a noninvasive IPMN.

- **Study design**: One hundred thirty patients with more than 1 year of follow-up after resection were included in this analysis.

- **Results**: At a median follow-up of 38 months, 22 (17%) developed imaging evidence of a new or progressive IPMN. Eleven (8%) underwent completion resection. Three of these 11 patients had invasive adenocarcinoma. Two other patients developed metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma and did not undergo resection. All five patients (4%) with cancer had negative margins at the initial operation. Sixteen of 100 patients (16%) with negative margins for IPMN at the initial operation developed a new IPMN, versus six of 30 patients (20%) with margins positive for IPMN (p = ns). Five of 22 patients (23%) with a new IPMN had a family history of pancreatic cancer, while eight of 108 patients (7%) without a new IPMN had a family history (p < 0.05). Overall, the chances of developing a new IPMN at 1, 5, and 10 years after the initial surgery were 4%, 25%, and 62%, respectively, and of requiring surgery were 1.6%, 14%, and 18%, respectively. The estimated chances of developing invasive pancreatic cancer were 0%, 7%, and 38% at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Patients who have undergone resection for noninvasive IPMN require indefinite close surveillance because of the risks of developing a new IPMN, of requiring surgery, and of developing cancer.

### Management of branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms: a large single-center study to assess predictors of malignancy and long-term outcomes [^113qwkra]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Management of branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (BD-IPMNs) remains challenging. We determined factors associated with malignancy in BD-IPMNs and long-term outcomes.

- **Methods**: This retrospective cohort study included all patients with established BD-IPMNs by the International Consensus Guidelines (ICG) 2012 and/or pathologically confirmed BD-IPMNs in a tertiary care referral center between 2001 and 2013. Main outcome measures were the association between high-risk stigmata (HRS)/worrisome features (WFs) of the ICG 2012 and malignant BD-IPMNs, performance characteristics of EUS-FNA for the diagnosis of malignant BD-IPMNs, and recurrence and long-term outcomes of BD-IPMN patients undergoing surgery or imaging surveillance.

- **Results**: Of 364 BD-IPMN patients, 229 underwent imaging surveillance and 135 underwent surgery. Among the 135 resected BD-IPMNs, HRS/WFs on CT/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were similar between the benign and malignant groups, but main pancreatic duct (MPD) dilation (5–9 mm) was more frequently identified in malignant lesions. On EUS-FNA, mural nodules, MPD features suspicious for involvement, and suspicious/positive malignant cytology were more frequently detected in the malignant group with a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 33%, 94%, and 86%; 42%, 91%, and 83%; and 33%, 91%, and 82%, respectively. Mural nodules identified by EUS were missed by CT/MRI in 28% in the malignant group. Patients with malignant lesions had a higher risk of any IPMN recurrence during a mean follow-up period of 131 months (P = .0).

### Management of branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas: Observation with MR imaging [^114riHFZ]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2010). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of conservative management by observation with MRI of patients with branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (BD-IPMNs).

Materials and methods: Twenty-three consecutive patients, who were followed up by MRI with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) over a period of more than nine months after initial MRI examinations, were enrolled in this study. On MRI, the number of lesions, the maximum diameter of BD-IPMNs, lesion location, the presence of associated dilatation of the main pancreatic duct (MPD), the presence of enhancing mural nodules within the lesion, and the presence of interval change were retrospectively reviewed on initial and follow-up MR images in consensus by two radiologists. All patients were evaluated to search for evidence of malignant progression of the disease.

Results: The follow-up period ranged from 10 to 96 months (mean, 37 months). On initial MRI with MRCP, a total of 39 lesions were found in 23 patients. The maximum diameter of BD-IPMNs ranged between 6 and 32 mm, with a mean of 12 mm. Thirty-four lesions (87%) in 19 patients remained unchanged in maximum diameter. Five lesions (13%) in four patients showed an increase in maximum diameter. Enhancing mural nodules were not found in any individual on either the initial MRI study or the follow-up studies. There was no patient who had evidence of local aggressive growth of the tumor or evidence of metastases to distant sites.

Conclusion: Our study suggests that branch-duct IPMNs without enhancing mural nodules are essentially benign.

### Management of incidental pancreatic cystic lesions: Integrating novel diagnostic and prognostic factors with current clinical guidelines [^112X4QMK]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Owing to increased detection rates, the diagnosis and management of incidental pancreatic cysts have become a common predicament. Up to 13% of patients undergoing cross-sectional imaging studies for other indications are found to have pancreatic cystic lesions. Although most cystic lesions are benign, the malignant potential of several types of pancreatic cysts makes accurate classification vital to directing therapy. Advances in the last decade have led to better characterization of pancreatic cyst morphology and have enhanced the ability to predict underlying histopathology and biological behavior.

Although accurate classification remains a challenge, the utilization of complementary diagnostic tools is the optimal approach to dictate management. The following review includes a description of pancreatic cysts, a critical review of emerging diagnostic techniques, and a review of recent guidelines in the management of incidental pancreatic cysts.

### Optimal surveillance interval of branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas [^116A7kmg]. JAMA Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Despite the increasing prevalence of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), data on the growth and malignant conversion rates based on long-term surveillance cohorts are limited. Many international guidelines recommend surveillance for benign lesions, but the optimal interval and duration are unclear.

The objective of this study was to determine the optimal surveillance protocol for IPMN and propose which patients may be exempted from surveillance. This large-scale, international cohort study examined the data of 3,825 patients with IPMN treated at five tertiary pancreatic centers. Patients included had branch duct (BD) IPMN and underwent either surveillance or surgery between January 1, 1988, and December 31, 2020. After a thorough review, 3,656 patients were included in the analytic sample. Changes in cyst size, worrisome features or high-risk stigmata, and malignant conversion rates were assessed. Patients who underwent surveillance for more than five years were evaluated to suggest discontinuation of the surveillance protocol. Clinical data collection began on January 1, 2021, and the mean (SD) follow-up duration was 84 (47.7) months. The data analysis was performed from May 2, 2022, through September 14, 2022.

The patients with BD-IPMN were followed up based on International Association of Pancreatology guidelines. Patients with suspicious malignant neoplasms during surveillance underwent surgical resection.

The main outcome of this study was the optimal follow-up interval and duration of BD-IPMN surveillance.

### Evaluation of the guidelines for management of pancreatic branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm [^114NK3HM]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

The 2006 Sendai Consensus Guidelines recommend surgical resection for all suspected branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (BD-IPMN) greater than 3 cm irrespective of symptoms, and those less than 3 cm with worrisome features. We aimed to evaluate the surgical characteristics of these guidelines retrospectively in pathologically confirmed cases of BD-IPMN.

- **Methods**: IPMNs resected at our institution (1995–2006) were classified as main-duct predominant or branch-duct (BD) predominant based on preoperative imaging and postoperative histology. Resected BD-IPMNs were classified histologically as low risk (adenoma, borderline) and high risk (carcinoma in situ or invasive cancer). Clinical data (presence of symptoms, mural nodule, dilated pancreatic duct, and cyst size) were correlated with pathology.

- **Results**: Between 1995 and 2006, there were 204 patients who underwent surgical resection of pancreatic cysts. Sixty-one patients had IPMN, including 31 with BD-IPMN. A total of 74.2% (23 of 31) of BD-IPMNs would have been recommended for surgical resection, including 69.2% (18 of 26) of low-risk lesions and 100% (5 of 5) of high-risk lesions. All 8 cases of BD-IPMN that would have been recommended for nonsurgical management were low-risk lesions. The positive predictive value of the guidelines is 21.7% (95% confidence interval, 9.7%-41.9%) and the negative predictive value is 100% (95% confidence interval, 67.6%-100.0%). Between 2000 and 2007, 351 patients with likely BD-IPMN were evaluated but not resected.

- **Conclusions**: Implementation of the Consensus Guidelines' recommendations was evaluated to determine their effectiveness in managing BD-IPMN.

### European evidence-based guidelines on pancreatic cystic neoplasms [^114S5ykm]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Should mixed-type (MT)-IPMN be managed in a similar manner to MD-IPMN? MT-IPMN carries a risk of malignant transformation that is comparable to MD-IPMN, and resection is therefore advised in patients who are fit for surgery (GRADE 2C, strong agreement).

Few studies have investigated MT-IPMN as a single entity. Malignancy rates appear similar for MT-IPMN and MD-IPMN. Recently, a pathological classification distinguishing minimal (microscopic) and extensive (macroscopic) involvement of the MPD showed a significant difference in the risk of high-grade dysplasia or cancer (17% and 70%, respectively). However, this classification can be used only after resection and is thus irrelevant for clinical assessment before surgery.

What type of resection is indicated when the entire MPD is dilated on imaging? Pancreatoduodenectomy with frozen section analysis of the resection margins is recommended for patients with MPD dilatation comprising the entire length of the pancreas (GRADE 2C, strong agreement). In cases in which there is a mural nodule within the MPD further along the duct, or in patients with an increased risk for malignancy (i.e. patients with familial pancreatic cancer), a total pancreatectomy can be considered (GRADE 2C, strong agreement).

It is important to assess the MPD for a mural nodule before surgical exploration (see sections 2 and 3 for details). There are conflicting data and opinions about the extent of surgery for MD-IPMN. Some authors advocate total pancreatectomy in every patient affected by MD-IPMN with radiological involvement of the entire MPD.

- **Group 2: Patients under surveillance due to general contraindications for surgery**: Forty-nine patients with an IPMN that fulfilled the criteria for surgical resection according to the guidelines, but who were not fit for surgery or objected to surgery, were followed up during the study period. The median patient age was 75.1 years (range 50–93 years). Twenty-seven (55.1%) were males and 22 (44.9%) females. The median follow-up time was 775 days (range 90–2190 days).

The tumor features that represented a surgical indication were main-duct IPMN in 13 patients (26.5%), mixed-type IPMN in 27 (55.1%), branch-duct IPMN with a diameter > 40 mm in 6 (12.3%), and branch-duct IPMN with worrisome radiological features in 3 (6.1%). The 1-, 5-, and 10-year overall survival rates for these patients were 74.8%, 40.6%, and 40.6%, respectively. The IPMN-specific 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates were 90.7%, 74.8%, and 74.8%, respectively.

### Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm [^116na1zK]. Human Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is a grossly visible (≥ 1 cm), mucin-producing neoplasm that arises in the main pancreatic duct and/or its branches. Patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm can present with symptoms caused by obstruction of the pancreatic duct system, or they can be asymptomatic. There are three clinical subtypes of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm: main duct, branch duct, and mixed.

Five histologic types of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm are recognized:

- **Gastric foveolar type**: A type characterized by specific histologic features.
- **Intestinal type**: Similar to intestinal mucosa in appearance.
- **Pancreatobiliary type**: Resembling pancreatobiliary duct epithelium.
- **Intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasm**: Noted for oncocytic cells.
- **Intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm**: Features tubulopapillary architecture.

Noninvasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms are classified into three grades based on the degree of cytoarchitectural atypia: low-, intermediate-, and high-grade dysplasia. The most important prognostic factor, however, is the presence or absence of an associated invasive carcinoma. Some main duct-intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms progress into invasive carcinoma, mainly tubular adenocarcinoma (conventional pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma) and colloid carcinoma. Branch duct-intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms have a low risk for malignant transformation.

Preoperative prediction of the malignant potential of an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm is of growing importance because pancreatic surgery has its complications, and many small intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, especially branch duct-intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, have an extremely low risk of progressing to an invasive cancer.

### Should patients with cystic lesions of the pancreas undergo long-term radiographic surveillance? Results of 3024 patients evaluated at a single institution [^114D8EVL]. Annals of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

In 2015, the American Gastroenterological Association recommended the discontinuation of radiographic surveillance after 5 years for patients with stable pancreatic cysts. The study evaluated the yield of continued surveillance of pancreatic cysts up to and after 5 years of follow-up.

A prospectively maintained registry of patients evaluated for pancreatic cysts was queried (1995–2016). Patients who initially underwent radiographic surveillance were divided into those with a ≥ 5 mm increase in diameter. Analyses of cross-over to resection and development of carcinoma were performed.

A total of 3024 patients were identified, with 2472 (82%) undergoing initial surveillance. The ≥ 5 year group (n = 596) experienced a greater frequency of cyst growth (44% vs. 20%; P < 0.0001), a lower rate of cross-over to resection (8% vs. 11%; P = 0.02), and a similar frequency of progression to carcinoma (2% vs. 3%; P = 0.07) compared with the < 5 year group (n = 1876). Within the ≥ 5 year group, 412 patients (69%) had demonstrated radiographic stability at the 5-year time point. This subgroup, when compared with the < 5 year group, experienced similar rates of cyst growth (19% vs. 20%; P = 0.95) and lower rates of cross-over to resection (5% vs. 11%; P < 0.0001) and development of carcinoma (1% vs. 3%; P = 0.008).

The observed rate of developing cancer in the group that was stable at the 5-year time point was 31.3 per 100,000 per year, whereas the expected national age-adjusted incidence rate for this population was omitted from the text.

### Cystic lesions of the pancreas [^113RKXmA]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Recent publications, such as the Fukuoka guidelines, provide more specific recommendations for surgical resection and surveillance of mucinous cystic neoplasms and IPMNs. In the study by Lee et al, a new EUS-based scoring system has been proposed for the prediction of malignancy in patients with BDT-IPMN. It has been proposed that patients with cysts 3 cm in size without the presence of mural nodules could be observed.

The American Gastroenterological Association published a technical review on the diagnosis and management of asymptomatic neoplastic pancreatic cysts. The review concluded that for patients with benign-appearing lesions and low-risk features on imaging, surveillance with MRI and EUS, with or without FNA, will allow watchful waiting of a presumed mucinous lesion, including both mucinous cystic neoplasms and branch duct IPMNs. The risks of malignancy should always be weighed against the risks of pancreatic surgery.

Most importantly, the American Gastroenterological Association published a guideline on the diagnosis and management of asymptomatic pancreatic cysts, based on expert opinions and the available literature. According to their recommendations, pancreatic cysts < 3 cm without a solid component or dilated pancreatic ducts should be reevaluated by MRI in 1 year and every 2 years thereafter for a total of 5 years if there is no change in size and other features. In contrast, cysts with two or more high-risk characteristics, such as a dilated main pancreatic duct, require further evaluation.

### Cystic lesions of the pancreas [^115PbMW7]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is characterized by the dilatation of the main pancreatic duct. The differential diagnosis for cystically dilated side branches includes serous cystadenoma or mucinous cystic neoplasm. Sometimes, IPMN can be confused with chronic pancreatitis, but normal-appearing pancreatic parenchyma and the presence of mucus support a diagnosis of IPMN. However, chronic pancreatitis can complicate the course of IPMN due to ductal obstruction from the tumor or mucus. Imaging features suggestive of malignant transformation include large unilocular cystic areas, focal hypoechoic areas, or mural nodules. Aggressive tumors may invade the duodenum, common bile duct, adjacent lymph nodes, vascular structures, and the peripancreatic space.

After an IPMN diagnosis, surgical resection is usually recommended for patients who are good surgical candidates, taking into account comorbidities, age, and IPMN subtype. In 2006, the working group of the International Association of Pancreatology proposed the Sendai Consensus Guidelines for the management of branch duct-type IPMN (BDT-IPMN). These guidelines recommend surgical resection for all BDT-IPMN greater than 3 cm, irrespective of symptoms. They also recommend resection for BDT-IPMNs less than 3 cm that exhibit worrisome features, such as cyst-related symptoms, mural nodules, or a pancreatic duct dilated greater than 6 mm. For presumed BDT-IPMNs less than 3 cm, applying the Consensus Guidelines may reduce the resection rate for low-risk lesions.

### Consequences of a surveillance strategy for side-branch intraductal pancreatic mucinous neoplasms: Long-term follow-up of one thousand cysts [^112kprPR]. Annals of Surgery (2024). High credibility.

To quantify the rate of progression in surveilled cysts and assess what factors should indicate delayed resection, side-branch intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (SB-IPMNs) are increasingly discovered. This makes it challenging to identify which patients require resection, thus avoiding inappropriate treatment. Most incidental lesions are surveyed, yet the consequences of that decision remain uncertain.

A prospectively maintained database of pancreatic cystic neoplasms was queried for patients with SB-IPMN. Patients with ≥ 2 imaging studies > 6 months apart were included. Clinically relevant progression (CR-progression) was defined by symptoms, worrisome/high-risk stigmata, or invasive cancer (IC). Growth ≥ 5 mm in 2 years is considered CR-progression; size ≥ 3 cm alone is not.

Between 1997 and 2023, 1337 patients were diagnosed with SB-IPMN. Thirty-seven (2.7%) underwent up-front surgery; 1000 (75.0%) had > 6 months of surveillance. The rate of CR-progression was 15.3% (n = 153) based on size increase (n = 63, 6.3%), main-duct involvement (n = 48, 4.8%), symptoms (n = 8, 5.0%), or other criteria (n = 34, 3.4%). At a median follow-up of 6.6 years (interquartile range: 3.0–10.26), 17 patients (1.7%) developed IC. Those with CR-progression developed IC in 11.1% (n = 17) and high-grade dysplasia (HGD) in 6.5% (n = 10). Nearly half of the cancers were not contiguous with the surveyed SB-IPMN. Size ≥ 3 cm was not associated with HGD/IC (P = 0.232). HGD/IC was least common in CR-progression determined by size growth (6.3%) versus main-duct involvement.

### Are the current guidelines for the surgical management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas adequate? A multi-institutional study [^115WcWUq]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

Controversy persists regarding the management of patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN). International consensus guidelines stratify patients into high-risk, worrisome, and low-risk categories.

- **Study design**: The medical records of seven institutions were reviewed for patients who underwent surgical management of IPMN between 2000 and 2015.

- **Results**: There were 324 patients included in the analysis; 60.4% of patients had main-duct/mixed type, and 39.7% had branch-duct IPMN. The median cyst size was 2.65 cm. Invasive cancer (IC) or high-grade dysplasia (HGD) was present in 42% (n = 136); 68.9% of patients with high-risk, 40.0% of patients with worrisome, and 24.6% of patients with low-risk features exhibited HGD/IC. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only one of three high-risk features and two of seven worrisome features predicted the presence of HGD/IC. Positive predictive values for HGD/IC in patients with obstructive jaundice and lymphadenopathy were 0.83 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.94) and 0.69 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.91), respectively. In the absence of high-risk features, HGD/IC was still present in 57.4% of patients with two or more worrisome features. Regression analysis demonstrated that each additional worrisome factor present was additive in predicting HGD/IC in a linear fashion (odds ratio 1.39; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.80; p < 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: These data demonstrate that the consensus guidelines for surgical resection of IPMN may not adequately stratify and identify patients at risk for having HGD or invasive cancer.

### The diagnostic value of abbreviated MRI protocol in the surveillance of branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm [^114AKD8m]. European Journal of Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of an abbreviated protocol (AP) MRI in detecting signs of degeneration in branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (BD-IPMNs) in patients undergoing routine MRI follow-up.

- **Methods**: This dual-center retrospective study included patients with BD-IPMN diagnosed on initial comprehensive protocol (CP) MRI who underwent routine MRI follow-up. The CP included axial and coronal T2-weighted images (T2WI), axial T1-weighted images (T1WI) before and after contrast administration, 3D MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), and diffusion-weighted images (DWI). Two APs, eliminating dynamic sequences with or without DWI, were extracted from CP. Two radiologists evaluated the APs separately for IPMN degeneration signs according to Fukuoka criteria and compared the results to the follow-up CP. In patients who underwent EUS, imaging findings were correlated with pathological results. Per-patient and per-lesion sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of APs were calculated. Additionally, the acquisition time for different protocols was calculated.

- **Results**: One hundred and fourteen patients (56.1% women, median age: 71 years) with 256 lesions were included. Degeneration signs were observed in 24.6% and 12.1% per-patient and per-lesion, respectively. Regarding APs, the per-patient sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy in the detection of the degeneration signs were 100%, 93.5%, 83.3%, 100%, and 95.1%, respectively. No additional role for DWI was detected. AP without DWI economized nearly half of CP acquisition time (388 seconds versus 663 seconds, respectively).

### American gastroenterological association institute guideline on the diagnosis and management of asymptomatic neoplastic pancreatic cysts [^114jnoEy]. Gastroenterology (2015). High credibility.

The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) 2015 guidelines provide recommendations on the follow-up and surveillance of neoplastic pancreatic cysts. Specifically, regarding surveillance imaging, the guidelines suggest obtaining MRI surveillance in one year for patients with pancreatic cysts that are less than 3 cm, do not have a solid component, and show no dilated pancreatic duct. If there are no changes in size or characteristics, subsequent imaging should be conducted every two years, for a total surveillance period of five years.

### Pancreatic cysts suspected to be branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm without concerning features have low risk for development of pancreatic cancer [^115Bh2oV]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

In 2006, international consensus guidelines for the management of pancreatic BD-IPMN and MCN were released by the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) and updated in 2012. The most notable changes in the revised Fukuoka guidelines were refinements in criteria used to stratify the malignant potential of BD-IPMN ("Fukuoka criteria") and a de-emphasis on cyst size ≥ 30 mm solely as an indication for surgery.

- **High-risk stigmata**: Obstructive jaundice with a cystic lesion located in the head of the pancreas, cyst containing an enhancing solid component, and main pancreatic duct (PD) diameter ≥ 10 mm.

- **Worrisome features**: Pancreatitis, cyst size ≥ 30 mm, thickened/enhancing cyst walls, PD size 5–9 mm, cyst with non-enhancing mural nodule, abrupt change in caliber of PD with distal pancreatic atrophy, and lymphadenopathy.

Consideration of immediate resection is recommended for surgically fit patients with "high-risk stigmata", "worrisome features", and concerning endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) findings (definite mural nodule, PD abnormalities, and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology with either high-grade dysplasia or malignant cell) or otherwise benign-appearing cyst with high-grade epithelial atypia. In the absence of Fukuoka criteria and/or high-risk EUS-FNA features, BD-IPMN are thought to confer low risk for malignancy and are suitable for non-operative management and surveillance.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of Fukuoka criteria in stratifying the risk of pancreatic cancer in clinically suspected BD-IPMN cases.

### Validation of international consensus guidelines for the resection of branch duct-type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [^114LmTCz]. The British Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Classifications of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) remain ambiguous, especially for the mixed type. Factors predicting malignancy remain unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of factors predicting malignancy in the new international consensus guidelines for resection of branch duct-type (BD)-IPMN and to compare them with those in the previous version.

- **Methods**: A prospectively collected database of patients with biopsy-proven BD-IPMN was analysed to compare factors between the first and second consensus guidelines, particularly as predictors of malignancy.

- **Results**: Of 350 patients with BD-IPMN, sensitivity (0.724) and balanced accuracy (0.751) of the second guidelines were superior to those (0.639 and 0.730) in the first version at the expense of slightly reduced specificity (0.779 versus 0.822 for the first version) by random forest models. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that main pancreatic duct dilatation greater than 5mm (hazard ratio (HR) 4.54, 95 per cent confidence interval 2.45 to 8.41; P < 0.001), mural nodules (HR 6.27, 3.27 to 12.01; P < 0.001) and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 level above 37units/ml (HR 4.03, 1.83 to 8.90; P = 0.001) were independent predictors of BD-IPMN malignancy.

- **Conclusion**: The new consensus guidelines provide better sensitivity, performance of factors predicting malignancy, and balanced accuracy in the diagnosis of BD-IPMN malignancy. Size alone was limited in predicting malignancy. Variability in clinical significance of the individual factors associated with a risk of malignancy remains a concern.

### European evidence-based guidelines on pancreatic cystic neoplasms [^115X1YmH]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

How should surgical specimens with an IPMN lesion be examined and reported?

- **Gross examination**: Involvement of the MPD and/or branch duct(s), the length of the MPD that is macroscopically involved, and the largest diameter of the dilated MPD or of the cyst in cases of BD-IPMNs should be recorded. In cases of multifocal BD-IPMNs, the largest diameter of each lesion should be reported (GRADE 2C, strong agreement).

- **Histopathological examination**:
	- IPMN without an invasive carcinoma: The histological subtype should be documented (gastric, intestinal, pancreatobiliary, or oncocytic) based on morphology and immunohistochemical staining. For grading of dysplasia in an IPMN, the use of a two-tiered classification system (low-grade vs. high-grade dysplasia) is recommended (GRADE 2C, strong agreement).
	- IPMNs with associated invasive carcinoma: The largest diameter of the invasive lesion should be measured and reported, in addition to the overall size of the lesion. The associated invasive carcinoma should be reported according to the WHO and Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) recommendations. If the transition from an IPMN to invasive carcinoma is not demonstrable, complete sampling of the intervening tissues should be conducted to substantiate whether the IPMN and invasive carcinoma are truly separate (GRADE 2C, strong agreement).

The term 'malignant IPMN' should not be used. Instead, it should be simply stated whether invasion is present or not. It is important to assess the histological subtype of IPMN since it is associated with the prediction of postoperative outcomes.

### Benefit of extended surveillance of low-risk pancreatic cysts after 5-year stability: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117JwiqT]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). Low credibility.

Aims: Low-risk branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (BD-IPMNs) lacking worrisome features (WF) and high-risk stigmata (HRS) warrant surveillance. However, their optimal duration, especially among cysts with initial 5-year size stability, requires further investigation. We systematically reviewed the surveillance of low-risk BD-IPMNs and investigated the incidence of WF/HRS and advanced neoplasia, high-grade dysplasia, and pancreatic cancer during the initial 5 years.

Methods: A systematic search (CRD42020117120) identified studies investigating long-term IPMN surveillance outcomes of low-risk IPMN among the Cochrane Library, Embase, Google Scholar, Ovid Medline, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, from inception until July 9, 2021. The outcomes included the incidence of WF/HRS and advanced neoplasia, disease-specific mortality, and surveillance-related harm (expressed as percentage per patient-years). The meta-analysis relied on time-to-event plots and used a random-effects model.

Results: Forty-one eligible studies underwent systematic review, and 18 studies were meta-analyzed. The pooled incidence of WF/HRS among low-risk BD-IPMNs during initial and extended surveillance was 2.2% (95% CI, 1.0%-3.7%) and 2.9% (95% CI, 1.0%-5.7%) per patient-year, respectively, whereas the incidence of advanced neoplasia was 0.6% (95% CI, 0.2%-1.0%) and 1.0% (95% CI, 0.6%-1.5%) per patient-year, respectively. The pooled incidence of disease-specific mortality during initial and extended surveillance was 0.3% (95% CI,…

### Natural history of branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with mural nodules: a Japan Pancreas Society multicenter study [^115ZZNH2]. Pancreas (2014). Low credibility.

The international consensus guidelines recommend that patients with BD-IPMNs who have MNs should basically consider surgery if clinically appropriate. The subjects of the present study, however, were patients who had been observed because the height of MNs was less than 10 mm. In these patients, strict monitoring of BD-IPMNs had been performed at short intervals, which enabled investigation of the natural history of BD-IPMNs with MNs of less than 10 mm in height. Among these patients, 23% showed an increase in the height of the MNs during follow-up for over 40 months. In this group, there were no patients who showed enlargement of the cystic branch; however, all four patients who showed progression of MPD dilation exhibited an increase in the size of the MNs. The frequency of progression of MPD dilatation during follow-up was significantly higher in the group with an increase in the height of MNs than in the group without.

In the follow-up patients who had BD-IPMN with MNs, none developed PDAC derived from IPMN. The incidence of the development of malignancy in BD-IPMNs including a distinct PDAC was similar to that of those without MNs reported in the literature. Therefore, in those who have a BD-IPMN with MNs of less than 10 mm in height, observation instead of immediate resection is considered to be possible.

It is well known that IPMNs are characterized by slow progression and a favorable prognosis in contrast to ordinary PDAC, which is recognized as being very invasive. Histologic studies of resected IPMNs have revealed that most IPMNs are dysplasia without p

### Pancreatic cysts suspected to be branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm without concerning features have low risk for development of pancreatic cancer [^111Msu52]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is usually discovered at an advanced stage, and there are no screening or surveillance strategies proven to reduce risk. Pancreatic cysts have been targeted for intervention since mucin-producing cysts are associated with a risk of progression to adenocarcinoma over time. Though pancreatic cysts are easily identified on cross-sectional imaging, most types pose no risk of malignant degeneration. With the trending use and improvements in imaging, incidental pancreatic cysts have been increasingly detected, occurring in 2.4–14.4% of the general population.

The minority of these cysts are easily and accurately distinguished using clinical and radiographic features such as main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (MD-IPMN) and high-risk (≥ 3 cm in size) mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN). However, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRI/MRCP) perform poorly in discerning cyst type for the majority of cysts, with an accuracy of diagnosis < 50%. Many are presumably neoplastic cysts, such as branch duct (BD)-IPMN or small MCN, whose natural history and risk for progression to adenocarcinoma are poorly understood.

Resection is reserved for symptomatic or probable malignant cysts with features as suggested by the Fukuoka criteria and the 2015 AGA guidelines on diagnosis and management of asymptomatic neoplastic pancreatic cysts. Surgical resection of pancreatic cysts carries a morbidity of 35% and mortality of 1%. Thus, non-operative management in most cases is reasonable as transformation o

### Branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN): Are cyst volumetry and other novel imaging features able to improve malignancy prediction compared to well-established resection criteria [^112hxx6H]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Figure 4 displays a two-way plot showing predicted probabilities and their 95% CI (y-axis) for the outcome of high-grade dysplasia/invasive cancer (HGD/INV) over different combinations of risk factors (x-axis) for a hypothetical male patient aged ≥ 70 years. These probabilities were estimated by a multivariable logistic regression model, as outlined in the "Materials and Methods" section. Abbreviations include MN: contrast-enhancing mural nodules, MPD: main pancreatic duct diameter ≥ 5 mm, and CA19–9: carbohydrate antigen 19–9 levels > 37 μmol/L.

Table 5 presents observed probabilities for HGD/INV versus low-grade dysplasia (LGD) in patients within the cohort, depending on the presence of risk factors such as contrast-enhancing mural nodules (MN), main pancreatic duct diameter ≥ 5 mm (MPD), and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 levels > 37 μmol/L (CA 19–9).

Figure 5 illustrates pancreatic MR images of a 61-year-old man with episodes of acute pancreatitis. On coronal T2-weighted image (a), the main pancreatic duct (MPD) diameter is 9 mm in the head of the pancreas, and branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (BD-IPMN; indicated with white arrows) is identified anteriorly in the uncinate process on axial (b) and coronal (c) T2-weighted images. The BD-IPMN was segmented using Horos v2.1.1 (d), with a calculated volume of approximately 5 cm³ (e). Due to the presence of suspected IPMN-related acute pancreatitis, MPD diameter larger than 5 mm, and elevated carbohydrate antigen 19–9 levels (80 μmol/L), further investigation is warranted.

### Malignant progression in IPMN: A cohort analysis of patients initially selected for resection or observation [^111GQe2k]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) may represent a field defect of pancreatic ductal instability. The relative risk of carcinoma in regions remote from the radiographically identified cyst remains poorly defined. This study describes the natural history of IPMN in patients initially selected for resection or surveillance.

- **Methods**: Patients with IPMN submitted to resection or radiographic surveillance were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Comparisons were made between these two groups.

- **Results**: From 1995 to 2010, a total of 356 of 1,425 patients evaluated for pancreatic cysts fulfilled inclusion criteria. The median follow-up for the entire cohort was 36 months. Initial resection was selected for 186 patients (52%); 114 had noninvasive lesions and 72 had invasive disease. A total of 170 patients underwent initial nonoperative management. The median follow-up for this surveillance group was 40 months. Ninety-seven patients (57% of those under surveillance) ultimately underwent resection, with noninvasive disease in 79 patients and invasive disease in 18. Five of the 18 (28%) invasive lesions developed in a region remote from the monitored lesion. Ninety invasive carcinomas were identified in the entire population (25%), ten of which developed the invasive lesion separate from the index cyst, representing 11% with invasive disease.

- **Conclusions**: Invasive disease was identified in 39% of patients with IPMN selected for initial resection and 11% of patients selected for initial surveillance. Ten patients developed carcinoma in a region remote from the monitored lesion.

### Impact of age, comorbidities and relevant changes on surveillance strategy of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms: a competing risk analysis [^113hMVC3]. Gut (2024). Low credibility.

The cost-effectiveness of surveillance for branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (BD-IPMNs) is debated. We combined different categories of risks of IPMN progression and IPMN-unrelated mortality to improve surveillance strategies.

- **Design**: Retrospective analysis of 926 presumed BD-IPMNs lacking worrisome features (WFs) or high-risk stigmata (HRS) under surveillance was conducted. The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CACI) defined the severity of comorbidities. IPMN relevant changes included the development of WF/HRS, pancreatectomy, or death from IPMN or pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic malignancy-unrelated death was recorded. Cumulative incidence of IPMN relevant changes was estimated using the competing risk approach.

- **Results**: The 5-year cumulative incidence of relevant changes was 17.83%, with 1.6% developing pancreatic malignancy. The 5-year cumulative incidences for IPMN relevant changes were 13.73%, 19.93%, and 25.04% in low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups, respectively. Age ≥ 75 (HR: 4.15) and CACI > 3 (HR: 3.61) were independent predictors of pancreatic malignancy-unrelated death. The 5-year cumulative incidence for death from other causes was 15.93% for the age ≥ 75 + CACI > 3 group, and 1.49% for the age < 75 group. In this group, the 5-year rate of malignancy-free patients was 95.56% with a 5-year survival of 79.51%.

- **Conclusion**: Although it is not uncommon for changes considered relevant by guidelines to occur during surveillance, their impact varies based on risk stratification.

### Identification of patients with branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and very low risk of cancer: Multicentre study [^114dQ4fY]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Different surveillance strategies for patients with low-risk branch-duct (BD) intraductal papillary neoplasm (IPMN) have been described. The aim of this study was to describe the natural history of low-risk BD-IPMN and to identify risk factors for the development of worrisome features (WF)/high-risk stigmata (HRS) and of pancreatic malignancies.

- **Methods**: This was a multicentre retrospective study of patients with BD-IPMN who were under active surveillance between January 2006 and December 2015. Patients were eligible if they had a low-risk lesion and had a minimum follow-up of 24 months. Outcomes were the development of WF/HRS or cytologically/histologically confirmed malignant IPMN.

- **Results**: Of 837 patients included, 168 (20 percent) developed WF/HRS. At the end of the observation time, 132 patients (79 percent) with WF/HRS were still under surveillance without progression to pancreatic cancer. Factors associated with the development of WF or HRS in multivariable analysis included localized nodules (versus diffuse: hazard ratio (HR) 0.43, 95 percent c.i. 0.26 to 0.68), cyst size 15–19mm (versus less than 15mm: HR 1.88, 1.23 to 2.87) or at least 20mm (versus less than 15mm: HR 3.25, 2.30 to 4.60), main pancreatic duct size over 3mm (versus 3mm or less: HR 2.17, 1.41 to 3.34), and symptoms at diagnosis (versus no symptoms: HR 2.29, 1.52 to 3.45). Surveillance in an endoscopy-oriented centre was also associated with increased detection of WF or HRS (versus radiology-oriented: HR 2.46, 1.74 to 3.47).

- **Conclusion**: Conservative management of patients with low-risk BD-IPMN should be considered due to the slow progression of disease in many patients.

### European evidence-based guidelines on pancreatic cystic neoplasms [^112RxEmR]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Follow-up of BD-IPMN is required as progression of disease is expected in about 10–15% of patients during 3–5 years of follow-up. Surveillance should also include the entire pancreatic gland due to an increased risk of new-onset cancer. In patients with MD-IPMN and those with mixed-type (MT)-IPMN, several factors may predict progression during surveillance (e.g. diffuse MPD dilatation, serum CA 19–9, serum alkaline phosphatase, and absence of extrapancreatic cysts).

- **What are the clinical implications of the presence of potential risk factors, including morphological features, with regard to determining follow-up investigations, and the decision to proceed with surgical resection**: For patients with an IPMN without an indication for operative intervention, routine follow-up is recommended. A 6-month follow-up in the first year, and yearly follow-up thereafter is adequate when no risk factors are present that establish an indication for surgery. Changes in clinical symptoms should trigger investigations (GRADE 1B, strong agreement). For patients with a relative indication for surgery (see statement 4.12), the 'elderly', and those affected by severe comorbidity, a 6-month follow-up is recommended (GRADE 1B, strong agreement).

In young individuals, the risk of malignancy and surgery must be balanced against the burden of lifelong follow-up. However, after partial pancreatectomy for IPMN, lifelong follow-up is still indicated. Resection, therefore, does not eliminate the need for continued monitoring.

### Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography with compressed sensing at 1.5 T: clinical application for the evaluation of branch duct IPMN of the pancreas [^1135cCYh]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Written informed consent for the MRI was obtained from each patient. Institutional review board approval was granted via a general waiver for studies with retrospective data analysis at the Medical University of Innsbruck (February 20, 2009). The authors affiliated with Siemens Healthcare had no control over any data and were not involved in the execution of the study.

- **Patients**: Patients were included in the study according to the following criteria: (1) referred to the Department of Radiology at the Medical University of Innsbruck for MRI evaluation of a cystic lesion of the pancreas, (2) age greater than 18 years, (3) no history of pancreatic surgery, (4) acquisition of the comprehensive MRCP protocol, and (5) suspicion of branch duct IPMN (BD-IPMN) indicated in the MRI report. This includes positive communication of the cystic lesion with the main pancreatic duct in at least one sequence, although no previous MRI data was available. Alternatively, the suspicion was noted in other imaging procedures such as CT, EUS, or past MRI reports, confirming positive communication with the main pancreatic duct as shown in the report (see Fig. 1).

After examining our internal database, we retrospectively included 41 patients (27 female, 14 male; median age 69 years, range 46–89 years) from March 2018 to December 2018. Among them, 18 patients were referred with a suspicion of BD-IPMN, and 23 were included for follow-up, having undergone previous MRI evaluations.
