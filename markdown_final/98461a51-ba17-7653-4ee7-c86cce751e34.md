## Question

A 62-year-old man with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis is scheduled for elective aortic valve replacement. Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography and CT angiography reveal an ascending aorta diameter of 47 mm at the level of the aortic root. He has no known connective tissue disorder or family history of aortic disease. The surgical team is discussing the operative plan.

According to current AHA guidelines, what should be considered regarding the management of this patient's ascending aorta during his planned aortic valve replacement?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage a 47 mm ascending aorta at the time of isolated aortic valve replacement in a 62-year-old man with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and no known connective tissue disorder or family history of aortic disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's baseline risk profile and whether this is sporadic disease versus heritable or bicuspid aortopathy. Then, I should verify the exact guideline thresholds for concomitant ascending aortic replacement at the time of aortic valve surgery in tricuspid valves. Next, I will examine the strength of evidence and whether 47 mm crosses a Class I versus Class IIa recommendation. After that, I should consider alternatives like valve-sparing root replacement if the root is involved, and weigh operative risk and center expertise. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and surveillance plan if the aorta is not replaced now, ensuring I anchor this to the 2022 ACC/AHA aortic disease guideline and related statements.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk framing. This is a 62-year-old with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis requiring surgical aortic valve replacement, and the ascending aorta measures 47 mm. There is no mention of bicuspid aortic valve or heritable thoracic aortic disease, so I should treat this as sporadic ascending aortic dilation and apply the tricuspid-valve thresholds rather than the lower BAV thresholds, which are more aggressive due to higher aortic event risk in BAV aortopathy [^d624fa7e] [^2a42ab58].

> Wait, let me verify the exact thresholds. The 2022 ACC/AHA aortic disease guideline states that in patients undergoing repair or replacement of a tricuspid aortic valve with a concomitant ascending aortic aneurysm, it is reasonable to replace the ascending aorta when the maximum diameter is ≥ 4.5 cm, and again when it is ≥ 5.0 cm, with both statements framed as Class IIa recommendations. Importantly, these are not Class I mandates, reflecting judgment and shared decision-making rather than a strict requirement [^d624fa7e] [^8cc9fbc9] [^5e08c3db].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I initially thought 47 mm might meet a Class I indication, but I should correct that. Both the 4.5 cm and 5.0 cm thresholds for concomitant ascending replacement at the time of tricuspid AVR are Class IIa, meaning "reasonable", not mandatory. So at 47 mm, the aorta is above 4.5 cm but below 5.0 cm, placing it in a gray zone where concomitant replacement is reasonable but not obligatory, and the decision should be individualized to patient risk, anatomy, and center expertise [^d624fa7e] [^8cc9fbc9].

> I need to check the evidentiary basis and safety. Contemporary data suggest that adding ascending aortic replacement to AVR at experienced centers does not increase operative mortality, with elective proximal aortic surgery mortality around 2.2% nationally, and observational series indicate low rates of adverse aortic events when concomitant repair is performed at ≥ 4.5 cm by experienced teams. However, some comparative studies in mixed cohorts suggest AVR alone can be safe in selected patients with modest dilation, underscoring that evidence is largely observational and decisions should be individualized [^c751b12c] [^b240f0a8] [^a46e0ae6].

> Let me consider anatomic variants and surgical options. If the dilation involves the aortic root rather than the tubular ascending aorta, valve-sparing aortic root replacement may be reasonable if the valve is suitable for sparing and the team is experienced, though that is a different operation than simple supracoronary graft replacement and requires specific expertise. If the dilation is supracoronary, a tube graft replacement is standard, and the valve can be addressed separately as indicated [^4c24ff57] [^ab53210b].

> I should confirm growth-rate and size-index modifiers. Rapid growth of ≥ 0.5 cm in one year or ≥ 0.3 cm per year in two consecutive years is an indication for surgery irrespective of absolute size, and in patients with extreme body size, indexing to height or body surface area may shift thresholds. Neither rapid growth nor indexing is described here, but I should double-check the imaging report for growth estimates and patient stature before finalizing the plan [^f362d040] [^d40a8913].

> Next, I should review center expertise and shared decision-making. The guideline emphasizes that concomitant aortic surgery decisions should be made by experienced surgeons within a Multidisciplinary Aortic Team, with explicit discussion of risks, benefits, and patient preferences. In lower-risk patients with reasonable life expectancy, many centers favor concomitant replacement at 4.5–4.9 cm to avoid a second operation, whereas in higher surgical risk or limited life expectancy, observation with surveillance may be reasonable [^0ecef153] [^54914511].

> Putting this together, I should synthesize a clear recommendation. Given a 47 mm ascending aorta at the time of tricuspid AVR, concomitant ascending aortic replacement is reasonable and should be strongly considered, particularly if the patient is at low operative risk, has a long life expectancy, and the procedure can be performed at an experienced center. If the team and patient prefer surveillance, then AVR alone is acceptable with the understanding that lifelong aortic imaging will be required and the risk of future aortic events, while low, is not zero and rises with increasing diameter [^d624fa7e] [^8cc9fbc9] [^c751b12c].

> But wait, what if we defer aortic surgery now? I should ensure a surveillance plan is explicit. If the ascending aorta is not replaced, the patient should undergo lifelong imaging of the aortic root and ascending aorta every 1–2 years, with shorter intervals if the diameter approaches 5.0 cm or if growth accelerates, recognizing that sporadic aneurysms can progress slowly but unpredictably and that elective aortic surgery carries substantially lower mortality than emergency repair [^8a10114e] [^f362d040] [^c751b12c].

> Final recommendation: Concomitant ascending aortic replacement is reasonable at 47 mm during tricuspid AVR and should be discussed as the preferred option in a low-risk patient at an experienced center, while acknowledging that AVR alone with surveillance is an acceptable alternative based on patient preference, comorbidity, and local expertise. I should confirm valve morphology, root involvement, growth rate, and body size indexing before committing to valve-sparing root replacement or a simple supracoronary graft, and document shared decision-making in the record [^d624fa7e] [^8cc9fbc9] [^0ecef153].

In a 62-year-old man with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and a 47 mm ascending aorta, **current AHA/ACC guidance supports concomitant ascending aortic replacement** [^d624fa7e] when the aorta is ≥ 4.5 cm during AVR, provided the patient is at low surgical risk and the operation is performed by an experienced team [^5e08c3db]. This approach balances the low operative risk of elective ascending replacement (≈2–3%) [^c751b12c] with the elevated long-term risk of dissection or rupture at this size [^57278406]. If the surgical risk is high or the team lacks experience, **AVR alone with close surveillance** is reasonable, but lifelong aortic imaging is essential [^8a10114e].

---

## Current AHA/ACC guidelines and recommendations

The 2022 ACC/AHA guideline provides **clear recommendations** for managing concomitant ascending aortic dilation during AVR:

- **Concomitant ascending aortic replacement is reasonable** in patients undergoing AVR for severe aortic stenosis when the ascending aorta diameter is ≥ 4.5 cm, provided the patient is at low surgical risk and the procedure is performed by an experienced surgical team [^d624fa7e] [^5e08c3db].

- **For diameters ≥ 5.0 cm**, concomitant ascending aortic replacement is strongly recommended regardless of surgical risk, given the significantly increased risk of aortic complications [^d624fa7e] [^8cc9fbc9].

- **For diameters < 4.5 cm**, AVR alone is generally recommended, with continued surveillance of the ascending aorta if there is any dilation [^notfound].

---

## Risk-benefit analysis of concomitant ascending aortic replacement

### Benefits

Potential benefits include **prevention of aortic complications**, as elective ascending aortic replacement at ≥ 4.5 cm significantly reduces the risk of aortic dissection, rupture, and sudden death [^notfound]. It also avoids the need for a second operation, which carries higher morbidity and mortality than elective repair [^c751b12c].

---

### Risks

Operative risk is low, with **elective ascending aortic replacement** carrying approximately 2–3% mortality at experienced centers [^c751b12c] [^b240f0a8]. Potential complications include bleeding, infection, stroke, and respiratory complications, though these are uncommon in low-risk patients [^notfound].

---

## Alternative management strategies

If concomitant ascending aortic replacement is deemed too risky or the surgical team lacks experience, **AVR alone with close surveillance** is a reasonable alternative. Lifelong imaging of the ascending aorta is recommended, with the frequency determined by the degree of dilation and the rate of growth [^8a10114e].

---

## Long-term outcomes and prognosis

Patients undergoing concomitant ascending aortic replacement at experienced centers have **excellent long-term outcomes**, with low rates of aortic complications and no significant increase in operative mortality compared to AVR alone [^c751b12c] [^b240f0a8]. Conversely, patients managed conservatively with AVR alone require lifelong surveillance due to the risk of progressive aortic dilation and complications [^8a10114e].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the patient's 47 mm ascending aorta, **concomitant ascending aortic replacement is reasonable** during AVR, provided the patient is at low surgical risk and the procedure is performed by an experienced team [^d624fa7e] [^5e08c3db]. This approach aligns with current AHA/ACC guidelines and balances the low operative risk with the significant long-term benefits of preventing aortic complications. If surgical risk is high or expertise is limited, AVR alone with close surveillance is acceptable, but lifelong aortic imaging is essential [^8a10114e].

### Valve replacement in patients with aortic stenosis… [^4bf208d9]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis is an important health issue because it is the most common cardiac valve problem, yet there is no effective medical therapy. Because of the increasing age of the U. S. population, this is a condition that family physicians will have to deal with more frequently in the future. Carabello reviews the management of aortic stenosis using the case history of a 60-year-old man with a loud systolic murmur noted on examination. The author mentions other physical examination features that may be noted while aortic stenosis is progressing to at least moderate severity. These features include later peaking of the murmur in systole, palpable delay of the carotid upstroke, and a softening of the second heart sound as the aortic component is lost. Hemodynamic disturbance ensues as the aortic valve area drops from the normal 3 to 4 cm² to 1. 5 to
2. 0 cm². The mean pressure gradient across the valve rises rapidly as the stenosis progresses to less than

1. 0 cm².

The author's cutoff for severe aortic stenosis is a mean aortic-valve gradient above 50 mm Hg, although he notes that there is no universally accepted definition relying on valve area or gradient. The review emphasizes that clinical symptoms of decompensated left heart function are much more crucial than the echocardiographic measures of gradient and valve area in determining whether to proceed with valve replacement. Asymptomatic patients are generally best served by observation; fewer than one third of patients with symptomatic severe stenosis are alive in two years without surgical intervention. Clearly, symptomatic patients and patients with suggestive symptoms and gradients greater than 50 mm Hg or valve areas less than 1. 0 cm² should proceed to valve replacement, according to the author. Exercise testing may reveal occult ventricular dysfunction in seemingly asymptomatic patients with severe stenosis by echocardiography.

Aortic stenosis that progressed to ventricular dysfunction with a low ejection fraction has traditionally been cited as a contraindication to valve surgery. The author recommends that patients with low ejection fractions who still have an elevated valve gradient should be considered for surgery because it appears to improve their survival. A low ejection fraction with a low gradient is usually an ominous sign of highly decompensated left heart function that does not improve with valve surgery.

Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) aortopathy progression and event risk — After isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR) for BAV, the 15-year freedom from aortic events was 89% and was lower with baseline dilation (85% versus 93%; P = 0.001) in a series of 1,286 patients treated from 1960 to 1995; among 56 patients with isolated AVR for aortic regurgitation and aortic root dilation 4.0–5.0 cm, adverse aortic events occurred in 34% during follow-up. In a prospective study of 90 adults with BAV, the mean increase in ascending aortic diameter was 0.47 mm/y (range, 0.2–2.3 mm/y) over a 4.8-year follow-up; among adults with BAV without a TAA at baseline (aortic diameter < 4.5 cm), 13% developed a TAA at 14 ± 6 years after diagnosis and the 25-year risk of TAA was 26%. For many adults, an aortic root, ascending aortic, or both diameter ≥ 4.0 cm is considered dilated and should therefore be monitored over time with surveillance imaging to detect progressive dilation.

Aortic root and ascending thoracic aorta — definitions of dilation and aneurysm highlight limits of the standard rule. The conventional definition is "any artery that is dilated to at least 1.5 times its expected normal diameter". For example, "a man in his 40s would be expected to have an average aortic root diameter of 3.5 cm; applying the standard definition of ≥ 1.5 times reference diameter, his aortic root would have to reach 5.25 cm", yet "most experts would consider his aorta to be an aneurysm well below that diameter". In heritable aortopathy, "aortic repair would be recommended at a diameter of ≤ 5.0 cm", which "would not even be large enough to be termed an 'aneurysm'. The section notes that "The most important consideration in deciding the diameter thresholds at which to call the root and ascending aorta dilated or aneurysm is based on the natural history of such abnormal aortas", and cites a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) cohort undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) in which investigators "studied 201 patients… and followed them for 10 to 15 years; they found that those with baseline aortic diameters of 4.5 cm to 4.9 cm had a significantly increased risk of aneurysm".

Moderate aortic regurgitation (AR) during other cardiac surgery — concurrent intervention considerations are outlined. In patients with moderate AR who are undergoing other forms of cardiac surgery, such as CABG, mitral valve surgery, or replacement of the ascending aorta, the decision to intervene on the aortic valve concurrently includes consideration of aortic valve anatomy, aortic root size and shape, regurgitant severity, other comorbidities, and patients' preferences and values. Patients undergoing surgical repair or replacement of the aortic root or ascending aorta may be candidates for a valve-sparing procedure.

Aortic aneurysm management during cardiac surgery — For patients undergoing aortic valve surgery with concomitant ascending aortic aneurysm of ≥ 4.5 cm, guidelines have previously recommended simultaneous aortic replacement in those with BAV, and data show safety of concomitant repair at ≥ 4.5 cm by experienced teams; nevertheless, in general it is reasonable in patients undergoing aortic valve repair or replacement to consider concomitant aneurysm surgery for those with aneurysms of ≥ 5.0 cm, and in those undergoing cardiac surgery for indications other than aortic valve repair, concomitant prophylactic aortic replacement at a diameter of 5.0 cm may be reasonable; observational data also note slow growth and low complication rates when valve surgery is performed without aneurysm repair.

Ascending aortic diameter — risk thresholds, definitions, and prevalence: Aortic repair would be recommended at a diameter of ≤ 5.0 cm, even though this size would not be large enough to be termed an aneurysm. In 201 patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) followed for 10 to 15 years, baseline diameters of 4.5 cm to 4.9 cm were associated with a significantly increased risk of aneurysm, dissection, or sudden death (P < 0.001) compared with < 4.5 cm. To assess risk below the traditional 5.5 cm threshold for prophylactic aortic repair, analysis of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) reported that, relative to ≤ 3.4 cm, a diameter of 4.0 cm to 4.4 cm conferred an 89-fold increased risk of dissection, and a diameter of ≥ 4.5 cm conferred a 6,000-fold increased risk. These data support defining 4.0 cm to 4.4 cm as dilated and ≥ 4.5 cm as aneurysm, with only 2.6% of MESA subjects having a dilated aorta and only 0.2% an aneurysm. This definition of a dilated ascending aorta being ≥ 4.0 cm is consistent with guidance defining aortic dilation as an aortic diameter of > 4.0 cm, and in clinical settings the term dilation is preferred to ectasia for mild aortic enlargement.

Aortic valve and ascending aorta surgery (Class IIb) — AVR may be considered for asymptomatic patients with any of the following indications: severe AS and abnormal response to exercise; evidence of rapid progression of AS or AR; mild AS while undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting or other cardiac surgery and evidence of a calcific aortic valve; moderate AR undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting or other cardiac surgery; or severe AR with rapidly progressive LV dilation when the degree of LV dilation exceeds an end-diastolic dimension of 70 mm or end-systolic dimension of 50 mm, with declining exercise tolerance, or with abnormal hemodynamic responses to exercise. Surgical repair may be considered in adults with AS or AR and concomitant ascending aortic dilatation (ascending aorta diameter greater than 4.5 cm) coexisting with AS or AR, and early surgical repair may be considered in adults with AS and a progressive increase in ascending aortic size or mild AR if valve-sparing aortic root replacement is being considered.

Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) disease aortopathy — routine follow-up: In patients with a BAV who have undergone previous aortic valve repair or replacement and have a diameter of the aortic root, ascending aorta, or both of ≥ 4.0 cm, lifelong surveillance imaging of the aortic root and ascending aorta by TTE, CT, or MRI is recommended at an interval dependent on aortic diameter and rate of growth; similarly, in patients with a BAV and a diameter of the aortic root, ascending aorta, or both of ≥ 4.0 cm, lifelong surveillance imaging by TTE, CT, or MRI is recommended at an interval dependent on aortic diameter and rate of growth. The synopsis notes that patients with BAV, with or without aortic dilation, require lifelong surveillance of the aortic root and ascending aorta because of risk of late aortic growth.

### Surgical management of the aorta in BAV patients [^2696e587]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) frequently develop aneurysms of the aortic root and tubular ascending aorta. Aneurysms of the aortic arch, in the absence of concomitant aortopathies, are much less common. According to the 2018 American Association of Thoracic Surgery consensus guidelines on BAV-related aortopathy, prophylactic surgical aortic repair / replacement is recommended starting at a maximum aortic diameter of 50 mm in patients with risk factors. Concomitant aortic surgery is also recommended at an aortic diameter of 45 mm in those patients with other indications for cardiac surgery (most commonly aortic valve procedures). The ultimate goal of prophylactic aortic surgery is the prevention of aortic catastrophes, e.g. aortic rupture or acute aortic dissection, which are associated with high morbidity and mortality. The surgical technique used - in elective and emergency cases - depends on the involvement and nature of the aortic valve disease, as well as the extent of aortic aneurysm formation. The current review focusses on the surgical management of the aortic root, tubular ascending aorta, and proximal aortic arch in BAV patients. Despite the abovementioned recommendations, many BAV patients develop acute aortic syndromes below the recommended aortic diameter thresholds. Further research is therefore required in order to identify high-risk BAV subgroups that would benefit from earlier surgical repair.

ACC/AHA aortic disease guideline — risk stratification by aneurysm diameter and selective surgery highlights that the risk of aortic dissection or rupture correlates with increasing diameter, and aneurysms of ≥ 5.0 cm would be expected to have a greater risk of complications or rapid growth than smaller aneurysms. In one report, relative to a control aortic diameter of ≤ 3.4 cm, diameters of 4.0 cm to 4.4 cm conferred an 89-fold increased risk of aortic dissection, and a diameter of ≥ 4.5 cm conferred a 6,300-fold increased risk. Consequently, many experienced surgeons in a Multidisciplinary Aortic Team choose to operate selectively on patients with aneurysms of 5.0 cm to 5.4 cm, provided that the patient's surgical risk is low, and there is an ongoing prospective multicenter RCT of patients with ascending TAAs of 5.0 cm to 5.4 cm comparing early elective surgery vs. medical surveillance. For patients undergoing aortic valve surgery with concomitant ascending aortic aneurysm of ≥ 4.5 cm, guidelines have previously recommended simultaneous aortic replacement in those with BAV, and data have also shown the safety of performing concomitant aneurysm repair at a diameter of ≥ 4.5 cm by experienced surgeons working in a Multidisciplinary Aortic Team.

Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) — aortic root/ascending aorta intervention thresholds are based on aortic diameter, surgical context, and risk factors. In patients with a BAV with indications for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and a diameter of the aortic sinuses or ascending aorta ≥ 4.5 cm, replacement of the aortic sinuses and/or ascending aorta is reasonable if the surgery is performed at a Comprehensive Valve Center. Surgery is recommended in patients with a BAV with or without symptoms and with a diameter of the aortic sinuses or the ascending aorta of ≥ 5.5 cm. Specific risk factors — including family history of aortic dissection, aortic growth rate > 0.5 cm per year, and aortic coarctation — are associated with greater risk, and in such patients operative intervention to replace the aortic sinuses and/or the ascending aorta is reasonable when the aortic dimension is 5.0 to 5.5 cm if the surgery is performed at a Comprehensive Valve Center. In patients who meet criteria for replacement of the aortic sinuses, valve-sparing surgery may be considered if the surgery is performed at a Comprehensive Valve Center. In asymptomatic patients with a BAV who are at low surgical risk, have a diameter of the aortic sinuses or ascending aorta of 5.0 to 5.5 cm, and have no additional risk factors for dissection, operative intervention to replace the aortic sinuses and/or the ascending aorta may be considered if the surgery is performed at a Comprehensive Valve Center. Retrospective studies indicate the incidence of aortic dissection is estimated to be approximately 0.4% with routine surveillance, and an individualized approach to the timing of surgical intervention for a dilated aorta is suggested.

Top 10 take-home messages for the diagnosis and management of aortic disease — because outcomes for patients with aortic disease are enhanced at programs with higher volumes, experienced practitioners, and extensive management capabilities, "Multidisciplinary Aortic Team care is considered in determining the appropriate timing of intervention". Shared decision-making involving the patient and a multidisciplinary team is "highly encouraged" to determine the optimal medical, endovascular, and open surgical therapies, and in patients contemplating pregnancy or who are pregnant it is "especially important" when considering cardiovascular risks, diameter thresholds for prophylactic aortic surgery, and mode of delivery. Imaging guidance states that computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and echocardiographic imaging "should follow recommended approaches for image acquisition, measurement and reporting of relevant aortic dimensions, and the frequency of surveillance before and after intervention". At centers with Multidisciplinary Aortic Teams and experienced surgeons, "the threshold for surgical intervention for sporadic aortic root and ascending aortic aneurysms has been lowered from 5.5 cm to 5.0 cm in selected patients, and even lower in specific scenarios among patients with heritable thoracic aortic aneurysms".

Aim

The "2022 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Aortic Disease" provides recommendations to guide clinicians in the diagnosis, genetic evaluation and family screening, medical therapy, endovascular and surgical treatment, and long-term surveillance of patients with aortic disease across its multiple clinical presentation subsets (ie, asymptomatic, stable symptomatic, and acute aortic syndromes).

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from January 2021 to April 2021, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CINHL Complete, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline. Additional relevant studies, published through June 2022 during the guideline writing process, were also considered by the writing committee, where appropriate.

Structure

Recommendations from previously published AHA/ACC guidelines on thoracic aortic disease, peripheral artery disease, and bicuspid aortic valve disease have been updated with new evidence to guide clinicians. In addition, new recommendations addressing comprehensive care for patients with aortic disease have been developed. There is added emphasis on the role of shared decision making, especially in the management of patients with aortic disease both before and during pregnancy. The is also an increased emphasis on the importance of institutional interventional volume and multidisciplinary aortic team expertise in the care of patients with aortic disease.

Recommendation‑specific supportive text — proximal thoracic aortic operations in the United States, including ascending thoracic aortic replacement and aortic root replacement, have an 'overall elective mortality rate of 2.2%', and the Nationwide Inpatient Sample reported 'operative mortality rate for proximal thoracic aortic surgery was 2.5%'; thus, 'patients who meet criteria for aneurysm repair and have low operative risk can undergo prophylactic resection and graft placement with low operative mortality risk'. In experienced aortic centers, adding ascending TAA repair to AVR 'does not increase operative mortality', and 'Root-sparing AVR with concomitant ascending aneurysm repair is acceptable' with 'no increase in long-term adverse aortic events'. For aortic root replacement, 'Surgical approaches to replace the aortic root should be guided by the aortic valve anatomy'; if the valve is unsuitable for repair, 'a mechanical- or biological-valved conduit aortic root replacement should be performed', and 'this procedure has an operative mortality rate of 2.2% in the United States based on the STS database', with 'Long-term outcomes' similar for mechanical versus biological valved conduits 'even in patients < 70 years old'.

ACC/AHA aortic disease guideline — indications for elective repair of the aortic root or ascending thoracic aorta include symptomatic aneurysm, diameter thresholds, and rapid growth; when large aneurysms cause chest or back pain due to expansion or rapid growth, surgical repair is therefore indicated. Elective repair is primarily guided by a maximum aortic diameter of ≥ 5.5 cm for aneurysms of the aortic root or ascending thoracic aorta, derived from natural history data with an assumed operative mortality of < 5%, and the same 5.5-cm threshold applies regardless of whether patients have tricuspid or BAVs. Growth triggers for intervention are also specified: confirmed growth of ≥ 0.5 cm in 1 year has been, and remains, an indication for surgery; moreover, growth of 0.3 cm in 1 year that is sustained for 2 consecutive years — intervention is also recommended.

For individuals of small body size, height nomograms should be considered in the decision about indications for surgery at various aortic dimensions. An ascending aortic length exceeding 110 mm should be considered as a risk factor for aortic events when indicating elective surgery for aortic aneurysms. Despite metrics and precision criteria, the benefits and risks of surgical intervention versus nonoperative management should be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Conotruncal abnormalities with aortic dilation — management stance: Patients with conotruncal abnormalities commonly have aortic diameters of 40 mm to 50 mm, and aortic complications are extremely rare (only 6 published case reports). Therefore, there is no strong justification for empiric prophylactic surgery in such patients based solely on aortic diameter, and watchful observation has often been recommended unless surgery is being undertaken for other indications. However, there are rare patients who develop substantially greater aortic enlargement and for whom prophylactic surgery may have more of a role. Risk factor management such as control of hypertension is important, and there are no RCTs evaluating the efficacy of medical therapy to reduce the rate of progression of aortic dilation or incidence of aortic dissection in this population.

### Management of dilated ascending aorta during aortic valve replacement: valve replacement alone versus aorta wrapping versus aorta replacement [^a46e0ae6]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The optimal management of dilated ascending aorta during aortic valve replacement (AVR) remains controversial. This study compared the outcomes among 3 different managements (AVR alone, aorta wrapping, and aorta replacement) for the dilated ascending aorta.

Methods

The study enrolled 499 consecutive non-Marfan patients undergoing AVR in the presence of the ascending aorta dilatation (40 to 55 mm). We evaluated rates of death and aortic events; in addition, we evaluated the aortic expansion rate by serial echocardiography.

Results

The surgery involved AVR alone (n = 362), aorta wrapping (n = 67), or aorta replacement (n = 70). Early mortality occurred in 1.2% (n = 6, P = 0.61). Throughout 1590.0 patient-years of follow-up, 47 deaths occurred. The 5-year survival rates were 90.1% ± 2.0%, 91.8% ± 3.5%, and 82.2% ± 7.5% in the AVR alone, aorta wrapping, and aorta replacement groups, respectively (P = 0.64). One aortic event (acute type A dissection) occurred in the AVR alone group. For the AVR alone group, the median aortic expansion rate was -0.6 mm/y (interquartile range, -3.2 to 0.6 mm/y). The aortic expansion rates were affected neither by the morphology of aortic valves (bicuspid vs tricuspid; P = 0.10) nor by the initial aorta diameter (γ = -0.31, P = 0.61). Clinically relevant aortic expansion (≥ 5 mm/y) was observed only in 5 patients; of these patients, 2 showed the aortic diameter of 60 mm or greater at the end of follow-up.

Conclusions

Compared with concomitant aortic wrapping or replacement, AVR alone achieved similar clinical outcomes, showing considerably low risks of adverse aortic events or relevant aortic expansion in dilated ascending aorta. These findings argue against routine aortic replacement at the time of AVR.

ACC/AHA aortic disease guideline — Thoracic imaging modality considerations explains that in patients with TAD not at surgical threshold, a detailed assessment with a TTE to evaluate aortic valve anatomy and aortic valve function is important for establishing a baseline, and TTE usually provides clear images of the aortic root and ascending aorta, is safe and reproducible, and can be used for longitudinal surveillance; in select patients with difficult echocardiographic imaging windows, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is an alternative; cross-sectional imaging with CT or MRI has been established as the gold standard for assessment of all segments of thoracic aorta including arch branch vessels, and electrocardiographic-gated techniques minimize motion artifact and thus allow precise measurement of aortic root and ascending aortic dimensions; patients with stable aortic dimensions can be observed longitudinally with TTE, CT, or MRI, and the frequency of surveillance imaging should be individualized and informed by the aneurysm cause, aortic diameter, historical rate of aortic growth, how close the diameter is to the surgical threshold, and the patient's age, with intervals potentially increased because the rate of aortic growth is relatively slow in patients with nongenetic and syndromic causes.

Aortic root and ascending aorta — operative mortality and procedure considerations are as follows: Proximal thoracic aortic surgery has a lower operative mortality when performed electively rather than emergently (2.2% versus 17.2%, respectively), and proximal thoracic aortic operations in the United States, including ascending thoracic aortic replacement and aortic root replacement, have an overall elective mortality rate of 2.2%; similar results were obtained in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample in which operative mortality rate for proximal thoracic aortic surgery was 2.5%. Single-institution studies have shown that the addition of ascending TAA repair to AVR does not increase operative mortality in experienced aortic centers, and root-sparing AVR with concomitant ascending aneurysm repair is acceptable with studies showing no increase in long-term adverse aortic events. For aortic root replacement, if the aortic valve is unsuitable for sparing or repair, a mechanical- or biological-valved conduit aortic root replacement should be performed because, when elective, this procedure has an operative mortality rate of 2.2% in the United States based on the STS database, and long-term outcomes are similar with mechanical- versus biological-valved conduit aortic root replacements, even in patients < 70 years old; elective valve- sparing aortic root replacement has been performed safely by experienced surgeons in a Multidisciplinary Aortic Team, and in patients without an underlying genetic disorder it has been performed by either the reimplantation or remodeling technique with comparable survival and valve durability.

Aortic arch aneurysm — management recommendations specify that in patients with an aortic arch aneurysm who have symptoms attributable to the aneurysm and are at a low or intermediate operative risk, open surgical replacement is recommended. In patients with an isolated aortic arch aneurysm who are asymptomatic and have a low operative risk, open surgical replacement at an arch diameter of ≥ 5.5 cm is reasonable. In patients undergoing open surgical repair of an ascending aortic aneurysm, if the aneurysmal disease extends into the proximal aortic arch, it is reasonable to extend the repair with a hemiarch replacement. In patients undergoing open surgical repair of an aortic arch aneurysm, if the aneurysmal disease extends into the proximal descending thoracic aorta, an elephant trunk procedure may be considered. In patients with an aortic arch aneurysm who are asymptomatic but meet criteria for intervention, but have a high risk from open surgical repair, a hybrid or endovascular approach may be reasonable.

Definitions of dilation and aneurysm of the aortic root and ascending thoracic aorta — limitations of the conventional threshold: The conventional definition of an arterial aneurysm is dilation to at least 1.5 times expected normal diameter, which applies well to the abdominal and descending thoracic aorta but is problematic for the aortic root and ascending thoracic aorta; for example, a man in his 40s with an average aortic root diameter of 3.5 cm would, by the standard definition of ≥ 1.5 times reference diameter, require 5.25 cm to be considered an aneurysm, whereas most experts would consider an aneurysm at a diameter well below that value.

Objectives

There is increasing attention to prophylactic replacement of the moderately dilated ascending aorta at aortic valve surgery. Moderate ascending aortic dilatation is common in adult patients with conotruncal anomalies. There are no data outlining actual risk of progressive ascending aortic dilatation or dissection to provide management guidelines.

Methods

From December 1973 through January 2008, 81 consecutive adults (median age, 34 years; range, 18–59 years) with conotruncal anomalies underwent operation on the aortic root, ascending aorta, or aortic valve. Primary cardiac diagnoses included tetralogy of Fallot with or without pulmonary atresia in 60 patients, truncus arteriosus in 12, double-outlet right ventricle in 6, and other in 3. Indications for operation included aortic regurgitation in 69 patients, supracoronary ascending aneurysm in 16, aortic stenosis in 5, and other in 8. Median ascending aortic size was 45 mm (23–80 mm).

Results

Operations included isolated aortic valve repair/replacement in 63 patients, combined aortic valve replacement and reduction aortoplasty in 9, aortic root replacement in 7, and isolated ascending aortic replacement in 2. Four patients required reoperation during a median follow-up of 3.8 years (maximum 31 years). There were no ascending aortic reoperations after previous reduction aortoplasties or supracoronary ascending aortic grafts, and there were no late aortic dissections.

Conclusions

Moderate ascending aortic enlargement is common among patients with conotruncal anomalies coming to operation, but aortic dissection is rare, as is subsequent need for aortic reoperation. Despite current enthusiasm for prophylactic operations on the ascending aorta in patients with acquired disease, these data suggest that the moderately dilated aorta in this setting may be observed.

Regarding specific circumstances for thoracic aortic aneurysm, more specifically with respect to patients with other heritable aortic diseases, ACC/AHA 2022 guidelines recommend to consider performing aortic repair by experienced surgeons in a multidisciplinary aortic team in patients with aneurysm of the aortic root or ascending aorta with nonsyndromic heritable thoracic aortic disease and no identified genetic cause and maximal aortic diameter of ≥ 45 mm having high-risk features for adverse aortic events or undergoing cardiac surgery for other indications.

Aortic dilation in conotruncal abnormalities — management stance: Although patients with conotruncal abnormalities commonly have aortic diameters of 40 mm to 50 mm and aortic complications are extremely rare (only 6 published case reports), there is no strong justification for empiric prophylactic surgery based solely on aortic diameter, and watchful observation has often been recommended unless surgery is being undertaken for other indications. Rare patients develop substantially greater aortic enlargement for whom prophylactic surgery may have more of a role, risk factor management such as control of hypertension is important, and there are no RCTs evaluating the efficacy of medical therapy to reduce the rate of progression of aortic dilation or incidence of aortic dissection in this population.

Descending thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) size thresholds for repair — In patients with intact descending TAA, repair is recommended when the diameter is ≥ 5.5 cm. In patients with intact descending TAA and risk factors for rupture, repair may be considered at a diameter of < 5.5 cm. In patients at increased risk for perioperative morbidity and mortality, it may be reasonable to increase the size threshold for surgery accordingly.

Contemporary management

The 2020 ACC/AHA guidelines for the management of patients with valvular heart disease and the 2017 ESC/EACTS guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease both recommend consideration for valvular replacement for moderate AS in patients who are already undergoing open heart surgery (class IIa, level of evidence C for both guidelines). The major rationale for this recommendation is the elevated perioperative risk and potential for damage to bypass grafts (if present) during repeat sternotomy should the moderate AS progress and require operative intervention in the future. The ACC/AHA guidelines recommend screening patients with moderate AS with echocardiography every 1–2 years to assess for progression versus the ESC/EACTS guidelines which recommend yearly screening. Currently, guidelines do not recommend stratification of individuals at risk of rapid progression.

Marfan syndrome — supportive thresholds and outcomes for prophylactic aortic root replacement: Prophylactic aortic root replacement for aneurysm disease prevents type A aortic dissection and improves survival in Marfan syndrome. In patients with Marfan syndrome managed with optimal medical therapy whose aortic diameters are < 5.0 cm, the risk of aortic dissection is low, whereas the risk increases when the aortic diameter is > 5.0 cm. In large series, about 20% have undergone elective surgery when aortic root diameters are < 5.0 cm, and indications for earlier surgery may include rapid aortic growth (≥ 0.3 cm/y), family history of aortic dissection, desire for pregnancy, severe valve regurgitation, and patient preference. When the maximal cross-sectional area of the aortic root or ascending aorta divided by height is ≥ 10 cm²/m, prophylactic aortic root replacement is reasonable. Aortic root replacement is associated with a very low surgical risk when performed by experienced surgeons in Multidisciplinary Aortic Teams, but in one series of 239 patients undergoing VSRR, 7% developed at least moderate AR at 1 year follow-up.

BAV aortopathy — risk factors and supportive evidence for surgical thresholds include that the risk of aortic dissection rises with increasing aortic diameter, with "hinge points" when the ascending aorta reaches diameters > 5.25 cm to 5.75 cm; indexing maximal aortic dimensions to height informs thresholds and survival was significantly better for those with an aortic cross-sectional area to height ratio of ≥ 10 who underwent elective prophylactic repair versus those who did not; additional risk factors include a family history of aortic dissection and rapid aortic growth of ≥ 0.3 cm/y; patients with BAV and aortic coarctation have been reported to be at increased risk, although in a recent report of 499 patients with BAV (mean age, 40 ± 16 years), of whom 24% also had coarctation, there was no difference in adverse aortic events between those with or without coarctation; patients with dilation of the aortic root ("root phenotype") represent 10% to 20% of patients with BAV and aortopathy and may have more rapid aortic growth and an increased risk of aortic complications; and shared decision making is often used when evaluating elective aortic root replacement at aortic diameters < 5.5 cm.

Ascending aortic dilation and aneurysm thresholds — Increase in risk at 4.0 cm to 4.4 cm is used to justify classifying the aorta as dilated, and an abrupt increase at a diameter of ≥ 4.5 cm is used to justify classifying it as an aneurysm; using this approach, of the MESA database subjects, only 2.6% would be considered to have a dilated aorta and only 0.2% to have an aneurysm. A dilated ascending aorta being ≥ 4.0 cm is stated and is consistent with guidance in which aortic dilation was defined as an aorta diameter of > 4.0 cm. In clinical settings the term dilation is preferred to ectasia for mild aortic enlargement, but some imaging groups use ectasia for larger aortas such as 4.5 cm to 5.4 cm, which overlaps with what most experts would consider an aneurysm.

Current guidelines on the management of thoracic aortic disease recommend that the ascending aorta be replaced when it reaches the size of 5.5 cm. Recently emerging data suggest that this criterion may need to be shifted to the left, signifying a recommendation to operate on patients with smaller aortic sizes. The data that support the need for a leftward shift in the guidelines include (1) novel and more granular data on the natural history of ascending aortic aneurysm between 5 and 6 cm showing that 2 hinge risk points exist-one at 5.25 cm, and the other at 5.75 cm; (2) aortic diameter before the moment of aortic dissection is at least 7 mm smaller than postdissection aortic size; (3) the advent of a semiautomated centerline method of imaging assessment seems to underestimate true ascending aortic size; (4) aortic surgery in the present era is very safe and its benefits outweigh the associated risks; (5) genetic testing via high-throughput next-generation sequencing identifies genetic defects responsible for aortic catastrophes at smaller aortic sizes; and (6) familial aortic dissection occurrence suggests that family members of an aortic dissection victim who harbor a sizable aneurysm should be operated on regardless of aortic size.

Turner syndrome — diagnostic evaluation and prophylactic aortic surgery thresholds are as follows: Women with Turner syndrome should be evaluated for bicuspid aortic valve, coarctation of the aorta, and enlargement of the ascending aorta (I, B-NR). Prophylactic replacement of the aortic root or ascending aorta in adults with Turner syndrome is reasonable when the aortic diameter is 2.5 cm/m² or greater (IIa, B-NR). Supporting text states that women with Turner syndrome are at substantial risk of BAV, CoA, and aortic enlargement and that evaluation is necessary to help decide what interventions may be necessary; it also notes that because of case series reporting dissection at smaller aortic diameters than in non-Turner aortopathy, prophylactic surgery is reasonable at lower diameters, particularly if rapid dilation is present, that measurements must account for stature by indexing to body surface area using Turner-specific normative data or by using ratio of aortic area to body height, and that pregnancy in Turner syndrome is associated with an increased risk of aortic dissection, especially with preexisting aortic valve or aortic abnormalities.
