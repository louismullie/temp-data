## Question

Evaluation of nocturia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step approach to evaluating and managing nocturia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining nocturia and establishing its clinical significance. Then, I should verify the core etiologic categories and the role of the frequency-volume chart in phenotyping. Next, I will review the initial history, physical examination, and basic tests, followed by targeted investigations based on phenotype. After that, I need to consider special populations and comorbidities, and finally outline first-line conservative management and when to escalate to pharmacotherapy, including desmopressin safety monitoring and referral triggers [^114geuBs] [^116m1vwY] [^115KacU3].

> Let me first confirm the definition and why it matters clinically. Nocturia is waking from sleep to void, and while even a single nightly void can be bothersome, two or more per night is commonly associated with meaningful sleep disruption, reduced quality of life, and increased risks of falls, fractures, cognitive impairment, and mood disturbance, so I should not minimize its impact even when the count seems "low" [^115KacU3] [^114xJ6Dw] [^115joePn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about cause before I classify the pathophysiology. I need to ensure I categorize nocturia into four principal mechanisms: nocturnal polyuria, global polyuria, reduced nocturnal bladder capacity, and sleep disorders, because treatment hinges on this phenotyping and these categories commonly coexist in the same patient [^115KacU3] [^112Kjd5T] [^116iuVmq].

> Next, I should review the frequency-volume chart as the cornerstone diagnostic tool. Wait, let me verify the thresholds and timing. A 3-day bladder diary with fluid intake, voided volumes, and sleep-wake times allows me to calculate the nocturnal polyuria index; more than 20% of 24-hour urine at night in younger adults and more than 33% in older adults supports nocturnal polyuria, while total 24-hour urine exceeding 40 mL/kg suggests global polyuria; I should also note the first morning void is included in nocturnal volume because it reflects overnight production, even though it is not counted as a nocturnal void for frequency [^117PEvzs] [^116iuVmq] [^111FEnBi].

> I will now examine the initial history elements I must capture. I need to check urinary symptoms, fluid intake quantity and timing, medication review including diuretics and hypnotics, sleep habits and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea, and daytime comorbidities such as diabetes, heart failure, renal disease, and endocrine disorders; validated symptom instruments like IPSS or OAB-q can quantify bother and guide follow-up, and I should remember that nocturnal-only diaries can miss daytime contributors, so a full diary is preferred when feasible [^112nGN3N] [^111D2s4P] [^114JVYgE] [^112WEb2t].

> Let me consider the physical examination next. I should confirm that a focused exam includes blood pressure, cardiovascular and peripheral edema assessment, abdominal exam for organomegaly or retention, and a genitourinary exam with digital rectal exam in men to assess prostate and rectal tone, and pelvic exam in women to evaluate prolapse and pelvic floor support; this helps identify systemic contributors and outlet obstruction that may drive nocturia [^116MpUjb] [^113PZ4yh].

> I need to ensure basic tests are not overlooked. Urinalysis should be obtained in all patients to screen for infection, hematuria, and glucosuria; measuring post-void residual helps detect incomplete emptying; and I should add renal function, glucose or HbA1c, calcium, and thyroid tests when clinically indicated, especially in women with predominant nocturia or when polyuria is suspected [^117WPtha] [^117A5SyY] [^113wRYGG].

> But wait, what if the phenotype remains unclear or the patient reports fragmented sleep with minimal bladder sensation. I should double-check for sleep disorders, particularly obstructive sleep apnea, using STOP-BANG or similar screening tools and refer for polysomnography when positive, because treating OSA can meaningfully reduce nocturia frequency and improve sleep architecture [^1137K2Ve] [^11115hqJ] [^112CR86W].

> Let me think about how to operationalize the phenotyping from the diary. If the nocturnal polyuria index exceeds age-specific thresholds, I should confirm nocturnal polyuria and then evaluate for contributing causes such as evening fluid loading, congestive heart failure, autonomic dysfunction, or circadian arginine vasopressin deficiency; if total 24-hour urine exceeds 40 mL/kg, I should consider diabetes mellitus or insipidus, hypercalcemia, or iatrogenic causes; if frequent small voids predominate, I should assess for overactive bladder, reduced nocturnal capacity, or outlet obstruction; and if awakenings precede the urge, I should reconsider primary sleep disorders as the driver [^116iuVmq] [^112Kjd5T] [^115KacU3].

> I should confirm special population nuances. In men with concomitant LUTS, I need to check for BPH and bladder outlet obstruction and consider uroflowmetry and pressure-flow studies selectively; in women, I must avoid nocturnal-only diaries and ensure a complete 3-day diary, with attention to pelvic organ prolapse and stress incontinence; in older adults, I should maintain a low threshold to screen for hyponatremia risk before and during desmopressin; and in patients with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction, I should stratify risk and tailor imaging and urodynamics accordingly [^112PAAgq] [^112WEb2t] [^116AnMK5] [^114geuBs] [^11564Gta].

> Next, I should review first-line conservative management, because I need to ensure reversible contributors are addressed before medications. Fluid management with total daily restriction to about 2 liters or a 25% reduction from baseline and avoiding fluids within 2 hours of bedtime, bladder training, weight loss and physical activity, management of peripheral edema with daytime leg elevation, and dietary adjustments such as moderating salt and evening protein intake are all reasonable and guideline-supported starting points [^11781oAy] [^112VAgBr].

> Hold on, I should verify medication-related contributors and timing. Diuretics can be shifted to the mid-afternoon to reduce nocturnal diuresis, and I should review other agents that increase urine output or fragment sleep; if nocturnal polyuria is confirmed, afternoon-dosed furosemide may be considered in selected patients after counseling about risks and benefits [^111v2u42] [^115KacU3].

> I will now examine when to escalate to pharmacotherapy and which agents to choose. For nocturnal polyuria, desmopressin is the most effective targeted therapy, but I need to ensure strict hyponatremia risk mitigation with baseline serum sodium, rechecks at day 3 and day 7, again at 1 month, and periodically thereafter, with more frequent checks in men over 65 or those on interacting drugs; I should stop therapy if sodium falls below 130 mmol/L and consider stopping if 130–135 mmol/L with symptoms, aligning with international consensus on safe desmopressin use [^114geuBs] [^116m1vwY].

> Let me reconsider agents for reduced capacity or mixed etiologies. Antimuscarinics or beta-3 agonists may help when overactive bladder features are present, but I should counsel on adverse effects and recognize that benefits on nocturia frequency are modest; similarly, alpha-blockers or 5-alpha reductase inhibitors may improve overall LUTS yet often have limited impact on nocturia unless bladder outlet obstruction is a major driver, so expectations must be set accordingly [^115G5uru] [^111638gy] [^113qdfqY].

> I should double-check follow-up cadence and outcome measures. Reassessment at 4–8 weeks using the same diary and symptom instruments allows me to quantify response and adjust therapy; I need to track not just nocturia frequency but also sleep quality, initial sleep period duration, and patient-reported bother, since frequency alone does not fully capture impact or guide treatment direction [^1127YGf6] [^11374vJs] [^115uSixv].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have clear referral triggers. Refractory symptoms despite optimized conservative and phenotype-directed therapy, suspicion for complex urologic pathology such as neurogenic bladder or female outlet obstruction, or diagnostic uncertainty after appropriate initial evaluation should prompt urology referral; likewise, positive OSA screening with access barriers or persistent symptoms despite CPAP should trigger sleep medicine referral to close the loop on modifiable drivers of nocturia [^115KacU3] [^112zJqzv].

---

The evaluation of nocturia should be **structured and multifactorial**, beginning with a detailed history, physical exam, and urinalysis [^112PAAgq], then using a 3-day bladder diary [^117PEvzs] and post-void residual [^117A5SyY] to classify the cause as nocturnal polyuria, reduced bladder capacity, or global polyuria [^116iuVmq]. Assess for **contributing comorbidities** — heart failure, diabetes, CKD, OSA [^1137K2Ve], and polypharmacy — and screen for OSA when suspected [^1137K2Ve]. Reserve advanced testing (urodynamics, cystoscopy, imaging) for refractory or unclear cases [^111Cqh7P]. This approach ensures accurate diagnosis and guides targeted therapy [^115KacU3].

---

## Clinical history and symptom assessment

A thorough clinical history is essential to identify underlying causes and guide further evaluation. Key elements include:

- **Nocturia frequency and severity**: Number of nightly voids, volume per void, and total nocturnal urine volume [^111FEnBi].
- **Fluid intake patterns**: Total daily intake, evening intake, caffeine, alcohol, and timing of fluids [^112nGN3N].
- **Sleep habits**: Sleep quality, duration, and symptoms suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) [^113PzsFi].
- **Medical comorbidities**: Heart failure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and psychiatric conditions [^115joePn].
- **Medication use**: Diuretics, antihypertensives, antidepressants, and other medications that may affect nocturnal urine production or bladder function [^112Kjd5T].
- **Impact on quality of life**: Daytime fatigue, cognitive impairment, mood disturbances, and functional limitations [^115KacU3].

---

## Physical examination

Physical examination should include:

- **Vital signs**: Blood pressure, heart rate, and weight.
- **Cardiovascular examination**: Signs of heart failure, peripheral edema, and jugular venous distension.
- **Abdominal examination**: Palpation for organomegaly, ascites, and bladder distension.
- **Genitourinary examination**: Digital rectal examination (DRE) in men to assess prostate size and consistency [^116MpUjb], and pelvic examination in women to evaluate pelvic organ prolapse or vaginal atrophy [^116m1vwY].
- **Neurological examination**: Assessment of lower extremity sensation, reflexes, and anal sphincter tone to evaluate for neurogenic bladder dysfunction [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic tests and investigations

### Basic laboratory tests

Basic laboratory tests include **urinalysis** to screen for infection, hematuria, proteinuria, and glucosuria [^116YpTgn], and **renal function tests** (serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate) to assess renal function, particularly if CKD is suspected [^113wRYGG].

---

### Bladder diary and frequency-volume chart

A 3-day bladder diary is a **cornerstone of nocturia evaluation**, documenting fluid intake, voiding times, volumes, and sleep periods [^117PEvzs]. It helps differentiate nocturnal polyuria, reduced bladder capacity, and global polyuria [^112mqjLd]. Nocturnal polyuria is defined as nocturnal urine volume exceeding 20% of total 24-hour urine volume in young adults or 33% in older adults [^116iuVmq]. Reduced bladder capacity is suggested by frequent small-volume voids, whereas global polyuria is indicated by total 24-hour urine volume exceeding 40 mL/kg body weight [^116iuVmq].

---

### Post-void residual (PVR) measurement

PVR assesses **incomplete bladder emptying**, which may contribute to nocturia [^115MCmgL]. It is recommended in the initial evaluation, particularly in patients with suspected bladder outlet obstruction or neurogenic bladder dysfunction [^112PAAgq].

---

### Advanced diagnostic tests (if indicated)

Advanced testing is reserved for refractory or unclear cases. Urodynamic studies evaluate bladder function, detrusor activity, and outlet obstruction [^112QQr7H]; cystoscopy visualizes the urethra and bladder for structural abnormalities; and imaging (renal ultrasound, transrectal ultrasound of the prostate, or MRI) assesses upper and lower urinary tract anatomy when indicated [^112PAAgq].

---

## Classification of nocturia

Based on clinical evaluation and diagnostic tests, nocturia can be classified into **three main categories**:

| **Category** | **Definition** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|-|
| Nocturnal polyuria | Excessive nocturnal urine production (> 20% of total 24-hour urine volume in young adults, > 33% in older adults) | - Heart failure <br/> - Diabetes insipidus <br/> - Obstructive sleep apnea <br/> - Evening fluid intake <br/> - Diuretic use [^116iuVmq] |
| Reduced bladder capacity | Frequent small-volume voids due to decreased bladder capacity or increased bladder sensitivity | - Overactive bladder <br/> - Interstitial cystitis <br/> - Benign prostatic hyperplasia <br/> - Urethral stricture <br/> - Neurogenic bladder [^116iuVmq] |
| Global polyuria | Increased total 24-hour urine volume (> 40 mL/kg body weight) | - Diabetes mellitus <br/> - Diabetes insipidus <br/> - Chronic kidney disease <br/> - Excessive fluid intake [^116iuVmq] |

---

## Impact of nocturia on quality of life

Nocturia significantly impairs quality of life, causing sleep fragmentation, daytime fatigue, cognitive impairment, mood disturbances, and increased risk of falls and fractures [^115KacU3]. It is also associated with higher overall mortality and cardiovascular morbidity [^115joePn].

---

## Current guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize a **structured, multifactorial approach** to nocturia evaluation:

- **Canadian Urological Association (CUA) 2022**: Recommends thorough history, physical examination, urinalysis, bladder diary, and PVR measurement. Management should address underlying causes, including behavioral, systemic, and lower urinary tract dysfunction [^113PZ4yh] [^111TiMgA].
- **European Association of Urology (EAU) 2025**: Recommends validated symptom questionnaires, bladder diary, and targeted evaluation of comorbidities, including sleep disorders and cardiovascular conditions [^114JVYgE] [^11115hqJ].
- **American Family Physician (AAFP) 2025**: Recommends conservative measures, including fluid management, sleep hygiene, and treatment of underlying comorbidities, with pharmacotherapy reserved for refractory cases [^115KacU3].

---

## Conclusion

The evaluation of nocturia requires a **comprehensive, structured approach** encompassing clinical history, physical examination, and targeted diagnostic tests. Accurate classification of nocturia into nocturnal polyuria, reduced bladder capacity, or global polyuria is essential for effective management. Current guidelines emphasize addressing underlying causes, including behavioral, systemic, and lower urinary tract dysfunction, to improve patient outcomes and quality of life [^111TiMgA].

Aims

Nocturia, or waking up at night to void, is a highly prevalent and bothersome symptom. Currently, there is a lack of clear and consistent recommendations regarding evaluation and management of nocturia. The aim of this report is to discuss how to fill the gaps in our knowledge in order to develop a practical patient-oriented diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm for nocturia.

Methods

This paper is a report of the presentations and subsequent discussion of a Think Tank session at the annual International Consultation on Incontinence Research Society (ICI-RS) in June 2017 in Bristol.

Results and Conclusion

Further investigations are needed to better understand the pathophysiology of nocturia, to allow improvement in diagnosis, and to optimize treatment by increasing efficacy and reducing adverse events. Patient-oriented practical guidelines on nocturia are needed to help clinicians from different disciplines diagnose and treat nocturia.

### Nocturia: evaluation and management [^115KacU3]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Nocturia (ie, awakening to void one or more times per night) is common in adults, with increasing prevalence in older age. Nocturia is associated with increased risk of falls and fractures, cognitive impairment, and depressed mood. In general, mechanisms for nocturia fall into one of four categories: increased nighttime urine production, decreased storage ability, incomplete bladder emptying, or primary sleep disorder. Although screening for nocturia currently is not recommended, patients reporting bothersome symptoms should be evaluated and treated. Initial workup includes assessing urinary symptoms, fluid intake, and comorbidities. Using validated nocturia questionnaires and frequency-volume charts (bladder diaries) can aid in diagnosis. A urinalysis should be performed for all patients. Lifestyle modifications and treatment of underlying comorbidities are first-line therapies for nocturia. Limitation of fluid intake, especially in the evening; addressing timing of diuretic intake; and sleep hygiene are recommended. Pharmacotherapy should be reserved for those unresponsive to lifestyle modifications and adequate treatment of comorbidities. Pharmacotherapy should target the etiology of nocturia, such as nocturnal polyuria, overactive bladder, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Patients with refractory symptoms should be referred for further treatment (eg, onabotulinumtoxinA injection, sacral neuromodulation, surgical management of benign prostatic hyperplasia).

### Nocturia: etiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^114GoypE]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2008). Low credibility.

Voiding at night, or nocturia, is a common reason for interrupted sleep in the adult population. The condition affects both men and women, with an incidence that increases dramatically with age. Nocturia has a negative impact on quality of life, affecting both morbidity and mortality. Effective diagnosis of the condition is dependent on a clear understanding of its underlying etiology. In general, the causes of nocturia fall into three categories: diurnal polyuria, nocturnal polyuria, and low bladder capacity. In some individuals, however, nocturnal polyuria and low bladder capacity may both contribute to the overall symptomatology of nocturia. Addressing any underlying conditions that contribute to nocturia is the first step in treating the condition. Lifestyle and behavioral changes may provide benefit in some individuals, but for many, the only option is pharmacotherapy. Antimuscarinic agents are first-line therapies for overactive bladder and are often used in the management of nocturia. Pharmacological and physicochemical differences between available antimuscarinic agents, however, translate into different safety and tolerability profiles, which may make some agents more suitable for use in certain populations, including the elderly. Careful selection of the most appropriate antimuscarinic medication is therefore central in optimizing treatment outcomes.

### International continence society consensus on the diagnosis and treatment of nocturia [^116m1vwY]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with nocturia have to face many hurdles before being diagnosed and treated properly. The aim of this paper is to: summarize the nocturia patient pathway, explore how nocturia is diagnosed and treated in the real world and use the Delphi method to develop a practical algorithm with a focus on what steps need to be taken before prescribing desmopressin.

Methods

Evidence comes from existing guidelines (Google, PubMed), International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society (ICI-RS) 2017, prescribing information and a Delphi panel (3 rounds). The International Continence Society initiated this study, the authors represent the ICI-RS, European Association of Urology, and Society of Urodynamics, Female Pelvic Medicine and Urogenital Reconstruction (SUFU).

Results

Diagnostic packages: consensus on, history taking for all causalities, intake diary (fluid, food) and bladder diary, not for its duration. Pelvic (women) or rectal (men) examination, prostate-specific antigen, serum sodium check (SSC), renal function, endocrine screening: when judged necessary. Timing or empty stomach when SSC is not important. Therapeutic packages: the safe candidates for desmopressin can be phenotyped as no polydipsia, heart/kidney failure, severe leg edema or obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Lifestyle interventions may be useful. Initiating desmopressin: risk management consensus on three clinical pictures. Follow-up of desmopressin therapy: there was consensus on SSC day 3 to 7, and at 1 month. Stop therapy if SSC is < 130mmol/L regardless of symptoms. Stop if SSC is 130 to 135mmol/L with symptoms of hyponatremia.

Conclusion

A summary of the nocturia patient pathway across different medical specialists is useful in the visualization and phenotyping of patients for diagnosis and therapy. By summarizing basic knowledge of desmopressin, we aim to ease its initiation and shorten the patient journey for nocturia.

### Sleep disorders, comorbidities, actions, lower urinary tract dysfunction, and medications ("Sleep C. A.L.M".) in the evaluation and management of nocturia: a simple approach to a complex diagnosis [^112Kjd5T]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nocturia arises from a fundamental mismatch between nocturnal urine production, storage capacity, and sleep architecture, which may be driven by abnormalities of the genitourinary tract, but also by sleep disorders, medical diseases, patient actions/lifestyle factors, or medications. This article introduces a novel system for organizing the complex differential diagnosis for nocturia, as proposed by an international collective of practicing urologists, physician specialists, and sleep experts: "Sleep CALM"-Sleep Disorders, Comorbidities, Actions, Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction, and Medications.

Methods

Narrative review of current evidence regarding the relevance of each "Sleep CALM" factor to nocturia pathogenesis, evaluation, and management.

Results

Nocturia and sleep disorders are highly intertwined and often bidirectional, such that nocturnal awakenings for reasons other than a sensation of bladder fullness should not be used as grounds for exclusion from nocturia treatment, but rather leveraged to broaden therapeutic options for nocturia. Nocturia is an important potential harbinger of several serious medical conditions beyond the genitourinary tract. Urologists should have a low threshold for primary care and medical specialty referral for medical optimization, which carries the potential to significantly improve nocturnal voiding frequency in addition to overall health status. Adverse patient actions/lifestyle factors, lower urinary tract dysfunction, and medication use commonly coexist with disordered sleep and comorbid medical conditions, and may be the primary mediators of nocturia severity and treatment response, or further exacerbate nocturia severity and complicate treatment.

Conclusion

"Sleep CALM" provides a memorable and clinically relevant means by which to structure the initial patient history, physical exam, and clinical testing in accordance with current best-practice guidelines for nocturia. Although not intended as an all-encompassing diagnostic tool, the "Sleep CALM" schema may also be useful in guiding individualized ancillary testing, identifying the need for specialty referral and multidisciplinary care, and uncovering first-line treatment targets.

### The effect of nocturia on sleep [^114xJ6Dw]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Sleep plays a vital role in physical and mental functioning. It is increasingly recognized that disturbed sleep is a highly prevalent and chronic condition that merits greater awareness due to the wide-ranging and serious repercussions associated with it. Nocturia is one of the causes of sleep disturbance and has been shown to impair functioning, quality of life, health and productivity, with those experiencing two or more voids per night reporting significant 'bother'. Nocturia warrants full consideration as a significant target for intervention, aiming to reduce the burden of disturbed sleep on individuals, families and society. Currently, however, a definitive evaluation of the most relevant sleep endpoints in nocturia therapy is lacking. One endpoint often used is the duration of the initial sleep period, which when evaluated in combination with the number of voiding episodes per night, might be an indication of the severity of sleep disruption in patients with nocturia.

### Nocturia: aetiology and treatment in adults [^115joePn]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2016). Medium credibility.

Nocturia is an extremely common condition that has major sequelae for affected patients. Through disruption of sleep, nocturia impairs quality of life and worsens health outcomes, and is associated with a variety of morbidities including diabetes, coronary artery disease, obstructive sleep apnoea, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and depression. Unsurprisingly, several studies have also linked nocturia with reduced survival. Nocturia is not simply a consequence of lower urinary tract disease; rather, it is a multifactorial disorder that is often a manifestation of an underlying renal or systemic disease. Through the use of the frequency volume chart, clinicians can accurately quantify nocturia and determine its aetiology. Evaluation of quality of life and sleep using simple measures is essential in order to assess the impact of nocturia on a patient. Numerous treatment options for nocturia exist, but most are associated with minor benefit or lack sufficient evidence supporting their use. By systematically analysing an individual's causes of nocturia, clinicians can design appropriate treatment strategies to most effectively treat this condition.

### Would a new definition and classification of nocturia and nocturnal polyuria improve our management of patients? ICI-RS 2014 [^112CV1Aq]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2016). Low credibility.

The following is a report of the proceedings of the Nocturia Think Tank sessions of the annual International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society, which took place September 22–24, 2014 in Bristol, UK. The report is organized into sections pertaining to the main topic of discussion focussing on the question as to whether a new definition and classification of nocturia and nocturnal polyuria would improve the outcome of management in our patients. First, discussions identified theoretical and practical shortcomings of current definitions. Secondly, the utility of several nocturnal polyuria definitions was tested in a real life population in relation to the symptom nocturia, in order to display weaknesses of these definitions. Thirdly, we explored in a clinical population the utility of bladder diary based parameters by asking the question: when nocturia improves, which of these parameters improve most? Based on the above explorations the Think Tank summarized elements of the current definitions that need reconsideration and suggests proposals for further research to reach more practical and more clinically meaningful definitions.

### Efficacy of nondrug lifestyle measures for the treatment of nocturia [^117Y3GVh]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Nocturia has a major impact on quality of life and affects numerous aspects of health. Lifestyle modifications are expected to be helpful in improving nocturia. However, the efficacy of this strategy has not been established. We tested the efficacy of nondrug lifestyle measures as a first step in treating nocturia and found factors predictive of the efficacy of the intervention.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a prospective evaluation of 56 patients treated at 3 hospitals between 2005 and 2009 for symptomatic nocturia. The patients were advised to modify their lifestyle to improve nocturia. Lifestyle modifications consisted of 4 directives of 1) restriction of fluid intake, 2) refraining from excess hours in bed, 3) moderate daily exercise and 4) keeping warm in bed. The frequency volume chart, International Prostate Symptom Score, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index before and 4 weeks after the intervention were used to evaluate the efficacy of the therapy.

Results

Mean nocturnal voids and nocturnal urine volume decreased significantly from 3.6 to 2.7 (p < 0.0001) and from 923 to 768 mL (p = 0.0005), respectively. Of the 56 patients 26 (53.1%) showed an improvement of more than 1 episode. This treatment was significantly more effective in patients with a larger 24-hour urine production.

Conclusions

Nondrug lifestyle measures were effective in decreasing the number of nocturia episodes and improving patient quality of life. Patients with polyuria showed a better response to the treatment.

### Nocturia: "do the math" [^1159Kiet]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

We reviewed the definition and etiologies of nocturia, offering the current diagnostic procedures and standards of care.

Materials and Methods

We reviewed recent published literature regarding nocturia, along with current paradigms for diagnosis and management.

Results

Nocturia is common as a limited occurrence but troublesome if the patient regularly experiences more than 2 episodes during sleep hours. The 4 principle etiologies associated with nocturia (nocturnal polyuria, decreased nocturnal bladder capacity, mixed polyuria, and global polyuria) may be easily differentiated through mathematical analysis of a 24-hour bladder diary.

Conclusions

Nocturia is highly treatable in many patients. Identification of the precise type and its cause enable clinicians to minimize the inconvenience and sleep deprivation associated with nocturia.

### Is our current understanding and management of nocturia allowing improved care? International consultation on incontinence-research society 2018 [^113L7kyH]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

Nocturia or waking at night, to urinate is a common cause of awakenings and may lead to sleep disturbance, impaired somatic health, impaired quality of life, and increased mortality. The aim of this report is to point out and discuss the aspects and issues that need to be addressed to improve the care of nocturia.

Methods

This paper is a report of the presentations and subsequent discussion of a Think Tank session at the annual International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society (ICI-RS) in June 2018 in Bristol.

Results and Conclusion

Nocturia is a known risk factor for in-hospital falls. Unfortunately, its assessment in acutely hospitalized (older) people is not the current practice and ward-based care plans are not tailored to this symptom. A new care pathway for hospitalized patients who have nocturia should be considered. More research into the relation of cardiovascular disorders and nocturnal polyuria (NP) is warranted and management of NP patients may be improved by involving a cardiologist in their management. There is definitely a need for phenotyping nocturia in relation to bladder capacity, filling phase, and emptying phase symptoms and how to treat the different phenotypes. In the near future, smart automated monitoring devices and applications might help us to diagnose and treat nocturia with less efforts.

### Polyuria in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms: prevalence and etiology [^114En27E]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2023). Medium credibility.

The 2021 AUA guidelines for the surgical management of BPH do not recommend the routine use of bladder diaries in the initial workup of men with LUTS. The 2014 guideline panel did recommend use of bladder diaries for men experiencing > 2 nocturia episodes. Data from the present study, however, show that 41% of polyuria patients did not experience > 2 nocturnal voids. Therefore, based on the current and past AUA guidelines, failure to utilize bladder diaries in the initial workup of patients with LUTS would fail to identify 18%−41% of these polyuria patients who may benefit from a polyuria specific treatment pathway. The data in the past and present studies reinforce the appropriateness of phenotyping patients based on urinary output and exploring polyuria specific algorithms for patient management.

Polyuria patients with LUTS may simply experience symptoms due to excess fluid intake. However, restricting fluids in a patient with underlying pathologic conditions like DM, DI, or CKD could be very harmful and result in severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, coma and even death. Determination of the root causes of polyuria necessitates an exploration of the physiological mechanism behind their current disease etiology.

### A contemporary assessment of nocturia: definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management – a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Wi3D8]. European Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Nocturia is a common urologic symptom that has been covered in a variety of reported studies in the literature but is not specifically covered in current guidelines.

Objective

To comprehensively review the literature pertaining to the definition, etiologies, and consequences of nocturia and assess the evidence supporting the use of conservative medical and interventional therapy.

Evidence Acquisition

A literature search was conducted using the keyword nocturia, restricted to articles in the English language, after 2000 and before April 2012, in PubMed/Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases. Regarding treatment modalities, studies were included only if nocturia was a primary end point and if the studies were designed as randomized controlled trials without limit of date. When suitable, a meta-analysis was conducted. Papers covering treatment options for nocturia specifically related to nonurologic conditions were excluded.

Evidence Synthesis

Nocturia is still defined as the symptom of wakening from sleep once or more often to void. The prevalence is high in both genders and increases with age. Frequency-volume charts, which are the pivotal tool of clinical assessment, detect 24-h polyuria, nocturnal polyuria (NP), or reduced nocturnal bladder capacity and help to target specific nonurologic etiologies. Nocturia is a morbid condition that significantly affects quality of life and increases mortality. Besides behavioral measures, validated treatment options include oral desmopressin, which is superior to placebo in treating NP. While the level of evidence for desmopressin is high, limited data support the use of α1-blockers and antimuscarinics; however, only rarely has nocturia been a primary end point when studying these drug classes, and studies have not consistently controlled for the effect of NP.

Conclusions

Our knowledge of nocturia, its etiology, and its management has substantially improved in recent years. The evidence available on the management of nocturia remains limited; contributory factors include (1) the complexity of associated conditions, (2) the underuse of objective evaluation tools, and (3) the lack of specific focus on nocturia in clinical trials.

### Nocturia in patients with cognitive dysfunction: a systematic review of the literature [^1127aEng]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Nocturia is a complex and multifactorial condition, which may be the result of a primary abnormality of the genitourinary tract or a symptom of an underlying medical condition. The current framework for evaluation and management of nocturia broadly divides nocturia into four distinct etiologies: excessive nocturnal urine production ("nocturnal polyuria"), excessive 24-h urine production ("global polyuria"), reduced bladder capacity (functional or extrinsic), and sleep disorders (primary or secondary). However, the cause-and-effect relationship between nocturia and cognitive dysfunction remains poorly understood, and this may fall into overlapping pathophysiologic phenotypes. Nevertheless, the findings from this review suggests that nocturia is associated with cognitive impairment, and this could have consequential impacts on clinical practice. Indeed, it could make it possible to further appropriate assessment of signs or symptoms of memory loss in patients with nocturia, or to systematically look for this bothersome symptom in patients with cognitive dysfunction.

### European Association of Urology guidelines on the management of female non-neurogenic lower urinary tract symptoms. part 2: underactive bladder, bladder outlet obstruction, and nocturia [^114VzvfU]. European Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Context

Female lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are a common presentation in urological practice. Thus far, only a limited number of female LUTS conditions have been included in the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines compendium. The new non-neurogenic female LUTS guidelines expand the remit to include these symptoms and conditions.

Objective

To summarise the management of underactive bladder (UAB), bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), and nocturia in females.

Evidence Acquisition

The literature search was updated in September 2021 and evidence synthesis was conducted using modified GRADE approach as outlined for all EAU guidelines. A new systematic review on BOO was carried out by the panel for purposes of this guideline.

Evidence Synthesis

The important considerations for informing guideline recommendations are presented, along with a summary of all the guideline recommendations.

Conclusions

Non-neurogenic female LUTS are an important presentation of urological dysfunction. Initial evaluation, diagnosis, and management should be carried out in a structured and logical fashion on the basis of the best available evidence. This guideline serves to present this evidence to practising urologists and other health care providers in an easily accessible and digestible format.

Patient Summary

This report summarises the main recommendations from the European Association of Urology guideline on symptoms and diseases of the female lower urinary tract (bladder and urethra) not associated with neurological disease. We cover recommendations related to the treatment of underactive bladder, obstruction of the bladder outlet, and nighttime urination.

### Diagnosis of urinary incontinence [^112fxrZA]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Urinary incontinence is common, increases in prevalence with age, and affects quality of life for men and women. The initial evaluation occurs in the family physician's office and generally does not require urologic or gynecologic evaluation. The basic workup is aimed at identifying possible reversible causes. If no reversible cause is identified, then the incontinence is considered chronic. The next step is to determine the type of incontinence (urge, stress, overflow, mixed, or functional) and the urgency with which it should be treated. These determinations are made using a patient questionnaire, such as the 3 Incontinence Questions, an assessment of other medical problems that may contribute to incontinence, a discussion of the effect of symptoms on the patient's quality of life, a review of the patient's completed voiding diary, a physical examination, and, if stress incontinence is suspected, a cough stress test. Other components of the evaluation include laboratory tests and measurement of postvoid residual urine volume. If the type of urinary incontinence is still not clear, or if red flags such as hematuria, obstructive symptoms, or recurrent urinary tract infections are present, referral to a urologist or urogynecologist should be considered.

### Nocturia: new directions [^1134oVhY]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2011). Low credibility.

The Nocturia Think Tank (TT) met during the 2010 meeting of the International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society to discuss present knowledge and future directions in care and research of this prominent component of the spectrum of lower urinary tract symptoms. Questions raised included whether nocturia should be re-defined as a function of its bother, effects on quality of life, and economic impact upon society. At issue is the need to delineate the determinants of successful nocturia management. The multifactorial nature of nocturia requires that progress in its treatment will be dependent upon the cooperative investigation on the part of urologists, urogynecologists, geriatricians, epidemiologists, medical economists and pharma. Areas for future avenues of research were outlined at the conclusion of the meeting.

### Basic concepts in nocturia, based on international continence society standards in nocturnal lower urinary tract function [^1147Mo2Z]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

To review the recommendations on nocturia in the International Continence Society (ICS) Standardization documents, setting out key definitions and parameters for use in clinical practice.

Methods

Definitions and evaluations described in the ICS Standards on Nocturia and Terminology for Lower Urinary Tract Function were identified and summarized.

Results

The terms have been divided into signs and symptoms. Nocturia as a symptom is waking at night to pass urine and as a sign is the number of times an individual passes urine during their main sleep period. Nocturnal polyuria as a symptom is passing large volumes of urine at night and as a sign is the excessive production of urine during the individual's main sleep period. These should be quantified using a 3-day bladder diary, thereby facilitating identification of 24-h polyuria, nocturnal polyuria, lower urinary tract dysfunction, or sleep disorder.

Conclusions

The summary reflects the multifactorial influences in nocturia and provides a pragmatic insight into bladder diary analysis for deriving key parameters relevant to clinical therapy.

### EAU guidelines on the assessment of non-neurogenic male lower urinary tract symptoms including benign prostatic obstruction [^112PAAgq]. European Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) represent one of the most common clinical complaints in adult men and have multifactorial aetiology.

Objective

To develop European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on the assessment of men with non-neurogenic LUTS.

Evidence Acquisition

A structured literature search on the assessment of non-neurogenic male LUTS was conducted. Articles with the highest available level of evidence were selected. The Delphi technique consensus approach was used to develop the recommendations.

Evidence Synthesis

As a routine part of the initial assessment of male LUTS, a medical history must be taken, a validated symptom score questionnaire with quality-of-life question(s) should be completed, a physical examination including digital rectal examination should be performed, urinalysis must be ordered, post-void residual urine (PVR) should be measured, and uroflowmetry may be performed. Micturition frequency-volume charts or bladder diaries should be used to assess male LUTS with a prominent storage component or nocturia. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) should be measured only if a diagnosis of prostate cancer will change the management or if PSA can assist in decision-making for patients at risk of symptom progression and complications. Renal function must be assessed if renal impairment is suspected from the history and clinical examination, if the patient has hydronephrosis, or when considering surgical treatment for male LUTS. Uroflowmetry should be performed before any treatment. Imaging of the upper urinary tract in men with LUTS should be performed in patients with large PVR, haematuria, or a history of urolithiasis. Imaging of the prostate should be performed if this assists in choosing the appropriate drug and when considering surgical treatment. Urethrocystoscopy should only be performed in men with LUTS to exclude suspected bladder or urethral pathology and/or before minimally invasive/surgical therapies if the findings may change treatment. Pressure-flow studies should be performed only in individual patients for specific indications before surgery or when evaluation of the pathophysiology underlying LUTS is warranted.

Conclusions

These guidelines provide evidence-based practical guidance for assessment of non-neurogenic male LUTS. An extended version is available online (www.uroweb.org/guidelines).

Patient Summary

This article presents a short version of European Association of Urology guidelines for non-neurogenic male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The recommended tests should be able to distinguish between uncomplicated male LUTS and possible differential diagnoses and to evaluate baseline parameters for treatment. The guidelines also define the clinical profile of patients to provide the best evidence-based care. An algorithm was developed to guide physicians in using appropriate diagnostic tests.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^111Cqh7P]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU guideline — initial evaluation of idiopathic overactive bladder (OAB) states that clinicians should not routinely perform urodynamics (UDS), cystoscopy, or urinary tract imaging in the initial evaluation of patients with OAB, and that clinicians may perform advanced testing, such as UDS, cystoscopy, or urinary tract imaging, in the initial evaluation of patients with OAB when diagnostic uncertainty exists. The initial evaluation of patients with symptoms of OAB should include a medical history, physical examination, and urinalysis, and additional components of an OAB evaluation may also include post-void residual (PVR) measurement, voiding diary, and a symptom questionnaire. There is no need to obtain UDS, cystoscopy, or upper tract imaging in the initial evaluation of a patient with OAB symptoms, but further evaluation with UDS, cystoscopy, and/or urinary tract imaging can be considered to clarify diagnosis when diagnostic uncertainty or abnormal findings exist and can also be considered if patients have a suboptimal or unexpected response to standard OAB therapy.

### Development of the impact of nighttime urination (INTU) questionnaire to assess the impact of nocturia on health and functioning [^115bDerr]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

This study describes development of the Impact of Nighttime Urination (INTU) questionnaire to assess nocturia impacts on health and functioning.

Methods

Development of the questionnaire followed an iterative patient-directed process as recommended by current guidance for patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. An initial 15-item questionnaire was devised based on reviewing the published literature, and then modified through four rounds of semi-structured interviews of 28 individuals with nocturia. In each round, open-ended concept elicitation, followed by cognitive debriefing, was used to assess the questionnaire. Items were modified based on participants' responses and incorporated into the next round of interviews.

Results

In all rounds, participants reported that their experiences were easy to recall and report on a daily basis and that the burden of completing the questionnaire was low. The final questionnaire has a same-day recall period. It includes six daytime impact items-having limited concentration, a sense of feeling tired, difficulty getting things done, irritability, not feeling rested, and drowsiness-and four items that measure the nighttime impact of nocturia-patient concern, waking up too early, difficulty getting enough sleep, and feeling bothered by having to get up at night to void. Responses follow a 5- or 4-point scale. The final INTU captures the key concepts associated with nocturia as confirmed by cognitive debriefing.

Conclusions

Development of the 10-item INTU, a nocturia-specific PRO measure, was based on direct input and feedback from patients and has demonstrated that it captures the patient-reported impacts of nocturia.

### International continence society (ICS) report on the terminology for nocturia and nocturnal lower urinary tract function [^1156LrKu]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The terminology for nocturia and nocturnal lower urinary tract function is reviewed and updated in a clinically and practically-based consensus report.

Methods

This report has been created by a Working Group under the auspices and guidelines of the International Continence Society (ICS) Standardisation Steering Committee (SSC). All relevant definitions were updated on the basis of research over the last 16 years since the publication of the first nocturia standardization document in 2002. An extensive process of 16 rounds of internal and external reviews was involved to examine each definition exhaustively, with decision-making by collective opinion (consensus).

Results

A clinically-based terminology report for nocturia and nocturnal lower urinary tract function, encompassing five key definitions divided into signs and symptoms has been developed. Clarity and user-friendliness have been key aims to make it interpretable by healthcare professionals and allied healthcare practitioners involved in the care of individuals with nocturnal lower urinary tract function.

Conclusion

A consensus-based terminology report for nocturia and nocturnal lower urinary tract function has been produced to aid clinical practice and research.

### The evaluation of nocturia in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia and the analysis of the curative effect after medical or placebo therapy for nocturia: a randomized placebo-controlled study [^116yjjhX]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Nocturia, is perceived as one single symptoms of all lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) by most men, which is highly prevalent and the most bothersome component. It has led to significant morbidity and, occasionally, mortality. Scholars have pointed out that, this bothersome symptom is related to cause arousal from sleep, and two or more voids per night are usually considered lead to a decreased health-related quality of life. Nocturia could result from many others disease and conditions (including urological and non-urological diseases). However, the various causes are not differentiated excluded in men with LUTS/BPH, and none of the individual α 1 -adrenoceptor antagonists without subtype selectivity have obvious benefit. The medical therapy have not shown a significant reduction in frequency of nocturia so far. There are also not equal amounts of studies showing positive or negative results on nocturia. For all of these reasons, nocturia is often multifactorial in etiology, and many medical conditions are associated with nocturia. Therefore, we aim to explore nocturia in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia, and we analyzed the curative effect after medical therapy for nocturia.

### Incidence and remission of nocturia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116njYMn]. European Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Although vital for decision-making about management, the natural history of nocturia remains uncertain. A systematic review would clarify the issue, but because natural history reviews are uncommon it would require methodological innovations.

Objective

To estimate the incidence and remission of nocturia, and refine methods for meta-analyses assessing natural history.

Evidence Acquisition

We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, and Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases and abstracts of major urologic meetings as far as August 31, 2015. Random effects meta-analyses addressed incidence/remission rates of nocturia; meta-regression explored potential determinants of heterogeneity. Studies were categorized as either low or high risk of bias using a novel instrument specifically designed for longitudinal symptom studies aimed at the general population.

Evidence Synthesis

Of 4165 potentially relevant reports, 16 proved eligible. Pooled estimates from 13 studies (114 964 person-years of follow-up) demonstrated that annual incidence was strongly associated with age: 0.4% (0–0.8%) for adults aged < 40 yr; 2.8% (1.9–3.7%) for adults aged 40–59 yr; and 11.5% (9.1–14.0%) for adults aged ≥ 60 yr. Of those with nocturia, each year 12.1% (9.5–14.7%) experienced remission.

Conclusions

The available evidence suggests that nocturia onset is strongly associated with age, with much higher rates in those over 60 yr; remission occurs in approximately 12% each year. These estimates can aid with management decisions and counseling related to nocturia.

Patient Summary

We reviewed all previous studies of progression of night-time urination (nocturia). We found that in any given year 0.4% of adults aged < 40 yr, 3% of adults aged 40–59 yr, and 12% of adults aged ≥ 60 yr will develop nocturia, while overall 12% of those with nocturia will improve. These findings may be helpful in making decisions about coping with or treating nocturia.

### The evaluation of nocturia in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia and the analysis of the curative effect after medical or placebo therapy for nocturia: a randomized placebo-controlled study [^115h9r11]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

In this study, between the NP group and the non-NP group, there was a significant difference in LUTS duration, maximum urine volume, morning urine volume, nocturnal urine volume, daytime urination, and 4-h before falling asleep drinking water volume. The frequency of daytime micturition and LUTS duration were the indices between the NP group and the non-NP group. A long disease history and more frequent daytime urination were considered the non-NP type, and α-blocker drug treatment could improve this type of nocturia. Nocturia could also be alleviated by treating the other causes, such as increased water drinking before going to bed.

This study had some limitations, including a small sample size and the assessment with regard to short-term use of medication. Future studies of patients with LUTS/BPH and nocturia should, therefore, also include nocturia-specific instruments to correctly classify the underlying pathologies for nighttime voiding, and hence, provide a rationale for the treatment of all LUTS/BPH causes.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction: diagnosis and evaluation [^113CEiiR]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) initial evaluation — At initial evaluation, all patients with NLUTD should undergo a detailed history, physical exam, and urinalysis (Clinical Principle), and patients with NLUTD who spontaneously void should undergo post-void residual measurement (Clinical Principle). Optional studies include a voiding/catheterization diary, pad test, and non-invasive uroflow (Expert Opinion). For low-risk NLUTD, the clinician should not routinely obtain upper tract imaging, renal function assessment, or multichannel urodynamics (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C), whereas for unknown-risk NLUTD, the clinician should obtain upper tract imaging, renal function assessment, and multichannel urodynamics (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). In the patient with an acute neurological event resulting in NLUTD, the clinician should perform risk stratification once the neurological condition has stabilized (Clinical Principle), and clinicians should not perform routine cystoscopy in the initial evaluation of the NLUTD patient (Clinical Principle).

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^113qdfqY]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) — nocturia burden and evaluation are emphasized as follows: The most prevalent and bothersome symptom of the LUTS is nocturia, which is also associated with increases in overall mortality. The differential diagnosis of increased nighttime urination frequency/volumes and the role of sleep apnea are highlighted as important, and nocturia is often multifactorial in origin and symptomatic of other medical problems, further complicating effective management. Due to the considerable burden of nocturia on quality of life (QoL) and a lack of effective management options, more funded research is needed, and nocturia, whether global, reduced bladder capacity, or mixed, is described as a unique symptom complex requiring special concern and judicious evaluation.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction: diagnosis and evaluation [^114c4GJ2]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) — initial evaluation optional studies — states: "At initial evaluation, optional studies in patients with NLUTD include a voiding/catheterization diary, pad test, and non-invasive uroflow. (Expert Opinion)". Multiple adjunctive studies such as a voiding diary, pad test, and non-invasive uroflowmetry may be useful in the initial assessment of some individuals with NLUTD and are selectively utilized where they may provide additional diagnostic or prognostic information or direct clinical management. A voiding and intake ("bladder") diary captures the timing and volumes of micturition, the number of incontinence episodes, and other details, and the same data can be captured in a catheterization diary for those who use CIC; consistent with this, "the diary is considered optional in the NLUTD patient where it may assist in diagnosis or inform clinical decision making". The guideline notes "very little normative data" and "only sparse literature supporting its use" in NLUTD. Patients who cannot provide accurate intake and voiding information from recall "should be directed to complete a diary", and compared to patient report, "the voiding diary is generally considered a more accurate assessment of at least some micturition variables in the non-neurogenic patient population", with data that "can have utility for patient counseling and directing initial and subsequent treatment in some NLUTD patients".

### Medical treatment of nocturia in men with lower urinary tract symptoms: systematic review by the European Association of Urology guidelines panel for male lower urinary tract symptoms [^111638gy]. European Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Context

The treatment of nocturia is a key challenge due to the multi-factorial pathophysiology of the symptom and the disparate outcome measures used in research.

Objective

To assess and compare available therapy options for nocturia, in terms of symptom severity and quality of life.

Evidence Acquisition

Medical databases (Embase, Medline, Cochrane Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central) were searched with no date restriction. Comparative studies were included which studied adult men with nocturia as the primary presentation and lower urinary tract symptoms including nocturia or nocturnal polyuria. Outcomes were symptom severity, quality of life, and harms.

Evidence Synthesis

We identified 44 articles. Antidiuretic therapy using dose titration was more effective than placebo in relation to nocturnal voiding frequency and duration of undisturbed sleep; baseline serum sodium is a key selection criterion. Screening for hyponatremia (< 130 mmol/l) must be undertaken at baseline, after initiation or dose titration, and during treatment. Medications to treat lower urinary tract dysfunction (α-1 adrenergic antagonists, 5-α reductase inhibitors, phosphodiesterase type 5inhibitor, antimuscarinics, beta-3 agonist, and phytotherapy) were generally not significantly better than placebo in short-term use. Benefits with combination therapies were not consistently observed. Other medications (diuretics, agents to promote sleep, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories) were sometimes associated with response or quality of life improvement. The recommendations of the Guideline Panel are presented.

Conclusions

Issues of trial design make therapy of nocturia a challenging topic. The range of contributory factors relevant in nocturia makes it desirable to identify predictors of response to guide therapy. Consistent responses were reported for titrated antidiuretic therapy. For other therapies, responses were less certain, and potentially of limited clinical benefit.

Patient Summary

This review provides an overview of the current drug treatments of nocturia, which is the need to wake at night to pass urine. The symptom can be caused by several different medical conditions, and measuring its severity and impact varies in separate research studies. No single treatment deals with the symptom in all contexts, and careful assessment is essential to make suitable treatment selection.

### The evaluation of nocturia in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia and the analysis of the curative effect after medical or placebo therapy for nocturia: a randomized placebo-controlled study [^116WxsN2]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

In our study, 80 patients were randomized to drug treatment (tamsulosin) and 68 patients were randomized to placebo treatment. The scores and the data (include I-PSS score, storage symptom score, voiding symptom score, quality of life score, frequency of daytime urination, maximum urine volume, and morning urine volume) were all statistically significant. However, the frequency of nocturia score and the nocturnal urine volume did not change significantly. The traditional tool for evaluating nocturia was the I-PSS in nocturia subtype score, which was not described in detail. Whatsmore, the important and detailed information of nocturia may not be fully captured by the I-PSS questionnaire alone. Michel et al. thought that the I-PSS (QoL and Nocturia score) can't show how nocturia decreases sleep quality. Therefore, a thorough evaluation of any treatment of nocturia requires using a method for measuring the treatment impact on sleep quality and QoL. The international consultation on incontinence questionnaire (ICIQ) N-QoL is developed by Abraham et al. and it is a validated questionnaire that can measure the deterioration of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) due to nocturia in general. In our study, we also found it was just a basic assessment of the patient's own quality of life use I-PSS (QoL) score. On the one hand we worried about patients' coordination and understanding, on the other hand we ignored the importance of nocturia to quality of life. The (ICIQ) N-QoL et al. should be used to evaluate nocturia on quality of life in further study.

### Urinary urgency and frequency: what should a clinician do? [^116rJpR8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Obstetrician-gynecologists often care for women with urinary symptoms of urgency and frequency. These symptoms are bothersome and treatable. Although it is rare that serious disease is causative, the clinician must be alert to ominous signs and physical findings. Most patients experience relief of their symptoms after a simple initial evaluation with appropriately directed treatment. A step-wise evaluation includes the directed history and physical, assessment of urinary habits, typically with a urinary diary, and occasionally an assessment of voiding efficiency, typically with a postvoid residual. Treatments may include myofascial therapy when trigger points are present on physical examination. Behavioral therapy and pharmaceuticals also play an important role. Persistent symptoms, hematuria, severe de novo postoperative symptoms, and ominous physical findings may warrant specialty consultation.

### Nocturia as a marker of poor health: causal associations to inform care [^112meeJD]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

Nocturia is a common symptom of many conditions and is encountered in patients presenting to services across different medical specialities and health disciplines. The causal pathway of nocturia is multi-factorial and differs between patients. There is currently no symptom-specific clinical algorithm for all-cause diagnosis of nocturia. The aim of this study was to investigate the interrelationships between causes of nocturia in order to inform the development of a comprehensive multidisciplinary assessment metric.

Methods

A PubMed search that identified studies reporting relationships between nocturia and a priori aetiological factors was conducted by cross referencing the term "nocturia" with "polyuria, postural hypotension, hypertension, cardiac function, heart failure, depression, anxiety, polypharmacy, sleep disturbance, sleep disorder, apnoea, and lower urinary tract symptoms". Directed acyclic graphs (DAGS) were constructed to visually represent causal assumptions and to identify underlying relationships.

Results

This study confirmed that causality of nocturia can be expressed in a directed acyclic graph, with the key variables being cardiovascular dysfunction, polyuria, sleep disturbance, mental health, metabolic and inflammatory changes, health status and lower urinary tract symptoms. None of the variables were independently a sufficient or necessary direct cause of nocturia and multiple backdoor pathways exist to nocturnal voiding. Polypharmacy, increasing age and BMI all have confounding effects.

Conclusions

There are significant interactions between voiding at night and metabolic, cardiovascular, hormonal, mental health, sleep and inflammatory changes that flag nocturia as a likely marker of co-morbid poor health. Patients should be comprehensively evaluated for all-causes of nocturia since multiple aetiologies commonly co-exist. Neurourol. Urodynam. 36:697–705, 2017. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AUA/SUFU Guideline — initial evaluation and telemedicine for overactive bladder (OAB) emphasizes that in the initial office evaluation of patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of OAB, clinicians should obtain a medical history with comprehensive assessment of bladder symptoms, conduct a physical examination, and perform a urinalysis to exclude microhematuria and infection (Clinical Principle). Clinicians may offer telemedicine to initially evaluate patients with symptoms suggestive of OAB with the understanding that a physical exam will not be performed and urinalysis should be obtained at a local laboratory (or recent lab results reviewed, if available) (Expert Opinion).

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction: diagnosis and evaluation [^114yR1zc]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) guideline — scope and methodology — states this is a guideline for adults and that pediatric NLUTD will not be discussed; it describes initial evaluation tools beyond history, physical examination, and urinalysis, including voiding diaries, questionnaires (e.g. NBSS, Qualiveen), post-void residual (PVR), uroflow, urodynamics (UDS), renal ultrasound (US), and cystoscopy, noting that not all NLUTD patients need all studies; after initial evaluation, patients are placed into three risk levels (low; medium; high) that determine surveillance. The literature search for systematic reviews used MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library in October 2017 and was rerun in February 2021 to identify publications from October 2017 through 2021; where no existing or incomplete reviews were found, PubMed (MEDLINE) and Embase were systematically searched using an a priori PICO. Databases were searched for primary studies from January 2001 through October 2017 with a rerun in February 2021. Study selection considered randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and case-control studies; although studies of any sample size were included, only those enrolling at least 30 patients were used to inform recommendation statements, and case series, letters, editorials, in vitro studies, animal models, and non-English publications were excluded.

European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendation: Urinalysis should be performed at initial evaluation and when clinically indicated at follow‐up visits for individuals with neurological diseases and urinary symptoms. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 94%).

Clinical Question 4. Should urine cultures versus no testing be offered for individuals with neurological disease and urinary symptoms?

Quantitative urine culture is used to diagnose a UTI by testing for the type of organisms and antibiotic sensitivity, and should be performed only in patients with symptoms such as dysuria, cloudy and/or malodorous urine, lower abdominal pain, and fever.

Recommendation: A urine culture should be performed for individuals with neurological diseases reporting urinary symptoms only if there is a suspicion of a UTI. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 91%).

Clinical Question 5. Should individuals with neurological diseases reporting urinary symptoms complete a bladder diary versus not complete a bladder diary?

Recording fluid intake, ideally together with urine output, helps to corroborate the history, recognize beverages and drinking habits detrimental to urinary symptoms, and provide an assessment of the functional bladder capacity. Nocturnal polyuria and polydipsia can be diagnosed only by using a bladder diary.

Recommendation: A three‐day bladder diary should be completed by individuals with neurological diseases having urinary problems at initial evaluation and at follow‐up visits when clinically indicated to provide an objective assessment of urinary symptoms. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 94%).

Clinical Question 6. Should individuals with neurological disease reporting urinary symptoms have their post‐void residual measured vs. not have their post‐void residual measured?

Post‐void residual volume is defined as the volume of urine left in the urinary bladder at the end of micturition and is a valuable indicator of bladder emptying.

### The evaluation of nocturia in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia and the analysis of the curative effect after medical or placebo therapy for nocturia: a randomized placebo-controlled study [^115a8NTV]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Nocturia, one of the most bothersome symptoms of LUTS, has been the focus of a high volume of rapidly evolving research. The purpose of this study was to describe the relevant recent research in the field of nocturia in China, with particular emphasis on its evaluation and management. Nocturia is a complicated clinical entity that is often multifactorial in etiology. Experts of the International Continence Society (ICS) define nocturia as the general complaint when an individual (independent of age, gender, cause(s) and associated bother) must wake up at night one or more times to void.

Epidemiological studies showed that the prevalence of nocturia in the < 30-year-old population was approximately 3%, in the 60- to 69-year-old population was 30%, and in the > 70-year-old population was 40%. The survey regarding > 60-year-old men in the United States demonstrated that up to 65.2% of old men would get up at night to urinate, of whom 25% of elderly males woke up at night to urinate ≥ 2 times. A Chinese questionnaire study showed that in patients living in the national scope, the storage symptoms of I-PSS were the most troubling symptoms of BPH in patients, in which nocturia was the most affecting. Schatzl reported that more than 60% of old people thought nocturia would negatively affect their quality of life. Recently, a study showed that the mortality rate of the elderly with nocturia was significantly higher (more than 3 times) than that of the elderly without nocturia (less than 3 times).

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction: diagnosis and evaluation [^11564Gta]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) unknown-risk initial evaluation — At initial evaluation in patients with unknown-risk NLUTD, the clinician should obtain upper tract imaging, renal function assessment, and multichannel urodynamics (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C), supported by two observational studies with an aggregate very serious risk of bias. The guideline notes that in some individuals with NLUTD the risk of complications remains unknown after initial history, physical examination, PVR, and UA, and that accurate risk stratification is not possible without additional evaluations including multichannel UDS and upper urinary tract assessment with functional tests and imaging; accordingly, NLUTD patients not stratified as low-risk should also undergo upper tract assessment with imaging and functional studies, and an initial assessment with multichannel UDS will provide additional information to judge more accurate risk stratification in patients at unknown-risk at presentation.

AUA/SUFU Guideline on Overactive Bladder — initial evaluation and testing: Clinicians may offer telemedicine to initially evaluate patients with symptoms suggestive of OAB, with the understanding that a physical exam will not be performed and urinalysis should be obtained at a local laboratory (or recent lab results reviewed, if available). Clinicians may obtain a post-void residual in patients with symptoms suggestive of OAB to exclude incomplete emptying or urinary retention, especially in patients with concomitant voiding or emptying symptoms. Clinicians may obtain a symptom questionnaire and/or a voiding diary in patients with symptoms suggestive of OAB to assist in the diagnosis of OAB, exclude other disorders, ascertain the degree of bother, and/or evaluate treatment response. Clinicians should not routinely perform urodynamics, cystoscopy, or urinary tract imaging in the initial evaluation of patients with OAB. Clinicians may perform advanced testing, such as urodynamics, cystoscopy, or urinary tract imaging in the initial evaluation of patients with OAB when diagnostic uncertainty exists. Clinicians should assess for comorbid conditions in patients with OAB that may contribute to urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urgency urinary incontinence and should educate patients on the role that managing these conditions can have on bladder symptoms. Clinicians may use telemedicine for follow-up visits with patients with OAB.

### A multisite feasibility study of integrated cognitive-behavioral treatment for co-existing nocturia and chronic insomnia [^113dDXuN]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The research conducted in this planning study is the first step toward changing the research and clinical practice paradigms for nocturia and insomnia, which have traditionally been treated separately with condition‐specific protocols. Future studies that seek to integrate protocols for improving care of patients with co‐existing conditions, especially those that typically are treated by different specialists, may benefit from a similar planning approach.

### The evaluation of nocturia in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia and the analysis of the curative effect after medical or placebo therapy for nocturia: a randomized placebo-controlled study [^1129dsC8]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

BPH is a common disease in elderly men, not only with voiding symptoms such as dysuria but also with storage symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency, and nocturia. Clinical studies showed that the application of α-blockers and 5α-reductase inhibitors could effectively relieve lower urinary tract symptoms caused by BPH, but the efficacy in improving nocturia was not obvious.

Tacklind thought that doxazosin and terazosin were significantly more effective than finasteride in improving nocturia, while no difference was found with tamsulosin. This lack of specificity precluded prostatic surgery, such as transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), from being the first-line therapy for nocturia. The symptoms of nocturia could not be improved in most patients. Nonetheless, various groups had reported decreases in nocturia after surgery in specific patient populations. In another study, Wada et al. evaluated the effect of TURP on nocturia in patients with LUTS/BPH. Nocturnal voids reduced from 3.0 to 1.9 per night after surgical treatment, which showed significant difference. Yoshimura et al. reported that 505 cases of patients with BPH after drug treatment of tamsulosin and TURP surgery decreased the frequency of nocturia in patients by 17.9 and 32.2%, respectively, but the efficacy in improving nocturia was not obvious. Additional studies were warranted to validate and substantiate these findings. Though such treatments were unlikely to benefit most patients with nocturia, they could be tried in select cases.

### Management and treatment of nocturnal enuresis-an updated standardization document from the international children's continence society [^111enxt1]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Enuresis is an extremely common condition, which, although somatically benign, poses long-term psychosocial risks if untreated. There are still many misconceptions regarding the proper management of these children.

Aim

A cross-professional team of experts affiliated with the International Children's Continence Society (ICCS) undertook to update the previous guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of children with enuresis.

Methods

The document used the globally accepted ICCS terminology. Evidence-based literature served as the basis, but in areas lacking in primary evidence, expert consensus was used. Before submission, a full draft was made available to all ICCS members for additional comments.

Results

The enuretic child does, in the absence of certain warning signs (i.e., voiding difficulties, excessive thirst), not need blood tests, radiology or urodynamic assessment. Active therapy is recommended from the age of 6 years. The most important comorbid conditions to take into account are psychiatric disorders, constipation, urinary tract infections and snoring or sleep apneas. Constipation and daytime incontinence, if present, should be treated. In nonmonosymptomatic enuresis, it is recommended that basic advice regarding voiding and drinking habits be provided. In monosymptomatic enuresis, or if the above strategy did not make the child dry, the first-line treatment modalities are desmopressin or the enuresis alarm. If both these therapies fail alone or in combination, anticholinergic treatment is a possible next step. If the child is unresponsive to initial therapy, antidepressant treatment may be considered by the expert. Children with concomitant sleep disordered breathing may become dry if the airway obstruction is removed.

### Psychometric evaluation of the nocturia sleep quality scale based on data from a prospective observational study [^115uSixv]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

The Nocturia Sleep Quality Scale (NSQS), a novel patient-reported outcomes measure, was developed to assess the impact of sleep disturbance from nocturia. The objective of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of the NSQS, including its structure, reliability, and validity.

Methods

Data were collected in the context of a web-based, prospective, longitudinal, observational study. Participants with nocturia were randomized 1:1 to either a group that received sleep hygiene instructions, including instructions to limit liquids at nighttime and empty bladder prior to bedtime, or one that did not receive sleep instructions. All participants were asked to provide responses to the web-based questionnaires from day 1 to day 10. Psychometric analyses, aligned with current regulatory guidance, were conducted to evaluate the daily scores and 3-day average scores of NSQS items and potential composites. Item-level analyses were conducted first, followed by composite-level analyses.

Results

The NSQS items and supporting measures demonstrated very slight improvement in patient-perceived sleep disturbance from nocturia over the course of the study. NSQS test-retest reliabilities were generally satisfactory. Correlations between NSQS items and related patient-reported measures tended to support the construct validity of the NSQS, and the known-groups analyses supplied evidence of its discriminating ability. NSQS responsiveness statistics were small.

Conclusions

The NSQS is a reliable and valid measure of the impact of nocturia on patients' sleep. The present analyses lay the psychometric groundwork for the use of the NSQS in future clinical trials to support product approval and labeling claims.

### Renal angina: concept and development of pretest probability assessment in acute kidney injury [^111R8ksb]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The use of advanced diagnostics (that is, beyond history and physical examination) forms a cornerstone of modern medicine. For any given diagnostic test, the context of that test is a critical component for the interpretation of the results. This context is referred to as pretest probability and forms the basis for the interpretation of any diagnostic test. For instance, if a young healthy pregnant woman presented for a medical examination and had a very elevated prostate specific antigen value, the patient's physician can safely dismiss this as a specious result. However, if the patient was a 70-year-old man with nocturia with the same elevated prostate specific antigen value, the clinician would arrive at a different conclusion. While this is an extreme example, it demonstrates the simple rule that all clinicians follow: the value of any diagnostic study without clinical context is minimized. The assessment of pretest probability for any diagnosis is informed by all of the core aspects of a medical examination (that is, history, physical examination, and all available medical information). The integration of these data then informs a differential diagnosis that guides the selection and interpretation of diagnostic studies.

### The evaluation of nocturia in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia and the analysis of the curative effect after medical or placebo therapy for nocturia: a randomized placebo-controlled study [^111FEnBi]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Nocturia evaluation index

Nocturia, specifically, was the number of voids recorded during the nighttime. The first morning void was excluded from the count because it is not followed by sleep. Nocturnal urine volume describes the amount of urine excreted during the nighttime and includes the volume of the first morning void because this urine has been produced during the nighttime. Nocturnal polyuria is an abnormally large urine volume produced during the nighttime. The ICS classifies nocturnal polyuria as the nocturnal urine volume divided by the 24-h urine volume (i.e. nocturnal polyuria index, NPi). The ICS defines nocturnal polyuria as NPi > 33% in the elderly.

Statistical analysis

SPSS 22.0 statistical software was used for data analysis. All variables were expressed as the mean ± SD values. The numerical data were compared using the unpaired t -test. An analysis of the difference in the number of patients with nocturia before and after treatment was performed using McNemar's test. A multivariate analysis was performed. A P-value of 0.05 or less was considered significant.

### Terminology, epidemiology, etiology, and pathophysiology of nocturia [^116iuVmq]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2014). Low credibility.

Nocturia, awaking from sleep to void, has a negative impact on health and well-being. Nocturia affects men and women and is more prevalent among the elderly. More than two nocturnal voids is considered to be a clinically meaningful threshold associated with significant negative outcomes for health and well-being, and the timing of awakening has a significant bearing on the negative consequences of nocturia. Several serious underlying pathophysiologic conditions may be associated with nocturia. A thorough history and assessment of number and times of voids, void volume, and fluid intake is essential for determining the etiology of a patient's nocturia. With data obtained from the frequency-volume chart (FVC), which is used to collect quantitative voiding data, a patient's nocturia may be classified as global polyuria, nocturnal polyuria, reduced bladder capacity, or a combination of these categories. Global polyuria is defined as 24-hr urinary output that exceeds 40 ml/kg body weight and results in increased 24-hr urinary frequency. Nocturnal polyuria is defined as more than 20% of daily urine output at night in young patients and more than 33% in elderly patients. Reduced bladder capacity may be a result of idiopathic or neurogenic detrusor overactivity, bladder outlet obstruction, or reduced nocturnal bladder capacity. The pathophysiology underlying the findings of the FVC falls into five main categories: global polyuria, nocturnal polyuria, reduced bladder capacity, sleep disorders, and circadian clock disorders. This review discusses the epidemiology, etiology, and pathophysiology of nocturia.

It adds that measurement options include "voiding diaries with or without frequency-volume charts and patient-rated global response scales for urgency, urgency incontinence, incontinence, frequency and nocturia", and that "validated OAB-specific instruments may be used to assess the impact of OAB symptoms on quality of life". It further advises, "Ideally, clinicians should obtain baseline measures using the same instruments in order to quantify progress" and "Patients should be encouraged to persist with a particular treatment for four to eight weeks; this time period will identify the majority of responders".

Adult urodynamics — uroflowmetry (Guideline Statement 15) indicates: Uroflow may be used by clinicians in the initial and ongoing evaluation of male patients with LUTS that suggest an abnormality of voiding/emptying. (Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C) Although the literature reviewed fails to specifically identify clinical scenarios when uroflowmetry is useful, the panel believes that this test has value in the evaluation of disorders of voiding, even if further testing is required to make a specific diagnosis, and uroflowmetry can also be used for monitoring treatment outcomes and correlating symptoms with objective findings; risks/harms of uroflowmetry include false positives and negatives, results should be interpreted in light of potential artifact, peak and mean can be affected by volume voided and test circumstances, and serial measurements that are consistent, similar and comparable provide the most valuable information; the panel supports the use of uroflowmetry in the initial diagnosis and follow-up of LUTS in men, while the correlation of urinary symptoms and uroflow in women is not as well understood.

### The evaluation of nocturia in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia and the analysis of the curative effect after medical or placebo therapy for nocturia: a randomized placebo-controlled study [^111TXN7s]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

To study nocturia in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) after medical or placebo treatment.

Methods

Patients with LUTS suggestive of BPH from several community clinics were included. Patients completed the International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) questionnaire and a 3-day voiding diary. Urinalysis, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement, and prostate ultrasonography were performed. Nocturnal polyuria (NP) was defined as a nocturnal urine fraction exceeding one third of the daily urine output in elderly men. A total of 148 outpatients were randomized to drug treatment (tamsulosin) or placebo treatment. After 8 weeks of treatment, they were re-evaluated using a 3-day voiding diary, PSA measurement, prostate volume (PV), I-PSS, etc.

Results

The average I-PSS score was 20.3, storage symptom score was 11.7, voiding symptom score was 8.6, quality of life (QoL) score was 3.7, PV was 40.4 ± 19.4 ml, and nocturnal urine volume (NUV) was 845.7 ± 339.0 ml. The mean frequency of nocturia was 2.3 ± 1.1 per day, and 94% of the patients had a nocturia frequency of more than two times per day. Of these patients, 76.5% had NP. A significant correlation was found between NUV and the amount of water intake at night and 4 h before sleep (r = 0.419, P = 0.002; r = 0.302, P = 0.031). Eighty patients were randomized to drug treatment (tamsulosin) and 68 patients were randomized to placebo treatment. The I-PSS score was 16.8 ± 4.9 to 19.3 ± 5.0 (p = 0.002), the storage symptom score was 10.3 ± 3.4 to 10.7 ± 3.4 (p = 0.007), and the voiding symptom score was 7.5 ± 2.4 to 8.6 ± 2.3 (p = 0.003). The frequency of daytime urination was 7.5 ± 2.6 to 8.1 ± 2.6 (p = 0.002), maximum urine volume (ml) was 372.8 ± 103.3 to 302.8 ± 119.3 (p = 0.007), and morning urine volume (ml) was 280.5 ± 111.7 to 259.5 ± 100.7 (p = 0.003). However, the frequency of nocturia score was 2.8 ± 0.7 to 3.0 ± 0.6 (p = 0.306) and the nocturnal urine volume (ml) was 800.7 ± 323.0 to 845.7 ± 303.5 (p = 0.056), which did not change significantly. There were significant differences between the NP and non-NP groups in the duration of LUTS, first voided urine volume, daytime urination frequency, and the amount of water intake at night and 4 h before sleep.

Conclusions

Among the symptoms of LUTS, the improvement rates for nocturia were the lowest after medical treatment for BPH. The α-blockers did not improve nocturia, which was a common symptom accompanying LUTS suggestive of BPH. Our results showed that the prevalence of NP was 76.5% and that NP was significantly related to the amount of water intake during the evening and before sleep.

### Finasteride [^1126vAvh]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Monotherapy

Finasteride 5 mg/day was initially evaluated in patients with symptoms of BPH and enlarged prostates by digital rectal examination in two 1-year, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind studies and their 5-year open extensions.

Finasteride was further evaluated in a long-term efficacy and safety study, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 4-year, multicenter study. 3040 patients between the ages of 45 and 78, with moderate to severe symptoms of BPH and an enlarged prostate upon digital rectal examination, were randomized into the study (1524 to finasteride, 1516 to placebo) and 3016 patients were evaluable for efficacy. 1883 patients completed the 4-year study (1000 in the finasteride group, 883 in the placebo group).

Effect on Symptom Score

Symptoms were quantified using a score similar to the American Urological Association Symptom Score, which evaluated both obstructive symptoms (impairment of size and force of stream, sensation of incomplete bladder emptying, delayed or interrupted urination) and irritative symptoms (nocturia, daytime frequency, need to strain or push the flow of urine) by rating on a 0 to 5 scale for six symptoms and a 0 to 4 scale for one symptom, for a total possible score of 34.

### A multisite feasibility study of integrated cognitive-behavioral treatment for co-existing nocturia and chronic insomnia [^114WsKZw]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Figure 1 summarizes completion rates by site for each study stage. A total of 245 patients were initially screened by phone, of whom 55% were ineligible and 25% declined participation. Twenty percent who completed telephone screening provided written informed consent. Of these, 35% did not meet trial eligibility after undergoing in‐depth screening and 4% declined randomization, yielding a randomization rate of 61% of patients consented. Twenty‐eight (93%) randomized participants completed one‐week after follow‐up and all 30 participants completed 4‐month follow‐up.

FIGURE 1
A flow diagram for the feasibility study is shown, including the number of participants evaluated for potential enrollment, the number excluded at telephone screening and face‐to‐face screening, the number randomized, and the number at follow‐up.

Participants (mean age 70.6 years, SD 6.8) represented diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds and age ranges (Table 1, Supplemental Table 2), although most were male. Participants in the integrated treatment group demonstrated an average decrease of 0.9 nightly nocturia episodes on the ICIQ OAB nocturia item, 16.5 on the ICIQ Nocturia QOL, and 7.8 on the ISI (Table 2, Supplemental Tables 3 and 6). Participants in the control group reported a decrease of 0.2 nightly nocturia episodes. In the integrated treatment group, 50% (versus 19% in control) had both ≥ 1 episode/night reduction in ICIQ OAB nocturia and ≥ 6‐point reduction in ISI. Sleep and bladder diary results demonstrated a greater reduction in the mean number of nighttime voids in the treatment group (−0.4, SD 1.0) without an increase in nighttime leakage (see Supplemental Tables 7–9 for actigraphy results). See Supplemental Table 10 for feedback results.

### Mixed urinary incontinence: are there effective treatments? [^112iZBW4]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2023). Medium credibility.

2 DIAGNOSIS

Multiple sources and guidelines describe the diagnostic process and assessments used to diagnose UI and UI subtypes. Patients presenting with symptoms of UI are usually assessed by their doctors to record the type and duration of symptoms. Diagnostic assessments can include medical history, physical examinations, completion of bladder diaries, urinalysis, postvoid residual volume calculations, and patient‐reported outcomes. The aims of these initial assessments are to determine the UI subtype (or other underlying cause that may require specialist referral), the frequency and severity of the symptoms, the impact on the patient's quality of life, and the degree of treatment need. Medical history is used to determine whether a patient has any other conditions that affect UI, such as diabetes, as improvement in the associated condition may improve UI severity, although the evidence is not conclusive. Validated questionnaires allow for a subjective differential diagnosis of UI subtype, while invasive urodynamic testing is not recommended for diagnostic purposes.

Establishing the type of UI is important; although some treatments, such as lifestyle and behavioral modifications, do not vary by UI subtypes, others are subtype‐specific. Most women present with a degree of MUI, and the phenotype (stress or urge predominant symptomatology as determined by patient history and questionnaires) directs the initial treatment. Absent standardized objective methodology to determine the predominant symptom, the patient history is critical. Furthermore, establishing the quality of life and social impact of the condition for the unique individual is critical for the determination of outcome and overall benefit of therapy.

### Clinical symptoms predictive of recurrent urinary tract infections [^112MsvUY]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate clinical predictors that will help diagnose women with recurrent urinary tract infections among women with irritative voiding symptoms.

Study Design

A case control study was performed. Cases were women with the diagnosis of recurrent urinary tract infection and controls were women with irritative voiding symptoms. Symptoms predictive for recurrent urinary tract infection were evaluated.

Results

Report of symptoms following intercourse (OR 12.4, 95% CI 3, 59), prior history of pyelonephritis (OR 7.4, 95% CI 2.1; 29), prompt resolution of symptoms with antibiotics (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.4, 11), and absence of nocturia (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05, 0.87) are significant predictors for women with recurrent urinary tract infection.

Conclusion

Among women with irritative voiding symptoms, clinical symptoms can help to identify women with recurrent urinary tract infections at the initial presentation even if urine culture reports are not available.

### Management of nocturia and nocturnal polyuria [^114yEbzx]. Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Nocturnal polyuria (NP), characterized by overproduction of urine at night (greater than 20%-33% of total 24-hour urine volume depending on age), is a major contributing factor in most nocturia cases. Nocturia can be caused by intake, urological, nephrological, hormonal, sleep, and cardiovascular factors. It is therefore important to accurately diagnose both the type of nocturia and the potentially associated medical conditions to determine appropriate treatment. Diagnostic tools, in addition to a thorough history and physical examination, include voiding/bladder diary analyses and questionnaires to diagnose nocturia type (NP, diminished nocturnal/global bladder capacity, global polyuria) and causative factors. Lifestyle modifications are the first intervention implemented for the management of nocturia and NP but, as symptoms progress, such measures may be insufficient, and pharmacotherapy may be initiated. While drugs for benign prostatic hyperplasia and overactive bladder have demonstrated statistically significant reductions in nocturnal voids, patients often fail to achieve a clinically meaningful response. Antidiuretic treatment is warranted for patients with nocturia due to NP because, in many patients, it treats the underlying cause (ie, insufficient secretion of antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin) that leads to overproduction of urine at night and has been shown to provide statistically significant reductions in nocturnal voids. Desmopressin, a synthetic analog of arginine vasopressin, is the only antidiuretic treatment indicated specifically for nocturia due to NP. Overall, the pathophysiology of NP is complex and differs from that of other types of nocturia. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary to effectively diagnose and manage this bothersome condition.

### Benign prostatic hyperplasia: clinical manifestations and evaluation [^115cJoQd]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a very common condition, related to aging and causing symptoms, called lower urinary tract symptoms. On account of its huge prevalence, it is important for clinicians who are involved in the management of patients with BPH to be aware of the very strict recommendations for BPH evaluation. In this article, we describe the different steps and procedures doctors should follow to evaluate these patients; symptoms and signs of BPH are reviewed, as well as the clinical evaluation steps and examinations available. The basic evaluation of the patients with BPH should include, according to the recommendations of the most relevant international guidelines, lower urinary tract symptoms evaluation with appropriate symptom scores, digital rectal examination, voiding charts, prostate-specific antigen and creatinine measurement, urinalysis, and imaging of the urinary tract.

### The evaluation of nocturia in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia and the analysis of the curative effect after medical or placebo therapy for nocturia: a randomized placebo-controlled study [^115cp8MA]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Nocturia has been identified as the leading cause for sleep disturbance and sleep fragmentation; it causes daytime fatigue, impacts daily activities, and deteriorates psychomotor performance, cognitive function, and mood. Nocturia can also cause depression and immunosuppression, and it increases the vulnerability for cardiovascular diseases and the development of diabetes mellitus.

In these analyses, LUTS/BPH patients with nocturia had some urinary system diseases, such as lower urinary tract obstruction and overactive bladder, as well as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, diabetes insipidus, and other awakening factors of urination (such as anxiety and sleep disorders). In this study, patients had hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes, and other diseases. Thus, nocturia may be caused by the combined effects of a variety of conditions. Kupelian et al. demonstrated that while increased odds of the metabolic syndrome were observed with mild to moderate degrees of nocturia. In this way, the etiology of nocturia, especially, nocturnal polyuria can be further analyzed by evaluating LUTS patients with metabolic syndrome.

### Enhancing obstructive sleep apnea screening and nocturia treatment: a quality improvement study [^112CR86W]. Urogynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Importance

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common but likely underdiagnosed in urogynecology patients with nocturia, and OSA treatment has the potential to improve nocturia symptoms.

Objective

The aim of the study was to assess the effect of implementing a universal screening protocol for OSA in a urogynecology clinic on screening rates, OSA prevalence among patients with nocturia, and symptom improvement following treatment.

Study Design

This was an observational quality improvement study at a urogynecology clinic at a safety-net hospital. Health care providers were asked to screen all new patients with nocturia using the STOP-BANG questionnaire. We assessed screening rates over an 18-month period and followed patients referred for sleep study to determine the percentage who completed evaluation, were identified as having OSA and, if necessary, prescribed treatment, as well as improvement in nocturia symptoms after treatment.

Results

Seventy-eight percent of eligible patients were screened, and screening rates increased substantially over the course of the study. Overall, 20.2% of patients screened positive and were referred for sleep study, and 80.6% of those were ultimately diagnosed with OSA. There were low levels of adherence to the recommended OSA treatment, but patients with OSA who were using the treatment reported better improvement in their symptoms.

Conclusions

Initiation of OSA screening in a urogynecology clinic is a significant and feasible way to address nocturia and has the potential to improve symptoms. Improving rates of OSA testing and adherence to OSA treatment will require a multidisciplinary approach, while systems-level changes are needed to address inequities and other barriers to accessing treatment.

### Variations in bladder pain syndrome / interstitial cystitis (IC) definitions, pathogenesis, diagnostics and treatment: a systematic review and evaluation of national and international guidelines [^114MEdFJ]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Interstitial cystitis (IC) and bladder pain syndrome (BPS) are challenging and encompassing hypersensitivity disorders of the lower urinary tract. A variety of national and international guidelines have been published including guidance on nomenclature, definitions, etiopathology, diagnostics and treatment. A lack of universally established clinical guidance is apparent. The aim of this review is to evaluate key guidelines on this area of practice, identify variations, compare their recommendations and grade them using AGREE II.

Methods

Literature searches were performed using the PUBMED and CINAHL database from January 1, 1983, to December 1, 2018, referring to the search strategy of AUA. Ten national and international guidelines were included into the analysis. We assessed the guidelines with the updated AGREE II.

Results

Symptoms congruent in all guidelines are: pain, pressure, discomfort and frequency, urgency and nocturia. Urinalysis is a prerequisite for diagnostics, cystoscopy for most and urodynamics not part of the routine assessment. Treatment options are recommended stepwise. The highest level of evidence and consensus was identified for oral therapies. Nine guidelines had an overall quality score ≥ 50% and three scored ≥ 70% (AUA, GG, RCOG).

Conclusions

The guidelines are congruent in symptom reporting, quite congruent in diagnostics and vary to a high degree on treatment recommendations. The complexity of BPS and emerging evidence indicate the need for regular updating of the guidelines and a wider consensus.

### The impact of urodynamics on treatment and outcomes in women with an overactive bladder: a longitudinal prospective follow-up study [^112QQr7H]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Urinary incontinence can seriously influence the physical, psychological, and social wellbeing of affected individuals. Urodynamics (UDS) has been considered the test of choice for lower urinary tract symptoms. The International Continence Society (ICS) states that the objective of urodynamic studies is to replicate the patient's symptoms whilst making measurements that aim to determine the underlying cause and in addition evaluate the related pathophysiological processes. Overactive bladder (OAB) is defined as a symptom complex of urinary urgency (an intense, sudden desire to void) with or without incontinence, usually with increased urinary frequency, or nocturia, but in the absence of infection or other proven pathological condition. From UDS testing, multiple diagnoses may be obtained, including detrusor overactivity (DO), urodynamic stress incontinence (USI), and voiding dysfunction (VD). In women who present with OAB, 46% do not have a DO diagnosis on UDS. UDS may falsely miss DO or it may not be able to capture DO at that time point. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Clinical Guidelines on urinary incontinence (NICE CG171) recommends that patients undergo UDS if they are unresponsive to conservative therapies. There is a dilemma for clinicians as to whether to treat women based on their symptoms or their UDS findings. Typically in the UK, patients with OAB are initially offered behavioural therapies and antimuscarinic drugs. NICE guidelines do not recommend performing UDS to commence conservative measures. However, botulinum toxin A can only be offered to women who have not responded to conservative measures and have proven DO on UDS. Invasive therapies (botulinum toxin type A, neuromodulation) can be offered to those with confirmed DO.

### European Academy of Neurology (EAN) / European federation of autonomic societies (EFAS) / international neuro-urology society (INUS) guidelines for practising neurologists on the assessment and treatment of neurogenic urinary and sexual symptoms (NEUROGED guidelines) [^116YpTgn]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

3.1 Section 1: Assessment of Urinary Symptoms

Table 1 and Appendix S5 present the evidence supporting the recommendations for assessing urinary symptoms. Figure 2 illustrates the assessment and treatment algorithm for urinary symptoms based on these recommendations.

Clinical Question 1. Should neurologists obtain a history of a patient's urinary symptoms versus not asking about urinary symptoms?

History taking forms the cornerstone of the assessment of urinary symptoms, and this is summarised as a checklist in Table 5.

Recommendation: Neurologists should actively ask about urinary symptoms in individuals with neurological diseases on a regular basis. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 100%).

Clinical Question 2. Should individuals with neurological disease reporting urinary symptoms undergo a focused physical examination versus not undergoing a physical examination?

Individuals reporting urinary symptoms should undergo a targeted physical examination at initial evaluation, which is repeated annually in moderate or high‐risk individuals. The examination helps to plan investigations and treatments and screen for complications.

Recommendation: Neurologists should perform a targeted physical examination in individuals with neurological diseases and urinary symptoms. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 94%).

Clinical Question 3. Should individuals with neurological disease reporting urinary symptoms undergo a urinalysis versus not undergoing a urinalysis?

Screening urinalysis, which includes physical, chemical (dipstick testing) and/or microscopic evaluation of urine, should be a part of the initial evaluation when an individual reports urinary symptoms. The urine should be tested at follow‐up in case of significant changes in urinary symptoms. Urinalysis is more useful to exclude UTIs, and when a UTI is suspected, the urine should be sent for culture. Urinalysis should not be routinely performed to screen for UTIs in individuals who are using a catheter, given the high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria and leukocyturia. Urine dipstick testing can also screen for glucosuria, proteinuria, and microscopic haematuria, prompting further investigations if persistent and unexplained.

### Nocturnal voiding frequency does not describe nocturia-related bother [^11374vJs]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

Nocturia frequency has been used as a measure of treatment efficacy for nocturia even though fluctuation of the symptom over time has been well described in the literature. Additionally, given the multifactorial causal pathway and clinically relevant comorbidities, frequency alone may be an insufficient marker of treatment direction. The aim of this study was to investigate factors associated with nocturia-related bother to identify additional variables that may capture the impact of nocturia, direct clinical care and have potential to quantify treatment outcome.

Methods

Prospective data from tertiary hospital Urology and Continence cohorts were matched for identical variables to generate a sample of 204 datasets. Descriptive statistics were obtained to describe the two cohorts. Characteristics of patients were evaluated across levels of nocturia frequency and nocturia-related bother using nonparametric methods; statistically significant differences between groups in each cohort were established.

Results

Nocturia frequency alone does not comprehensively reflect attributable bother. Five sleep variables (poor quality sleep, short time to first awakening to void, less than 7hours of total sleep, primary sleep latency, and daytime sleepiness) and daily urinary urgency were significantly associated with high nocturia-related bother. Attributable bother, despite high-frequency nocturia, was minimized by male gender, lack of daily urinary urgency and good sleep quality. Poor health status, urinary urgency and sleep latency were associated with nocturia frequency.

Conclusions

Items of importance to individuals with nocturia have been identified from patient data. These variables have the potential to sit alongside change in nocturia frequency as potential markers of treatment response.

### Bladder outflow obstruction in women: clinical and basic evaluation [^112pKHug]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

Female bladder outflow obstruction is an underdiagnosed and undermanaged condition. This review article aims to illustrate the basic and clinical evaluation of patients who might have this condition.

Review

Clinical evaluation includes clinical history, examination, and basic investigations, including uroflowmetry and postvoid residual, urinalysis and culture, renal function assessment, ultrasound of kidneys and bladder, voiding cystourethrography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Based on the initial evaluation, if the concern of obstruction is high, the clinician might undergo further advanced evaluation.

Conclusion

Basic evaluation is the initial step in the diagnosis of female bladder outflow obstruction, the clinician need to have a high index of suspicion and often further advanced evaluation is needed to confirm the diagnosis.

### Evaluation… [^116m8FCG]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Anticholinergics decrease detrusor tone, frequency, and urgency and improve bladder capacity. Anticholinergic therapy may be used in children with primary nocturnal enuresis and daytime wetting and in patients who do not respond to desmopressin. 2, 8, 30 Desmopressin is recommended if the family is unwilling or unable to adhere to nonpharmacologic measures. The drug is most effective in children eight years and older who have monosymptomatic enuresis with nocturnal polyuria, normal bladder capacity, and less frequent bed-wetting.
31. 2 Initial treatment is usually one tablet or one spray every night; the dosage is increased weekly to
0. 6 mg or 40 mcg daily. Desmopressin therapy is combined with fluid restriction and voiding before bedtime. Equivalent oral and intranasal doses have similar potency.

Treatment of Secondary and Nonmonosymptomatic Enuresis If no cause for nocturnal enuresis is evident, primary nocturnal enuresis treatment options are appropriate. Most children with encopresis-associated enuresis and daytime wetting respond to disimpaction, prevention of reaccumulation of stools, and bowel retraining. 38 A history of snoring, mouth breathing, behavioral problems, and daytime somnolence in patients with enlarged tonsils or adenoids on examination may suggest obstructive sleep apnea. Surgical correction of airway obstruction in these patients improves or cures nocturnal enuresis and daytime wetting. 39 Individual psychotherapy, crisis intervention, and family therapy are effective measures for psychogenically induced enuresis.

2 Children with dysfunctional voiding have abnormal urine flow patterns on cystometry, a large amount of post-void residual urine, and a normal upper urinary tract on imaging and benefit from a voiding regimen. Biofeedback is effective for motivated children with primary nocturnal enuresis and dysfunctional voiding. 25 Biofeedback improves nocturnal enuresis, daytime wetting, constipation, frequency, urgency, voiding patterns, and bladder hyperactivity for up to two years after completion of therapy. 25.

### Diagnosis and management of overactive bladder… [^115yd419]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with overactive bladder typically have a variety of symptoms that may include urinary urgency and frequency, nocturia, and urge incontinence. The condition is frequently encountered and affects an estimated 30 to 40 percent of persons 75 years of age or older. Patients with symptoms of overactive bladder often withdraw from their usual social activities, are more likely to be depressed, and may suffer from sleep disruption because of nocturia. Ouslander provides a review of the diagnostic work-up and treatment of overactive bladder. Overactive bladder has a multifactorial etiology in most persons. The author states that a targeted diagnostic evaluation of patients with symptoms of overactive bladder is required. All older men should be questioned about symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy. Patient diaries may provide helpful details regarding frequency of urination, voiding volumes, pattern of voiding, and lifestyle factors that may contribute to symptoms.

All patients should have focused genitourinary, pelvic, and rectal examinations, and a clean-catch urine specimen should be checked for hematuria and infection. Cystoscopy should be targeted to patients with unexplained hematuria, recurrent urinary tract infections, or risk factors for bladder cancer. Urodynamic testing is relatively more complex and invasive, and the author notes that its role in the diagnostic work-up of overactive bladder is controversial. He suggests targeting this procedure to patients who have failed initial therapy or those with nonspecific symptoms and an unclear etiology of overactive bladder. Generic immediate-release oxybutynin may work best in patients who only need short-term control such as during social situations or at night to decrease nocturia. The once-daily controlled-release form of oxybutynin has fewer reported side effects and similar efficacy.

Tolterodine is also available in short-acting and long-acting formulations, with similar efficacy and side effects compared with oxybutynin. Older men with prostatic hypertrophy may benefit from alpha-blocker medications and should be watched for urinary retention if anticholinergic drugs are employed. Nocturia related to volume overload may be improved by one dose of a diuretic taken in the late afternoon or by nighttime use of desmopressin in children. The review discusses a number of investigational medications, which may have promise for treatment of overactive bladder.
