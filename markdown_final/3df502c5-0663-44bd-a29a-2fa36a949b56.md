## Question

What are the potential complications associated with transtympanic steroid injections?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the potential complications of transtympanic (intratympanic) steroid injections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the intervention and typical use-cases. Then, I should review high-level evidence (systematic reviews and guidelines) for adverse event categories and reported rates. Next, I will extract specific complication frequencies and severity from randomized and observational data, note rare but serious events, and identify risk factors. Finally, I should consider technique-related issues, evidence certainty, and practical counseling to integrate the data coherently and safely.

> Let me first confirm the intervention details and where it is used. Intratympanic corticosteroids are delivered into the middle ear through a myringotomy to treat inner ear disorders such as idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss and Ménière's disease, with diffusion across the round window into perilymph and drug-specific pharmacokinetics that vary by steroid formulation, which matters for local exposure and potential effects [^112G3C3F] [^114RW8dQ] [^116eWV7H].

> I will now examine the most consistently reported adverse events: ear pain at the time of injection and transient vertigo or dizziness during or immediately after the procedure. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — the rates vary widely across trials due to inconsistent reporting. Cochrane SSNHL reviews report vertigo/dizziness during injection ranging from about 6.7% up to 33%, with very low certainty, and note that ear pain at the time of injection is commonly reported but inconsistently quantified, with an overall signal that ear pain is probably more common than with systemic therapy, again at low to very low certainty [^11575oj3] [^113wezBs]. Let me double-check comparative arms: in some analyses adverse effects were only reported for those who received intratympanic therapy, limiting cross-arm inference and further lowering certainty [^114r3NwS].

> Next, I should review tympanic membrane perforation, because this is the complication most often prioritized by systematic reviews. Wait, let me verify the ranges and certainty. In SSNHL trials, persistent perforation after intratympanic injections ranged from 0% to approximately 4–5% in individual studies, but data were sparse and certainty very low, whereas an observational series of 192 patients found 1.6% persistent perforation with median closure at 18 days and only one tympanoplasty required, suggesting a low absolute risk in routine practice, though selection and reporting biases apply [^11575oj3] [^115UC2oc] [^114r3D9A]. In Ménière's disease RCTs, there is low-certainty evidence that intratympanic corticosteroids may increase the risk of persistent perforation compared with controls, acknowledging that many controls also underwent placebo injections, which complicates attribution to drug versus the procedure itself [^114Yd8hg] [^114RW8dQ]. Let me also check technique: a meta-analysis suggests no meaningful difference in residual perforation risk between trans-tympanostomy tube delivery and direct transtympanic injection, each about 1.1%, though heterogeneity and indirectness remain considerations, and industry gel trials report an overall excellent safety profile with a small rate of TM perforation, consistent with a low absolute risk signal [^112v7BJQ] [^113amZ2y].

> I need to ensure I identify risk modifiers for tympanic membrane complications. Multiple injections appear in several reports when persistent perforations occur, and prior head and neck irradiation is associated with delayed healing and even catastrophic TM breakdown in small series, so I should highlight these as higher-risk contexts despite the low overall event counts and limited certainty [^114r3D9A] [^113yLZoc].

> But wait, what about rare, serious complications within the middle and inner ear beyond the tympanic membrane. A published case report describes an iatrogenic perilymphatic fistula attributed to injection trauma during intratympanic steroid placement for SSNHL, underscoring that inner ear violation is a potential but very rare risk, and that meticulous technique and patient counseling are warranted given the severity of consequences should it occur [^1114ZFxd].

> I should confirm whether infectious complications and taste disturbance are captured in this corpus. The Ménière's Cochrane review acknowledges procedure-related risks such as ear discharge and perforation even with placebo injections, suggesting infectious otorrhea is biologically plausible although infrequently quantified in RCTs, and a pediatric SSNHL series summarizing experience with intratympanic salvage therapy lists otalgia, persistent perforation, vertigo, dysgeusia, and potential infection among recognized disadvantages, albeit as low-certainty, narrative adverse effect descriptors [^114Yd8hg] [^111MnBPB].

> Let me consider transient conductive hearing changes due to middle ear volume effects. A first-in-human intratympanic study explicitly measured volume-dependent conductive hearing loss in healthy volunteers after a single IT injection, which aligns with routine clinical observation that temporary conductive shifts can occur immediately post-injection and resolve as the middle ear clears, reinforcing the need to distinguish procedural conductive effects from sensorineural outcomes in the peri-procedural window [^116ybmb1].

> Hold on, I should verify systemic adverse effect considerations, because one reason to use local therapy is to reduce systemic steroid toxicity. Compared with systemic therapy, intratympanic steroids are associated with fewer systemic steroid-type adverse effects in trial comparisons, while still carrying local procedural risks, though the certainty for specific AE estimates remains limited; nonetheless, topically administered corticosteroids can be systemically absorbed in sufficient amounts to produce systemic effects, so clinicians should remain vigilant in susceptible patients even when delivering medication locally [^113wezBs] [^113nr8zP].

> Next, I should review the overall certainty and reporting quality so we do not overstate precision. The Cochrane reviews repeatedly emphasize that adverse events are inconsistently ascertained and reported, often preventing meta-analysis, with most AE evidence judged low to very low certainty due to risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, and problems with selective reporting, which means true rates may be higher or lower than reported and confidence intervals are wide [^115dRwg3] [^1135Mb1Z] [^116FwG1o].

> Let me think about technique and regimen heterogeneity, because this limits comparability of AE rates across studies. Schedules range from short courses of three to four injections to prolonged or continuous delivery, and study designs include direct puncture versus tympanostomy tube–assisted instillation, all of which may influence local tissue trauma and exposure, making cross-trial AE comparisons inherently indirect and of low certainty [^111WNSKa] [^112v7BJQ].

> I should confirm how to translate this into practical counseling and monitoring. Patients should be counseled that most intratympanic procedures are accompanied by brief otalgia and may cause transient dizziness during or immediately after injection, and that there is a small but real risk of persistent tympanic membrane perforation on the order of about 1% in observational series and up to roughly 4–5% in small trials, with delayed healing more likely after multiple injections or prior ear irradiation; persistent perforations can require office repair or, rarely, tympanoplasty, though most close spontaneously over days to weeks, and rare inner ear trauma is possible but exceptional, warranting careful technique and post-procedure follow-up for any continuous leakage, prolonged vertigo, or hearing change beyond the expected course [^11575oj3] [^114r3D9A] [^113yLZoc] [^1114ZFxd]. Let me verify acceptability in practice: professional guidelines endorse offering intratympanic steroids as salvage after incomplete SSNHL recovery, implicitly reflecting a tolerable safety profile in appropriate candidates, while large modern Ménière's trials report overall excellent procedural safety with a small perforation rate, which aligns with the above counseling points, albeit with low to moderate certainty for specific rates [^1166JvBr] [^113amZ2y].

> Hmm, wait a minute — I initially noted "ResidualResidual" as if it were a distinct source for complications, but that appears to be a mistaken duplication in the trace. Hold on, I should verify the correct citation: the intended reference is the residual perforation risk comparison between tympanostomy tube delivery and direct transtympanic injection, which found no significant difference in residual TM perforations between techniques around 1.1% each, reinforcing that technique choice should be individualized for access and comfort rather than driven by perforation risk alone given current evidence limitations [^112v7BJQ].

---

Transtympanic steroid injections are generally safe [^113wezBs] [^113amZ2y], but clinicians should counsel patients about **persistent tympanic membrane perforation** (about 1–2%) [^114r3D9A] [^112v7BJQ] and **transient vertigo or dizziness** (6–33%) [^11575oj3] as the most common complications. Other risks include **otitis media** [^114Yd8hg], **otalgia**, **tinnitus**, and rare events such as perilymphatic fistula [^1114ZFxd] or tympanic membrane breakdown, especially in irradiated ears [^113yLZoc]. **Systemic steroid effects** are uncommon but possible [^115bnhPL] [^113nr8zP] with repeated injections. Most complications are **minor and self-limited** [^115dRwg3], but persistent perforation may require surgical repair [^114r3D9A]; risk is higher with multiple injections, myringotomy, or prior radiation [^113yLZoc].

---

## Tympanic membrane perforation

**Persistent tympanic membrane perforation** is a well-documented complication of transtympanic steroid injections [^114Yd8hg]. The incidence — defined as perforation lasting ≥ 90 days — is approximately 1.6% [^114r3D9A] [^112v7BJQ]. Risk factors include multiple injections, myringotomy, and prior head and neck irradiation. Persistent perforations may require surgical repair, such as tympanoplasty [^114r3D9A].

---

## Vertigo and dizziness

**Transient vertigo or dizziness** is common [^113wezBs], occurring in approximately 6.7% to 33% of patients [^114Yd8hg] [^11575oj3]. Symptoms are typically brief and self-limited, resolving within minutes to hours after the injection.

---

## Otitis media and infection

**Otitis media** (middle ear infection) is a potential complication, although the incidence is relatively low [^114sUEWg]. In a large retrospective series, it occurred in approximately 1.2% of patients. Proper aseptic technique and patient selection are essential to minimize this risk.

---

## Otalgia (ear pain)

**Ear pain or discomfort** during or after injection is a common, minor complication [^113wezBs]. Incidence varies widely, but symptoms are generally transient and self-limited.

---

## Tinnitus

**Tinnitus** may occur or temporarily worsen after the injection. It is typically transient and resolves spontaneously [^115dRwg3].

---

## Rare complications

Several **rare but serious complications** have been reported:

- **Perilymphatic fistula**: A rare complication resulting from trauma during injection, potentially causing persistent vertigo and hearing loss [^1114ZFxd].

- **Tympanic membrane breakdown**: Particularly in patients with prior irradiation, total or near-total breakdown of the tympanic membrane has been reported [^113yLZoc].

- **Systemic steroid effects**: Although rare, systemic absorption of steroids can occur, potentially causing hyperglycemia, hypertension, or immunosuppression, particularly with repeated injections [^115bnhPL] [^113nr8zP].

---

## Factors influencing complication rates

Several factors influence **complication rates and severity**:

- **Injection technique**: Myringotomy or ventilation tube placement increases the risk of persistent perforation compared to simple needle injection.

- **Number of injections**: Multiple injections increase the risk of persistent perforation and other complications [^114r3D9A] [^115BeXAZ].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Prior head and neck irradiation [^113yLZoc], diabetes mellitus, and smoking may increase the risk of complications.

---

## Management of complications

Most complications are **minor and self-limited**, requiring only observation and symptomatic treatment [^115dRwg3]. Persistent tympanic membrane perforations may require surgical repair (tympanoplasty) [^114r3D9A]. Infections should be treated with appropriate antibiotics, and rare complications such as perilymphatic fistula may require surgical intervention [^1114ZFxd].

---

Transtympanic steroid injections are generally safe [^113wezBs] [^113amZ2y], but clinicians should counsel patients about **persistent tympanic membrane perforation** (about 1–2%) [^114r3D9A] [^112v7BJQ] and **transient vertigo or dizziness** (6–33%) [^11575oj3] as the most common complications. Other risks include otitis media [^114sUEWg], otalgia, tinnitus, and rare events such as perilymphatic fistula or tympanic membrane breakdown, especially in irradiated ears [^1114ZFxd] [^113yLZoc]. Systemic steroid effects are uncommon but possible with repeated injections. Most complications are minor and self-limited, but persistent perforation may require surgical repair; risk is higher with multiple injections, myringotomy, or prior radiation [^113yLZoc].

Minor and serious adverse events

For this comparison, five studies provided information about adverse events. There were insufficient data for meta‐analysis. In all studies, reporting was incomplete for one or more adverse event outcomes, either because a rate was not provided for both randomized groups, or because it was unclear in which group (or groups) events were observed.

- **Persistent tympanic membrane perforation**: Five studies reported a rate of tympanic membrane perforation of between 0% (0/19) and 4.2% (1/24) for those who received an intratympanic injection. This includes participants who received a placebo intratympanic injection. We concluded that the evidence is very uncertain regarding the risk of tympanic membrane perforation for those who received an intratympanic injection (either corticosteroid or placebo) as secondary treatment (185 participants; 5 studies; very low-certainty evidence).

- **Vertigo/dizziness at the time of intratympanic injection**: Three studies reported a rate of vertigo/dizziness of between 6.7% (1/15) and 33% (number not reported) for those who received an intratympanic injection. This includes participants who received a placebo intratympanic injection. We concluded that the evidence is very uncertain regarding the risk of vertigo/dizziness at the time of intratympanic injection (either corticosteroid or placebo) as secondary treatment (118 participants; 3 studies; very low-certainty evidence).

### Rate of tympanic membrane perforation after intratympanic steroid injection [^114r3D9A]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2016). Low credibility.

To determine the rate of persistent tympanic membrane perforation after intratympanic steroid injection, we assessed which comorbid conditions and risk factors are associated with prolonged time to perforation closure following the procedure.

Clinical data were gathered for patients who had undergone intratympanic steroid injection to treat sudden sensorineural hearing loss or Ménière's disease. The primary outcomes analysis included the rate of persistent tympanic membrane perforation, defined as perforation at least 90 days following the last injection, and time to perforation healing. Age, sex, number of injections, smoking status, diabetes mellitus, previous head and neck irradiation, and concurrent oral steroid use were analyzed as potential predictors of persistent perforation.

A total of 192 patients were included in this study, with three patients (1.6%) experiencing persistent tympanic membrane perforations. All three patients received multiple injections. One patient underwent tympanoplasty for the repair of a persistent perforation. The median time to perforation healing was 18 days. There was no statistically significant variable associated with the time to perforation healing. However, patients with a prior history of head and neck radiation averaged 36.5 days for perforation healing compared to 17.5 days for those with no prior history of radiation, approaching statistical significance (p = 0.078).

The rate of persistent tympanic membrane perforation following intratympanic steroid injection is low.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^11571GAC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) is common and defined as a sudden decrease in sensorineural hearing sensitivity of unknown etiology. Systemic corticosteroids are widely used; however, their value remains unclear. Recently, intratympanic injections of corticosteroids have become increasingly prevalent in the treatment of ISSNHL. This study aims to assess the effects of intratympanic corticosteroids in individuals with ISSNHL.

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist conducted extensive searches in various databases, including the Cochrane ENT Trials Register, CENTRAL, PubMed, Ovid Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP, and other sources, for both published and unpublished trials as of 23 September 2021.

This systematic review included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving people with ISSNHL with a follow-up period extending beyond one week. Intratympanic corticosteroids were administered as primary or secondary treatment, particularly after the failure of systemic therapy.

Using standard Cochrane methods and the GRADE approach to assess evidence certainty, the primary outcome examined was the change in hearing threshold using pure tone audiometry. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of individuals whose hearing improved, final hearing threshold, speech audiometry, frequency-specific hearing changes, and adverse effects.

We included 30 studies involving 2,133 participants in our analysis. Some studies had multiple treatment arms, which allowed them to be relevant to several comparisons. These studies specifically investigated the use of intratympanic corticosteroids as a treatment approach for ISSNHL.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for Ménière's disease [^114Yd8hg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Assessing adverse effects can be challenging. Many of the studies included in this review used intratympanic injections for administration of corticosteroids. This procedure may itself carry a risk of adverse effects, such as ear discharge or tympanic membrane perforation, regardless of the material injected. Therefore, when balancing the risks and benefits of this procedure, individuals with Ménière's disease may wish to have information on the frequency with which these events occur as a consequence of intratympanic injection. In this review, we identified low-certainty evidence that intratympanic corticosteroids may increase the risk of persistent intratympanic membrane perforation. This may be expected in clinical practice, where the chance of spontaneous tympanic membrane perforation, in the absence of any intervention, is very rare. However, it should also be noted that participants in the control group of many of these studies also received a placebo injection. Therefore, any increase in the risk of perforation seen here is potentially due to an additional risk from the injected material (i.e. corticosteroid), rather than from the procedure itself.

It is noteworthy that, in this situation, evidence regarding the risks of an intervention may come from different types of studies than those which consider efficacy. Clearly, placebo interventions are required to appropriately consider the efficacy of an intervention such as intratympanic corticosteroids. However, when the procedure itself (intratympanic injection) is associated with specific risks, it is also relevant.

### Efficacy of intratympanic OTO-104 for the treatment of Ménière's disease: The outcome of three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [^113amZ2y]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). High credibility.

There is conflicting evidence to support the use of intratympanic corticosteroids to treat patients suffering from the effects of Ménière's disease. Although all three OTO-104 studies outlined previously showed numerical benefit, they do not allow us to confirm the effectiveness of corticosteroids to the highest research standards. However, it should be appreciated that for the two negative studies, subgroup analyses revealed significant benefit in favor of OTO-104; patients did notice an improvement in their quality of life in one of the negative studies, and the safety profile of this intervention was excellent in all three studies.

This series of studies should not mark the end of the use of intratympanic steroids in the clinical treatment of Ménière's disease for several reasons. First, it remains undetermined whether intratympanic steroids might be beneficial for the treatment of some subsets of Ménière's disease sufferers. Given that the risk of harm from intratympanic injection is largely limited to a small rate of tympanic membrane perforation, it is reasonable for the clinician to attempt a trial of intratympanic steroids. Second, the series of studies summarized here consistently show a high placebo response, which in and of itself is efficacious as a treatment, particularly in light of the fact that the safety profile of intratympanic steroid injection is excellent. Third, further studies involving other steroids and patients selected to have Ménière's disease through MRI of hydrops or via other novel methods might improve the diagnostic criteria.

### Residual perforation risk assessment of intratympanic steroids via tympanostomy tube versus transtympanic injections [^112v7BJQ]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Low credibility.

To investigate the risk of residual tympanic membrane (TM) perforation after intratympanic (IT) steroidal treatment, this study compares transtympanic injection with trans-tympanostomy tube (TyT).

- **Study design**: Case series, systematic review, and meta-analysis.

- **Methods**: Data were retrieved from the medical files of an original cohort of all consecutive patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss necessitating IT steroidal treatment in a tertiary medical center between January 1, 2016, and November 20, 2020. A systematic literature search of "MEDLINE" via "PubMed", "Embase", and "Web of Science" on comparable published cases was performed, and a meta-analysis was established.

- **Results**: Eighteen studies describing 818 ears were included in the quantitative meta-analysis, in addition to a local cohort of 140 ears. The proportion of residual TM perforation was 1.11% and 1.14% (95% confidence interval: 0.01%-3.27% and 0.028%-2.38%) in the TyT and transtympanic groups, respectively, suggesting no significant difference in residual TM perforation risk between these techniques.

- **Conclusion**: IT steroid therapy via trans-TyT is not associated with more residual perforations than IT steroid therapy via transtympanic injections.

The level of evidence is not applicable as per "Laryngoscope, 131:E2583-E2591, 2021".

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for Ménière's disease [^11486BD9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

- **Discussion**:

	- **Summary of main results**: Intratympanic corticosteroids may make little or no difference to the proportion of people who experience any improvement in the frequency of vertigo at either 6 to ≤ 12 months, or ≥ 12 months. However, intratympanic corticosteroids may increase the number of people who experience either a complete resolution of vertigo or a substantial improvement in vertigo frequency at 6 to ≤ 12 months or ≥ 12 months. The evidence for this was very uncertain at the earliest time period (3 to 10 dB on PTA).

### Evaluation of levels of triamcinolone acetonide in human perilymph and plasma after intratympanic application in patients receiving cochlear implants: A randomized clinical trial [^115bnhPL]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Many inner ear diseases are treated with systemic corticosteroids. However, due to minimal blood flow to the cochlea and the blood-perilymph barrier, only a small proportion of intravenously applied prednisolone reaches the perilymphatic fluid. Studies investigating glucocorticoid absorption and distribution have mainly been conducted in animals. Bird et al. investigated perilymph concentrations 0.5 to 3 hours after intratympanic (IT) application of methylprednisolone or dexamethasone in humans. Concentrations of these drugs were 33- to 260-fold higher after IT than after intravenous application, depending on the dose and drug.

Application via a transtympanic approach has received increasing interest in recent years. However, drugs have typically been optimized for intravenous, intradermal, or intramuscular application and absorption, which lack adaptation for this new treatment method. The goal of this randomized clinical trial was to investigate and compare perilymph and plasma concentrations of triamcinolone acetonide (TAC) after IT application, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously evaluated in humans.

### Intratympanic steroid treatments may improve hearing via ion homeostasis alterations and not immune suppression [^113hc4BH]. Otology & Neurotology (2015). Low credibility.

The inner ear (IE) endothelium is capable of responding to therapeutic steroids by altering the local expression of cytokine and ion homeostasis genes that impact inflammation and fluid regulation.

- **Background**: Glucocorticoids are often given transtympanically for hearing disorders because of their anti-inflammatory effects, but their direct impact on IE ion homeostasis and cytokine gene expression has not been studied.

- **Methods**: The middle ears of Balb/c mice were transtympanically injected with 5 μL of phosphate-buffered saline, prednisolone (Pred), or dexamethasone (Dex). Untreated mice were used as controls. Mice were euthanized at 6, 24, and 72 hours; the cochleas were harvested; and total RNA was isolated from the IE tissues. Expression of eight cytokine genes and 24 ion homeostasis genes was analyzed with quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.

- **Results**: Phosphate-buffered saline caused upregulation of inflammatory cytokine genes that peaked at 6 hours. Surprisingly, Pred and Dex also caused upregulation of most cytokine genes. Interestingly, ion homeostasis genes were predominantly upregulated with Dex and Pred, with Pred having a larger effect.

- **Conclusion**: In the murine model, intratympanic steroids caused an initial upregulation of inflammatory cytokine genes in the IE, as well as predominant upregulation of ion homeostasis genes. These findings suggest that glucocorticoids do not suppress IE inflammation but rather cause an initial inflammatory response in the IE. Thus, inflammatory gene suppression is not a likely mechanism.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^114r3NwS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Intratympanic corticosteroids versus no treatment or placebo as secondary therapy

Seven studies were included for this comparison. Five studies compared the efficacy of a secondary intratympanic corticosteroid with no therapy, and two studies compared intratympanic corticosteroid with intratympanic placebo. Intratympanic therapy may result in a small improvement in the change in hearing threshold (low-certainty evidence) although the mean difference was just below the threshold for clinical relevance (PTA change -9.07 dB). In addition, intratympanic corticosteroids may result in a much higher proportion of patients achieving an improvement in their hearing (absolute effect of 315 more patients per 1000 having improved hearing) and a small, but clinically important, effect on the final hearing threshold (decrease of 11.09 dB HL, low-certainty). The clinically relevant effects persisted after sensitivity analysis.

Adverse effects were only reported for those who received intratympanic corticosteroids, and we were unable to compare the intervention to placebo or no treatment. Persistent tympanic membrane perforation, vertigo/dizziness at the time of injection, and ear pain at the time of injection were all reported in the intervention group, but their frequency could not be precisely determined. The results indicate that there may be a small improvement in hearing with the use of intratympanic corticosteroids, but it is unclear whether this would be a noticeable or important difference.

### Intratympanic methylprednisolone for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^116h4APf]. Otology & Neurotology (2007). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids are commonly used for the treatment of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSHL). In this study, the effectiveness of intratympanic (IT) corticosteroid injection was examined and compared with a control group in patients with SSHL who failed systemic corticosteroid treatment.

- **Materials and methods**: A total of 19 patients formed the retreatment group (RG) and 18 patients comprised the control group (CG). All participants had failed high-dose intravenous and oral corticosteroid treatments. These patients were invited back, with IT methylprednisolone injected five times at 3-day intervals in the RG, followed by a mean observation period of 24.9 months (range: 7–30 months). Audiological evaluations were conducted initially, a week after completing the injections, monthly during the first 3 months, and at the end of the follow-up period in the RG. The CG was followed up for 3 months after the completion of systemic corticosteroid treatment without any additional drug administration.

- **Results**: The mean age was 52.6 years (range: 20–79 years) in the RG and 59.9 years in the CG. In the RG, the mean pure-tone average for speech frequencies (500–4,000 Hz) at baseline audiogram, at the first month, at the third month, and at the final controls were 65.2 dB (range: 43–102 dB), 45.4 dB (range: 23–77 dB), 43.6 dB (range: 30–77 dB), and 44.5 dB (range: 33–77 dB), respectively. In the CG, the mean pure-tone averages for speech frequencies at the end of systemic treatment and at the third-month control were 63.5 dB (range: 44–98 dB) and 59.0 dB (range: 40–100 dB), respectively.

### Clinical practice guideline: Sudden hearing loss (update) [^1166JvBr]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for sudden sensorineural hearing loss, particularly in relation to intratympanic corticosteroids, the AAO-HNSF 2019 guidelines recommend offering or referring patients to a clinician who can offer intratympanic corticosteroid therapy when there is incomplete recovery from SSNHL two to six weeks after the onset of symptoms.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^116FwG1o]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

The quality of the evidence was largely assessed as low or very low. There was moderate-certainty evidence for a small number of outcomes, but no high-certainty evidence was identified. The main reasons for this uncertainty were serious risks of bias in the included studies and imprecise effect estimates. Imprecision was attributed to the small number of participants, few events, or wide confidence intervals overlapping the threshold for clinical relevance.

Almost all included studies had a small number of participants, increasing the risk that randomization may not achieve balance across groups for important prognostic characteristics (both known and unknown) that may confound outcome estimates. One such characteristic is the propensity towards spontaneous recovery, which can significantly impact pooled estimates for hearing threshold. Imbalance across groups may not be detected by comparing baseline parameters, such as pre-treatment hearing loss and the delay between symptom onset and treatment initiation. Thus, it is crucial for trials to have enough participants to achieve balance across groups for the propensity towards spontaneous recovery and other important prognostic factors. This is supported by meta-analyses that demonstrated, in both primary and secondary treatments respectively, that variation in outcome estimates is reduced when there is a larger number of participants.

### Efficacy of intratympanic OTO-104 for the treatment of Ménière's disease: The outcome of three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [^11485MUN]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). High credibility.

- **AVERTS-1**: In the AVERTS-1 study, although the OTO-104 treatment group had a lower adjusted mean DVD than placebo at month 3, the difference was not statistically significant (2.2 for OTO-104 versus 2.4 for placebo; p = 0.623; Fig. 2A). Secondary endpoints of mean vertigo severity score at month 3 (0.408 for OTO-104 versus 0.403 for placebo; p = 0.932), change from baseline in vertigo frequency at month 3 (−0.173 for OTO-104 versus −0.173 for placebo; p = 0.993), and effect of vertigo on days sick at home or bedridden at month 3 (0.590 for OTO-104 versus 0.579 for placebo; p = 0.943) were not different between OTO-104 and placebo groups. Also, the SF-36 physical and mental health summaries at month 3 were not significantly different between OTO-104 and placebo groups (data not shown).

	- **Subgroup analysis**: In a subgroup analysis of the 115 patients (69.7% of study population) who did not previously receive intratympanic steroid injections, OTO-104 patients improved more (i.e. had lower adjusted mean DVD) from baseline than patients receiving placebo at month 3, and the difference was significant (1.895 for OTO-104 versus 3.027 for placebo; p = 0.045). In contrast, of the 50 patients (30.3% of the study population) who previously received intratympanic steroid injections, placebo patients had lower adjusted mean DVD (i.e. improved more) compared with patients receiving OTO-104 at month 3, and the difference was statistically significant.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for Ménière's disease [^114RW8dQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Ménière's disease is a condition that causes episodes of vertigo, associated with hearing loss and tinnitus. Corticosteroids are sometimes administered directly into the middle ear to treat this condition, through the tympanic membrane. The underlying cause of Ménière's disease is unknown, as is the way in which this treatment may work. The efficacy of this intervention in preventing vertigo attacks and their associated symptoms is currently unclear.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of intratympanic corticosteroids versus placebo or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register, Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 14 September 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in adults with a diagnosis of Ménière's disease, comparing intratympanic corticosteroids with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies with follow-up of less than three months or with a cross-over design, unless data from the first phase of the study could be identified.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome - improved or not improved), and 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale).

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for Ménière's disease [^1148YKX6]. The Cochrane database of systematic reviews (2023). High credibility.

A variety of different interventions have been proposed to treat people with Ménière's disease. These include dietary or lifestyle changes, oral treatments, treatments administered by injection into the ear (intratympanic), and surgical treatments. This review focuses on the use of intratympanic corticosteroids to treat the symptoms of Ménière's disease.

Corticosteroids can be administered into the middle ear through the tympanic membrane. They are often administered via injection but can also be delivered as drops through a ventilation tube, with or without a wick. Treatment regimens vary from a one-off injection to a short course (two to three injections), and may need to be repeated if symptoms recur. Different types of corticosteroids may be used, including methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, or hydrocortisone.

At present, there is no agreement on the ideal treatment for people with Ménière's disease; consequently, there is no 'gold standard' treatment with which to compare these medications.

- **How the intervention might work**: The underlying cause of Ménière's disease is poorly understood, as are the mechanisms by which the interventions may work. The specific action of steroids in the inner ear is unclear but may include an influence on water homeostasis, ion channels, and blood flow to the inner ear (reviewed in Farhood 2016). The rationale for intratympanic delivery is that it enables steroids to reach the target organ at a high dose, whilst avoiding complications from systemic administration.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^115dRwg3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Study limitations included risk of bias, inconsistency (heterogeneity), indirectness of evidence (characteristics of participant population), imprecision (variance of the outcome within studies), and publication bias.

A summary of findings table was included, constructed according to the recommendations described in Chapter 10 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Handbook 2021), for the following comparisons:

- **Intratympanic corticosteroids versus systemic corticosteroids**: as primary therapy.
- **Intratympanic plus systemic corticosteroids (combined therapy) versus systemic corticosteroids alone**: as primary therapy.
- **Intratympanic corticosteroids versus no treatment or versus placebo**: as secondary therapy.
- **Intratympanic plus systemic corticosteroids (combined therapy) versus systemic corticosteroids alone**: as secondary therapy.

The following outcomes were included in the summary of findings tables:

- **Change in hearing threshold** with pure tone audiometry (pure tone average (PTA)).
- **Proportion of patients whose hearing is improved**.
- **Final hearing threshold**.
- **Adverse events**.

Adverse events were inconsistently reported across the studies, with a wide range of different adverse events described. For the summary of findings tables, events that were considered most relevant to intratympanic injection, namely tympanic membrane perforation, ear pain, and vertigo/dizziness, were prioritized. All other adverse events are described in the text of the review and additional tables (Table 2; Table 4; Table 6; Table 8), but not included in the summary of findings.

### Intratympanic triamcinolone and dexamethasone in the treatment of Ménière's syndrome [^115BeXAZ]. Otology & Neurotology (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to describe the safety and potential efficacy of the intratympanic administration of triamcinolone (40mg/mL) in the treatment of unilateral Ménière's syndrome.

- **Study design**: Single-institution retrospective analysis.

- **Setting**: Tertiary referral neurotology clinic.

- **Patients**: Eighteen patients diagnosed with unilateral Ménière's syndrome with vertigo refractory to medical management.

- **Interventions**: Intratympanic injection of triamcinolone or dexamethasone.

- **Outcome measures**: Kaplan-Meier analysis was implemented to determine the rate of successful vertigo control. Responders were defined as patients who achieved sufficient vertigo control to decline ablative therapy. Nonresponders were defined as those who did not achieve satisfactory vertigo control and required ablative or surgical therapy. Pre- and post-treatment audiogram data were used to evaluate changes in hearing. Patient follow-up data were assessed for complications potentially resulting from intratympanic therapy.

Results indicated that no patient experienced profound hearing loss or other serious adverse events as a result of intratympanic triamcinolone therapy. Tympanic membrane perforation occurred in three (18%) patients, all of whom had received three or more previous intratympanic injections. Satisfactory vertigo control with intratympanic triamcinolone therapy was achieved in 14 (78%) of 18 subjects.

In conclusion, our results suggest that intratympanic triamcinolone therapy on an as-needed basis is a safe and potentially effective procedure for vertigo control in patients with Ménière's syndrome.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^111WNSKa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

A small number of studies investigated secondary treatment after the failure of initial therapy. The type of initial (primary) treatment that participants received varied: three studies used intravenous steroids, three studies used a 10- to 14-day course of oral steroids, and one study used an initial dose of intravenous steroids followed by a tapered oral dose. One study did not describe the primary therapy used.

Most studies that considered secondary treatment compared intratympanic steroids to either no treatment or placebo. A single study compared intratympanic plus systemic corticosteroids to systemic corticosteroids alone.

- **Administration methods**: The nature of the intratympanic injection varied between studies. Most studies used an intratympanic delivery of either dexamethasone or methylprednisolone, administered as a short course of three to four injections over 7 to 14 days. Two studies employed notably different methods. One involved daily injections for 10 days, followed by alternate-day injections for a further 20 days and ongoing injections twice a week for five months. Another study used a catheter to provide continuous infusion of dexamethasone over 14 days, rather than intermittent injections.

### Study of steroid effects on graft and inner ear outcomes in tympanoplasty: Randomized controlled trial [^111tpDmX]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2018). High credibility.

More studies are needed to investigate the side effects of steroids in tympanoplasty, owing to the paucity of such studies in the literature. This randomized, controlled clinical trial included 59 patients with chronic otitis media who underwent tympanoplasty and were randomized after surgery to a systemic steroid or no steroid treatment. Patients were randomized into two groups. Perforation size, graft outcome, and complications such as tinnitus and hearing loss were compared between the two groups.

Postsurgical steroid injection had no effect on graft outcome (p = 0.927) or tinnitus (p = 0.478). Tympanic membrane perforation (p = 0.92), plaque size (p = 0.94), bleeding amount (p = 0.38), and mucosal status (p = 0.96) during surgery had no effect on graft outcome after the tympanoplasty. In conclusion, administration of steroids after tympanoplasty failed to improve outcome and may put the patient at risk of side effects.

### The role of steroids in the preservation of hearing and vestibular function in cochlear implantation [^115yJnuj]. The Laryngoscope (2024). High credibility.

Cochlear implant surgery is guided by principles of atraumatic insertion to protect the inner ear. Previous studies suggest the potential benefit of steroids in patients undergoing cochlear implantation (CI), although the optimal route of administration has yet to be determined. We aim to systematically review the human studies of hearing and vestibular function preservation in patients undergoing CI receiving perioperative steroids and to discuss their role.

- **Data sources**: Search performed in PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases in December 2023.

- **Review methods**: Studies comparing several methods of steroid delivery and conventional management for patients undergoing CI were identified. Primary outcomes included hearing and vestibular function preservation. Secondary outcomes included reported adverse events, routes of steroid administration, and the presence of a control group without steroid administration.

- **Results**: A total of 15 studies (N = 659) met inclusion criteria. Methodology, doses, route of steroid administration, and follow-up duration differed between most studies. Audiometric, vestibular, and hearing preservation (HP) results were inconsistent. In 12 studies, perioperative steroids were associated with either increased HP or vestibular function preservation. Only two studies reported adverse events related to oral corticosteroid therapy.

- **Conclusions**: There is a tendency for perioperative steroids to have a positive impact, at least in the short term, on hearing and vestibular function preservation in CI. Topical corticosteroid therapy appears to be beneficial.

### Steroids for idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^111Xc18x]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

This update of a Cochrane review was first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 1, 2006, and previously updated in 2009. Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL) is a clinical diagnosis characterized by sudden deafness of cochlear or retrocochlear origin, in the absence of a clear precipitating cause. Steroids are commonly prescribed to treat this condition; however, there is no consensus on their effectiveness.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether steroids in the treatment of ISSHL a) improve hearing (primary) and b) reduce tinnitus (secondary). Additionally, to determine the incidence of significant side effects from the medication.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose, and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was April 22, 2013.

- **Selection criteria**: We identified all randomized controlled trials (with or without blinding) in which steroids were evaluated in comparison with either no treatment or a placebo. Trials were considered that included the use of steroids in combination with another treatment if the comparison control group also received the same other treatment. Two authors reviewed the full-text articles of all the retrieved trials of possible relevance and applied the inclusion criteria independently.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We graded trials for the risk of bias using the Cochrane approach.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^113wezBs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Summary of main results

We identified data for four of our proposed comparisons from a total of 30 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that analyzed 2133 participants. No data were found for the comparisons of intratympanic corticosteroids versus no treatment/placebo as primary therapy, intratympanic corticosteroids versus systemic corticosteroids as secondary therapy, or intratympanic corticosteroids plus systemic corticosteroids versus placebo/no treatment as either primary or secondary therapy.

- **Intratympanic corticosteroids versus systemic corticosteroids as primary therapy**: We identified 16 studies and analyzed 1108 patients for this comparison (Table 1). Intratympanic corticosteroids may result in a trivial or no difference in the change in hearing threshold compared to systemic steroids (low-certainty evidence). They probably also result in little to no difference in the number of participants whose hearing improves and may result in little to no difference in the final hearing threshold. The confidence intervals of all outcomes do not overlap the thresholds for clinical relevance, and these results persisted after sensitivity analysis. Overall, vertigo and dizziness may be increased, and ear pain is probably more common for those who receive intratympanic corticosteroids. However, adverse effects commonly associated with steroid use, such as blood glucose problems, may be reduced among those who receive intratympanic steroids. Persistent tympanic membrane perforation and ear pain are probable adverse outcomes.

### Comparison of 2 different intratympanic methylprednisolone injection schedules in combination with intravenous dexamethasone for unilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^1131zQAS]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is a common otologic disease in clinical settings. Systemic and intratympanic steroid treatments have been proven effective, but the regimens vary from center to center. The purpose of this study is to analyze the effects of the combined application of intravenous dexamethasone and intratympanic methylprednisolone injection in different time strategies for the treatment of unilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss.

A retrospective chart review was conducted for the period from March 2016 to June 2018 at our Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. A total of 61 patients who met the academy criteria for unilateral sudden hearing loss were included and grouped based on the timing of introducing intratympanic methylprednisolone. All patients received intravenous dexamethasone, 10 mg once daily for 5 days followed by 5 mg once daily for the next 7 days. Intratympanic methylprednisolone (40 mg) was injected every other day four times in all patients, commencing on day 1 in group 1 and day 6 in group 2. The pre-and post-treatment pure-tone audiograms were analyzed.

A total of sixty-one patients met our inclusion criteria. No significant differences were observed between patients' demographics or pretreatment hearing thresholds. In the 3-month post-treatment pure-tone audiogram assessment, the mean hearing threshold improvements were similar between groups with no frequency specificity. The curative rate in both groups was similar and satisfactory. Two patients with diabetes mellitus had persistent small perforations.

### Efficacy of steroid injection on idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^114TGCpa]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

To evaluate the effectiveness of transtympanic steroid injection on patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL), we compared patients who received oral steroids alone.

- **Study design**: Retrospective chart review.

- **Methods**: Patients with a history of ISSNHL and failed oral steroid therapy were included. Audiograms were performed, and patients were included if sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) of more than 20 dB occurred over less than 72 hours. Patients who received transtympanic steroid injection were compared with those who received oral steroids alone.

- **Results**: Sixty-one patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study. The number of patients with improvement in pure tone average in the injection group was 9 (30%) compared with 5 (17%) in the oral group. Twelve (38.7%) of the injected patients had improvement in speech discrimination scores of greater than 15% compared with only 3 (10%) in the oral steroid group.

Our study revealed that patients with ISSNHL who have failed oral steroid therapy obtain better hearing results with transtympanic steroids in comparison to oral steroids.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^112G3C3F]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) is common and is defined as a sudden decrease in sensorineural hearing sensitivity of unknown etiology. Systemic corticosteroids are widely used; however, their value remains unclear. Intratympanic injections of corticosteroids have become increasingly common in the treatment of ISSNHL.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of intratympanic corticosteroids in people with ISSNHL.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched several databases, including the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; CENTRAL (2021, Issue 9); PubMed; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP as well as additional sources for published and unpublished trials (search date: 23 September 2021).

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving people with ISSNHL and follow-up of over a week. Intratympanic corticosteroids were given as primary or secondary treatment (after failure of systemic therapy).

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methods, including GRADE, to assess the certainty of the evidence. Our primary outcome was the change in hearing threshold measured by pure tone audiometry. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of people whose hearing improved, final hearing threshold, speech audiometry, frequency-specific hearing changes, and adverse effects.

- **Main results**: We included 30 studies, comprising 2,133 analyzed participants. Some studies had more than two treatment arms and were therefore relevant to several comparisons. Studies investigated intratympanic corticosteroids as either primary (initial treatment) or secondary therapy.

### Evaluation of levels of triamcinolone acetonide in human perilymph and plasma after intratympanic application in patients receiving cochlear implants: A randomized clinical trial [^112T1PiU]. JAMA Otolaryngology–Head & Neck Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Each patient provided written informed consent to participate in this prospective study, which was approved by the ethics committee of the Medical University of Vienna. Inclusion criteria required patients to be between 18 and 90 years old, undergoing cochlear implantation, and willing to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria included patients younger than 18 years, individuals receiving steroids regularly or having received steroids preoperatively either intravenously or orally, those with contraindications to the administration of triamcinolone acetonide (TAC), or contraindications against intratympanic (IT) injections.

- **Study population**: Forty patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups. Groups 1 and 2 received IT TAC approximately 24 hours before surgery, whereas groups 3 and 4 received the injection approximately 1 hour before surgery. Groups 1 and 3 were treated with TAC at a concentration of 10 mg/mL, while groups 2 and 4 received 40 mg/mL.

- **Causes of hearing loss**: Otosclerosis (n = 1), Meniere disease (n = 2), labyrinthitis (n = 1), progressive hearing loss after cytomegalovirus infection (n = 1), progressive sensorineural hearing loss (n = 24), sudden sensorineural hearing loss (n = 5), and vestibular schwannoma (n = 3).

### Sudden sensorineural hearing loss in children: A report of 75 cases [^111MnBPB]. Otology & Neurotology (2018). Low credibility.

Systemic steroids are recommended for the treatment of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) in American guidelines, and intratympanic steroid therapy is considered second-line or salvage therapy. Although the guidelines are proposed for patients over 18 years of age, literature has reported that systemic steroids are also the first choice for children with SSNHL. Some studies on intratympanic steroid treatment for idiopathic SSNHL, after the failure of intravenous therapy, demonstrate that the salvage therapy offers potential benefits. Salvage therapy provides localized treatment with higher perilymphatic concentrations and avoids systemic side effects.

Some of the disadvantages include otalgia during and after treatment, persistent tympanic membrane perforation, vertigo, dysgeusia, and potential infection. There are reports on systemic steroid treatment in children; however, there is insufficient data on intratympanic steroid administration in this age group. There are only two studies on intratympanic steroid administration in children:

- **Study by Pitaro et al**: Investigated 8 of 19 children who received intratympanic steroid salvage therapy. Five had partial hearing recovery, and three did not improve.
- **Review by Dedhia and Chi**: Reviewed 20 children with SSNHL; two patients underwent intratympanic steroid therapy, and both showed improvement.

Oral steroid combined with intratympanic injection is discussed in the literature. The authors also propose that combination therapy is better than single drug therapy.

### The effectiveness of intratympanic steroid injection in addition to systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^113Ui5xV]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2023). High credibility.

There is significant debate regarding the efficacy of intratympanic steroid (ITS) therapy in idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL). ITS are reported to have an effect on ISSHL, and ITS with additional systemic therapy are also effective. Achieving the correct diagnosis rapidly in the primary treatment of ISSHL is crucial, as early treatment greatly increases the likelihood of hearing recovery.

A retrospective study was conducted from 2010 to 2017 at the 1st ENT Clinic of Athens. Participants were inpatients who were first examined and diagnosed with ISSNHL in the Emergency Department and subsequently admitted to the clinic. In 2014, our clinic changed the treating protocol of ISSNHL. We compared the audiological results of patients treated with the previous protocol (intravenous steroids) to those treated with the new protocol (combined intravenous and intratympanic steroids).

The main outcome measure was the hearing threshold before treatment and after completion of therapy. We retrieved from the hospital medical records the following demographic and clinical data: sex, age, date of admission, comorbidities, hearing threshold per frequency on admission and on discharge day, and the time period between the onset of symptoms and initial treatment.

We concluded that both intratympanic steroids and systemic steroids alone appear equally effective. However, the use of intratympanic and systemic steroids together is likely superior to either used alone. Intratympanic steroids likely offer additional benefits as secondary/salvage therapy in patients who do not respond to initial treatment.

### Transtympanic iontophoresis of gadopentetate dimeglumine: Preliminary results [^112knowg]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

We sought to demonstrate the feasibility of using iontophoresis to deliver pharmaceutical agents into the middle and inner ear for the treatment of middle and inner ear diseases, which is proved in this study by the successful iontophoresis of the ferromagnetic contrast agent gadopentetate dimeglumine.

- **Study design and setting**: Eight rabbits were iontophoresed using gadopentetate dimeglumine solution 469 mg/mL. Then, all rabbits underwent magnetic resonance imaging for the detection of gadopentetate dimeglumine in the middle and inner ear structures. The study was conducted in the tertiary referral center, the University Hospital of Crete.

- **Results**: The high signal intensity of the gadopentetate dimeglumine solution was demonstrated within the middle ear cavity and inner ear structures of all iontophoresed ears and in none of the noniontophoresed ones.

- **Conclusions**: Transtympanic iontophoresis could be an effective method for the passage of pharmaceutical agents into the middle and inner ear for the treatment of middle and inner ear diseases.

### Assessment of safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and volume-dependent conductive hearing loss in healthy volunteers: First-in-human, open-label, placebo-controlled study of a single intratympanic injection of AC102 [^116ybmb1]. Otology & Neurotology (2025). Low credibility.

Despite numerous efforts, at the time of writing, no approved pharmacotherapies are available for the treatment of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL). The treatment of hearing loss with systemic or intratympanic glucocorticoid steroids, which have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties, is recommended in many countries and is regarded as the standard of care. However, there is a lack of clear evidence for the significant beneficial effects of glucocorticoids in treating SSNHL. In addition, such treatment may not be justified due to the possible side effects, including hypertension, behavioral disturbances, and diabetes mellitus. Although the root cause of SSNHL is often unknown, it likely affects the hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) of the auditory nerve. Importantly, neither the hair cells nor the SGNs can be replaced once lost. Therefore, it is crucial to have an immediate and target-specific intervention to prevent any further damage to these cells and to prevent acute hearing loss from becoming permanent.

Getting drugs or medication into the inner ear can be a challenging task due to the presence of the blood-labyrinth barrier that protects the inner ear and SGNs. Therefore, a systemically administered medication is less likely to reach these target tissues at levels sufficient to have a therapeutic effect without the risk of systemic adverse reactions. Different approaches have been explored to target the inner ear effectively, including local delivery via intratympanic injection.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for Ménière's disease [^117VSVC3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

There is a paucity of evidence about all of these interventions, despite some of them being in common use for Ménière's disease. All the evidence we found was of very low or low certainty, showing that we are unsure of the effects of the interventions. Future research may significantly alter the effect estimates. We were unable to carry out many meta-analyses. Although we identified 10 studies for inclusion, there were often differences in the actual outcomes assessed in each study or the time points for follow-up. Therefore, we were unable to pool the data to achieve a more precise estimate of any effect. Additionally, study authors often used different methods of measuring the same outcome, which prevented data from being combined. For example, vertigo was assessed using either a global score or a frequency score, which could not be combined, and hearing was assessed using a continuous scale or as an improvement above a certain threshold.

Certain outcomes were only assessed by some included studies. Many studies did not assess the impact of the disease on quality of life or tinnitus at all. Potential adverse effects of the interventions were also often poorly reported or simply not assessed. We noted that unvalidated rating scales were commonly used in the studies included, particularly when looking at the global impact of treatments for vertigo. When such scales are used, it is difficult to determine if they are accurately assessing the outcome and what size of change on this scale represents a meaningful difference in the outcome (the minimally important difference).

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for Ménière's disease [^1135Mb1Z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

The GRADE approach rates evidence from RCTs that do not have serious limitations as high certainty. However, several factors can lead to downgrading the evidence to moderate, low, or very low certainty. The degree of downgrading is determined by the seriousness of these factors:

- **Study limitations (risk of bias)**: This was assessed using the rating from the Cochrane risk of bias tool for the study or studies included in the analysis. We rated down either one or two levels, depending on the number of domains that had been rated at high or unclear risk of bias.

- **Inconsistency**: This was assessed using the I² statistic and the P value for heterogeneity for all meta-analyses, as well as by visual inspection of the forest plot. For results based on a single study, we rated this domain as having no serious inconsistency.

- **Indirectness of evidence**: We considered whether there were concerns over the population included in these studies for each outcome, as well as whether additional treatments were offered that may impact the efficacy of the intervention under consideration.

- **Imprecision**: We took into account the sample size and the width of the confidence interval for each outcome. If the sample size did not meet the optimal information size (i.e. fewer than 400 people for continuous outcomes or fewer than 300 events for dichotomous outcomes), or if the confidence interval crossed the small effect threshold, we rated down one level. If the sample size did not meet the optimal information size and the confidence interval included both potential harm and potential benefit, we rated down twice.

### Intratympanic dexamethasone for sudden sensorineural hearing loss after failure of systemic therapy [^115mEsTn]. The Laryngoscope (2007). Low credibility.

Intratympanic steroids are increasingly used in the treatment of inner ear disorders, especially in patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) who have failed systemic therapy. We reviewed our experience with intratympanic steroids in the treatment of patients with sudden SNHL to determine overall success, morbidity, and prognostic factors.

The hypothesis is that intratympanic steroids have minimal morbidity and the potential to positively affect hearing recovery in patients with sudden SNHL who have failed systemic therapy.

- **Study design**: The authors conducted a retrospective review.

- **Methods**: Patients presenting with sudden SNHL, defined as a rapid decline in hearing over three days or less affecting three or more frequencies by 30 dB or greater, who underwent intratympanic steroid therapy (24 mg/mL dexamethasone) were reviewed. Patients with Meniere disease, retrocochlear disease, autoimmune HL, trauma, fluctuating HL, radiation-induced HL, noise-induced HL, or any other identifiable etiology for sudden HL were excluded. Patients who showed signs of hearing fluctuation after injection were also excluded.

Pretreatment and posttreatment audiometric evaluations, including pure-tone average (PTA) and speech reception threshold (SRT), were analyzed. Patient variables related to recovery were studied, including patient age, time to onset of therapy, status of the contralateral ear, presence of diabetes, severity of HL, and associated symptoms (tinnitus, vertigo). A 20-dB gain in PTA or a 20% improvement in SDS was considered significant.

### Intratympanic steroid treatment for sudden deafness: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114JGoLB]. Otology & Neurotology (2012). High credibility.

The efficacy of intratympanic steroid (ITS) treatment in sudden deafness (SD) remains controversial. To shed light on this issue, we performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials to assess the overall efficacy of ITS therapy and clarify whether it is more suitable as a first-line approach (primary treatment) or as a salvage treatment when traditional systemic agents have failed.

- **Methods**: An electronic database search (MEDLINE and PubMed) was performed with the objective of identifying all studies published in the English language between January 1980 and November 2011 on the efficacy of ITS in the treatment of SD. All relevant articles were retrieved, and the related reference lists were reviewed systematically to identify other reports that could be included. Data were synthesized using the Mantel-Haenszel model. Results are expressed as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).

- **Results**: A total of 11 randomized studies including 472 subjects allocated to ITS and 453 controls were selected. Intratympanic steroid regimens used and treatments administered to controls varied widely across studies. When considering together trials investigating ITS therapy as a primary (n = 4) or salvage (n = 7) treatment, the common OR for recovery was 1.7 (95% CI, 1.3–2.3). When considering them separately, the common ORs for recovery were 0.9 (95% CI, 0.7–1.6) for primary and 2.9 (95% CI, 1.9–4.5) for salvage therapy.

- **Conclusion**: Intratympanic steroid therapy seems to confer a certain degree of benefit as a salvage but not as a primary treatment of sudden deafness.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^116nUq1b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Measures of treatment effect are essential for understanding the impact of intratympanic corticosteroids on sudden sensorineural hearing loss. We summarized the effects of dichotomous outcomes, such as the proportion of patients with hearing improvement measured by pure tone audiometry, as risk ratios (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). For key dichotomous outcomes presented in the summary of findings tables, we also expressed the results as absolute numbers, indicating both the assumed risk in the comparator group and the corresponding risk associated with the experimental intervention, based on its pooled relative effect and 95% CI.

For outcomes measured on a continuous scale, such as change in PTA and final PTA, we calculated the mean difference (MD) with a 95% CI. The summary statistic in the meta-analysis for the primary outcome was the mean difference (MD) of the mean change in dB (baseline/post-therapy) in hearing threshold between two groups in each study, measured by pure tone audiometry. Similarly, for the secondary outcome 'final hearing threshold', the summary statistic was the mean difference (MD) of the mean final hearing threshold in dB HL (post-therapy) between two groups in each study, also measured by pure tone audiometry. We used RevMan 5 to compute the measures of treatment effect for each individual study [RevMan 2020].

For hearing outcomes measured on a continuous scale, such as change in PTA and final PTA, we assumed a difference of 10 dB to be a clinically relevant effect. This decision was based on the test-retest reliability of pure tone audiometric measurements and established minimal criteria for improvement in individual patients [Chandrasekhar 2019; Gurgel 2012; Stachler 2019].

### Steroid nomenclature in inner ear therapy [^116eWV7H]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Low credibility.

Local glucocorticosteroid ("steroid") therapy is widely used to treat the inner ears of patients with Menière's disease, idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss, and in combination with cochlear implants. Applied steroids have included dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, and triamcinolone. However, the steroid forms commonly applied are often dexamethasone-phosphate, methylprednisolone-hemisuccinate, or triamcinolone-acetonide. In each case, the additional component is not a counter-ion but is covalently bound to the molecule to increase aqueous solubility or potency. These drug forms are approved for intravenous or intramuscular delivery and are used "off-label" in the ear.

When given systemically, the molecular form of the drug is of minor importance as the drugs are rapidly metabolized. In contrast, when administered intratympanically, the exact form of the drug has a major influence on entry into perilymph and elimination from perilymph, which in turn influences distribution along the cochlear scalae. Dexamethasone-phosphate has completely different molecular properties from dexamethasone and has different pharmacokinetic properties entering and leaving perilymph. Molecular properties and perilymph pharmacokinetics also differ markedly for triamcinolone and triamcinolone-acetonide. Methylprednisolone-hemisuccinate has completely different molecular properties from methylprednisolone. In the ear, different steroid forms cannot therefore be regarded as equivalent in terms of pharmacokinetics or efficacy. This presents a terminology problem.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for Ménière's disease [^11582qX1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

We rated all the included studies at either high or unclear risk of bias from selective reporting. Three studies did not have a published protocol to compare the reported results to and were therefore rated at unclear risk of selective reporting. These studies were Borghei 2016, El Shafei 2020, and Garduno-Anaya 2005. We also rated two of the studies on OTO-104 at unclear risk due to issues in reporting: Lambert 2012 provided very limited narrative data only on hearing and quality of life, precluding any meta-analysis, and NCT02265393 reported most outcomes at 12 months of follow-up (when all participants had received the study drug), rather than reporting at six months of follow-up, which would allow for a comparison of efficacy between control and intervention arms.

- **High risk of bias**: We rated three studies at high risk of bias. In Ul Shamas 2017, no vertigo outcomes were reported, which is extremely unusual for a trial on Ménière's disease. In the cases of AVERTS-2 and Lambert 2016, there were discrepancies in reporting between the trial registration documents and the publications. The trial registry site for AVERTS-2 indicated that hearing and quality of life would be assessed; however, these were not reported. Additionally, tympanic membrane perforation, a widely recognized complication of this procedure, was not included in the adverse event reporting. The trial registry site for Lambert 2016 indicated that outcomes would be reported after four months of follow-up, yet the trial results are provided at three months of follow-up.

Statistical analysis

Median values with ranges (presented as minimum to maximum) are given for continuous variables. The nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare TAC levels in perilymph and plasma. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) models were used for group comparisons of the TAC levels in perilymph.

- **One-factorial ANOVA**: First, groups 1 to 4 were compared using a 1-factorial ANOVA design. The Tukey-Kramer method was used for multiplicity-adjusted pairwise group comparisons.
- **Two-factorial ANOVA**: Second, two 1-factorial ANOVA models were applied, testing for the overall dose (10 mg/mL vs. 40 mg/mL) and the overall time point (1 hour vs. 24 hours) effects. Third, a 2-factorial ANOVA model was used, including the 2 factors of dose and time between application and sampling, together with an interaction term to test for a dose-dependent time effect and a time-dependent dose effect, respectively.

Due to the skew distribution of the TAC levels in perilymph, log10-transformed values were used as dependent variables for all ANOVA and regression models. To quantify the strength of the effects on TAC levels, the geometric mean ratios (GMRs) with 95% CIs were determined by retransforming mean differences from the logarithmic to the original scale. To compare the TAC levels in patients with an aerated middle ear to patients with mucosal disease, the 2-sample t test was used for perilymph (log10 transformed) and the exact Wilcoxon rank sum test for plasma. Analysis was conducted using SAS statistical software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute), and a 2-sided P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^115UC2oc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

For this comparison, eight studies provided information pertaining to adverse events (Ahn 2008; Arastou 2013; Arslan 2011; Battaglia 2008; Choi 2011; Gundogan 2013; Koltsidopoulos 2013; Tsounis 2018). In three studies, reporting was incomplete for one or more adverse event outcomes, because it was unclear in which group (or groups) events were observed (Arastou 2013; Arslan 2011; Tsounis 2018). There were insufficient data for meta-analysis.

Five studies reported a rate of tympanic membrane perforation between 0% (0/85) and 5.5% (2/36) for those who received an intratympanic injection (Ahn 2008; Arastou 2013; Arslan 2011; Choi 2011; Gundogan 2013). We concluded that the evidence is very uncertain regarding the risk of tympanic membrane perforation for those who received intratympanic corticosteroid combined with systemic corticosteroid as primary treatment (474 participants; 5 studies; very low-certainty evidence).

Four studies reported a rate of vertigo/dizziness at the time of injection between 0% (0/60) and 8.1% (3/37) for those who received an intratympanic injection (Ahn 2008; Choi 2011; Gundogan 2013; Tsounis 2018). Note that in one study, two groups received intratympanic injection: one group received intratympanic corticosteroid, and the other received both intratympanic and systemic corticosteroid (Tsounis 2018). We concluded that the evidence is very uncertain regarding the risk of vertigo/dizziness at the time of intratympanic injection.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^115JcuGS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

After scanning all search results and independently screening titles and abstracts, we retrieved full texts of reports that loosely met the inclusion criteria and where exclusion of studies could not be clearly inferred from the abstract. At least two authors reviewed these and applied the inclusion criteria independently. These were as follows:

- **Intratympanic corticosteroid treatment of ISSNHL**: Clinical study.
- **Randomisation process**: Stated randomisation process.
- **Study comparisons included in the review**: At least one comparison included.

Final decisions on inclusion were based on the full-text analysis of preselected studies for the following criteria: 1) a reported randomisation process in the main text of the study report, 2) studying comparisons included in the review, 3) the diagnosis of included patients was ISSNHL, 4) the proportion of included patients with bilateral ISSNHL was below 5%, and 5) the time point of final outcome assessment was at least one week (eight days or more) after the start of treatment. In order to include a high number of studies, we also included those performing outcome assessments with short follow-up (less than four weeks). However, we considered a short follow-up duration of two weeks or less to represent a high risk of bias in these studies.

We openly discussed any differences of opinion about which studies to include in the review. If consensus could not be reached, we planned to refer these studies to the Cochrane ENT Co-ordinating Editor. However, this was not necessary in any case. Publications in languages that could not be read by the authors were not included.

### Intratympanic steroid treatments rescued recurrent hearing loss following COVID-19 vaccination and detection of an intralabyrinthine schwannoma [^111cCztv]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

To combat the COVID-19 pandemic, mRNA vaccines have been widely administered as one of the most effective approaches to protect from SARS-CoV-2 infections and/or severe disease. The adverse effects of mRNA vaccinations are mostly reported as mild and temporary, such as short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache without requiring specific treatments. However, it has been reported that these vaccinations are possibly associated with 147 cases of sudden hearing loss, deafness, unilateral deafness, neurosensory deafness, and hypoacusis. The incidence estimates of sudden sensorineural hearing loss after COVID-19 vaccination ranged from 0.3 to 4.1 per 100,000 per year. It was unclear how to specifically treat such sudden hearing loss. Here, we report a case of sudden and recurrent hearing loss following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in coincidence with detection of intralabyrinthine schwannoma and subsequent improvement with oral and then intratympanic steroid treatments.

### Standardization of outcome measures for intratympanic steroid treatment for idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^113MB2Xe]. Otology & Neurotology (2022). Low credibility.

To identify variability in reported hearing outcomes for intratympanic (IT) steroid treatment of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL), outcomes were compared using the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) guidelines with other published criteria.

- **Study design**: Retrospective chart review.

- **Setting**: Tertiary otology practice.

- **Patients**: Patients with ISSNHL treated with IT steroid between April 2003 and December 2020.

- **Interventions**: IT steroid injection and audiometric evaluation.

- **Main outcome measures**:
	1. Rates of full, partial, or no recovery using the AAO-HNS guideline versus other reported criteria
	2. Correlation analyses of demographic and clinical variables with response to IT steroid

- **Results**:
	- Using AAO-HNS reporting criteria, full recovery of the pure-tone average was noted in 25.68% of patients. Applying eight other published outcomes criteria to this patient cohort classified full recovery in 14.87% to 40.54% of patients. Similarly, AAO-HNS criteria classified "no recovery" in 51.35% of patients, whereas applying the other reported criteria showed an average rate of 62.16% no recovery and as high as 82.43% of patients without recovery. Younger age (p = 0.003; effect size, 0.924) and IT injection within a week of onset (p < 0.001; effect size, 1.099) positively correlated with full recovery. There was no impact of prior or concurrent oral steroids, or number of steroid injections on outcome.

- **Conclusion**: Great variability exists in the literature for the assessment of IT steroid outcomes in ISSNHL.

### Intratympanic corticosteroid injection as a first-line treatment of the patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss compared to systemic steroid: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112gp7Es]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2022). High credibility.

The study aimed to investigate if there is a difference in the use of intratympanic steroid therapy (IST), compared to systemic steroid treatment (SST), as an initial treatment for patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL). This was conducted through a meta-analysis design performed on the mean pure-tone average (PTA) improvement and the complete recovery rate.

A systematic literature review was performed on randomized controlled trials published from 1990 to August 2020 in databases including PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library/CENTRAL, Ovid, ProQuest, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov. The primary outcomes of interest were pure-tone average improvement and complete recovery rates.

Six eligible studies with 496 patients (250 patients in the IST group and 246 subjects in the SST group) were included. The pooled standardized mean difference of the PTAs was estimated as 0.07 (95% CI = -0.10 to 0.25; I² = 0.0%, P = 0.668), and the pooled odds ratio of complete recovery rate was obtained as 1.00 (95% CI = 0.66 to 1.51; I² = 31.6, P = 0.199). Moreover, the pooled standardized mean difference of the pure-tone average for the intratympanic steroid treatment group compared to the patients with oral steroid treatment was 0.07 (95% CI = -0.12 to 0.26; I² = 0.0%, P = 0.526).

The study demonstrated that the effect of the intratympanic injection of corticosteroid, as a first-line treatment, is not statistically different from the systemic route in improving the hearing outcomes among patients.

### Systemic steroid versus combined systemic and intratympanic steroid treatment for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^113kuyCi]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of oral steroid treatment versus combined oral and intratympanic dexamethasone injection for idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. This was conducted through a retrospective case review in which 30 patients in the oral steroid group and 39 patients in the combined oral and intratympanic steroid injection group were compared.

The comparison of the initial pure tone audiometry (PTA) threshold results revealed a significant difference between the systemic steroid (SS) group and the systemic and intratympanic steroid group. The initial PTA was 74.33 ± 22.64 dB (mean ± SD) in the SS group and 87.49 ± 26.22 dB (mean ± SD) in the intratympanic steroid group. The difference in the initial PTA results was statistically significant between the SS group and intratympanic steroid group (P < 0.05, P = 0.032). The pure-tone gain in the SS group was 20.97 ± 27.47 dB (mean ± SD), and that of the group treated with both systemic and intratympanic steroids was 19.36 ± 22.16 dB (mean ± SD) (P = 0.49).

The results of this study indicate that, in sudden sensorineural hearing loss, the administration of intratympanic steroids in conjunction with SS therapy appears to have the same effect on the restoration of hearing as the effect obtained using SS therapy alone.

Since the second treatment of local steroid injection on day 138, the patient had not reported any vertigo or further hearing loss for the following four months. The seventh audio test on day 252 showed a stable result similar to Audio 6, verifying the long-term improvement in hearing (Figure 1B–E, Audiogram 7).

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^115i3qdD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Hearing recovery in patients with ISSNHL mostly occurs early, within a few days of onset, but can also occur after several weeks. It has been observed that the time course of hearing recovery can extend to six months. However, most of the hearing improvement will take place during the first weeks after onset. To estimate the treatment effect of an intervention for ISSNHL, it is desirable that the final outcome assessment is conducted after several weeks of follow-up. Short evaluation periods may risk underestimation of treatment effects. After the recovery period, the hearing thresholds reached can be assumed to be stable in most patients. A large randomized controlled trial (published protocol) assessed the primary outcome 30 days after onset, with an initial assessment after 10 days and a follow-up at six months.

- **Why it is important to do this review**: There is still uncertainty as to (1) whether intratympanic corticosteroids are better than placebo or no treatment, (2) whether intratympanic administration of corticosteroids alone or in combination with systemic application of steroids will lead to better results than systemic drug administration alone, (3) if so, which treatment protocol will lead to the best outcome, and (4) what risks of adverse events are associated with this approach in inner ear therapy. This Cochrane Review was therefore warranted to assess the benefits and harms of intratympanic corticosteroids treatment for ISSNHL.

### Intratympanic steroid treatments rescued recurrent hearing loss following COVID-19 vaccination and detection of an intralabyrinthine schwannoma [^115VFuZf]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

A man in his 20s with normal vital records and blood pressure was referred to the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) clinic for two episodes of sudden hearing loss in the left ear within three months following the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccination. Oral steroids became ineffective after initially improving the first hearing loss. He experienced progressive hearing loss, continuous ringing and buzzing sounds in the left ear, and slight spontaneous vertigo in the later stages of the recurrent hearing loss. However, no position-evoked vertigo was reported.

The timeline of clinical symptoms and treatments includes audiometric and hearing measurements, as well as MRI images revealing an intralabyrinthine schwannoma. The timeline detailed the two-dose COVID-19 vaccination (4 weeks apart); the emergence of the initial 10-day hearing loss starting on day 1 after the second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine; and the second (recurrent) hearing loss on day 31, lasting for 3.5 months with accompanying ear ringing and mild vertigo. Clinical tests included seven audiometric tests, MRI, and a blood draw. Various treatments were deemed ineffective, such as pseudoephedrine, fluticasone propionate nasal spray, and oral prednisone, while the final effective treatment was intratympanic steroid injections. No pure tone average abnormalities or hearing loss symptoms were reported before vaccination.

### Intratympanic steroid treatment: A review [^114sUEWg]. Otology & Neurotology (2004). Low credibility.

The objective of this research was to review published literature regarding the use of intratympanic steroids in the treatment of Meniere's disease and sudden sensorineural hearing loss, and to make recommendations based on the literature review.

- **Data sources**: Literature was reviewed from 1996 to 2003 using PubMed, Medline Plus, and Web of Science.
- **Study selection**: Retrospective case series and uncontrolled prospective cohort studies were the only types of studies available for review.
- **Conclusion**: Based on the available literature, a weak recommendation is made to use intratympanic steroid treatment for sudden hearing loss if oral steroid therapy fails or is contraindicated. The existing studies regarding intratympanic steroid treatment of Meniere's disease and tinnitus are inadequate to determine the efficacy of this treatment for these conditions. Higher quality studies are needed.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^115CCPsb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist conducted systematic searches for randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials. There were no language, publication year, or publication status restrictions. The date of the search was 23 September 2021.

- **Electronic searches**: The Information Specialist searched various databases, including the Cochrane ENT Trials Register (via the Cochrane Register of Studies on 23 September 2021), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2021, Issue 9), PubMed (1946 to 23 September 2021), Ovid Embase (1974 to 23 September 2021), LILACS (searched 23 September 2021), Web of Knowledge and Web of Science (1945 to 23 September 2021), CNKI (searched via Google Scholar on 23 September 2021), ClinicalTrials.gov (searched via the Cochrane Register of Studies and clinicaltrials.gov on 23 September 2021), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP, searched 23 September 2021).

The Information Specialist modeled subject strategies for databases on the search strategy designed for CENTRAL. Where appropriate, they combined these with subject strategy adaptations of the highly sensitive search strategy designed by Cochrane for identifying randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials, as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version 5.1.0, Box 6.4.b. (Handbook 2011). Search strategies for major databases, including CENTRAL, are provided in Appendix 1.
