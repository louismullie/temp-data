## Question

If you have had COVID should you continue getting the covid vaccine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether someone who has already had COVID-19 should continue getting COVID-19 vaccines, and if so, how to time them and who needs extra doses. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the current official recommendations and whether prior infection changes eligibility. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for vaccination after infection, including hybrid immunity and waning. Next, I will examine special populations such as older adults and immunocompromised persons. After that, I need to check timing considerations after a recent infection and how to operationalize "up to date". Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically grounded recommendation and address common concerns like long COVID and safety, making sure I anchor this to ACIP/CDC and IDSA guidance and contemporary effectiveness data.

> Let me first confirm the current policy baseline so I don't jump to conclusions: ACIP recommends that all persons aged 6 months and older receive an updated 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose, regardless of prior infection history, and that adults aged 65 years and older and immunocompromised persons receive a second dose about 6 months later, with additional doses for immunocompromised patients based on shared clinical decision-making, which means prior infection does not exempt anyone from current vaccination recommendations [^115mjVep] [^113e8sZ7].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale for vaccinating after infection, because natural immunity alone is often overestimated. Large cohort data show unvaccinated individuals with prior symptomatic COVID-19 have substantial protection against reinfection, but that protection wanes and is not as durable or broad as vaccine-induced immunity, and importantly, vaccination after recovery adds meaningful protection on top of prior infection, reducing reinfection risk by roughly 47–62% in population-based analyses, which supports the concept of hybrid immunity being superior to infection alone [^116QC2bf] [^113y9pnk] [^113z5F9R].

> I should double-check the comparative effectiveness of hybrid immunity versus vaccine-only or infection-only states. Prospective cohorts and systematic reviews indicate that adults with prior infection plus a recent vaccine dose have about 60–62% protection against infection and 73–81% against symptomatic illness, outperforming those with only prior infection or only vaccination in many contexts, and a single updated mRNA dose in previously infected persons can yield protection comparable to a two-dose series in naïve individuals, reinforcing the value of layering vaccine onto natural immunity [^1179ouX6] [^113McKV2] [^114NuvpL].

> Hold on, I should verify waning and variant dynamics because protection is not static. Vaccine effectiveness against infection wanes over months and can vary by variant, but protection against severe outcomes persists longer, and updated annual formulations targeting circulating lineages restore protection, which is why programs have shifted to annual, variant-adapted vaccination to preempt seasonal surges and maintain population resilience [^112JqCZg] [^114W6FtJ] [^115mjVep].

> Next, I should review special populations. Adults aged 65 years and older have disproportionate hospitalization burdens and derive substantial benefit from an additional updated dose about 6 months after their first annual dose, and immunocompromised persons have attenuated vaccine responses and are prioritized for additional doses and, in some cases, pre-exposure prophylaxis with agents like pemivibart, with oncology guidance similarly endorsing updated doses and spacing around immunosuppressive therapies to optimize response [^115mjVep] [^116CAy9n] [^113Y6gFD].

> I need to ensure timing after a recent infection is handled correctly. Current guidance advises delaying vaccination for about 2–3 months after a recent COVID-19 infection to avoid redundant immune stimulation and to align with waning of infection-induced immunity, with ASCO suggesting 2–3 months and CDC/ACIP operational guidance commonly using a 3-month interval, while recognizing that optimal timing can be individualized based on exposure risk and clinical judgment [^116CAy9n] [^112hV16V].

> Let me consider long COVID and potential vaccine benefits beyond acute reinfection. Observational data suggest vaccination after infection is associated with improved long COVID symptom trajectories in many patients, although evidence quality is limited and heterogeneous, so while not definitive, this potential benefit further supports vaccination in those previously infected who continue to experience persistent symptoms [^111HJJ2s] [^115nVmiv] [^112eV8Ko].

> I should confirm safety and the "why bother" message. Serious adverse events from mRNA vaccines are uncommon and comparable to placebo in trials, and in the context of high background immunity, a single updated dose strategy balances benefit and reactogenicity, while public health messaging emphasizes that vaccination provides a more predictable, durable, and safer pathway to protection than relying on infection alone, which carries risks of severe disease and long COVID [^1153DkhG] [^117BiGvu] [^115mjVep].

> But wait, what if someone argues that natural immunity is enough? I should acknowledge that while prior infection confers meaningful protection, it is heterogeneous in magnitude and durability, wanes over time, and may be less robust against emerging variants, whereas updated vaccination standardizes and broadens immunity, which is why health authorities recommend annual vaccination for everyone eligible, including those previously infected, to sustain hybrid protection at the population level [^116QC2bf] [^114W6FtJ] [^115mjVep].

> Putting this together, my clinical recommendation is as follows: yes, you should continue getting COVID-19 vaccines after having COVID-19, because hybrid immunity from prior infection plus updated vaccination provides stronger and more durable protection than infection alone. Get one updated 2024–2025 dose now if you haven't already, wait about 2–3 months after a recent infection before vaccinating, and if you are 65 years or older or immunocompromised, plan for a second dose about 6 months later, with additional doses for immunocompromised patients based on shared clinical decision-making, aligning with ACIP/CDC and IDSA guidance and contemporary effectiveness evidence [^115mjVep] [^112K6TAU] [^113McKV2] [^1179ouX6].

Yes, you should continue getting COVID-19 vaccines after prior infection because **immunity from infection wanes** [^116QC2bf] and varies by illness severity and age [^117BiGvu], while **vaccination provides broader, more durable protection** against severe disease, hospitalization, and death, including against new variants [^1153DkhG] [^113ToSjt]. Current guidance is for all eligible individuals, including those previously infected, to stay up to date with updated vaccines, with additional doses for older adults and immunocompromised persons [^113e8sZ7] [^115mjVep] [^111FxmmS]. Vaccination after infection is safe and may reduce the risk of long COVID and reinfection [^111HJJ2s] [^115nVmiv] [^113y9pnk].

---

## Duration and durability of immunity after COVID-19 infection

- **Waning immunity**: Natural immunity from prior infection declines over time, with protection against reinfection decreasing significantly after 6–12 months [^notfound].

- **Severity-dependent protection**: The level and duration of immunity correlate with illness severity; mild or asymptomatic cases may have less robust and shorter-lived protection [^notfound].

- **Variant susceptibility**: Prior infection provides limited protection against new variants, especially those with significant antigenic drift, such as Omicron sublineages [^notfound].

---

## Effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in previously infected individuals

- **Enhanced protection**: Vaccination after infection (hybrid immunity) provides broader and more durable protection against reinfection, severe disease, and hospitalization than infection alone [^113McKV2] [^115ym9Qp].

- **Reduced reinfection**: Vaccination after infection reduces the risk of reinfection by approximately 50% compared to unvaccinated individuals with prior infection [^113y9pnk].

- **Long COVID**: Vaccination after infection may reduce the risk and severity of Long COVID symptoms, although evidence is still evolving [^111HJJ2s] [^115nVmiv].

---

## Current recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination in previously infected individuals

Current recommendations are that **all eligible individuals**, including those previously infected, should stay up to date with updated COVID-19 vaccines [^115mjVep]. For **additional doses**, adults aged ≥ 65 years and immunocompromised individuals should receive extra doses based on current guidelines and shared clinical decision-making [^115mjVep] [^115NyQde]. Vaccination should be delayed for **2–3 months after infection** to optimize immune response and minimize reactogenicity [^116CAy9n].

---

## Safety considerations for vaccinating previously infected individuals

- **Safety profile**: Vaccination after infection is safe, with no significant increase in adverse events compared to vaccinated individuals without prior infection [^notfound].

- **Reactogenicity**: Mild, transient side effects (e.g. fatigue, injection site pain) are common but typically resolve within a few days [^113AHLuR].

- **Rare adverse events**: Serious adverse events, such as myocarditis, are rare and occur at similar or lower rates than in the general population [^notfound].

---

## Impact of emerging variants on vaccine effectiveness

Variant adaptation means that vaccines are regularly updated to target circulating variants, maintaining effectiveness against **severe outcomes** [^114vvCap]. Continued vaccination provides protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death, even as **variant-specific neutralizing antibody levels wane** [^113ToSjt].

---

## Public health implications and individual benefits

- **Community protection**: Continued vaccination reduces transmission, community spread, and the emergence of new variants [^111FEeaL].

- **Individual benefit**: Vaccination after infection reduces the risk of reinfection, severe disease, and long COVID, providing individual and societal benefits [^113y9pnk] [^113McKV2] [^111HJJ2s].

## Summary of evidence

| **Aspect** | **Evidence summary** |
|-|-|
| Immunity after infection | - Wanes over 6–12 months <br/> - Varies by severity and age [^notfound] |
| Vaccine effectiveness after infection | - Enhanced **protection** <br/> - Reduced **reinfection** <br/> - Lower risk of **long COVID** [^113McKV2] [^113y9pnk] [^111HJJ2s] |
| Current recommendations | - Stay up to date with updated vaccines <br/> - Additional doses for high-risk groups [^115dVVFE] [^115mjVep] |
| Safety | Safe with mild, transient side effects [^113AHLuR] |
| Variant impact | Continued protection against severe outcomes [^112JqCZg] |

---

Individuals who have had COVID-19 should continue to receive updated COVID-19 vaccines because **immunity from infection wanes** and varies, while **vaccination provides broader, more durable protection** against severe disease, hospitalization, and death, including against new variants. Current guidance supports staying up to date with vaccination, with additional doses for older adults and immunocompromised individuals, and vaccination after infection is safe and may reduce the risk of long COVID and reinfection.

IDSA COVID-19 serologic testing — first 2 weeks after symptom onset: The IDSA panel recommends against using serologic testing to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first 2 weeks following symptom onset (strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence). Most studies included in this recommendation's literature review assessed unvaccinated individuals and so the panel's findings might not apply to individuals who have been vaccinated, especially with respect to specificity, rendering test accuracy worse than presented. Similarly, in today's population there is a higher likelihood of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection than assessed in the included studies, which could also negatively affect specificity, rendering test accuracy worse than presented. Analogous to other respiratory viruses where nonserologic tests are preferred for diagnosis of acute infection, serologic testing should not be performed routinely for diagnosis of acute COVID-19.

Recommendation for Use of an Additional Updated COVID-19 Vaccine Dose in Persons Aged ≥ 65 Years

On February 28, 2024, ACIP recommended that all persons aged ≥ 65 years receive 1 additional dose of any updated COVID-19 vaccine (i.e. Moderna, Novavax, or Pfizer-BioNTech). † This additional dose should be administered ≥ 4 months after the previous dose of updated COVID-19 vaccine. For initial vaccination with Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, the 2-dose series should be completed before administration of the additional dose. Because Novavax COVID-19 vaccine is currently authorized under Emergency Use Authorization, the recommendation for the updated Novavax COVID-19 vaccine is an interim recommendation.

Discussion

Despite the availability of COVID-19 vaccines in the United States, vaccination coverage has plateaued since May 2021, and uptake remains suboptimal. Although the exact proportion of the population that must be vaccinated to attain herd immunity is debated, the current full vaccination coverage estimates found in this study (69% and 82% among those who ever or never had COVID-19, lower in some subpopulations) is probably insufficient to prevent ongoing community transmission. We found that those who have had COVID-19 were less likely to have been vaccinated with > 1 dose or to be fully vaccinated and were more likely to be reluctant to get a future vaccination than were those who had not had the illness. This finding suggests a lack of understanding about the duration of immunity conferred by infection, as well as concerns about vaccine-associated side effects, general vaccine safety, and a lack of trust in the government. Addressing concerns about possible side effects as well as encouraging providers to have discussions about the safety and importance of vaccination may be critical for increasing coverage among this group. Regardless of sociodemographic characteristics, those who had a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 were also more likely to report uncertainty (probably/unsure) or reluctance (probably will not/definitely will not) toward vaccination. These results highlight the value of increasing vaccine uptake and confidence among those who have had the infection, particularly as new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge.

### After the pandemic: perspectives on the future trajectory of COVID-19 [^116QC2bf]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

There is a realistic expectation that the global effort in vaccination will bring the pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) under control. Nonetheless, uncertainties remain about the type of long-term association that the virus will establish with the human population and, in particular, whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) will become an endemic disease. Although the trajectory is difficult to predict, the conditions, concepts and variables that influence this transition can be anticipated. Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 as an endemic virus, perhaps with seasonal epidemic peaks, may be fuelled by pockets of susceptible individuals and waning immunity after infection or vaccination, changes in the virus through antigenic drift that diminish protection and re-entries from zoonotic reservoirs. Here we review relevant observations from previous epidemics and discuss the potential evolution of SARS-CoV-2 as it adapts during persistent transmission in the presence of a level of population immunity. Lack of effective surveillance or adequate response could enable the emergence of new epidemic or pandemic patterns from an endemic infection of SARS-CoV-2. There are key pieces of data that are urgently needed in order to make good decisions; we outline these and propose a way forward.

### Optimal annual COVID-19 vaccine boosting dates following previous booster vaccination or breakthrough infection [^11381bU1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Such an alternate approach has been enabled by recent research based on ample coronavirus incidence data that documented substantial spatiotemporal heterogeneity in peak incidence across the Northern Hemisphere. These results largely match typical respiratory virus incidence patterns, featuring peaks of "flu and cold season" with some specificity in each locality. However, in isolation, these results give no direct guidance regarding when to administer booster vaccinations. The optimal timing of booster vaccinations depends jointly on the risk of infection due to seasonality and on the long-term waning of protection subsequent to booster vaccination. Rigorous estimates of long-term protection subsequent to booster vaccination have been obtained by leveraging longitudinal antibody and reinfection data from the close evolutionary relatives of SARS-CoV-2 as well as infection and antibody data on SARS-CoV-2 to estimate the durability of immunity following natural infection, primary vaccination, and boosting. These analyses, subsequently validated by comparison to empirical data, indicate that statistical approaches derived from evolutionary medicine can illuminate reinfection risks with high accuracy and precision. Yet, the impact on yearly infection of administering yearly booster vaccinations at specific times in specific locations remains unknown — as does the impact of breakthrough infections at specific times of the year on the optimal timing of booster vaccination.

Here we integrated the waxing probabilities of infection subsequent to antigen exposure with projections of the expected seasonal variation in frequency of infection for endemic SARS-CoV-2 to perform a high-resolution investigation of prospective timings of booster vaccinations that maximally curtail infection. We evaluated the optimal boosting date over the year for individuals who have not been infected over the previous year. Then we analyzed similar optimal timings for individuals who have been infected during that year to determine any advantage to delaying the booster, depending on the date of infection. Such knowledge of optimal booster vaccination timing will be helpful for physician and individual decision-making in the context of ongoing endemic disease, and is crucial for effective vaccination policy that suppresses morbidity and mortality as a consequence of COVID-19.

### Estimated 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in adults [^112JqCZg]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Waning was apparent in this analysis, including some strata 179 to 299 days after vaccination in which point estimates were negative. VE can be measured in multiple ways but is essentially a comparison between rates or risk of disease in vaccinated vs unvaccinated (or less vaccinated) populations. Persons who did not receive 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccines were more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection soon after 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccine rollout, which corresponds to the earlier time since dose strata, compared with those who received a 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccine. Because prior SARS-CoV-2 infection provides some protection against future SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, higher infection rates in the comparator population (ie, those without 2023–2024 vaccines) early in the study period may have temporarily provided them with higher infection-induced protection and reduced the measured VE with greater time since dose, resulting in negative VE estimates further from vaccination. Results in this analysis, which did not control for prior infection, suggest that the risk of COVID-19 among people who are more than 6 months from their 2023 to 2024 vaccination appears to be higher than unvaccinated people who may have had more recent prior infection. However, controlling for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection generally increases measured VE, lending further evidence that the measured VE in this analysis is likely an underestimate of vaccination's true protection. Lower VE in younger age groups, including negative VE, may be indicative of differences in who gets vaccinated or patterns of prior infection. Notably, none of the VE estimates against critical illness were negative, highlighting that updated COVID-19 vaccines continued to provide protection against the most severe outcomes and supporting COVID-19 vaccine recommendations.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^113P67ix]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA serologic testing — new recommendations on prior infection evidence and routine testing after infection/vaccination: The current guideline includes 2 new recommendations, comprising a weak recommendation to use serology assays that target nucleocapsid protein rather than spike protein when evidence of prior COVID-19 is desired and a recommendation that suggests against routine serologic testing in patients with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. The rationale notes that most available vaccines result in formation of anti-spike antibodies, some inactivated whole virus vaccines can also result in anti-nucleocapsid antibodies, and a single protective titer was not identified despite associations of higher binding or neutralizing antibodies with protection.

### Myths&facts about COVID-19 vaccines… [^117BiGvu]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know Getting a COVID-19 vaccine is a safer and more dependable way to build immunity to COVID-19 than getting sick with COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccination causes a more predictable immune response than an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. FACT: COVID-19 vaccination causes a more predictable immune response than an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. COVID-19 can cause severe illness or death. You can also continue to have long-term health issues after COVID-19 infection. Getting sick with COVID-19 offers protection from future illness. This protection is sometimes called "natural immunity. " The level of protection people get from a COVID-19 infection may vary depending on how mild or severe their illness was, the time since their infection, and their age. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine can provide added protection for people who already had COVID-19. Learn about why you should get vaccinated even if you already had COVID-19.

The ingredients in COVID-19 vaccines are safe. FACTNearly all the ingredients in COVID-19 vaccines are also ingredients in many foods – fats, sugars, and salts. None of the COVID-19 vaccines contain ingredients like preservatives, tissues, antibiotics, food proteins, medicines, latex, or metals. Exact vaccine ingredients vary by manufacturer. Learn more about what ingredients are and are not in Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Novavax COVID-19 vaccines. COVID-19 vaccines do not cause new variants. FACTNew variants of the COVID-19 virus happen because the virus that causes COVID-19 constantly changes through a natural ongoing process of mutation. COVID-19 vaccines do not create or cause variants of the virus that causes COVID-19. As the COVID-19 virus spreads, it has more opportunities to change. Learn more about variants. COVID-19 vaccines do not contain microchips and they cannot make you magnetic.

FACTVaccines are developed to fight against disease. Vaccines work by stimulating your immune system to produce antibodies. After getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first. COVID-19 vaccines are not administered to track your movement. They are free from manufactured products such as microelectronics, electrodes, carbon nanotubes, and nanowire semiconductors. COVID-19 vaccines are free from metals such as iron, nickel, cobalt, lithium, and rare earth alloys. They do not contain ingredients that can produce an electromagnetic field at the site of your injection. Learn more about the ingredients in the COVID-19 vaccinations authorized for use in the United States. COVID-19 vaccines will not affect fertility. FACTCurrently no evidence shows that any vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, cause fertility problems in women or men.

COVID-19 vaccination is recommended if you are pregnant, trying to get pregnant now, or might become pregnant in the future, as well as their partners. Learn more about COVID-19 vaccines and people who would like to have a baby. COVID-19 vaccines do not alter DNA. FACTCOVID-19 vaccines do not change or interact with your DNA in any way. Both messenger RNA and protein subunit COVID-19 vaccines work by delivering instructions to your cells to start building protection against the virus that causes COVID-19. After the body produces an immune response, it gets rid of all the vaccine ingredients just as it would get rid of any information that cells no longer need. This process is a part of normal body functioning. The genetic material delivered by mRNA vaccines never enters the nucleus of your cells, which is where your DNA is kept, so the vaccine does not alter your DNA.

### The unnaturalistic fallacy: COVID-19 vaccine mandates should not discriminate against natural immunity [^114o2Cna]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

Natural immunity and vaccine-induced immunity: an overview of the evidence

The question of the relative effectiveness of vaccine and infection-induced immunity is, of course, an empirical question that is best answered by an appropriate empirical research study, in this case, a systematic review and meta-analysis. Once available, policy decisions should ultimately be guided by this sort of high-quality evidence. However, although one published systematic review of nine clinical studies suggests no statistical advantage to vaccine-induced immunity over natural immunity, large-scale reviews and analyses (particularly in relation to the most recent Omicron variant) are currently lacking. As such, we shall here provide only an overview of the currently available evidence.

As we detailed in the introduction, there are two benefits of vaccine-induced immunity that are invoked to justify general vaccine mandates: preventing healthcare systems from becoming overwhelmed (in large part by reducing severe outcomes from COVID-19) and the reduction of viral transmission. With respect to the former, large, randomised placebo-controlled studies have clearly demonstrated that widely used vaccines have a high degree of efficacy in preventing serious morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. As time passes, we will continue to learn more about the duration of vaccine-induced immunity, but data suggest that vaccine efficacy declines over time. For this reason, many countries have implemented booster programmes. Notably though, in many countries, individuals are considered to be fully vaccinated for the purposes of vaccine requirements and passport schemes as long as they have received two doses; for instance, a booster does was not necessary for receiving a NHS COVID-19 pass in England while the domestic vaccine passport scheme was in place. However, some countries have imposed expiry dates on the validity of proof of vaccination; for instance, Croatia, Austria and Switzerland consider travellers 'fully vaccinated' for only 1 year after their second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.

### COVID-19-associated hospitalizations among vaccinated and unvaccinated adults 18 years or older in 13 US States, January 2021 to April 2022 [^111a2GtD]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cross-sectional study of US adults hospitalized with COVID-19 during the first year of vaccine availability in the US, COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates in unvaccinated adults were more than 10 times higher than in vaccinated persons, a salient finding when many eligible Americans remained unvaccinated. COVID-19 vaccines, including booster doses, are strongly associated with prevention of COVID-19–associated hospitalizations, and vaccination is effective in averting serious clinical consequences. To reduce COVID-19–associated morbidity and mortality, clinicians and public health practitioners should continue to promote COVID-19 vaccinations with all recommended doses for all eligible persons.

### A call to action: current challenges and considerations for COVID-19 vaccination in immunocompromised populations [^114wufqV]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The heightened risk of infection and complexities of preventing disease in immunocompromised individuals are at the forefront of public health strategies. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the increased vulnerability and susceptibility to serious outcomes in this population. COVID-19 prevention efforts led to the development of vaccines, including mRNA-based options, which were initially recommended as a 2-dose primary schedule for both immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals. However, post-rollout assessments led to updated recommendations specific to immunocompromised populations. As COVID-19 potentially transitions to become endemic disease, immunocompromised individuals will remain at high risk of severe disease; thus, the evaluation of current vaccination challenges remains crucial for guiding effective public health efforts. This article summarizes key findings from the previous articles of this supplement, highlighting current vaccination challenges for at-risk immunocompromised groups and exploring solutions to ensure protection against COVID-19 for these vulnerable populations.

COVID-19 convalescent plasma — hospitalized patients: The guideline panel suggests against COVID-19 convalescent plasma for persons hospitalized with COVID-19. The text notes that, based on limited studies and mechanistic reasoning, COVID-19 convalescent plasma may be more effective if given at high titers early in the course of hospitalization, in patients with undetectable or low levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, or in those with a humoral immune deficiency, but current randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have not reported outcomes in such pre-specified subpopulations. It further indicates that additional clinical trials may be needed to determine whether there is a benefit and at what dose, and that future studies in hospitalized patients should focus on humoral immunodeficiencies early in the course of COVID-19 and should also consider screening for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies at RCT entry with outcomes assessed by antibody levels.

### COVID-19-associated hospitalizations among U.S. adults aged ≥ 18 years-COVID-NET, 12 States, October 2023-April 2024 [^114UvTyL]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

Among adults, COVID-19 hospitalization rates increase with age. Data from the COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network were analyzed to estimate population-based COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates during October 2023-April 2024 and identify demographic and clinical characteristics of adults aged ≥ 18 years hospitalized with COVID-19. Adults aged ≥ 65 years accounted for 70% of all adult COVID-19-associated hospitalizations, and their COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates were higher than those among younger adult age groups. Cumulative rates of COVID-19-associated hospitalization during October 2023-April 2024 were the lowest for all adult age groups during an October-April surveillance period since 2020–2021. However, hospitalization rates among all adults aged ≥ 75 years approached one COVID-19-associated hospitalization for every 100 persons. Among adults hospitalized with COVID-19, 88.1% had not received the 2023–2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine before hospitalization, 80.0% had multiple underlying medical conditions, and 16.6% were residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Guidance for adults at high risk for severe COVID-19 illness, including adults aged ≥ 65 years and residents of LTCFs, should continue to focus on adopting measures to reduce risk for contracting COVID-19, advocating for receipt of recommended COVID-19 vaccinations, and seeking prompt outpatient antiviral treatment after receipt of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result.

### Impact of COVID-19 vaccination on the risk of developing long-COVID and on existing long-COVID symptoms: a systematic review [^112eV8Ko]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The second topic is to know if COVID-19 vaccines represent a risk for those individuals with ongoing long-COVID symptomatology. We identified eleven level III studies of moderate to high methodological quality investigating the impact of vaccine on individuals who had previously suffered from COVID-19 and developed long-COVID (infection-long COVID-vaccine design). The results here were less consistent, since 63% of the studies (n = 7/11) found that vaccination improved ongoing symptoms of long-COVID, whereas 36% (n = 4/11) reported small changes or even worsening in some patients. Again, the definition of long-COVID among the studies was inconsistent. This heterogeneity in the response against vaccines of individuals with long-COVID could be related to the complexity of this condition. For instance, Tsuchida et al.identified that people experiencing a worsening of long-COVID symptoms after vaccination are those also showing excessive immune response to vaccination, with higher increased rate of antibody titers. On the contrary, Peghin et al.observed that COVID-19 vaccines did not produce an altered humoral response in individuals with current long-COVID. Discrepancies between these studies could be related to the fact that numerous autoantibodies may be produced after SARS-CoV-2 infectionand, accordingly, COVID-19 vaccines effects could be dependent on the host immune response. Further, since long-COVID includes a myriad of > 100 different multiorgan symptoms, it is possible that vaccines influence could be related to some specific long-COVID symptoms. Accordingly, COVID-19 vaccination may help to reduce long-COVID by eradicating the viral reservoir or by resetting a deregulated immune response to primary acute infection, and this effect could be host-dependent. Overall, although current evidence is inconclusive, available data suggest that COVID-19 vaccines are important factors for further immunological protection against potential reinfections.

Vaccinated: persons with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test collected 14 days or more after vaccination with a primary series, defined as either the second dose of a 2-dose vaccine series or after 1 dose of a single-dose vaccine. When not otherwise specified, vaccinated persons include those who may have received additional or booster doses. Vaccinated without a booster dose: persons who have received a primary series and who have not received an additional or booster dose. This includes those eligible and not yet eligible for an additional or booster dose. Vaccinated with a booster dose: persons vaccinated with a primary series and an additional or booster dose on or after August 13, 2021, with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test collected 14 days or more after receipt of an additional or booster dose. Because the immune status of all cases is not known, an additional dose (recommended for persons with a weakened immune system) cannot be distinguished from a booster dose.

### Rates of COVID-19 among unvaccinated adults with prior COVID-19 [^113R3kFm]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Among 121 615 patients with more than 10 million days of follow-up, unvaccinated individuals with prior symptomatic COVID-19 had 85% lower risk of acquiring COVID-19 than unvaccinated individuals without prior COVID-19. Prior studies investigating protection against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection found similar results, with protection associated with natural immunity ranging from 80.5% to 100%. This level of protection is similar to that reported for mRNA vaccines. The findings that patients with prior COVID-19 had 88% protection against hospitalization for COVID-19 and 83% protection against COVID-19 not requiring hospitalization suggest that natural immunity was associated with similar protection against mild and severe disease. mRNA vaccines are associated with similar prolonged protection from severe COVID-19 as found in our study, although vaccine-associated protection from mild COVID-19 has been shown to wane at 6 months.

Limitations include possible COVID-19 testing or vaccination at outside health care facilities, but undetected infection should have been balanced between cases and controls. Patients who have recovered from COVID-19 may behave differently from those without immunity, potentially confounding results. Strengths include large sample size, long duration of follow-up, and inclusion of only unvaccinated individuals with symptomatic COVID-19. The findings of this study may have important implications for vaccine policy and public health.

Remarks specify that the panel considered symptomatic patients to have at least one of the most common symptoms compatible with COVID-19, that testing is indicated since clinical assessment alone is not accurate in predicting a COVID-19 diagnosis and a positive test result may inform decisions about therapy, isolation, and potentially contact tracing, and that there were limited data available regarding the analytical performance of SARS-CoV-2 NAATs in immunocompromised or vaccinated individuals, in those who have had prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, in children, or in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants (e.g. Omicron).

### Annual variant-targeted vaccination to prevent severe COVID-19 in cohorts with vaccine-derived and hybrid immunity [^114W6FtJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Following the roll-out of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines in 2021 and repeated Omicron waves in 2022, a large proportion of the world became vaccinated and infected, thus developing hybrid immunity. Although population-level immunity increased, COVID-19 caused more severe illness in the fall/winter of 2023–2024 than influenza. As of 2024, national vaccination programs in the United States (US) put forth recommendations for the general adult population to receive annual variant-targeted COVID-19 and influenza vaccine doses in the fall; for older adults, a second COVID-19 vaccine dose is recommended approximately 6 months later. In the summer of 2024, however, there was a large Omicron JN.1 wave, infecting many individuals who had received their variant-targeted XBB booster dose in the prior fall. These events prompted questions to determine how long variant-targeted booster-induced immunity protects against severe illness and if booster-vaccinated individuals with a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron infection require their annual booster dose in the context of vaccine-derived and hybrid immunity.

Persons Aged ≥ 65 Years with Moderate or Severe Immunocompromise

Persons aged ≥ 65 years who are moderately or severely immunocompromised, have completed an initial series, and have received ≥ 1 updated COVID-19 vaccine dose should receive 1 additional updated COVID-19 vaccine dose ≥ 2 months after the last dose of updated vaccine. Further additional doses may be administered, guided by the clinical judgment of a health care provider and personal preference and circumstances. Any further additional doses should be administered ≥ 2 months after the last COVID-19 vaccine dose. Additional clinical considerations, including detailed schedules and tables by age for all age groups and vaccination history for those who are or are not moderately or severely immunocompromised, are available at.

Pemivibart — benefit, risk, dosing, and timing per FDA EUA are described as follows: The anticipated benefit is likely greatest in people who are the most immunocompromised, and the anticipated benefit may be lower in patients aged 12 to 17 years. Patients who place a higher value on potential harms, specifically, the observed 0.6% risk of anaphylaxis, and a lower value on the uncertain benefits of prevention of severe COVID-19 would reasonably decline pemivibart. Per the FDA EUA, pemivibart is authorized to be given at 4,500 mg IV every 3 months, and in individuals who have recently received a COVID-19 vaccine, pemivibart should be administered at least 2 weeks after vaccination. As the evidence is based on immunobridging and circulating variant susceptibility is evolving, additional clinical and laboratory data may impact this recommendation.

### Use of additional doses of 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine… [^115mjVep]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

In October 2024, ACIP recommended that all persons aged ≥ 65 years and persons aged 6 months–64 years with moderate or severe immunocompromise receive a second 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose 6 months after their last dose. Further, ACIP recommended that persons aged ≥ 6 months with moderate or severe immunocompromise may receive additional doses based on shared clinical decision-making. Abstract COVID-19 remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality, especially among adults aged ≥ 65 years and persons with moderate or severe immunocompromise; these persons are among those at highest risk for severe disease from COVID-19. On June 27, 2024, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccination for all persons aged ≥ 6 months to target currently circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2 and provide additional protection against severe COVID-19.

Because SARS-CoV-2 circulates year-round and immunity from vaccination wanes, on October 23, 2024, ACIP recommended a second 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose for all adults aged ≥ 65 years and for persons aged 6 months–64 years with moderate or severe immunocompromise, 6 months after their last dose of 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine. Further, ACIP recommended that persons aged ≥ 6 months who are moderately or severely immunocompromised may receive additional doses of 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine based on shared clinical decision-making. Staying up to date with COVID-19 vaccination is recommended to decrease the risk for severe COVID-19, especially among adults aged ≥ 65 years and persons with moderate or severe immunocompromise. Further, ACIP voted to recommend that persons aged ≥ 6 months who are moderately or severely immunocompromised may receive additional doses of 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine based on shared clinical decision-making. This report summarizes these ACIP recommendations and the rationale, including evidence reviewed by the ACIP COVID-19 Vaccines Work Group and presented to ACIP. Rationale and Evidence Vaccine Effectiveness ACIP reviewed CDC data on COVID-19 VE, including data on VE of the original monovalent, bivalent, and 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccines in the populations of interest. COVID-19 vaccines have provided substantial protection for persons with and without immunocompromise, with generally lower VE in persons with immunocompromise than in those without. During the 2023–24 respiratory virus season, the 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccines provided added benefit in a population with a high prevalence of immunity from previous immunization and infection.

The 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccines provided approximately 50% additional protection against hospitalization initially and then waned to negligible additional protection by approximately 4–6 months after receipt of a 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccine dose. Protection lasted longer against critical illness. VE against critical illness started at 67% and decreased to 40% 4–6 months after the dose, with point estimates indicating additional waning of VE by 6–10 months after the dose. Although waning patterns have varied season to season among persons with immunocompromise, an additional COVID-19 vaccine dose has consistently restored protection that has waned after previous doses in persons with and without immunocompromise.

Methods

Since June 2020, ACIP has convened 40 public meetings to review data and consider recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines. During March–June 2024, the ACIP COVID-19 Vaccines Work Group (Work Group) met nine times to discuss the current policy question (i.e. whether 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccination should be recommended for all persons aged ≥ 6 months). The Work Group used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty of the evidence regarding benefits and harms associated with an updated (bivalent or 2023–2024) COVID-19 vaccine administered in the United States during September 2022–May 2024. The Work Group selected this population, intervention, and period to identify evidence most applicable to what can be anticipated from the 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine in the United States. The Work Group used the Evidence to Recommendations framework †† to guide their considerations and reviewed data on the importance of COVID-19 as a public health problem and issues of resource use, benefits and harms, patients' values, acceptability, feasibility, and equity related to COVID-19 vaccines.

### Trajectory of long COVID symptoms after COVID-19 vaccination: community based cohort study [^114JiDaA]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

By the end of 2021 in the UK, when 90% of the population had received at least one dose of a covid-19 vaccine, nearly 14 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 had been confirmed, 640 000 patients had been admitted to hospital, and 158 000 had died with covid-19. Symptoms of infection may persist for months, defined in UK clinical guidelines as ongoing symptomatic covid-19 (signs and symptoms 4–12 weeks after onset) or post-covid-19 syndrome (> 12 weeks after onset). These symptoms are collectively and commonly referred to as long covid. Long covid is characterised by a range of manifestations across organ systems, including fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive impairment, often with fluctuating periods of wellness followed by relapse. By 8 February 2021, nearly 6% of adults in England might have experienced prolonged symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection since the pandemic began, and in October 2021 an estimated 1.2 million people in private households in the UK (1.9%) had reported experiencing long covid, with symptoms in two thirds of these individuals having a detrimental impact on day-to-day activities.

### Effectiveness of a single COVID-19 mRNA vaccine dose in individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection: a systematic review [^113McKV2]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Considering these updated COVID-19 vaccination guidelines, it is necessary to better understand the level of protection provided by a single mRNA vaccine dose in the current immunological context of high population-level immunity. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the peer-reviewed literature on vaccine effectiveness (VE) of a single COVID-19 mRNA dose among individuals with a history of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to those with differing prior infection and vaccination history, including individuals who were (i) SARS-CoV-2 naïve (i.e. unvaccinated and no history of prior infection), (ii) unvaccinated with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, and (iii) previously vaccinated with > 1 COVID-19 dose with or without prior infection.

This systematic review identifies 18 studies and finds that among those with prior infection, a single mRNA dose increases protection by 8–71% against infection (during Omicron BA.1, BA.4/5, or XBB predominance), 39–67% against symptomatic infection (BA.1, BA.2, or BA.4/5), and 25–60% against hospitalization or hospitalization or death (BA.1). VE of one dose is comparable to two doses among those with prior infection, and higher than following two doses without prior infection. This supports current recommendations for one COVID-19 mRNA vaccine dose to be given in advance of the respiratory season, regardless of history of infection or vaccination, with considerations for additional doses for certain populations including young children, older adults, and the immunocompromised.

COVID-19 remains an important public health threat, despite overall decreases in COVID-19-related severe disease since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates remain higher among adults aged ≥ 65 years relative to rates in younger adults, adolescents, and children; during October 2023-January 2024, 67% of all COVID-19-associated hospitalizations were among persons aged ≥ 65 years. On September 12, 2023, CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended updated (2023–2024 Formula) COVID-19 vaccination with a monovalent XBB.1.5-derived vaccine for all persons aged ≥ 6 months to protect against severe COVID-19-associated illness and death. Because SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate throughout the year, and because of the increased risk for COVID-19-related severe illness in persons aged ≥ 65 years, the protection afforded by updated vaccines against JN.1 and other currently circulating variants, and the expected waning of vaccine-conferred protection against disease, on February 28, 2024, ACIP recommended all persons aged ≥ 65 years receive 1 additional dose of the updated (2023–2024 Formula) COVID-19 vaccine. Implementation of these recommendations is expected to enhance immunity that might have waned and decrease the risk for severe COVID-19-associated outcomes, including death, among persons aged ≥ 65 years.

### Immunological considerations for COVID-19 vaccine strategies [^116F7nMJ]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2020). High credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the most formidable challenge to humanity in a century. It is widely believed that prepandemic normalcy will never return until a safe and effective vaccine strategy becomes available and a global vaccination programme is implemented successfully. Here, we discuss the immunological principles that need to be taken into consideration in the development of COVID-19 vaccine strategies. On the basis of these principles, we examine the current COVID-19 vaccine candidates, their strengths and potential shortfalls, and make inferences about their chances of success. Finally, we discuss the scientific and practical challenges that will be faced in the process of developing a successful vaccine and the ways in which COVID-19 vaccine strategies may evolve over the next few years.

Methods

In 2018, ACIP adopted the Evidence to Recommendations framework to guide the development of vaccine recommendations. Since November 2023, the ACIP COVID-19 work group met seven times to discuss the current policy question, i.e. whether adults aged ≥ 65 years should receive an additional dose of updated COVID-19 vaccine. Work group membership included ACIP voting members, representatives of ACIP ex officio and liaison organizations, and scientific consultants with expertise in public health, immunology, medical specialties, and immunization safety and effectiveness. Work group discussion topics included COVID-19 disease surveillance and epidemiology; COVID-19 vaccination coverage; and the safety, effectiveness, feasibility of implementation, and cost effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. This report summarizes the ACIP recommendation for an additional dose of the updated COVID-19 vaccine for persons aged ≥ 65 years and the rationale, including evidence reviewed by the work group and presented to ACIP.

### Efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines [^1153DkhG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Different forms of vaccines have been developed to prevent the SARS-CoV-2 virus and subsequent COVID-19 disease. Several are in widespread use globally. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines (as a full primary vaccination series or a booster dose) against SARS-CoV-2.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the COVID-19 L·OVE platform (last search date 5 November 2021). We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, regulatory agency websites, and Retraction Watch.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing COVID-19 vaccines to placebo, no vaccine, other active vaccines, or other vaccine schedules.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for all except immunogenicity outcomes. We synthesized data for each vaccine separately and presented summary effect estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). MAIN RESULTS: We included and analyzed 41 RCTs assessing 12 different vaccines, including homologous and heterologous vaccine schedules and the effect of booster doses. Thirty-two RCTs were multicentre and five were multinational. The sample sizes of RCTs were 60 to 44,325 participants. Participants were aged: 18 years or older in 36 RCTs; 12 years or older in one RCT; 12 to 17 years in two RCTs; and three to 17 years in two RCTs. Twenty-nine RCTs provided results for individuals aged over 60 years, and three RCTs included immunocompromized patients. No trials included pregnant women. Sixteen RCTs had two-month follow-up or less, 20 RCTs had two to six months, and five RCTs had greater than six to 12 months or less. Eighteen reports were based on preplanned interim analyses. Overall risk of bias was low for all outcomes in eight RCTs, while 33 had concerns for at least one outcome. We identified 343 registered RCTs with results not yet available. This abstract reports results for the critical outcomes of confirmed symptomatic COVID-19, severe and critical COVID-19, and serious adverse events only for the 10 WHO-approved vaccines. For remaining outcomes and vaccines, see main text. The evidence for mortality was generally sparse and of low or very low certainty for all WHO-approved vaccines, except AD26.COV2.S (Janssen), which probably reduces the risk of all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.25, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.67; 1 RCT, 43,783 participants; high-certainty evidence). Confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 High-certainty evidence found that BNT162b2 (BioNtech/Fosun Pharma/Pfizer), mRNA-1273 (ModernaTx), ChAdOx1 (Oxford/AstraZeneca), Ad26.COV2.S, BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm-Beijing), and BBV152 (Bharat Biotect) reduce the incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 compared to placebo (vaccine efficacy (VE): BNT162b2: 97.84%, 95% CI 44.25% to 99.92%; 2 RCTs, 44,077 participants; mRNA-1273: 93.20%, 95% CI 91.06% to 94.83%; 2 RCTs, 31,632 participants; ChAdOx1: 70.23%, 95% CI 62.10% to 76.62%; 2 RCTs, 43,390 participants; Ad26.COV2.S: 66.90%, 95% CI 59.10% to 73.40%; 1 RCT, 39,058 participants; BBIBP-CorV: 78.10%, 95% CI 64.80% to 86.30%; 1 RCT, 25,463 participants; BBV152: 77.80%, 95% CI 65.20% to 86.40%; 1 RCT, 16,973 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence found that NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax) probably reduces the incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 compared to placebo (VE 82.91%, 95% CI 50.49% to 94.10%; 3 RCTs, 42,175 participants). There is low-certainty evidence for CoronaVac (Sinovac) for this outcome (VE 69.81%, 95% CI 12.27% to 89.61%; 2 RCTs, 19,852 participants). Severe or critical COVID-19 High-certainty evidence found that BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, Ad26.COV2.S, and BBV152 result in a large reduction in incidence of severe or critical disease due to COVID-19 compared to placebo (VE: BNT162b2: 95.70%, 95% CI 73.90% to 99.90%; 1 RCT, 46,077 participants; mRNA-1273: 98.20%, 95% CI 92.80% to 99.60%; 1 RCT, 28,451 participants; AD26.COV2.S: 76.30%, 95% CI 57.90% to 87.50%; 1 RCT, 39,058 participants; BBV152: 93.40%, 95% CI 57.10% to 99.80%; 1 RCT, 16,976 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence found that NVX-CoV2373 probably reduces the incidence of severe or critical COVID-19 (VE 100.00%, 95% CI 86.99% to 100.00%; 1 RCT, 25,452 participants). Two trials reported high efficacy of CoronaVac for severe or critical disease with wide CIs, but these results could not be pooled. Serious adverse events (SAEs) mRNA-1273, ChAdOx1 (Oxford-AstraZeneca)/SII-ChAdOx1 (Serum Institute of India), Ad26.COV2.S, and BBV152 probably result in little or no difference in SAEs compared to placebo (RR: mRNA-1273: 0.92, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.08; 2 RCTs, 34,072 participants; ChAdOx1/SII-ChAdOx1: 0.88, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.07; 7 RCTs, 58,182 participants; Ad26.COV2.S: 0.92, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.22; 1 RCT, 43,783 participants); BBV152: 0.65, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.97; 1 RCT, 25,928 participants). In each of these, the likely absolute difference in effects was fewer than 5/1000 participants. Evidence for SAEs is uncertain for BNT162b2, CoronaVac, BBIBP-CorV, and NVX-CoV2373 compared to placebo (RR: BNT162b2: 1.30, 95% CI 0.55 to 3.07; 2 RCTs, 46,107 participants; CoronaVac: 0.97, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.51; 4 RCTs, 23,139 participants; BBIBP-CorV: 0.76, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.06; 1 RCT, 26,924 participants; NVX-CoV2373: 0.92, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.14; 4 RCTs, 38,802 participants). For the evaluation of heterologous schedules, booster doses, and efficacy against variants of concern, see main text of review.

Compared to placebo, most vaccines reduce, or likely reduce, the proportion of participants with confirmed symptomatic COVID-19, and for some, there is high-certainty evidence that they reduce severe or critical disease. There is probably little or no difference between most vaccines and placebo for serious adverse events. Over 300 registered RCTs are evaluating the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, and this review is updated regularly on the COVID-NMA platform (covid-nma.com). Implications for practice Due to the trial exclusions, these results cannot be generalized to pregnant women, individuals with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, or immunocompromized people. Most trials had a short follow-up and were conducted before the emergence of variants of concern. Implications for research Future research should evaluate the long-term effect of vaccines, compare different vaccines and vaccine schedules, assess vaccine efficacy and safety in specific populations, and include outcomes such as preventing long COVID-19. Ongoing evaluation of vaccine efficacy and effectiveness against emerging variants of concern is also vital.

### Disentangling post-vaccination symptoms from early COVID-19 [^114LqGuJ]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 dissemination requires rapid recognition followed by quarantining of infected individuals (along with appropriate health care). However, there is overlap between symptoms from COVID-19, and early post-vaccination systemic symptoms. Moreover, immunity to SARS-CoV-2 does not occur immediately post-vaccination, with functional protection from approximately day 12. Quarantining and testing every individual with systemic symptoms early post-vaccination would be onerous, expensive, and labour-intensive – but given the impact of viral outbreaks might be unavoidable if SARS-CoV-2 infection cannot be excluded robustly.

Here we aim to determine whether symptom profiles can be used to differentiate individuals with systemic side-effects of vaccination alone from individuals with superimposed SARS-COV-2 infection.

### Effectiveness associated with vaccination after COVID-19 recovery in preventing reinfection [^113y9pnk]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

The benefit of vaccination for preventing reinfection among individuals who have been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 is largely unknown.

Objective

To obtain population-based estimates of the probability of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection and the effectiveness associated with vaccination after recovery from COVID-19.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study used Rhode Island statewide surveillance data from March 1, 2020, to December 9, 2021, on COVID-19 vaccinations, laboratory-confirmed cases, hospitalizations, and fatalities to conduct a population-based, retrospective study during periods when wild type, Alpha, and Delta strains of SARS-CoV-2 were predominant. Participants included Rhode Island residents aged 12 years and older who were previously diagnosed with COVID-19 and unvaccinated at the time of first infection, stratified into 3 subpopulations: long-term congregate care (LTCC) residents, LTCC employees, and the general population (ie, individuals not associated with congregate settings). Data were analyzed from October 2021 to January 2022.

Exposures

Completion of the primary vaccination series, defined as 14 days after the second dose of an mRNA vaccine or 1 dose of vector virus vaccine.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, defined as a laboratory-confirmed positive result on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antigen test at least 90 days after the first laboratory-confirmed positive result on a PCR or antigen test.

Results

Overall, 3124 LTCC residents (median [IQR] age, 81 [71–89]; 1675 [53.6%] females), 2877 LTCC employees (median [IQR] age, 41 [30–53]; 2186 [76.0%] females), and 94 516 members of the general population (median [IQR] age, 35 [24–52] years; 45 030 [47.6%] females) met eligibility criteria. Probability of reinfection at 9 months for those who remained unvaccinated after recovery from prior COVID-19 was 13.0% (95% CI, 12.0%-14.0%) among LTCC residents, 10.0% (95% CI, 8.8%-11.5%) among LTCC employees, and 1.9% (95% CI, 1.8%-2.0%) among the general population. Completion of the primary vaccination series after infection was associated with 49% (95% CI, 27%-65%) protection among LTCC residents, 47% (95% CI, 19%-65%) protection among LTCC employees, and 62% (95% CI, 56%-68%) protection in the general population against reinfection, adjusting for potential sociodemographic and clinical confounders and temporal variation in infection rates.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection after recovery from COVID-19 was relatively high among individuals who remained unvaccinated. Vaccination after recovery from COVID-19 was associated with reducing risk of reinfection by approximately half.

### Effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and hybrid immunity in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptomatic COVID-19 among adults in the United States [^1179ouX6]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to reduce the risk of severe illness and health care utilization following SARS-CoV-2 infection, but there are fewer data available on the impact of vaccination on the overall risk of infection. In this multistate prospective community cohort study, adults who were vaccinated with a bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine within the past 59 days were less likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 than those who were unvaccinated or had received a monovalent vaccine dose ≥ 180 days prior regardless of infection history; the overall adjusted VE of a bivalent dose was 37% within 7 to 59 days of receipt. Beyond 60 days, protection against infection was lower, regardless of variant period. When hybrid immunity was evaluated, we found that adults with evidence of a prior infection and receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine within 7 to 179 days, regardless of valency, were less likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and less likely experience symptomatic COVID-19 illness than naive individuals who were unvaccinated or had received a monovalent vaccine ≥ 180 days prior; overall protection was estimated to be 60% to 62% against infection and 73% to 81% against symptomatic illness. In contrast, among adults with no evidence of prior infection, VE was lower (27% against infection when vaccination was received within 7–179 days), although this estimate was less precise due to limited sample size. Also in contrast, among those with evidence of prior infection and receipt of a monovalent vaccine ≥ 180 days prior, VE was similarly lower at 29% against infection.

Pemivibart — dosing, timing after vaccination, and harm–benefit considerations are specified as follows: Per the FDA EUA, pemivibart is authorized to be given at 4,500 mg IV every 3 months, and per the FDA EUA, in individuals who have recently received a COVID-19 vaccine, pemivibart should be administered at least 2 weeks after vaccination. Patients who place a higher value on potential harms, specifically, the observed 0.6% risk of anaphylaxis, and a lower value on the uncertain benefits of prevention of severe COVID-19 would reasonably decline pemivibart. Because susceptibility is evolving, additional clinical and laboratory data may impact this recommendation. Conditional recommendations are made when the suggested course of action would apply to the majority of people with many exceptions, and shared decision-making is important.

### Effectiveness of a booster dose of aerosolized or intramuscular adenovirus type 5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine in adults: a multicenter, partially randomized, platform trial in China [^115zL95V]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The current global population exhibits a multifaceted immunological landscape regarding COVID-19, encompassing individuals who have received COVID-19 vaccinations, those who have been previously infected and recovered from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and potentially those possessing hybrid immunity. This intricate hybrid immune status arises from variations in vaccine types administered, dosing regimens, exposure to diverse viral variants, and the timing of these events. Despite the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation to utilize a monovalent XBB.1 descendent lineage as the vaccine antigen in May 2023, they concurrently advised against delaying vaccination programs that include WHO emergency-use listed or prequalified COVID-19 vaccines in anticipation of accessing vaccines with updated compositions. Furthermore, the vast scope of global vaccine inequity will continue to have profound repercussions worldwide, particularly among the most vulnerable populations. Consequently, the inquiry into whether booster doses of COVID-19 vaccines containing the ancestral strain can still afford protection to populations with hybrid immunity during the period of omicron variant dominance remains a crucial area meriting further investigation.

In China, an impressive over 90% of the population has achieved primary immunization against COVID-19, primarily through the administration of inactivated vaccines. The first national-scale outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 omicron predominance occurred at the end of the year 2022 in China, shortly after the dismantling of the "dynamic zero-case policy". A survey conducted across 31 provinces in China reported that 82.4% of individuals were infected with SARS-CoV-2 between December 2022 and February 2023. Consequently, a vast majority of the Chinese population now boasts hybrid immunity to COVID-19, derived from both COVID-19 vaccination and breakthrough infections caused by the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variants. Nonetheless, despite a considerable segment of the population acquiring a certain degree of immunity towards COVID-19 via vaccination, prior infection, or a blend of both, the mutation and widespread dissemination of the SARS-CoV-2 virus persist worldwide, giving rise to the advent of novel variants.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline — research needs — notes that more data on the efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis, specifically in vaccinated or previously infected immunocompromised individuals who have received COVID-19 vaccines, are needed, and that head-to-head comparisons of baricitinib, tocilizumab, abatacept, and infliximab in patients with severe, rapidly progressing COVID-19 and critical COVID-19 would be informative.

### Canada needs a national COVID-19 inquiry now [^1148NbnX]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Finally, an inquiry could address the decline in vaccine uptake. COVID-19 vaccination rates have dropped sharply since the 2021 COVID-19 vaccination campaign. While over 83% of Canadians have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, uptake of updated COVID-19 vaccines in autumn 2023 was approximately 15%. Well-funded, well-organized vaccine misinformation and disinformation campaigns are part of the problem, but better, regularly updated information could also have been distributed by Canadian public health institutions. Canada needs a national strategy to support existing vaccination programs and the infrastructure to scale up if vaccines with more durable immune protection become available. Recently published data demonstrate that updated vaccines continue to prevent severe infection; mitigate post-COVID increases in risk of events such as heart attacks, strokes, and venous thromboembolism; and reduce forward transmission to other individuals. Lukewarm efforts to support ongoing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination programs and inform the public of the benefits of high levels of vaccination represent a missed opportunity and warrant investigation.

Our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve and academic debates will continue as well. An inquiry may add other items to this list, or change our perspective on some of the fundamental issues. But Canada cannot wait for perfect clarity with so many becoming sick — the precautionary principle means that "action to reduce risk should not await scientific certainty". Canada needs a frank, open, and public discussion of the evidence and its limitations, across disciplines and perspectives. Part of the contribution of an inquiry to healing rifts and restoring trust will be documenting and transparently addressing the concerns of all Canadians.

COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage

Monitoring vaccination coverage in communities and organizations is recommended by CDC to gauge progress, focus vaccination efforts on populations whose coverage is low, and inform the need for additional prevention strategies. As of July 23, 2021, the proportion of the total U.S. population who is fully vaccinated is 48.9%. †† Of the 2,945 (91.4%) U.S. counties reporting, vaccination coverage is < 40% in 1,856 (63.0%) and 40%–49.9% in 672 (22.8%); only 417 (14.2%) of counties reported ≥ 50% COVID-19 vaccination coverage. Primary vaccination efforts should be accelerated in counties with low vaccination coverage. Public health practitioners should work with clinicians and community partners to build confidence in the vaccine and ensure equitable access. §§ Organizations should establish supportive policies, such as allowing workers to receive vaccines during work hours or to take paid leave to get vaccinated at a community site, as well as offering flexible, nonpunitive sick leave options for employees.

Before vaccination, the EUA Fact Sheet should be provided to recipients and caregivers. Providers should counsel Moderna COVID-19 vaccine recipients about expected local and systemic reactogenicity. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is not interchangeable with other COVID-19 vaccine products; the safety and efficacy of a mixed-product series have not been evaluated. ACIP does not state a product preference; a person may receive any recommended COVID-19 vaccine series. However, persons should complete the series with the same COVID-19 product they received for the first dose. Additional clinical considerations, including details of administration and use in special populations (e.g. persons who are pregnant, immunocompromised or who have a history of severe allergic reactions) are available at. The interim recommendation and clinical considerations are based on use of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine under an EUA and might change as more evidence becomes available. ACIP will continue to review additional data as they become available; updates to recommendations or clinical considerations will be posted on the ACIP website.

Approximately 70% of eligible adults in the United States have completed a primary COVID-19 vaccination series. §§§§ With the emergence of novel variants of concern and development of additional therapeutic strategies, studies in vaccinated populations are vital to guide targeted guidelines and interventions for persons at risk for severe outcomes. COVID-19–associated outcomes occurred in a small proportion of persons (0.015%) who had completed primary vaccination, all of whom were aged ≥ 65 years, immunosuppressed, or had other underlying conditions. Even when vaccinated, persons with identifiable risk factors should receive interventions including chronic disease management, precautions to reduce exposure, additional primary and booster vaccine doses, and effective pharmaceutical therapy as indicated to reduce risk for severe COVID-19–associated outcomes. Increasing COVID-19 vaccination coverage is a public health priority.

IDSA COVID-19 serologic testing — regulatory and assay limitations note that although current EUA indications do not preclude use of antibody tests in vaccinated individuals, none of the currently authorized tests has been authorized to assess humoral immunity after vaccination or to define a threshold of protection after infection; therefore, the FDA recommends against SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing to assess immunity. Detection of anti-RBD-bAbs correlates with emergence of nAbs and nAbs have been associated with protection against COVID-19, yet a definitive correlate of protection has not been identified. Currently, only 1 commercial test has been authorized to detect nAbs from individuals with recent or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, but although calibrated against the WHO standard, it was not validated for testing after vaccination or for predicting protection from reinfection. Assays designed to quantify T-cell immune function are not widely available for clinical use.

### Looking beyond COVID-19 vaccine phase 3 trials [^113rQSGP]. Nature Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

After the recent announcement of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy in clinical trials by several manufacturers for protection against severe disease, a comprehensive post-efficacy strategy for the next steps to ensure vaccination of the global population is now required. These considerations should include how to manufacture billions of doses of high-quality vaccines, support for vaccine purchase, coordination of supply, the equitable distribution of vaccines and the logistics of global vaccine delivery, all of which are a prelude to a massive vaccination campaign targeting people of all ages. Furthermore, additional scientific questions about the vaccines remain that should be answered to improve vaccine efficacy, including questions regarding the optimization of vaccination regimens, booster doses, the correlates of protection, vaccine effectiveness, safety and enhanced surveillance. The timely and coordinated execution of these post-efficacy tasks will bring the pandemic to an effective, and efficient, close.

### Effectiveness of a single COVID-19 mRNA vaccine dose in individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection: a systematic review [^115fYUjB]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since the emergence of Omicron in November 2021, population-level immunity to SARS-CoV-2 stemming from both natural infection and vaccination has increased substantially. Recent seroprevalence studies conducted in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and Europe estimate that > 90% of the population have some immunity to SARS-CoV-2 from prior infection, vaccination, or both –. However, due to the emergence of antigenically distinct variants and waning immunity, populations remain at risk for future infection, severe disease, and sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

COVID-19 mRNA vaccines were initially licensed as a two-dose series, with subsequent approvals, and recommendations for additional booster doses for various populations during the pandemic. Based on the high level of population immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and in support of simplifying the vaccine dosing schedule, regulatory authorities have since authorized or approved the use of a single updated COVID-19 mRNA dose. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration authorized or approved the use of a single BA.4/5 bivalent COVID-19 mRNA dose for most individuals above 5 years of age on April 18, 2023. This was followed by authorization of a single annual dose of monovalent COVID-19 mRNA XBB.1.5-adapted vaccine for the same age group on September 11, 2023 intended for primary vaccination and for the 2023–2024 respiratory virus season. In a similar manner, the European Medicines Agency authorized or approved a single dose of the BNT162b2 XBB.1.5-adapted vaccine on August 30, 2023 for individuals ≥ 5 years of age irrespective of prior COVID-19 doses. Likewise, the World Health Organization Strategic Advisory Group of Experts issued a recommendation on September 28, 2023 for a single annual dose for primary immunization citing potential benefits in terms of improved vaccine acceptance and uptake.

IDSA COVID-19 guidelines — ambulatory patients and neutralizing antibody–containing products — note that the product used contains high titers of neutralizing antibodies and is used early in clinical presentation or in subpopulations of patients who do not have an adequate humoral immune response even at later stages of disease. The existing evidence in this specific population of patients remains sparse, and future studies in ambulatory patients should continue to target these populations.

### Ongoing and future COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials: challenges and opportunities [^11541HWC]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Large-scale deployment of COVID-19 vaccines will seriously affect the ongoing phases 2 and 3 randomised placebo-controlled trials assessing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates. The effect will be particularly acute in high-income countries where the entire adult or older population could be vaccinated by late 2021. Regrettably, only a small proportion of the population in many low-income and middle-income countries will have access to available vaccines. Sponsors of COVID-19 vaccine candidates currently in phase 2 or initiating phase 3 trials in 2021 should consider continuing the research in countries with limited affordability and availability of COVID-19 vaccines. Several ethical principles must be implemented to ensure the equitable, non-exploitative, and respectful conduct of trials in resource-poor settings. Once sufficient knowledge on the immunogenicity response to COVID-19 vaccines is acquired, non-inferiority immunogenicity trials-comparing the immune response of a vaccine candidate to that of an authorised vaccine-would probably be the most common trial design. Until then, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trials will continue to play a role in the development of new vaccine candidates. WHO or the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences should define an ethical framework for the requirements and benefits for trial participants and host communities in resource-poor settings that should require commitment from all vaccine candidate sponsors from high-income countries.

### COVID-19 vaccination coverage, behaviors, and intentions among adults with previous diagnosis, United States [^1144SFTa]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

To determine the extent of gaps in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine coverage among those in the United States with and without previous COVID-19 diagnoses, we used data from a large, nationally representative survey conducted during July 21-August 2, 2021. We analyzed vaccine receipt (≥ 1 dose and full vaccination) and intention to be vaccinated for 63,266 persons. Vaccination receipt was lower among those who had a prior diagnosis of COVID-19 compared to those without: > 1 dose: 73% and 85%, respectively, p < 0.001; full vaccination: 69% and 82%, respectively, p < 0.001). Reluctance to be vaccinated was higher among those with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis (14%) than among those without (9%). These findings suggest the need to focus educational and confidence-building interventions on adults who receive a COVID-19 diagnosis during clinic visits, or at the time of discharge if hospitalized, and to better educate the public about the value of being vaccinated, regardless of previous COVID-19 infection.

### The politics of COVID-19 vaccine confidence [^1118DCEk]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

In the context of emerging COVID-19 virus variants, trends of vaccine nationalism, and multiple vaccine supply challenges, COVID-19 vaccine related uncertainties and challenges continue. Additionally, confidence in new COVID-19 vaccines is highly variable, with minority communities generally less trusting of not only the new vaccines, but also those who produce them and the governments buying and recommending them. How governments handle the COVID-19 response will be a key influencer of public confidence in and acceptance of COVID vaccination.

### Use of updated COVID-19 vaccines 2023–2024 formula for persons aged ≥ 6 months: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, September 2023 [^111LZKC8]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Post–COVID-19 conditions contribute to COVID-19–related morbidity among all age groups. The prevalence of ongoing symptoms ≥ 3 months after COVID-19 illness ranged from < 1% among persons aged < 18 years to 5% among those aged 35–49 years. During June 7–19, 2023, approximately one in four adults with post–COVID-19 conditions reported significant activity limitations.

Members of racial and ethnic minority groups continue to be disproportionately affected by COVID-19–associated hospitalization. Higher prevalences of underlying conditions in some racial and ethnic minority populations might increase their risk for severe COVID-19–associated outcomes. As of May 10, 2023, only 17% of the U.S. population had received a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine dose, with lower coverage among some racial and ethnic minority populations, potentially driven by differences in vaccine access and acceptability.

After declining throughout the spring and early summer of 2023, COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates began increasing in mid-July 2023. Further increases are anticipated during the fall and winter respiratory virus season.

### COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations by COVID-19 vaccination status and previous COVID-19 diagnosis-California and new york, may-November 2021 [^113z5F9R]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

By November 30, 2021, approximately 130,781 COVID-19–associated deaths, one in six of all U.S. deaths from COVID-19, had occurred in California and New York. * COVID-19 vaccination protects against infection with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), associated severe illness, and death; among those who survive, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection also confers protection against severe outcomes in the event of reinfection. The relative magnitude and duration of infection- and vaccine-derived protection, alone and together, can guide public health planning and epidemic forecasting. To examine the impact of primary COVID-19 vaccination and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection on COVID-19 incidence and hospitalization rates, statewide testing, surveillance, and COVID-19 immunization data from California and New York (which account for 18% of the U.S. population) were analyzed. Four cohorts of adults aged ≥ 18 years were considered: persons who were 1) unvaccinated with no previous laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, 2) vaccinated (14 days after completion of a primary COVID-19 vaccination series) with no previous COVID-19 diagnosis, 3) unvaccinated with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, and 4) vaccinated with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis. Age-adjusted hazard rates of incident laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in both states were compared among cohorts, and in California, hospitalizations during May 30–November 20, 2021, were also compared. During the study period, COVID-19 incidence in both states was highest among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis compared with that among the other three groups. During the week beginning May 30, 2021, compared with COVID-19 case rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, COVID-19 case rates were 19.9-fold (California) and 18.4-fold (New York) lower among vaccinated persons without a previous diagnosis; 7.2-fold (California) and 9.9-fold lower (New York) among unvaccinated persons with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis; and 9.6-fold (California) and 8.5-fold lower (New York) among vaccinated persons with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis. During the same period, compared with hospitalization rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization rates in California followed a similar pattern. These relationships changed after the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant became predominant (i.e. accounted for > 50% of sequenced isolates) in late June and July. By the week beginning October 3, compared with COVID-19 cases rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, case rates among vaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis were 6.2-fold (California) and 4.5-fold (New York) lower; rates were substantially lower among both groups with previous COVID-19 diagnoses, including 29.0-fold (California) and 14.7-fold lower (New York) among unvaccinated persons with a previous diagnosis, and 32.5-fold (California) and 19.8-fold lower (New York) among vaccinated persons with a previous diagnosis of COVID-19. During the same period, compared with hospitalization rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization rates in California followed a similar pattern. These results demonstrate that vaccination protects against COVID-19 and related hospitalization, and that surviving a previous infection protects against a reinfection and related hospitalization. Importantly, infection-derived protection was higher after the Delta variant became predominant, a time when vaccine-induced immunity for many persons declined because of immune evasion and immunologic waning. Similar cohort data accounting for booster doses needs to be assessed, as new variants, including Omicron, circulate. Although the epidemiology of COVID-19 might change with the emergence of new variants, vaccination remains the safest strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections and associated complications; all eligible persons should be up to date with COVID-19 vaccination. Additional recommendations for vaccine doses might be warranted in the future as the virus and immunity levels change.

### Cost-effectiveness of 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccination in US adults [^116eKnvG]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

This decision analytic modeling study shows that vaccination with an updated 2023 to 2024 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine for all adults in the US may be attractive not only for its expected health gains but also for its economic benefits. As the evidence base for COVID-19 vaccination and burden of illness rapidly evolve, it will be important to continue to update and revise the economic evaluation of vaccination against COVID-19. In particular, higher-quality data are needed to assess vaccine safety and effectiveness and to estimate the burden of disease for pediatric and adolescent age groups. Understanding the health effects and costs of long COVID also requires further investigation. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has recently released a report providing a standard definition of long COVID, and this is anticipated to support and help guide future research in this area. As hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19 continue to decline, the burden of long COVID will have increasing importance in determining the economic attractiveness of future updated COVID-19 vaccines.

### Vaccines for COVID-19: where do we stand in 2021? [^111XdW9n]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

As of July 2021, over 3 billion doses of a COVID-19 vaccines have been administered globally, and there are now 19 COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in at least one country. Several of these have been shown to be highly effective both in clinical trials and real-world observational studies, some of which have included special populations of interest. A small number of countries have approved a COVID-19 vaccine for use in adolescents or children. These are laudable achievements, but the global vaccination effort has been challenged by inequitable distribution of vaccines predominantly to high income countries, with only 0.9% of people in low-income countries having received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Addressing this inequity is of critical importance and will result in better control of SARS-CoV-2 globally. Other challenges include: the reduced protection from COVID-19 vaccines against some strains of SARS-CoV-2, necessitating the development of variant specific vaccines; and uncertainties around the duration of protection from vaccine-induced immunity.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^113FjQVZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

How to approach a patient when considering pharmacologic treatments for COVID-19 — this section discusses how to approach a patient suspected to have COVID-19 and how to apply the IDSA COVID-19 treatment guidelines to specific clinical syndromes. The guideline notes that the certainty of supporting evidence is low to moderate for most recommendations and that the panel made conditional suggestions rather than strong recommendations for or against most of the agents. It further states that though substantial progress was made with COVID-19 therapies, there remain many unanswered questions in the management of COVID-19, and that despite limited evidence, to give actionable and timely guidance to frontline clinicians, it provides recommendations for use of combinations of agents, recommends some agents over others, or extrapolates to sub populations not evaluated in trials. Critical unanswered questions identified include which sub-populations or specific clinical types of patients benefit most from specific therapeutic agents, what the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 therapies are in populations immune from prior SARS-CoV-2 infections and vaccination, what the efficacy and safety of treatments are in infections with specific SARS-CoV-2 variants and sub-variants, and how therapeutic agents perform when compared to each other to allow a tiered approach to treating patients with COVID-19.

### Trajectory of long COVID symptoms after COVID-19 vaccination: community based cohort study [^112TTZbn]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

The symptom trajectory following the initial decrease after a first vaccine dose was unclear, being compatible with both increasing and decreasing odds of long covid over time. Evidence was, however, found of an increasing trend when the sample was restricted to participants vaccinated during the follow-up period. Relapsing symptoms are common in long covid, and persistent symptoms are associated with a weak antibody response, so it is possible that receiving a first vaccine dose alone is insufficient for sustained improvement in some people.

UK Government guidelines recommend that people should delay vaccination for four weeks after a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2. Given that we only considered follow-up visits beyond 12 weeks of participants' first positive test result (as our outcome of interest was long covid symptoms at least 12 weeks after infection), it seems unlikely that this guidance would have affected our analysis. The National Health Service advises patients with ongoing complications of covid-19 to consult their doctor about vaccination, so it is possible that some people with long covid symptoms may choose to delay vaccination until their symptoms resolve, which would induce an association. However, this is unlikely to have affected our analysis, as we found no evidence that study participants with long covid deferred their covid-19 vaccination compared with those without long covid (see supplementary figure 5). Because our study was observational, we cannot rule out the possibility of a change in reported symptoms after vaccination being due to a placebo effect. Although we might expect to observe a post-vaccination relapse in some participants whose symptoms initially improved, our ability to do this was limited by the follow-up available to us (a median of 67 days from the second vaccine dose).

### Effect of COVID-19 vaccination on long covid: systematic review [^115nVmiv]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

We found no randomised controlled trials, but 16 observational studies provided outcomes on long covid. Six of the eight studies of two or more doses of vaccine given before infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus found significant reductions in the rates of long covid. A similar result was less clear with only one dose of vaccine. Three of the five studies of vaccination after the infection showed significant reductions in patients with long covid, but none showed any harm of vaccination. Owing to insufficient data, we could not examine any dose-response association. All 16 studies were non-randomised, and most were assessed as having a moderate to critical risk of bias. Thus the evidence summarised here is of low certainty.

### A call to action: current challenges and considerations for COVID-19 vaccination in immunocompromised populations [^112ujYgb]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 1.
mRNA-Based COVID-19 Vaccine Recommendations for Immunocompromised Individuals in the United States

Given the heterogeneity of the immunocompromised population, adoption of nonstandard vaccination approaches could help to provide tailored patient care for those with attenuated responses to vaccination. When providing guidelines for immunization recommendations, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers timing of the COVID-19 vaccination as it relates to immunosuppressive therapies. For COVID-19, the current guidance for this population is to wait ≥ 2 weeks before starting or resuming immunosuppressive therapy after COVID-19 vaccination. Those patients receiving B cell–depleting therapies are advised to time their vaccination to coincide with approximately 4 weeks before their next scheduled therapy. Currently, US healthcare professionals have the potential to administer COVID-19 vaccines outside of the recommended dosing intervals if there are any clinical benefits of doing so; however, nonroutine vaccinations are not recommended as a standard practice. Active postvaccination assessment of immune response to vaccination through serologic, cellular, immune, or B cell quantification testing is currently not recommended to guide clinical care, although this approach may ultimately be important to establish for COVID-19 vaccines. For example, serologic tests have been used for assessing the need for hepatitis B revaccination or booster doses among hemodialysis patients; whether a similar approach might be practical for COVID-19 vaccines among immunocompromised patients may be worth further investigation. Overall, alignment on recommendations for tailored care may help to simplify immunization options, increase patient care options, and ultimately provide additional protection for those individuals currently still at risk for serious outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### COVID-19 vaccinations: the unknowns, challenges, and hopes [^116Q3kpa]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

The entire world has been suffering from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic since March 11, 2020. More than a year later, the COVID-19 vaccination brought hope to control this viral pandemic. Here, we review the unknowns of the COVID-19 vaccination, such as its longevity, asymptomatic spread, long-term side effects, and its efficacy on immunocompromised patients. In addition, we discuss challenges associated with the COVID-19 vaccination, such as the global access and distribution of vaccine doses, adherence to hygiene guidelines after vaccination, the emergence of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants, and vaccine resistance. Despite all these challenges and the fact that the end of the COVID-19 pandemic is still unclear, vaccines have brought great hope for the world, with several reports indicating a significant decline in the risk of COVID19-related infection and hospitalizations.

### Optimal annual COVID-19 vaccine boosting dates following previous booster vaccination or breakthrough infection [^113V8hGa]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 booster vaccinations mitigate transmission and reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with infection. However, the optimal date for booster administration remains uncertain. Geographic variation in infection rates throughout the year makes it challenging to intuit the best yearly booster administration date to effectively prevent infection, and also challenging to provide best guidance on how to alter booster administration in response to a breakthrough infection.

Methods

We leveraged longitudinal antibody and reinfection probabilities with spatiotemporal projections of COVID-19 incidence to develop a geographically informed approach to optimizing the timing of booster vaccination. We assessed the delay in booster vaccination that is warranted following breakthrough infections whenever they occur during the year, enabling a personalized assessment of optimal timing that acknowledges and respects diversity of COVID-19 immune status, addressing a substantial barrier to uptake.

Results

Yearly booster vaccination on any date is beneficial to prevention of infection. However, each location exhibits as much as a 3–4-fold range in degree of protection by date of uptake. Optimal COVID-19 booster vaccination dates are location-specific, typically in early autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. Infection late in the interval between boosts substantially alters the optimal boosting date.

Conclusions

Considerable benefit accrues from aptly timing COVID-19 booster vaccination campaigns, which can be tailored to specific locations. Individuals can acquire the greatest benefit from booster vaccination by timing it optimally, including delaying in cases of infection late in the interval between boosts. These results provide location-specific guidance for public health policy, healthcare provider recommendations, and individual decision-making.

### Effectiveness of a single COVID-19 mRNA vaccine dose in individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection: a systematic review [^114NuvpL]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Based on high population immunity to SARS-CoV-2 from prior infection, vaccination, or both, in fall 2023, regulatory agencies globally authorized/approved a single mRNA XBB.1.5-adapted vaccine dose for individuals aged ≥ 5 years regardless of prior vaccination.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review on vaccine effectiveness (VE) of a single COVID-19 mRNA dose in individuals with a history of prior infection compared to individuals who were (i) SARS-CoV-2 naïve, (ii) unvaccinated with prior infection, and (iii) vaccinated with > 1 dose with or without prior infection. We searched MEDLINE and Embase for studies published January 2021-October 2023. Data were synthesized following Synthesis Without Meta-Analysis guidelines; bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023453257).

Results

Eighteen studies were eligible. None of these studies reported bivalent or XBB.1.5-adapted VE, and none reported VE for immunocompromised populations or children aged < 5 years. Among those with prior infection, a single mRNA dose increased protection by 8–71% against infection (during Omicron BA.1, BA.4/5, or XBB predominance), 39–67% against symptomatic infection (BA.1, BA.2, or BA.4/5), and 25–60% against hospitalization or hospitalization or death (BA.1). VE of one dose was comparable to two doses among those with prior infection, and higher than following two doses without prior infection.

Conclusions

A single dose of original mRNA COVID-19 vaccine provides similar protection to two doses for immunocompetent individuals aged ≥ 5 years in the current setting of high pre-existing immunity. This supports current recommendations for one dose to be given in advance of the respiratory season, regardless of history of infection or vaccination, with considerations for additional doses for certain populations including young children, older adults, and the immunocompromised.

### Summary of guidance for minimizing the impact of COVID-19 on individual persons, communities, and health care systems-United States, August 2022 [^1126aaRZ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

As SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, continues to circulate globally, high levels of vaccine- and infection-induced immunity and the availability of effective treatments and prevention tools have substantially reduced the risk for medically significant COVID-19 illness (severe acute illness and post-COVID-19 conditions) and associated hospitalization and death (1). These circumstances now allow public health efforts to minimize the individual and societal health impacts of COVID-19 by focusing on sustainable measures to further reduce medically significant illness as well as to minimize strain on the health care system, while reducing barriers to social, educational, and economic activity (2). Individual risk for medically significant COVID-19 depends on a person's risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and their risk for developing severe illness if infected (3). Exposure risk can be mitigated through nonpharmaceutical interventions, including improving ventilation, use of masks or respirators indoors, and testing (4). The risk for medically significant illness increases with age, disability status, and underlying medical conditions but is considerably reduced by immunity derived from vaccination, previous infection, or both, as well as timely access to effective biomedical prevention measures and treatments (3,5). CDC's public health recommendations change in response to evolving science, the availability of biomedical and public health tools, and changes in context, such as levels of immunity in the population and currently circulating variants. CDC recommends a strategic approach to minimizing the impact of COVID-19 on health and society that relies on vaccination and therapeutics to prevent severe illness; use of multicomponent prevention measures where feasible; and particular emphasis on protecting persons at high risk for severe illness. Efforts to expand access to vaccination and therapeutics, including the use of preexposure prophylaxis for persons who are immunocompromised, antiviral agents, and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, should be intensified to reduce the risk for medically significant illness and death. Efforts to protect persons at high risk for severe illness must ensure that all persons have access to information to understand their individual risk, as well as efficient and equitable access to vaccination, therapeutics, testing, and other prevention measures. Current priorities for preventing medically significant illness should focus on ensuring that persons 1) understand their risk, 2) take steps to protect themselves and others through vaccines, therapeutics, and nonpharmaceutical interventions when needed, 3) receive testing and wear masks if they have been exposed, and 4) receive testing if they are symptomatic, and isolate for ≥ 5 days if they are infected.

Serologic testing to assess previous SARS-CoV-2 infection — antibody target — when evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection is desired, the IDSA panel suggests using serologic assays that target nucleocapsid protein rather than spike protein (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). This guidance reflects that most available vaccines result in formation of only anti-spike antibodies but some inactivated whole-virus vaccines (CoronaVac and BBIBP-CorV) can also result in anti-nucleocapsid antibodies, and that given widespread vaccination and persistence of anti-spike antibodies, detection of anti-spike antibodies has low positive predictive value for diagnosis of recent COVID-19 in most individuals.

### Effectiveness of a single COVID-19 mRNA vaccine dose in individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection: a systematic review [^113jcrSd]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Findings from this systematic review support recent policy recommendations and decisions for receipt of one COVID-19 vaccine dose regardless of vaccination history for immunocompetent individuals ≥ 5 years of age for the 2023–2024 and 2024–2025 respiratory virus seasons. Of note, we did observe that a single dose in the absence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection provided protection during pre-Omicron and Omicron periods, although this protection tended to be lower than that provided by hybrid immunity of one dose and prior infection. This review also indicates, however, that there is a lack of published, peer-reviewed evidence describing the protection conferred by a single dose among those with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection for certain populations, including young children and immunocompromised persons. Due to the increased risk of severe disease in these populations, and the gap in evidence, additional doses continue to be warranted in these groups in alignment with current recommendations for additional doses for certain patient populations. Because of waning protection following infection, vaccination, or both, and the continuing emergence of antigenically distinct variants, protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes will continue to fluctuate. To maintain optimal protection, COVID-19 vaccination should be given annually before the viral respiratory season to the general population, and additional doses may be needed for certain populations. Thus, the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines should be continually monitored to inform future vaccine recommendations in real time.

In summary, a single dose of COVID-19 vaccine improves protection against a range of COVID-19 outcomes and provides similar protection to that conferred by a two-dose series for immunocompetent individuals aged ≥ 5 years in the current setting of high pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 immunity. These findings support current recommendations for one dose of COVID-19 vaccines to be given in advance of the viral respiratory season, regardless of prior history of SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 vaccination, with considerations for additional doses for certain populations including young children, older adults, and the immunocompromised.

Detailed data on the efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis specifically in immunocompromised individuals who have received COVID-19 vaccines are needed, and additional data regarding safety, serum neutralizing against emerging variants, clinical efficacy, and pharmacoeconomic analyses are needed.

### Guidance for implementing COVID-19 prevention strategies in the context of varying community transmission levels and vaccination coverage [^111FEeaL]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The most important public health action to end the pandemic remains increasing vaccination coverage, which saves lives, prevents illness, and reduces the spread of COVID-19. Effective COVID-19 prevention strategies are well documented and can help reduce community transmission until high vaccination coverage is achieved. To maximize protection of the community, prevention strategies should be strengthened or added if transmission worsens. Prevention strategies should only be relaxed or lifted after several weeks of continuous sustained improvement in the level of community transmission. In areas with low or no SARS-CoV-2 transmission and with testing capacity in place to detect early introduction or increases in spread of the virus, layered prevention strategies might be removed one at a time while monitoring closely for any evidence that COVID-19 cases are increasing.

The widespread availability and administration of COVID-19 vaccines has changed the trajectory of the pandemic in the United States and significantly reduced hospitalization and mortality among vaccinated persons. Increasing the proportion of eligible persons who are vaccinated reduces the risk for substantial or high community-wide transmission, which in turn reduces the risk for the emergence of new variants that could have the potential to overcome vaccine-induced immunity. However, vaccination coverage varies across the United States, and transmission risk remains considerable in areas with low vaccination coverage. Decisions to add or remove effective prevention strategies should be based on local data and public health recommendations. The emergence of more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Delta, increases the urgency to expand vaccination coverage and for public health agencies and other organizations to collaboratively monitor the status of the pandemic in their communities and continue to apply layered prevention strategies to minimize preventable illness and death.

### Trajectory of long COVID symptoms after COVID-19 vaccination: community based cohort study [^111HJJ2s]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

We found that vaccination against covid-19 is associated with a decrease in the likelihood of continuing to experience long covid symptoms in adults aged 18 to 69 years, and this appeared to be sustained after a second vaccine dose. Our results suggest that vaccination of people previously infected may be associated with a reduction in the burden of long covid on population health, at least in the first few months after vaccination. Further research is required to evaluate the long term relationship between vaccination and long covid, in particular the impact of the omicron variant, which has become dominant in the UK, booster doses, now widely available to adults in the population, and reinfections. Studies are also needed to understand the biological mechanisms underpinning any improvements in symptoms after vaccination, which may contribute to the development of therapeutics for long covid.

### Impact of COVID-19 vaccination on the risk of developing long-COVID and on existing long-COVID symptoms: a systematic review [^116CYvkU]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The mechanisms underlying a potential risk reduction of long-COVID in people previously vaccinated are unknown. Two hypotheses are proposed. First, since vaccines reduce the severity of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, this may then translate into lower risk of developing organ or systemic derangements, and thus symptoms onset and duration. However, the association of long -COVID with COVID-19 severity remains controversial. A second hypothesis is that vaccines may accelerate clearance of the remaining SARS-CoV-2 virus in the human body (viral remnant hypothesis of long-COVID) or could also reduce the exaggerated inflammatory and/or immune response associated with long-COVID development (immune/inflammatory hypothesis of long-COVID). Future studies investigating the underlying mechanisms of vaccines on long-COVID would be needed to clarify these issues.

### Good or best practice statements: proposal for the operationalisation and implementation of GRADE guidance [^111s9ExC]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Box 3
Examples of inappropriately developed good practice statements

Vaccination: Countries are strongly urged to execute only high-quality preventive vaccination campaigns that can be conducted under safe conditions, without undue harm to health workers and the community when considering lifting any temporary suspensions on preventive mass vaccination campaigns. From WHO — Framework for decision-making: implementation of mass vaccination campaigns in the context of COVID-19. Explanation: Statement not clear and not necessary for healthcare practice. The statement does not provide a clear indication of what high-quality means and does not call for action that may not be usually conducted in usual practice. Therefore, without this guidance, clinicians and policymakers will be able to make the proper decision.
Infection control: Employers may consider allowing exposed and asymptomatic critical infrastructure workers to continue to work in select instances when it is necessary to preserve the function of critical infrastructure workplaces. From COVID-19 Critical Infrastructure Sector Response Planning. Explanation: Implementing the statement may not result in large net-positive consequences after consideration of all relevant outcomes and potential downstream consequences. Reintegrating exposed workers who are not experiencing any symptoms and who have not tested positive back into onsite operations may carry considerable risk to other workers because many people with asymptomatic COVID-19 can still spread the disease, and tests are imperfect, yielding a not negligible number of false negatives.
Diagnosis: It is recommended that contacts without symptoms are tested as soon as possible after being traced, to enable early identification of any asymptomatic or presymptomatic secondary cases among contacts and to start further contact. From European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) — Contact tracing: public health management of persons, including healthcare workers, who have had contact with COVID-19 cases in the European Union, Third Update. Explanation: Collecting and summarising evidence would be a good use of the guideline panel's time. There is evidence that the role of asymptomatic testing in controlling COVID-19 outbreaks in settings with vulnerable populations is evolving rapidly, and recommendations may need continuous updating. Effects of asymptomatic testing on the general population are a relevant question.
Infection control: Schools do not need to inform parents that pupil or teachers have been removed due to their symptoms. From Health Protection Surveillance Centre — Schools Pathway for COVID-19, the public health approach. Explanation: There was no well-documented clear and explicit rationale (or indirect evidence). Informing parents of students of a potential COVID-19 case allows them to take appropriate actions to protect their children and their close contacts. Therefore, the benefits behind not informing are not clear and require further explanation.

### Effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination and prior infections to reduce long COVID risk during the pre-omicron and omicron periods [^1136VQpd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

We estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19 and long COVID during pre-Omicron and Omicron periods, by number of doses and prior infection history.

Methods

We combined survey information from a cohort of healthcare workers in Quebec, Canada, with immunization registry and laboratory administrative data. We defined COVID-19 cases as symptomatic laboratory-confirmed infections and long COVID as self-reported symptoms persisting ≥ 12 weeks. We assessed VE against COVID-19 and long COVID, stratified by infection history, using a test-negative design where vaccinated participants were compared to unvaccinated participants during the pre-Omicron period or to those twice vaccinated ≥ 6 months before laboratory testing during the Omicron period.

Results

Analyses included 8230 COVID-19 participants and 43361 tested specimens. During the pre-Omicron period, one- and two-dose VE was 75% (95%CI:64–83) and 95% (95%CI:84–98) against COVID-19, respectively, and 91% (95%CI:79–96) and 87% (95%CI:22–98) against long COVID, respectively. During the Omicron period, booster dose VE was 41% (95%CI:34–47) against COVID-19 and 57% (95%CI:46–66) against long COVID, waning by 6 months. Hybrid VE in vaccinated and previously infected individuals ranged 81% (95%CI:38–94) to 92% (95%CI:87–95) regardless of number of doses, prior infecting variant or median time since last immunological event up to 9 months.

Conclusion

COVID-19 vaccination prevented long COVID during the pre-Omicron period and reduced the risk by more than half post-Omicron. With most of the population by now both vaccinated and infected, repeated booster doses may add little incremental value against long COVID, an observation with important public health, immunization program and cost implications.

### Summary of guidance for minimizing the impact of COVID-19 on individual persons, communities, and health care systems-United States, August 2022 [^113ToSjt]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Vaccines and Therapeutics To Reduce Medically Significant Illness

COVID-19 vaccination. COVID-19 vaccines are highly protective against severe illness and death and provide a lesser degree of protection against asymptomatic and mild infection. Receipt of a primary series alone, in the absence of being up to date with vaccination * through receipt of all recommended booster doses, provides minimal protection against infection and transmission. Being up to date with vaccination provides a transient period of increased protection against infection and transmission after the most recent dose, although protection can wane over time. The rates of COVID-19–associated hospitalization and death are substantially higher among unvaccinated adults than among those who are up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccination, particularly adults aged ≥ 65 years. Emerging evidence suggests that vaccination before infection also provides some protection against post–COVID-19 conditions, † and that vaccination among persons with post–COVID-19 conditions might help reduce their symptoms. Continuing to increase vaccination coverage and ensuring that persons are up to date with vaccination are essential to preventing severe outcomes. Overall booster dose coverage in the United States remains low, § which is concerning given the meaningful reductions in risk for severe illness and death that booster doses provide and the importance of booster doses to counter waning of vaccine-induced immunity. Public health efforts to expand reach and promote equitable access to vaccination have resulted in similar rates of primary series coverage across most racial and ethnic groups; however, racial and ethnic disparities in booster coverage have emerged. Supporting community partnerships and leveraging trusted sources of information must continue in order to eliminate persistent disparities and achieve equity in booster dose coverage, including through increasing education efforts and promotion of equitable vaccination outreach. Public health efforts need to continue to promote up-to-date vaccination for everyone, especially with vaccines targeting emerging novel variants that might be more transmissible or immune-evasive.

IDSA COVID-19 serology in high-suspicion symptomatic patients with negative NAATs — Recommendation 2 states that the IDSA panel recommends against using IgG antibodies to provide evidence of COVID-19 in symptomatic patients with a high clinical suspicion and repeatedly negative NAATs (strong recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Supporting evidence identified 19 studies in such patients; PCR-negative/IgG-positive results ranged from 0% to 93%, with most studies reporting this combination in fewer than 50% of samples, and PCR-negative/IgM-positive results ranged from 2% to 83%. The guideline remarks that contemporary populations are more likely to have prior infection or vaccination than the study populations, which could negatively affect pooled specificity calculations.

COVID-19 vaccine safety in clinical trials — The three vaccines were authorized after randomized controlled trials as large as or larger than prior vaccines, with 30,000–44,000 participants per trial, randomized 1:1 vaccine vs placebo, and these trials demonstrated their efficacy and safety. The 3 vaccines had similar rates of local and systemic reactogenicity, which were greater than those seen for the placebo arm; reactogenicity tended to be greater with the second dose (when applicable) and was less frequent and less severe in older recipients. Nearly all reactions were considered mild to moderate and resolved within several days. Serious adverse events were similar in vaccine and placebo arms, no deaths considered attributable to vaccination were reported in any of the trials, and manufacturers will continue safety monitoring for up to 2 years.

### Outpatient management of COVID-19: rapid evidence review [^112pdBpk]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

New COVID-19 variants of concern continue to develop. Incubation period, transmissibility, immune escape, and treatment effectiveness differ by variants of concern. Physicians should be aware that the characteristics of the predominant variants of concern determine aspects of diagnosis and treatment. Multiple testing modalities exist; the most appropriate testing strategy varies depending on the clinical scenario, with factors of test sensitivity, turnaround time, and the expertise required for specimen collection. Three types of vaccines are available in the United States, and all people six months and older should be encouraged to receive one because vaccination is effective in reducing the incidence of and hospitalizations and deaths associated with COVID-19. Vaccination may also reduce the incidence of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e., long COVID). Consider medications, such as nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, as first-line treatment for eligible patients diagnosed with COVID-19 unless logistical or supply constraints occur. National Institutes of Health guidelines and local health care partner resources can be used to determine eligibility. Long-term health effects of having COVID-19 are under investigation.

### Association of guideline complexity with individuals' ability to determine eligibility for COVID-19 vaccination [^1152XWK7]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Initial demand for COVID-19 vaccines exceeded early supply, so states created vaccine prioritization guidance. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also released guidance on prioritization. We assessed COVID-19 vaccine guideline complexity and the ability of individuals to identify their eligibility.

### Broad humoral and cellular immunity elicited by one-dose mRNA vaccination 18 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection [^115GHR6p]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Additional vaccination in COVID-19 convalescent individuals is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), based on epidemiological observations of a significantly lower reinfection risk in COVID-19 patients who were subsequently vaccinated than in those who remained unvaccinated after infection. The CDC's recommendation is also supported by immunological findings of similar, or even greater, humoral and cellular responses elicited by one vaccine dose in patients who recovered from COVID-19 than by a two-dose vaccination regimen in naïve individuals. Those studies found that a second dose did not significantly increase the immune response of COVID-19 convalescent individuals. However, there are no specific guidelines regarding the number of additional vaccine doses that should be given to people with a history of COVID-19, partly owing to a lack of knowledge of how long the maximal post-COVID-19 "boosting" effect could be generated by one dose of mRNA vaccine. We hypothesized that it could be achieved even after a year after COVID-19 diagnosis, and the present study results support the use of one additional vaccine dose, even in individuals who had COVID-19 as long as 18 months ago.

### COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations by COVID-19 vaccination status and previous COVID-19 diagnosis-California and new york, may-November 2021 [^115ym9Qp]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

By November 30, 2021, approximately 130,781 COVID-19-associated deaths, one in six of all U.S. deaths from COVID-19, had occurred in California and New York.* COVID-19 vaccination protects against infection with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), associated severe illness, and death (1,2); among those who survive, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection also confers protection against severe outcomes in the event of reinfection (3,4). The relative magnitude and duration of infection- and vaccine-derived protection, alone and together, can guide public health planning and epidemic forecasting. To examine the impact of primary COVID-19 vaccination and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection on COVID-19 incidence and hospitalization rates, statewide testing, surveillance, and COVID-19 immunization data from California and New York (which account for 18% of the U.S. population) were analyzed. Four cohorts of adults aged ≥ 18 years were considered: persons who were 1) unvaccinated with no previous laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, 2) vaccinated (14 days after completion of a primary COVID-19 vaccination series) with no previous COVID-19 diagnosis, 3) unvaccinated with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, and 4) vaccinated with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis. Age-adjusted hazard rates of incident laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in both states were compared among cohorts, and in California, hospitalizations during May 30-November 20, 2021, were also compared. During the study period, COVID-19 incidence in both states was highest among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis compared with that among the other three groups. During the week beginning May 30, 2021, compared with COVID-19 case rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, COVID-19 case rates were 19.9-fold (California) and 18.4-fold (New York) lower among vaccinated persons without a previous diagnosis; 7.2-fold (California) and 9.9-fold lower (New York) among unvaccinated persons with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis; and 9.6-fold (California) and 8.5-fold lower (New York) among vaccinated persons with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis. During the same period, compared with hospitalization rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization rates in California followed a similar pattern. These relationships changed after the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant became predominant (i.e., accounted for > 50% of sequenced isolates) in late June and July. By the week beginning October 3, compared with COVID-19 cases rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, case rates among vaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis were 6.2-fold (California) and 4.5-fold (New York) lower; rates were substantially lower among both groups with previous COVID-19 diagnoses, including 29.0-fold (California) and 14.7-fold lower (New York) among unvaccinated persons with a previous diagnosis, and 32.5-fold (California) and 19.8-fold lower (New York) among vaccinated persons with a previous diagnosis of COVID-19. During the same period, compared with hospitalization rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization rates in California followed a similar pattern. These results demonstrate that vaccination protects against COVID-19 and related hospitalization, and that surviving a previous infection protects against a reinfection and related hospitalization. Importantly, infection-derived protection was higher after the Delta variant became predominant, a time when vaccine-induced immunity for many persons declined because of immune evasion and immunologic waning (2,5,6). Similar cohort data accounting for booster doses needs to be assessed, as new variants, including Omicron, circulate. Although the epidemiology of COVID-19 might change with the emergence of new variants, vaccination remains the safest strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections and associated complications; all eligible persons should be up to date with COVID-19 vaccination. Additional recommendations for vaccine doses might be warranted in the future as the virus and immunity levels change.

### Optimal annual COVID-19 vaccine boosting dates following previous booster vaccination or breakthrough infection [^112hV16V]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) confer protection against infection and severe disease. In New York City alone, vaccination prevented nearly 300 000 cases, 50 000 hospitalizations, and 8500 deaths in 7 key months. For long-term protection, booster vaccination is necessary to address the waning of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody levels. However, the date when it is optimal to administer yearly booster vaccinations is not clear. It is complicated by the substantial spatiotemporal variation in incidence exhibited by SARS-CoV-2. Aligning booster timing to provide peak protection during peak incidence could be crucial to maximizing benefits.

The ascertainment of optimal dates for yearly booster vaccination is important not only for those who have not recently been infected, but also for those who experience breakthrough infections. The production of antibodies for recent breakthrough infection would offset benefits of an immediate booster vaccination. Current guidance suggests delay of reinforcement of immunity to later in the year, with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommending a delay of up to 3 months. However, this guidance has not been rigorously evaluated, creating a significant barrier to vaccine uptake. Therefore, it is vital to establish policies assessing the optimal timing of boosters and acknowledging the impact of breakthrough infections.

The question of when to boost has been extensively researched for influenza, which exhibits seasonal infection surges associated with climate and for which analyses of extensive endemic seasonal incidence data have been collected and analyzed. Consequently, the US CDC recommends influenza boosters between September and October in the United States. In countries that span temperate and tropical latitudes such as China, the optimal timing of yearly influenza boosters varies within the nation by as much as several months. These findings regarding influenza suggest performing similar seasonality analyses of 2019–2024 COVID-19 infection data. However, there are far fewer years of COVID-19 seasonal infection prevalence data on which to base predictions. Moreover, COVID-19 infections during recent years do not reflect endemic seasonality, and instead have been characterized by pandemic surges driven by historical contingencies, early saltations of viral evolution, and wholly naive versus differentially exposed immunological states of populations. Therefore, an alternate approach to evaluating optimal timing is necessary until there is sufficient accumulation of long-term empirical data on seasonality.
