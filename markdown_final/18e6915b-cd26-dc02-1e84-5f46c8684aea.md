## Question

red, warm tender nodule skin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate a red, warm, tender skin nodule. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate triage for life-threatening infections and malignancy. Then, I should verify the key distinguishing clinical features that narrow the differential. Next, I will prioritize the differential by likelihood and danger, outline a focused diagnostic workup, and finally specify when to biopsy and how to treat, while double-checking for pitfalls and exceptions at each step.

> Let me first confirm the red flags that mandate urgent action: rapidly expanding erythema with systemic toxicity suggests cellulitis or erysipelas and needs prompt antibiotics. Necrosis, bullae, or crepitus raises concern for necrotizing infection. Immunocompromise with fever and new nodules can signal opportunistic molds like Fusarium or Aspergillus. And a new, nonhealing, or atypically located nodule in someone over 50 or with cancer history warrants exclusion of metastasis or aggressive skin cancers, so I should not delay escalation if any of these are present [^be6c4770] [^2bd33f26] [^5acd020c].

> Wait, let me verify the core clinical discriminators before jumping to tests: location matters — pretibial nodules favor erythema nodosum, palms or soles point away from EN, and periumbilical or truncal nodules raise concern for metastasis. Depth and morphology — subcutaneous, nonulcerating nodules suggest panniculitis, whereas dermal or ulcerating lesions push me toward vasculitis, infection, or malignancy. Associated features like fever, arthralgias, GI symptoms, oral/genital ulcers, or recent drugs/infections reshape pretest probabilities substantially [^86660303] [^5acd020c] [^c328db5b].

> I will now examine the most likely diagnosis first: erythema nodosum presents with tender, erythematous, subcutaneous nodules on the shins, often with arthralgias and systemic symptoms, and is classically a septal panniculitis without vasculitis. Triggers include streptococcal infection, sarcoidosis, IBD, medications, pregnancy, and increasingly COVID-19, so I should ask about these explicitly and order ASO, chest imaging, and targeted labs before labeling it idiopathic [^86660303] [^40bec6ec] [^91a3571e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — several mimics can look similar but diverge on key features: Sweet syndrome produces tender erythematous plaques or nodules with neutrophilia and a dermal neutrophilic infiltrate, often on the upper body and associated with malignancy or drugs. Pancreatic panniculitis shows painful lower-extremity nodules with fat necrosis and ghost cells when lipase is elevated. Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa yields tender subcutaneous nodules with livedo racemosa and medium-vessel vasculitis on deep biopsy. And cellulitis/erysipelas are warm, tender, expanding plaques without true nodularity, so I should double-check for a demarcated border and systemic signs to separate them from panniculitis [^c328db5b] [^c18e5f5d] [^f7703f6a] [^be6c4770].

> But wait, what if the nodule is on the hand or in an immunocompromised host? I need to check for entities like milker's nodule (zoonotic parapox), herpetic whitlow, or even atypical mycobacterial infection, and in neutropenia I should consider neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis from chemotherapy rather than infection. Likewise, a rapidly growing, asymptomatic red nodule in an older adult should trigger thoughts of Merkel cell carcinoma, so I should confirm the AEIOU features and plan a biopsy if present [^831c78e4] [^5e27ed93] [^7f236dcf].

> Next, I should review the focused diagnostic workup: obtain a CBC, ESR/CRP, and urinalysis to screen for systemic inflammation or renal involvement. Order ASO or streptococcal testing when EN is suspected. Consider chest radiography for TB, sarcoidosis, or coccidioidomycosis. Check lipase if pancreatic panniculitis is on the table. And tailor infectious serologies or cultures to exposures and risk factors, recognizing that routine blood cultures are low yield in uncomplicated cellulitis and should be reserved for systemic toxicity or immunocompromise [^86660303] [^40bec6ec] [^c3009c22].

> I should confirm when to biopsy and how: if the diagnosis is uncertain after clinical correlation, if the lesion is atypical, persistent, ulcerating, or in a high-risk patient, or if vasculitis or malignancy is suspected, then a biopsy is indicated. For suspected panniculitis, I need a deep incisional or excisional specimen to capture septa versus lobules and vessels. For suspected vasculitis, I should ensure the biopsy reaches medium-sized arteries. And if I suspect EN, I should avoid early biopsy because the histology is most specific after 48–72 hours when Miescher radial granulomas appear [^40bec6ec] [^1cc2f4f8] [^cce6bf21].

> Let me think about treatment principles and common pitfalls: for erythema nodosum, supportive care, leg elevation, compression, and NSAIDs are first-line while I treat the underlying trigger. For Sweet syndrome, systemic corticosteroids are effective but I should screen for associated malignancy. For pancreatic panniculitis, management targets the pancreatic disease and lesions often regress with control of lipase. For cellulitis, initiate antibiotics per IDSA guidance and reassess at 48–72 hours. And I should avoid unnecessary imaging or labs in straightforward cellulitis to prevent misinterpretation and delays [^86660303] [^c328db5b] [^c18e5f5d] [^c3009c22].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overlooked a couple of exceptions: a tender nodule on the ear could be chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis from pressure rather than infection, and a child with tender nodules and systemic symptoms could have panniculitis from diverse causes including infectious triggers or autoimmune disease, so I should verify exposures, travel, and age-specific differentials before committing to a single diagnosis [^75c81813] [^fa91c84c].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined sequence: triage for danger, map morphology and distribution, prioritize EN versus its mimics, execute a targeted lab and imaging workup, and biopsy when the story is incomplete or red flags emerge. By anchoring on location, depth, systemic features, and histopathology, I can avoid premature closure and catch serious disease early while preventing overtreatment of benign, self-limited conditions [^86660303] [^40bec6ec] [^3dfda77c].

A red, warm, tender skin nodule most often reflects **cellulitis** or **erysipelas** [^be6c4770] due to bacterial infection, but the differential is broad and includes panniculitis (notably erythema nodosum) [^86660303], abscess, vasculitis, and malignancy [^bc5bbe9b]. Rapid diagnosis relies on **history, exam, and targeted labs** [^ee7d974c]; **biopsy is indicated** for atypical, persistent, or nonresolving lesions to exclude vasculitis, panniculitis, or neoplasm [^3dfda77c]. Initial management is empiric antibiotics for suspected infection [^2bd33f26]; if no improvement in 48–72 hours, reassess and escalate to biopsy or imaging [^notfound].

---

## Clinical features and diagnostic approach

### Key clinical features

- **Appearance**: erythematous, warm, tender, indurated nodule or plaque, often with ill-defined borders [^be6c4770].
- **Systemic symptoms**: fever, malaise, chills, or rigors may accompany infection [^be6c4770].
- **Distribution**: commonly on lower extremities, but can occur anywhere [^86660303].

---

### Diagnostic approach

A structured approach begins with a **focused history** covering onset, duration, trauma, insect bites, travel, comorbidities, immunosuppression, medications, and systemic symptoms [^ee7d974c]. The **physical examination** should document size, tenderness, warmth, fluctuance, ulceration, sinus tracts, lymphadenopathy, and joint involvement [^notfound]. Initial laboratory tests include CBC, ESR/CRP, and cultures if drainage is present; obtain blood cultures only if systemic toxicity is suspected [^c3009c22]. Imaging (ultrasound or MRI) is reserved for deep or unclear cases to distinguish cellulitis from abscess or necrotizing infection [^dc9daeaa].

## Indications for biopsy

Biopsy is indicated when:

- **Atypical presentation**: Nonhealing, persistent, or atypically located lesions [^c7a6193f].
- **Treatment failure**: No improvement after 48–72 hours of appropriate antibiotics [^notfound].
- **Suspicion of vasculitis or panniculitis**: Clinical or histopathologic features suggestive of these entities [^cce6bf21].
- **Malignancy concern**: Persistent, nonhealing, or atypical lesions [^5acd020c].

---

## Histopathological findings

Histopathology provides definitive diagnosis:

- **Cellulitis/erysipelas**: Dermal neutrophilic infiltrate, vascular dilation, no vasculitis [^notfound].
- **Erythema nodosum**: Septal panniculitis, Miescher radial granulomas, no vasculitis [^40bec6ec].
- **Sweet syndrome**: Dense dermal neutrophilic infiltrate, papillary dermal edema [^c328db5b].
- **Polyarteritis nodosa**: Medium-vessel necrotizing vasculitis [^f7703f6a].
- **Leukemia cutis**: Atypical myeloid or lymphoid infiltrate [^2493c066].

---

## Management strategies

### Infectious etiologies

Empiric antibiotics should cover **Streptococcus and Staphylococcus**, including MRSA when risk factors are present [^notfound]. Provide supportive care with elevation, rest, and analgesia [^c2ea120a]. Escalate to IV therapy or add coverage for Gram-negative or anaerobic organisms if there is no improvement or if necrotizing infection is suspected [^notfound].

---

### Inflammatory etiologies

Treat underlying systemic disease and use **NSAIDs or corticosteroids** for symptom control [^c2ea120a]. For erythema nodosum, address triggers and provide supportive care [^c2ea120a].

---

### Vasculitis and malignancy

Management is guided by the specific entity and may involve **immunosuppression, chemotherapy, or radiation** [^ecf2ea9c].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis depends on the **underlying cause**, response to therapy, and patient comorbidities. Complications can include chronic infection, ulceration, scarring, systemic involvement, and recurrence [^5acd020c].

---

A red, warm, tender nodule most often reflects cellulitis or erysipelas, but the differential is broad; **prompt clinical assessment, targeted labs, and timely biopsy** when indicated are essential to confirm the diagnosis and guide therapy [^ee7d974c].

### Erythematous patches and nodules in a neutropenic patient [^5e27ed93]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

A 54-year-old man with progressed high-grade myelodysplastic syndrome admitted for chemotherapy developed several painful skin lesions on day 15 of treatment with daunorubicin and cytarabine. Exam demonstrated several erythematous plaques with induration, warmth, and tenderness on the legs and a tender, erythematous nodule on the forearm (Fig 1). Labs were notable for severe pancytopenia, including a leukocyte count of 2.6 × 10³ cells/uL and absolute neutrophil count of 730 cells/mL. Biopsies were obtained for histopathology (Figs 2 and 3). Tissue culture was sterile.

Question 1: Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis (NEH)
B. Leukemia cutis
C. Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet Syndrome)
D. Subcutaneous mycosis
E. Erythema nodosum

Answers:
A. NEH – Correct. NEH is a rare and self-limiting neutrophilic dermatosis that presents with tender, erythematous, and edematous plaques and nodules developing 1–2 weeks following chemotherapy, most commonly cytarabine. Histopathology reveals a perieccrine inflammatory infiltrate with neutrophils and lymphocytes, as well as edema, necrosis, and squamous metaplasia of eccrine coils. In neutropenic patients, inflammation may be sparse, but characteristic eccrine changes are maintained.
B. Leukemia cutis – Incorrect. Leukemia cutis often presents as asymptomatic nodules and papules favoring the trunk, extremities, and head. Histopathology shows infiltration of neoplastic leukocytes or their precursors into the dermis and subcutis.
C. Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet Syndrome) – Incorrect. Sweet syndrome is the most common neutrophilic dermatosis and is associated with malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndrome. However, an abrupt onset of multiple, tender, erythematous plaques, or nodules is characteristic, and histopathology would reveal marked edema and a significant dermal neutrophilic infiltrate without eccrine gland pathology.
D. Subcutaneous mycosis – Incorrect. The development of a solitary, indurated, subcutaneous nodule following transcutaneous trauma warrants concern for a deep fungal infection, and eccrine gland necrosis can be seen. However, fungal organisms would be identified on histopathology and tissue culture.
E. Erythema nodosum – Incorrect. While clinical findings may imitate NEH, erythema nodosum mainly localizes on the extensor surface of the legs. Histopathology would reveal a septal granulomatous panniculitis without vasculitis.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Erythema nodosum (EN)
B. Pancreatic panniculitis
C. Nutritional deficiency
D. Nodular vasculitis
E. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura

Answers:
A. Erythema nodosum (EN) – Incorrect. EN presents with tender red subcutaneous nodules on the lower extremities and may be associated with infections, oral contraceptives, and other systemic inflammatory disorders. While our patient's nodules could represent EN, the expected histopathology would be a septal and not lobular panniculitis, as seen in our case.
B. Pancreatic panniculitis – Incorrect. Pancreatic panniculitis may present as tender nodules on the lower limbs and may be associated with arthropathy and pleural effusions. Histologically, it may also show fat necrosis and foamy histiocytes. However, contrary to typical presentations, there were no signs of abdominal pain or elevated serum amylase or lipase.
C. Nutritional deficiency – Correct. Given our patient's history of multiple food allergies and findings of petechiae, ecchymoses, hemarthrosis, and gingival bleeding, vitamin C (ascorbic acid) levels were evaluated, revealing a striking deficiency (< 0.1 mg/dl). As ascorbic acid is involved in collagen formation within the capillary walls, its deficiency can result in vessel fragility and hemorrhage, causing the skin findings seen in our patient. Consequently, vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) was diagnosed.
D. Nodular vasculitis – Incorrect. While nodular vasculitis may present with erythematous, tender nodules, they typically appear more commonly on the calves than on the shins. Histopathology often reveals lobular or septolobular panniculitis with vasculitis involving the medium-sized vessels, along with granulomatous inflammation and necrosis. Additionally, acid-fast bacilli staining was negative.
E. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura – Incorrect. Although immune thrombocytopenic purpura can present with petechiae and ecchymoses, thrombocytopenia is typically present.

### Differential diagnosis of the swollen red eyelid [^68ee74e7]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of eyelid erythema and edema is broad, ranging from benign, self-limiting dermatoses to malignant tumors and vision-threatening infections. A definitive diagnosis usually can be made on physical examination of the eyelid and a careful evaluation of symptoms and exposures. The finding of a swollen red eyelid often signals cellulitis. Orbital cellulitis is a severe infection presenting with proptosis and ophthalmoplegia; it requires hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics to prevent vision loss. Less serious conditions, such as contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, and blepharitis, are more common causes of eyelid erythema and edema. These less serious conditions can often be managed with topical corticosteroids and proper eyelid hygiene. They are differentiated on the basis of such clinical clues as time course, presence or absence of irritative symptoms, scaling, and other skin findings. Discrete lid lesions are also important diagnostic indicators. The finding of vesicles, erosions, or crusting may signal a herpes infection. Benign, self-limited eyelid nodules such as hordeola and chalazia often respond to warm compresses, whereas malignancies require surgical excision.

### Tender violaceous nodule on the palm [^4f660934]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 71-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of a tender nodule on the left palm during a total-body skin examination (Fig 1). The patient carried a diagnosis of JAK2 VA617F intermediate-risk essential thrombocytosis with secondary myelofibrosis and had been started on ruxolitinib 3 months prior to the presentation. The patient was an avid gardener. The examination revealed a well-appearing male with a multiloculated, nonulcerated, red-violaceous nodule on the left palm. Laboratory studies revealed lymphocytosis with normal platelets. A skin biopsy and tissue culture were obtained. Hematoxylin-eosin staining (Fig 2) and Gomori methenamine silver staining (Fig 3) were performed on the biopsy sample.

Question 1: Given the history and images, what is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Epidermoid cyst
B. Squamous cell carcinoma
C. Pilomatrical carcinoma
D. Basal cell carcinoma
E. Pilomatrixoma

Answers:
A. Epidermoid cyst – Incorrect. Epidermoid cysts typically present as firm, skin colored or yellowish papules or nodules in middle aged adults. They generally have a central punctum and are mobile. They are characterized histologically by unilocular or multilocular cystic structures in the dermis. Cyst rupture can result in foreign body granulomatous reaction in adjacent dermis.
B. Squamous cell carcinoma – Incorrect. Squamous cell carcinomas are keratinocyte carcinomas that typically present as tender, painful lesions on sun-exposed sites that may ulcerate. Typical histological features include conspicuous keratinisation with nests of squamous epithelial cells extending into the dermis.
C. Pilomatrical carcinoma – Correct. Pilomatrical carcinomas are rare, locally aggressive adnexal tumors arising in the hair follicle matrix. They usually present in males in the sixth or seventh decades of life on the head and neck. The most common clinical presentation is a solitary non-tender firm dermal swelling. Diagnosis is based on histological examination; basaloid cells with atypia and a raised mitotic index with or without ghost cells are the commonest pathological finding.
D. Basal cell carcinoma – Incorrect. Although basal cell carcinomas can also present as skin colored nodules on the head and neck, they are typically slow growing with clinically distinct features on both gross examination and dermoscopy.
E. Pilomatrixoma – Incorrect. Differentiating between benign and malignant pilomatrixomas remains challenging in clinical practice. Pilomatrixomas also present as skin colored, red or white lesions on the head and neck, however they typically remain stable for years or grow slowly in size. Immunohistochemistry is also not able to reliably distinguish between benign and malignant pilomatrical (hair follicle) tumors.

### Mucosal ulcers, extremity nodules, and fevers [^a63de1c1]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Sweet syndrome
B. Behçet's disease
C. Primary EBV infection
D. Erythema multiforme
E. Primary Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection

Answers:
A. Sweet syndrome – Incorrect. Sweet syndrome presents with neutrophilia, fevers, and typically edematous plaques or vesiculobullous lesions. Histology would show a dense neutrophilic infiltrate and papillary dermal edema without evidence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis.
B. Behçet's disease – Correct. The oral and genital ulcers, neutrophilic vasculitis on histology of erythema nodosum-like skin lesions, as well as ocular, neurologic, gastrointestinal, and joint symptoms with an otherwise unremarkable infectious and inflammatory workup led to a diagnosis of Beçhet's disease.
C. Primary EBV infection – Incorrect. EBV infection may have been both an inciting trigger for Behçet's disease and the cause of her initial presentation consistent with infectious mononucleosis. Associations between EBV infection and Behçet's disease have been well demonstrated. While EBV itself can have dermatologic manifestations, EBV alone was improbable, particularly given evidence of neutrophilic vasculitis on biopsy and subsequent EBV viral load and IgM testing were negative.
D. Erythema multiforme – Incorrect. The rash associated with erythema multiforme typically consists of targetoid plaques on the distal extremities. Skin biopsy findings here are also not compatible with erythema multiforme, which would show a vacuolar interface dermatitis with a lymphocytic infiltrate, rather than a neutrophilic vasculitis as pictured.
E. Primary HSV infection – Incorrect. Erythema-nodosum like skin lesions would be highly unusual for primary HSV infection. HSV serologies and PCR were obtained and negative.

### A female with subcutaneous nodules and livedo racemosa [^f7703f6a]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Sneddon syndrome
B. Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa (c-PAN)
C. Erythema nodosum
D. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
E. Erythema induratum

Answers:
A. Sneddon syndrome — Incorrect. Sneddon syndrome may present with livedo racemosa, although typically widespread, as well as hypertension and central nervous system disease. Subcutaneous nodules are not a characteristic feature. A biopsy may show endothelial inflammation, myointimal hyperplasia, and occlusion of the arterioles. It is often caused by antiphospholipid antibodies in adults and adenosine deaminase 2 deficiency in children. Testing for an adults and adenosine deaminase 2 gene mutation in this patient yielded negative results.
B. c-PAN — Correct. Tender subcutaneous nodules, livedo racemosa, and the biopsy demonstrating the necrotic blood vessel at the deeper, dermal-subcutaneous junction suggest medium-vessel vasculitis. The perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate and concentric layers of fibrosis signify that the lesion is more than 48 hours old and in the reparative stage. Fatigue, weight loss, fever, arthralgias, and neuropathy can be present in both c-PAN and systemic polyarteritis nodosa; however, c-PAN lacks multiorgan-system involvement, including hypertension, abdominal pain, renal failure, as well as hematuria and microaneurysms upon laboratory studies and imaging, respectively.
C. Erythema nodosum — Incorrect. A biopsy of erythema nodosum reveals septal panniculitis with radial (Miescher) granulomas without vasculitis. Livedo racemosa suggests a vascular etiology.
D. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis — Incorrect. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis may present with subcutaneous nodules and livedo racemosa; however, the absence of upper respiratory tract, pulmonary, and renal involvement makes this diagnosis unlikely.
E. Erythema induratum — Incorrect. Erythema induratum presents with tender nodules, often on the calves; livedo racemosa is not a characteristic feature. Histology shows septal panniculitis and vasculitis in the connective tissue septa and venules of fat lobules.

### Red rashes of the vulva [^0e428b97]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Red patches and plaques of the vulva may be manifestations of neoplasms, infections, or inflammatory skin diseases. These diseases can mimic one another clinically; features that generally allow the diseases to be identified on most cutaneous surfaces can be altered in the moist, occluded vulvar environment, making clinical diagnosis difficult. A detailed history and thorough physical examination can point to the likely diagnosis, but biopsy and culture may be needed for diagnosis especially in refractory disease. It is not uncommon for several of these processes to be present concomitantly or complicating other vulvar diseases.

### Fever and indurated subcutaneous plaques [^c493b714]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Lupus profundus
B. Subcutaneous panniculitislike T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL)
C. Erythema nodosum
D. Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)
E. Erythema induratum
Answers:
A. Lupus profundus – Incorrect. Lupus profundus is more common in women and presents as subcutaneous nodules on arms, shoulders, buttocks, and face. It occurs in 2% to 5% of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. Conversely, 10% to 15% of patients with lupus panniculitis have SLE. Histopathology findings show lobular lymphocytic panniculitis with epidermal and dermal changes of lupus, such as thickened basement membrane, interface changes, and superficial and deep, perivascular, periadnexal, lymphocytic inflammation with increased dermal mucin. In less than half of the cases, biopsy findings show lobular lymphocytic panniculitis without epidermal and dermal lupus changes. There are increased plasma cells and B-cell aggregates, and are less likely to have Ki-67/MIB-1–positive T cells or monoclonal TCR gene rearrangement compared with SPTCL.
B. SPTCL – Correct. The infiltration of fat lobules by large lymphocytes with hyperchromatic irregular nuclei rimming the adipocytes with fat necrosis is consistent with a diagnosis of SPTCL. The World Health Organization criteria classify SPTCL to cases expressing αβ T-cell receptor, commonly CD8 +, with solely subcutis involvement, which often runs an indolent course. Primary cutaneous γδ T-cell lymphoma is commonly CD4 −, CD8 -, CD56 +, with infiltration into epidermis and dermis and portends a poor prognosis. Approximately 19% of SPTCL patients also have autoimmune disorders including SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjögren disease.
C. Erythema nodosum – Incorrect. There are tender erythematous subcutaneous nodules on the lower legs.
D. PAN – Incorrect. Livedo reticularis, Raynaud phenomenon, subcutaneous nodules, and ulceration often occur on legs.
E. Erythema induratum – Incorrect. It presents with tender nodules on calves, which may ulcerate, with septal and lobular granulomatous panniculitis and neutrophilic vasculitis on histology.

### A suspicious skin nodule with dilated chest veins: the importance of a full skin examination [^22f31db3]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

This letter outlines the case of a new-onset skin nodule, which led to the diagnosis of both a primary bronchial carcinoma and a cutaneous metastatic squamous cell carcinoma deposit. This case highlights the importance of a full skin examination to pick up important clinical signs as, although these can be subtle, they can have a significant effect on further management.

### Erythema nodosum: a practical approach and diagnostic algorithm [^86660303]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Erythema nodosum is the most common form of panniculitis and is characterized by tender erythematous nodules mainly in the lower limbs on the pretibial area. The exact cause of erythema nodosum is unknown, although it appears to be a hypersensitivity response to a variety of antigenic stimuli. Although the etiology is mostly idiopathic, ruling out an underlying disease is imperative before diagnosing primary erythema nodosum. Erythema nodosum can be the first sign of a systemic disease that is triggered by a large group of processes, such as infections, inflammatory diseases, neoplasia, and/or drugs. The most common identifiable causes are streptococcal infections, primary tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, Behçet disease, inflammatory bowel disease, drugs, and pregnancy. We propose a diagnostic algorithm to optimize the initial work-up, hence initiating prompt and accurate management of the underlying disease. The algorithm includes an initial assessment of core symptoms, diagnostic work-up, differential diagnosis, and recommended therapies. Several treatment options for the erythema nodosum lesions have been previously reported; nevertheless, these options treat the symptoms, but not the triggering cause. Making an accurate diagnosis will allow the physician to treat the underlying cause and determine an optimal therapeutic strategy.

### Denying the truth does not change the facts: a systematic analysis of pseudoscientific denial of complex regional pain syndrome [^7d9d2712]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Putting the Pieces Together

In summary, extensive literature using a variety of research methods indicates that a set of mechanisms reflecting autonomic, brain plasticity, inflammatory, immune, and genetic/epigenetic factors, is consistently associated with a diagnosis of CRPS. If CRPS pain and symptoms were purely the result of being given a label, or represented broad nonspecific complaints or underlying psychosocial issues, there would be no reason for the studies summarized above to show consistent patterns of association with a CRPS diagnosis compared to a non-CRPS pain diagnosis, to show unilateral clinical and biochemical changes, or for these changes to reverse in some cases with CRPS-focused treatment. Critics argue that seemingly very divergent clinical presentations, such as a warm/red limb versus a cold/blue limb, imply opposite mechanisms and therefore different pain conditions. However, as substantiated above, enhanced inflammation and altered autonomic function provide mechanisms that could explain both abnormally warm and cold skin. Results of a large prospective clinical study of CRPS, including both acute CRPS and chronic CRPS patients, demonstrated that the characteristic warm CRPS presentation evident in acute CRPS often changes over time within individuals to the cold CRPS presentation more common in chronic CRPS. Furthermore, it has been shown that signs and symptoms of CRPS are dynamic, ie, can change at different time points dependent, for example, on surrounding temperature, and that different clinical phenotypes of CRPS exist.

Other prospective work suggests that elevations in inflammatory mediators (cytokines and peptides), which can contribute to edema as well as skin redness, are present in acute CRPS patients but generally normalize within the first 18 months post-onset. Evidence that the presentation and mechanisms of CRPS can change over time within individuals argues for a single syndrome that evolves in character over time rather than these differing CRPS presentations reflecting two different, unrelated syndromes. Findings such as these are more consistent with clinical patient subtypes within the CRPS diagnostic label rather than distinct conditions.

### Unilateral reticulated patch localized to the anterior thigh [^7393d4ed]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 76-year-old white man presented with a 2-month history of an asymptomatic, hyperpigmented, telangiectatic, reticulated patch localized to the left anterior thigh (Fig 1). He denied a history of similar skin changes. He also denied recent changes in medications, trauma to the involved area, or other notable exposures. He reported use of a laptop computer for up to 10 hours per day (Fig 2). Diagnosis was made based on clinical appearance. No biopsy was performed.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Livedo reticularis
B. Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa
C. Erythema ab igne
D. Reticular erythematous mucinosis
E. Retiform parapsoriasis

Answers:
A. Livedo reticularis – Incorrect. Livedo reticularis is characterized by reddish-blue to hyperpigmented patches in a netlike vascular pattern. It is associated with a physiologic vasospastic response to cold. The affected area is more generalized than this patient's single lesion and is typically present symmetrically and bilaterally.
B. Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa – Incorrect. Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa, a necrotizing vasculitis affecting the arteries within the dermis and subcutaneous fat, may present with reticulated lesions. It is typically characterized by tender subcutaneous nodules and ulcerations. These were absent in this patient.
C. Erythema ab igne – Correct. Erythema ab igne is caused by long-term exposure to heat below the threshold for thermal burn. The precise mechanism of lesion formation is unknown, but the pigmentary pattern corresponds with the dermal venous plexus. Histologic features include dilation of dermal blood vessels, pigment deposition of melanin and hemosiderin, and epidermal atrophy with possible squamous atypia. This patient's exposure to heat came from use of his laptop computer that had a left-sided fan, expelling hot air onto his left anterior thigh.
D. Reticular erythematous mucinosis – Incorrect. Typically lesions of reticular erythematous mucinosis are papules or plaques and are localized to the back or chest. The lesions are photosensitive, and histopathology findings show dermal deposits of mucin and a perivascular T-cell infiltrate.
E. Retiform parapsoriasis – Incorrect. Retiform parapsoriasis is a variant of large plaque parapsoriasis that is caused by superficial cutaneous lymphoid infiltrates composed of CD4 T cells. Typically, these lesions are plaques present at multiple locations.

### Infiltrative and sclerotic right chest wall plaque [^aba64c5f]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What underlying primary malignancy is most commonly associated with this condition?

A. Breast
B. Lung
C. Liver
D. Acute Myelogenous Leukemia
E. Kidney

Answers:
A. Breast – Correct. CeC is most commonly associated with an underlying primary breast cancer. CeC can be the presenting sign or a sign of disease recurrence.
B. Lung – Incorrect. Though lung cancer is another common malignancy associated with CeC, it is not the most commonly associated primary cancer.
C. Liver – Incorrect. Although liver cancer does cause cutaneous changes, it is much more associated with findings such as jaundice, spider angiomas, and rarely, pityriasis rotunda.
D. Acute Myelogenous Leukemia – Incorrect. Although acute myelogenous leukemia is often associated with cutaneous findings such as leukemia cutis and acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet Syndrome) among others, it has not been associated with CeC. Leukemia cutis has a varied presentation but should be considered in patients with pink-red-violaceous indurated plaques or nodules. Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis most often manifests as well-circumscribed tender red plaques or nodules, and though it does have rare necrotizing subtypes, the histopathology does not demonstrate the expected diffuse neutrophilic infiltrate.
E. Kidney – Incorrect. Skin metastases of renal cell carcinoma are typically skin-color to red, vascular, nodular, rapidly growing lesions often seen on the scalp (but can be appreciated elsewhere).

### Multiple nodules on the bilateral aspect of the upper extremities [^3723f114]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Rheumatoid nodules – Incorrect. Although the nodule distribution and clinical findings in this patient are similar to those of rheumatoid nodules, rheumatoid nodules are associated with rheumatoid arthritis. This patient had no history of arthralgias or joint stiffness; therefore, he is less likely to have rheumatoid arthritis.
B. Erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) – Correct. EED is a type of chronic leukocytoclastic vasculitis that presents most frequently with bilateral, symmetric, periarticular nodules on the dorsal aspect of the upper extremities. Although its etiology is unclear, it has been shown to be associated with malignancies, infections (HIV and hepatitis), and autoimmune connective tissue diseases.
C. Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis – Incorrect. This condition is associated with destructive arthropathy, which would have been evident by this point in this patient's lengthy course. The lesions tend to be skin-colored, pink, red-brown, or yellow and range up to 2 cm in diameter on the head, hands, ears, and joints. Small coalescing papules can create a "coral bead" appearance in the periungual region. The chronicity of this patient's disease and the lack of destructive arthropathy make this diagnosis unlikely.
D. Tuberous xanthomas – Incorrect. Tuberous xanthomas are skin-colored papules and nodules that favor the elbows and knees and develop in association with disorders of lipid metabolism. Their diagnosis can be made clinically, but additional testing is definitive. Tuberous xanthomas are usually painless, unlike the painful nodules in this case.
E. Enchondromas – Incorrect. Enchondromas are benign cartilage-producing tumors that develop in long bones, particularly those of the hand. Multiple enchondromas are associated with Maffucci syndrome and Ollier disease, which present most commonly in childhood or adolescence, unlike the presentation in adulthood seen in this case.

### Purpuric eruption of the breasts, abdomen, thighs, and buttocks [^4e6074c5]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What cutaneous diagnosis is most likely?
A. Angiosarcoma
B. Kaposi's sarcoma
C. Reactive angioendotheliomatosis (RAE)
D. Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)
E. Calciphylaxis

Answers:
A. Angiosarcoma – Incorrect. Angiosarcoma is more typically seen in older adults, and would most commonly appear as indurated purpuric or bruise-like lesions on the face and scalp.
B. Kaposi's sarcoma – Incorrect. Kaposi sarcoma would typically present with slowly enlarging vascular patches or plaques with more defined demarcation than this case.
C. RAE – Correct. RAE is a rare, benign entity characterized by proliferation of endothelial cells within vascular lumina. It is often seen in patients with coexistent systemic disease, such as autoimmune disease (as in our patient, who met criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus), chronic infection, lymphoproliferative disorder, cryoproteinemia, severe atherosclerotic disease, or valvular heart disease.RAE may present with erythematous to violaceous patches, plaques, or nodules, with or without a livedoid pattern, necrosis, blisters, or ulceration. The presence of superimposed focal purpura, petechiae, or ecchymoses may serve as a clinical clue.
D. PAN – Incorrect. The clinical features of cutaneous PAN can be similar to RAE, commonly presenting with lower extremity subcutaneous nodules, livedoid changes, and occasionally ulceration.
E. Calciphylaxis – Incorrect. Retiform purpura and marked pain would be more classic for a diagnosis of calciphylaxis. The lesions of calciphylaxis are most commonly noted on the lower legs, though a large portion of patients can also exhibit involvement on central, adipose-rich areas of the body; acral and genital lesions are also possible.

### Subcutaneous nodules accompanied by joint pain and erythema [^8ed239fc]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the diagnosis?
A. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency
B. Erythema nodosum
C. Pancreatitis, panniculitis, and polyarthritis syndrome (PPPS)
D. Polyarteritis nodosa
E. Sarcoidosis

Answers:
A. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency – Incorrect. Although the histology of the subcutaneous nodules of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency displays lobular panniculitis with neutrophilic infiltrate, ghost cells would not be observed.
B. Erythema nodosum – Incorrect. Although the subcutaneous nodules of erythema nodosum are classically involving the lower extremities such as this patient, they are typically tender, and biopsy should demonstrate septal panniculitis instead of lobular panniculitis with ghost cells.
C. PPPS – Correct. This diagnosis accurately reflects the expected histologic findings of pancreatic panniculitis while also taking into account the extensive articular involvement and imaging suggestive of developing bone infarcts.
D. Polyarteritis nodosa – Incorrect. Although polyarteritis nodosa can present with lower extremity subcutaneous nodules and arthralgias, the markedly elevated lipase levels and presence of ghost cells on histology do not support this diagnosis.
E. Sarcoidosis – Incorrect. Although sarcoidosis can present with arthralgias and lower extremity subcutaneous nodules resembling this case, the biopsy findings would likely demonstrate septal panniculitis. Moreover, the elevated lipase levels are not explained by a diagnosis of sarcoidosis.

### Cutaneous manifestations of monoclonal gammopathy [^ecf2ea9c]. Blood Cancer Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Plasmacytoma

Plasmacytoma is defined as a neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells and can involve skin. Skin plasmacytoma may be characterized by one or more skin lesions and can be associated with monoclonal gammopathy. This can take three different forms: (1) in association with multiple myeloma, (2) without association with multiple myeloma, and (3) direct extension from an underlying bone lesion. WM, heavy-light chain disease can develop skin plasmacytoma. IgD multiple myeloma would also present an increased risk for skin plasmacytoma in comparison with other isotypes.

Patients with skin plasmacytoma usually present with red, violaceous, non-tender nodules and occasionally with diffuse erythematous rash (Fig. 4). An erythematous patch overlying a solitary bone plasmacytoma and associated with local adenopathy (AESOP syndrome) has also been described. Histopathological studies demonstrate clonal infiltration by plasma cells. Current treatment options include localized radiation therapy, local surgery, and systemic treatment according to the number of tumors and their characteristics, but typically would require systemic therapy when part of myeloma.

### Polyarthritis, neuropathy, and persistent violaceous plaques [^c0e5a6ab]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Cutaneous tuberculosis
B. Drug reaction
C. Erythema nodosum leprosum
D. Sweet syndrome
E. Tumid lupus erythematosus

Answer:
A. Cutaneous tuberculosis – Incorrect. There is clinical and histologic overlap of erythema nodosum leprosum with certain presentations of cutaneous tuberculosis (such as lupus vulgaris) and other infectious granulomatous diseases. However, the neural tropism of the acid-fast organisms — a highly characteristic feature of leprosy — and the prominent vasculitis make cutaneous tuberculosis less likely.
B. Drug-induced erythema nodosum – Incorrect. Drug reaction is a diagnosis of exclusion. Although hypersensitivity reactions to certain drugs can present with a clinical picture of erythema nodosum, the histopathologic features and the findings of organisms by Fite staining excludes a drug reaction.
C. Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) – Correct. Histopathology shows a superficial and deep perivascular, prominent perineural and interstitial infiltrate of lymphocytes, foamy histiocytes and plasma cells (Fig 1, B). Perivascular neutrophils, nuclear dust, and fibrin deposition are also present (Fig 1, C). Fite stain shows numerous acid-fast bacilli within histiocytes, within a nerve, and in endothelial cells (Fig 1, D). The diagnosis rendered was multibacillary leprosy with associated vasculitis, consistent with ENL. Subsequent polymerase chain reaction on the specimen was positive for Mycobacterium leprae.
D. Sweet syndrome – Incorrect. Sweet syndrome presents with tender, edematous, erythematous papules and nodules typically on the upper body. Prodromal fever and flu-like symptoms are common. An array of extracutaneous inflammatory manifestations can occur, especially of the joints and eyes. Microscopically, Sweet syndrome presents as a diffuse dermal neutrophilic infiltrate, which may extend into the subcutaneous fat, with papillary dermal edema and frequently an accompanying secondary leukocytoclastic vasculitis.
E. Tumid lupus erythematosus (TLE) – Incorrect. In TLE, patients usually present with erythematous patches and plaques of sun-exposed areas of the upper body, neck, and face. Microscopically, dense perivascular and periadnexal lymphocytic infiltrates are seen with sparing of the papillary dermis and epidermis, along with mucin deposits in the reticular dermis. The prominent mixed infiltrate (as opposed to lymphocytic), perineural tropism, and lack of dermal mucin deposition argue against TLE.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 9 refugees, immigrants, and migrants [^bdf72cdc]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Post‑travel febrile illness evaluation — repeat exams and key clinical clues are outlined. Repeat the exam at least daily if the diagnosis is not clear because new findings might appear that will help in the diagnostic process (e.g., skin lesions, a tender liver). Although most febrile illnesses in returned travelers are secondary to infections, other conditions, including pulmonary emboli and drug hypersensitivity reactions, also can be associated with fever. Fever as part of a clinical syndrome deserves further scrutiny because it could indicate a disease of public health concern for which infection containment and control measures are indicated. On the other hand, it is not uncommon to have no focal findings in infections such as malaria, typhoid fever, or dengue, so‑called undifferentiated (or systemic) febrile illnesses. Nevertheless, this distinction provides only a rough guide. For example, malaria may sometimes be accompanied by a variety of focal symptoms. Misdiagnosing a patient with gastroenteritis who actually has malaria with gastrointestinal symptoms could negatively impact the patient's outcome. Dermatologic presentations are among the most frequent conditions in returned travelers. Skin rashes may evolve rapidly, and the localizations and types of skin lesions (e.g., macules, nodules, papules, plaques, ulcers) can contribute to the diagnosis of systemic infections, such as arboviral infections, measles, spotted fever group rickettsioses, typhoid fever, acute schistosomiasis (Katayama fever), or acute HIV infection. Petechial or purpuric lesions may indicate meningococcal disease.

Question 3: Which of the following cutaneous manifestation of this disease would likely produce evidence of fungal dissemination on biopsy?
A. Erythema nodosum
B. Erythema multiforme
C. Sweet syndrome
D. Acute generalized exanthema
E. Solitary granulomatous plaque

Answers:
A. Erythema nodosum–Incorrect. Cutaneous manifestations of Coccidioidomycosis are categorized as reactive or organism specific. Erythema nodosum is considered the most frequent reactive manifestation.
B. Erythema multiforme–Incorrect. Erythema multiforme is characterized by target-like lesions and can include oral findings. It is also considered a reactive cutaneous finding and, as such, would not produce visible microorganisms on biopsy.
C. Sweet syndrome–Incorrect. Sweet syndrome is a very rare feature of Coccidioidomycosis. Biopsy would show abundant neutrophils but not microorganisms.
D. Acute generalized exanthema–Incorrect. Acute generalized exanthema, which can be mistaken for an allergic contact dermatitis, would not produce evidence of fungal dissemination on biopsy.
E. Solitary granulomatous plaques–Correct. Clinically, lesions as a result of dissemination are nonspecific and include ulcerated and verrucous plaques; solitary granulomatous plaques; and papular, nodular, or pustular lesions. The clinical differential diagnosis includes histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, Cryptococcus, and sarcoidosis.

Reactive cutaneous disorders

Erythema nodosum

Erythema nodosum (EN) is a reactive cutaneous process that is most frequently associated with infections, sarcoidosis, rheumatologic diseases, IBD, drugs, autoimmune diseases, pregnancy, and malignancies (lymphomas). In up to 60% of the cases, no underlying cause is found.

EN is the most common form of septal panniculitis and the most frequent skin manifestation associated with IBD. It has been associated with IBD in 11% of the cases, occurring more frequently in patients with UC than CD. EN is mainly seen in females, and in patients with colonic involvement and/or arthritis, typically associated with an exacerbation of the colitis (90%) but not with the severity or colonic extent, although it may even occur before the diagnosis of IBD.

EN is typically present as multiple, deep-red tender, painful nodules, distributed usually over the shins. The lesions do not show suppuration, ulceration or scarring, and they change to a yellowish color, similar to a deep bruise. Outbreaks appear suddenly and may be accompanied by general symptoms (Fig. 2).

Figure 2
Erythema nodosum. Multiple red, warm, and tender nodules, classically located on pretibial surface of lower extremity

EN usually regresses spontaneously after a few weeks of supportive treatment with compression stockings, leg elevation, and rest. It sometimes leaves a mild hyperpigmentation on the skin. When associated with IBD, EN is usually resolved with control of the IBD and often recurs with exacerbations of the bowel disease.

### Panniculitis with fever of unknown origin [^3dfda77c]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Background

The term fever of unknown origin (FUO) was first used by Petersdorf and Beeson at Yale University in the 1960s. They studied 100 patients with a body temperature above 38.3°C for over 3 weeks without diagnosis despite a week of hospital evaluation. Most panniculitides present similarly, with tender, erythematous subcutaneous nodules, typically where fatty tissue is prominent (eg, legs, thighs, buttocks and cheeks). Subtypes of panniculitis are linked to infections, trauma, cancer and inflammatory illnesses. Diagnosing panniculitis is challenging due to its rarity and similar clinical presentations. Diagnosis requires thorough clinical examination, considering patient risk factors, lesion distribution and related symptoms (eg, ulceration, sclerosis and atrophy). Histopathologic evaluation can aid diagnosis, but requires careful clinical correlation to avoid inaccuracies. The challenge increases with FUO, necessitating a comprehensive assessment. We describe a young child with panniculitis and recurring fevers, highlighting the diagnostic challenges and need for a multidisciplinary approach

### Atypical erythema nodosum triggered by COVID-19 infection [^91a3571e]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

EN is characterized by the clinical and histopathologic findings of acute onset of erythematous, painful, subcutaneous nodules on the anterior "pretibial" area of the lower extremities with a biopsy showing septal panniculitis.EN is a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction that can be idiopathic or associated with underlying autoimmune conditions or infectious etiology, most commonly reported following streptococcal infection. EN has also been associated with various viral infections such as Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis B and C, HIV, and herpes simplex virus. Workup includes a chest x-ray to exclude pulmonary infections such as tuberculosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and sarcoidosis; antistreptolysin O titers; and complete blood counts to rule out malignancy. Our patient presented with the classic characteristics of EN but also had significant involvement of the posterior aspects of her lower extremities, which is atypical. Given the time course of the presentation and lack of other identifiable causes, her EN was likely secondary to her COVID-19 viral infection; however, it may have also been idiopathic. Of the 3 other reported cases of EN secondary to COVID-19, 1 also describes an atypical distribution involving the arms, face, and lower portion of the back. In the documented cases of EN associated with COVID-19 infection, 1 patient reported symptoms of painful tender nodules developing as early as 72 hours after being diagnosed with COVID-19, whereas the other 2 cases experienced symptoms of the lower portion of the leg such as pain, tenderness, swelling, and redness 1 to 2 weeks after their respiratory symptoms started. The pathophysiology leading to typical and atypical presentations of EN in the setting of COVID-19 remains unclear. However, Ordieres-Ortega et alhave postulated that the development of EN in COVID-19 may be due to the dysregulated immune response caused by the virus, specifically including the case of elevated interleukin (IL) 1, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-7 in predisposed patients with polymorphisms of IL-1 and IL-6 promoter genes. Future studies are required to investigate this further. Although there are only 3 other known reports of EN triggered by COVID-19 infection, cutaneous manifestations are estimated to occur at a rate of 20.4% and include erythematous papular, vascular, vesicular, and urticarial eruptions. Other atypical skin presentations following COVID-19 infection include generalized pruritis, Sweet syndrome, Kawasaki disease-like presentation, polymorphic patterns, and in our case, atypical EN. Our understanding of cutaneous reactions following COVID-19 infection continues to expand, and this case emphasizes that COVID-19 infection should be included among the list of triggers for EN.

### Panniculitis with fever of unknown origin [^927296b5]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Patient's perspective

As a mother, watching my daughter struggle with her health has been incredibly challenging. From an early age, she faced numerous medical issues, which already made life complicated. The fevers were relentless, peaking unpredictably and making her feel miserable. Visiting multiple specialists, from dermatologists to rheumatologists, each contributing their expertise but leaving us with more questions than answers.

Treatment with prednisolone and methotrexate offered some relief, but managing the side effects and ensuring she stayed on track with her medications required constant vigilance. Regular follow-ups and tests became a part of our routine, and while we saw gradual improvements, the fear of relapse lingered. Despite these challenges, my daughter showed remarkable resilience, returning to her daily activities with a determination that inspired us all.

Through this journey, the importance of comprehensive, coordinated care became clear. However, the 2 year wait for whole genome sequencing has been a significant source of anxiety for our family. The uncertainty of what the results might reveal and the prolonged period without definitive answers weighs heavily on us every day. Through this journey, we have learnt that a simple fever should never be taken for granted. It can be a sign of something much more serious, and we urge other parents to seek thorough medical evaluation if their child experiences persistent unexplained fevers. Today, while she continues to face health challenges, the improvement in her symptoms and the ability to attend school and play bring immense relief and joy to our family.

Learning points

Persistent or unexplained fevers in paediatric patients should not be taken lightly as they can indicate a more serious underlying condition, with the hunt for a diagnosis taking us down to our molecular genomics
Early biopsy of nodular lesions is crucial in detecting potentially malignant or serious conditions, facilitating timely treatment.
Diagnosing conditions with overlapping and non-specific symptoms, such as recurrent fevers and skin nodules, requires a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach.
Continuous monitoring and regular follow-ups are critical for assessing treatment response and ensuring patient safety.

### Symmetric red-purple papules in the diaper region [^c4169950]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

A father brought his daughter, a 7-month-old healthy female, to the dermatology clinic with a chief complaint of bumps in her diaper area for 1 month. She was diagnosed with eczema and yeast in this area at a few months of life that were treated with topical nystatin and mupirocin. Her father denied the use of any topical steroids on the bumps.

Discussion: The physical examination revealed a well-appearing child with 4 discrete reddish-purplish round papules that were symmetrically distributed on the convexities of the buttocks, ranging from 0.5 cm to 1.0 cm on a background of erythematous thin papules (Fig 1). The rest of her cutaneous examination was normal.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Diaper candidiasis
B. Granuloma gluteale infantum
C. Juvenile xanthogranuloma
D. Langerhans cell histiocytosis
E. Leukemia cutis
A. Diaper candidiasis — Incorrect. Diaper candidiasis classically presents as erythematous plaques, commonly in the folds, with peripheral satellite lesions.
B. Granuloma gluteale infantum — Correct. The most likely diagnosis is granuloma gluteale infantum (GGI), which typically presents as asymptomatic, symmetric, red to purple, oval or round papules or nodules affecting the diaper area in infants.
C. Juvenile xanthogranuloma — Incorrect. Juvenile xanthogranuloma usually presents as a solitary or few discrete pink to yellow papules on the head and neck.
D. Langerhans cell histiocytosis — Incorrect. Langerhans cell histiocytosis typically presents with pink to yellow or skin-colored 1- to 2-mm eroded or hemorrhagic papules, pustules, or vesicles. Patients may also have a seborrheic dermatitis–like eruption involving the scalp and other flexural areas.
E. Leukemia cutis — Incorrect. Although leukemia cutis has a wide clinical presentation, the most characteristic skin findings are flesh-colored to red-brown papules, nodules, and plaques that may become purpuric. In addition, leukemia cutis typically presents concomitantly with or after a diagnosis of systemic leukemia and patients typically have other systemic symptoms.

### Nodular granulomatous phlebitis: an uncommon tuberculid [^d051c6e4]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Nodular granulomatous phlebitis is a tuberculid that should be considered in patients with tender subcutaneous nodules, granulomatous phlebitis on histology, and resolution of lesions when starting antituberculous therapy. The presence of a granulomatous vasculitis or phlebitis should prompt a thorough search for tuberculosis and exclude other causes of granulomatous vasculitis.

### Treatment of Sweet's syndrome in pregnancy [^6fcfd282]. Dermatologic Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Pregnancy-associated Sweet's syndrome is a rare occurrence (2%), with good prognosis, spontaneous resolution after delivery, and not increased infant morbidity and mortality. However, differential diagnosis is not easy for physician not familiar with skin lesions. Systemic involvement, even though unusual, might occur in nearly every organ of the body, including pericardium, myocardium, and placenta, as well as one report of early fetal miscarriage, questioning the possibility of risks underestimation. We present two further cases, one occurred in a 31-year-old woman at 26 weeks of gestation and the other on a 26-year-old woman at 24 weeks of gestation, primigravidae. Both presented with tender papules and nodules on their face and upper body parts. Laboratory examinations and skin biopsy histology were pathognomonic. Monitoring of general maternal and fetal conditions showed no signs of sufferance, but the decision to accelerate skin symptoms release, being time to delivery quite distant, challenge the treatment options. There are no recommended treatments for Sweet syndrome and the choice is very limited during pregnancy. A short course of oral steroids was very effective, with lesions healing in few days, no relapses or fetal complications. When pregnant patients exhibit fever, neutrophilia, arthralgia or myalgia, and tender erythematous plaques or nodules, Sweet syndrome should be considered. The trained dermatologist is in the leading position to address the differential diagnosis, reassure the patient, and avoid complications, even if they are rare.

In this report, we describe a case of tender, erythematous nodules that appeared acutely on the distal legs in a 48-year-old female with renal transplant following SARSs-CoV-2 infection complicated by prolonged fevers and pneumonia. The patient was diagnosed with a classic presentation of EN arising from a new and emerging trigger-COVID-19 infection. The cutaneous lesions resolved with conservative management.

Conclusions

This report highlights the importance of clinician awareness of the potential association of COVID-19 with a classic clinical presentation of EN and underscores that these cases can be managed with the same therapeutic repertoire as EN due to other aetiologies. Of note, use of systemic agents was not employed in this case, as our patient improved with conservative therapy alone.

### An unusual case of coccidioidomycosis presenting with skin lesions [^dda09345]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2008). Low credibility.

A 42-year-old white male without prior skin disease presented 8 months ago with chest pain, fever, and coughing to his primary physician. At that point, he had no skin lesions. The diagnosis was made by standard blood tests. The patient completed treatment and was symptom free for 8 months until he presented to his physician again with skin lesions on his right cheek and extremities. The patient was referred to our dermatology clinic for further evaluation. A complete skin examination revealed lesions on his face, extremities, and back. The lesions on his right face were 8 x 10-mm erythematous papules and nodules coalescing into a plaque. A biopsy was taken from his right cheek lesions.

### New practical aspects of sweet syndrome [^c328db5b]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Sweet syndrome (SS), or acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is an inflammatory, non-infectious skin reaction characterized clinically by tender, erythematous papules/plaques/pustules/nodules commonly appearing on the upper limbs, trunk, and head and neck; histologically, SS is characterized by dense neutrophilic infiltrate in the dermis. SS is accompanied by fever; an elevation of inflammatory markers (e.g., erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive protein) in serum may also be observed. Although most cases of SS are idiopathic, SS also occurs in the setting of malignancy or following administration of an associated drug. SS has also been reported in association with pregnancy and a burgeoning list of infectious (most commonly upper respiratory tract infections) and inflammatory diseases; likewise, the litany of possible iatrogenic triggers has also grown. Over the past several years, a wider spectrum of SS presentation has been realized, with several reports highlighting novel clinical and histological variants. Corticosteroids continue to be efficacious first-line therapy for the majority of patients with SS, although novel steroid-sparing agents have been recently added to the therapeutic armamentarium against refractory SS. New mechanisms of SS induction have also been recognized, although the precise etiology of SS still remains elusive. Here, we catalogue the various clinical and histological presentations of SS, summarize recently reported disease associations and iatrogenic triggers, and review treatment options. We also attempt to frame the findings of this review in the context of established and emerging paradigms of SS pathogenesis.

### Concurrent Sweet's syndrome and erythema nodosum [^dc34990d]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

A 29-year-old Mexican man was admitted to the hospital with fever, cough, sore throat, and red, tender leg nodules suggestive of erythema nodosum (Fig. 1). The white blood cell count was 35,000. Several days later, annular plaques and pustules developed on his face, neck, and forearms (Figs. 2 and 3). Facial skin biopsy showed neutrophilic dermatitis without evidence of infection or vasculitis consistent with Sweet's syndrome. Biopsy of the thigh was non-diagnostic, but showed a mixed neutrophilic and granulomatous dermatitis.

Figure 1
The patient's legs show red, tender nodules suggestive of erythema nodosum.

Figure 2
Annular plaques and pustules developed on the patient's face.

Figure 3
Annular plaques developed on the patient's hands.

Erythema nodosum (EN) is a form of panniculitis characterized by painful red nodules over the pretibial area. Sweet's syndrome (SS) is an acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by fever, leukocytosis, and erythematous plaques involving the arms, trunk, and neck. Vesiculopustules, nodules, and ulcers may also occur. Simultaneous occurrence of EN and SS has been increasingly reported, and both appear to be reactive dermatoses with overlapping clinical and histopathologic features. Although often idiopathic, both disorders have been associated with upper respiratory infections, medications, hematologic malignancies, and autoimmune disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease). Treatment includes corticosteroids, potassium iodide, or colchicine. SS generally responds well to therapy, but recurs in up to 25% of patients; 15% have a chronic relapsing course.

Extensive evaluation was unrevealing, including chest and abdominal imaging, bone marrow biopsy, endoscopy, and serologies for hepatitis, syphilis, recent Streptococcal infection, and rheumatologic disorders. He responded well to oral prednisone. The underlying cause was presumed to be an antecedent upper respiratory tract infection.

### Recurrent painful ecchymosis in an adolescent female [^78ae1595]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical vignette

A 16-year-old girl presented to clinic with a 2-month history of painful, waxing and waning unilateral erythematous ecchymotic patches on the right lower extremity (Fig 1). She was otherwise healthy and of normal affect, and she denied any history of trauma to the area. She also denied any psychiatric disturbance or history. Two punch biopsies were obtained that both showed a mild perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. Topical corticosteroids were of limited help, and the lesions spontaneously resolved within 1 week (Fig 2).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Psychogenic purpura (PP)
B. Urticarial vasculitis
C. Thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP)
D. Livedo reticularis
E. Livedo vasculopathy

Answers:
A. PP – Correct. PP, also known as Gardner-Diamond syndrome or autoerythrocyte sensitization, is a rare syndrome of recurrent painful spontaneous ecchymosis that can be associated with a prodromal phase of itch, pain, and warmth at the site of ecchymosis.
B. Urticarial vasculitis – Incorrect. Urticarial vasculitis is characterized by wheals lasting more than 24 hours accompanied with burning and pain. Wheals can resolve with hyperpigmentation or ecchymosis. However, lesions are typically bilateral and symmetrical.
C. TTP – Incorrect. TTP presents as a pentad of renal failure, fever, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neurologic symptoms. Petechial and purpuric lesions are common cutaneous manifestations.
D. Livedo reticularis – Incorrect. Livedo reticularis classically presents on the lower extremities as a violaceous-erythematous and reticulated pattern caused by slow venous flow. It commonly presents as a physiologic response to cold temperatures but can be secondarily caused by a luminal obstruction or systemic disease.
E. Livedo vasculopathy – Incorrect. Livedo vasculopathy is associated with hypercoagulability and presents as tender, punched out ulcers on a background of livedo reticularis on the lower extremities. Involved areas heal with stellate white atrophic scarring, telangiectasias, and hemosiderin deposition known as atrophie blanche.

### Primary cutaneous nasal-type NK / T-cell lymphoma presenting as purpuric nodules on the lower leg [^bc430a87]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The case discussed here is illustrative in its presentation and course. It highlights important clues to the diagnosis of nasal-type extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma that may be useful for clinicians who encounter similar cases.

First, this case illustrates important deviations from most cases of nasal-type extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, which is much more common in Asia and Central America, presents on the nose, and follows a rapidly progressive course with high mortality. In a retrospective study of nasal-type extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma on the nose, patients treated optimally with pegylated asparaginase, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin combined with radiotherapy demonstrated a 2-year progression-free survival and 2-year overall survival of 77.1% and 82.9%, respectively. In contrast, our patient is from the United States and presented with lesions on the leg. Non-nasal nasal-type extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma has been shown to portend a much worse prognosis, with a 5-year progression-free survival of 4.2% (vs 50.9% for nasal) and 5-year overall survival of 16% (vs 55.8% for nasal). Despite his poor prognosis, the patient presented here has responded very well to treatment after 1 year, but there is a potential for relapse.

Second, this case highlights the critical role of the primary care physician in identifying clues that the patient's lesions warranted immediate referral to dermatology. The seriousness of the diagnosis could have been easily overlooked on examination or mistaken as resulting from minor trauma while on warfarin therapy. Moreover, the differential diagnosis of his purpuric nodules included several other much more common entities, such as erythema nodosum, calciphylaxis, warfarin-induced skin necrosis, and other vasculitis/vasculopathy. However, the patient lacked a trauma history, risk factors for erythema nodosum, pain out of proportion on examination, or retiform purpura, which hinted at this more insidious diagnosis. In a large multicenter cohort study by Abramson et al, the dominant positive prognostic factors for peripheral T-cell lymphomas were earlier stage at diagnosis and initial response to treatment. Therefore, it was important that his primary care physician recognized this concerning presentation and referred him to dermatology, resulting in a diagnostic biopsy within just 2 days of the initial encounter.

### An infant who has dome-shaped papules [^0a4160d1]. Pediatrics in Review (2012). Low credibility.

JXG is a benign disorder of early childhood and primarily occurs in infants and children < 2 years of age. It is characterized by solitary or multiple yellow-red nodules on the skin and, rarely, in other organs. The clinical diagnosis of solitary cutaneous JXG usually requires confirmation by biopsy. Referral to a dermatologist should be obtained to exclude other disorders if multiple lesions are present. Clinicians should rule out ocular lesions with referral to an ophthalmologist if the patient is < 2 years of age and has multiple lesions of JXG. If ophthalmologic consultation reveals no ocular lesions, screening every 6 months for the first 2 years of life is advised.

### Rapidly growing bullous plaque on the hand [^831c78e4]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. SCC — Incorrect. SCC most commonly presents on sun-damaged skin as an erythematous hyperkeratotic papulonodule, but the clinical presentation can be variable. Histologically, SCC displays overlying parakeratosis, atypical keratinocytes invading the dermis.
B. Ecthyma contagiosum (orf) — Incorrect. The clinical history (cattle farmer) of this case does not match that of orf. Orf is caused by a different virus in the Poxviridae family of viruses than milker's nodules and is transmitted by direct contact with infected sheep and goats. Milker's nodules are associated with cattle, although the clinical and histologic presentation of the 2 viruses is identical. The collective term for these viruses is "farmyard pox".
C. Cutaneous anthrax — Incorrect. Transmission of anthrax from Bacillus anthracis is mainly through contact with infected animals (wild and domestic) or contaminated animal products (leather, wool, or meat). The skin lesions are typically located on the arms, face, and neck and consist of a nontender bulla or ulcer surrounded by erythema that develops into a necrotic plaque.
D. Herpetic whitlow — Incorrect. Herpetic whitlow is caused from an infection with herpes simplex virus on the digits. It presents as recurrent local erythema, edema, and tender grouped vesiculopustules progressing to erosions. The diagnosis can be made clinically but additional testing is definitive.
E. Milker's nodule — Correct. This zoonotic dermatosis is caused by a parapox virus transmitted from infected lesions on dairy cattle to humans via direct contact. It is most commonly observed in young people who have recently started milking cattle or in veterinary students. The infection in cattle is usually mild and characterized by papules in the muzzle area that can be difficult to see. This is more common than cowpox, which is caused by a member of Orthopoxvirus and is endemic in wild rodents. The lesions typically develop through different clinical stages similar to orf. At the inoculation site, a red-blue papule develops, which quickly progresses into a pustule or bullae with central umbilication and crusting. The lesion is typically tender and it is associated with mild fever and malaise.

### Rare case of Lyme borreliosis in a patient presenting with dactylitis and skin rash [^7fae376c]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Clinical symptoms in LB are not always specific, and LB can look like several diseases. It can cause multisystem disease, particularly affecting the skin, musculoskeletal system, nervous system and heart. Lyme arthritis is usually not painful and is not accompanied by fever. It has been shown that 84% of patients have monarthritis and that the knees are affected in up to 98%. ACA is reported in 1%–3% of LB cases in Europe. ACA and arthritis are late manifestations of LB and may present months to years after the infectious tick bite.

To our knowledge, this is the first case of LB describing asymmetrical dactylitis in a hand. Previously, a case report of LB dactylitis in a toe has been published by Levy et al. Also, diffuse hand and finger swelling has been reported as a striking feature of Lyme arthritis. Borrelia lymphocytoma cutis is a non-tender bluish-red nodule that may mimic dactylitis if it is located in one digit. However, it is typically found on the ear lobe, areola mammae or scrotum.

The diagnosis of LB may be challenging and the diagnosis of disseminated infection is often delayed several years because of the similarity of this entity to other diseases. One of the reasons is that the patients do not always recall a preceding tick bite and dermatological manifestations are not obligatory. Furthermore, once a patient has developed anti- B.b.s.l. antibodies, these can persist for years. B.b.s.l. -specific PCR has a reasonable sensitivity in Lyme arthritis, but with a higher sensitivity in synovial samples than on synovitis fluid (range 40%–96%) but a high specificity (100%). In our case, it was not possible to confirm the diagnosis from PCR of the skin biopsy as the biopsy had been fixated using formaldehyde, but this could have supported the diagnosis. Culture in skin and synovial tissue/fluid is time-consuming and costly and is not recommended in routine diagnostic testing. The diagnosis may further be validated by the histopathological pattern in LB, including varying degrees of superficial and deep perivascular and interstitial lymphocytic infiltrates mixed with plasma cells and eosinophile. Epidermal changes such as spongiosis are seen in some cases. However, the histological features of EM and ACA are not specific.

### Management of malignant cutaneous wounds in oncologic patients [^5acd020c]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A fungating malignant wound is a devastating complication of cancer. It occurs when tumor cells invade the skin and destroy surrounding tissues, infiltrating its supportive vasculature. Neoplastic wounds may result from the growth of a primary skin tumor, from a skin metastasis or from the invasion of the skin by tumors emerging from deeper levels. Local invasion may initially manifest as an inflammation with redness, induration, heat, and tenderness. Malignant wounds may present as either a crater-like ulcer (destructive process) or as raised nodules similar in appearance to a cauliflower (proliferating) or as a combination of both. This justifies the term "fungating", which is sometimes used to describe proliferating wounds. Malignant wounds are characterized by rapid growth and are often associated with malodor, exudate, edema, necrosis, pain, bleeding, pruritus, and infection. Edema, exudate, and necrosis arise from cellular perfusion alteration. Necrotic tissue is a perfect environment for bacterial growth leading to secondary infection. The bacteria that colonize the wound activate proteases that fragment the necrotic tissue, causing the dead tissue to liquefy and generate exudate. The bleeding is the result of an imbalance in hemostatic process. The rapid growth of a tumor can lead to the compression of contiguous structures, such as soft tissues and nerves, causing pain and mobility reduction.

The diagnosis of a malignant ulcer is already suspected on the basis of neoplastic history and clinical presentation, but definite diagnosis demands a skin biopsy and histopathological examination.

Malignant fungating wounds affect 5 to 10% of patients with cancer; they usually appear during the last 6 to 12 months of patient's life but they can be present for years. Wounds of neoplastic etiology can arise from any type of tumor and are more frequently located on the breast, followed by the neck, chest, extremities, genitals, head, and other sites.

Patients' care suffering from malignant fungating wounds requires collaboration of different healthcare specialties, ranging from oncology and palliative care to wound care units.

Comprehensive assessment is fundamental in complicated scenarios, such as malignant wounds. The latter may present with unique or atypical clinical presentation and they are always difficult to treat, resulting in dramatical impact on the patients' and their families' as well as caregivers' quality of life.

### Painful nodules on the lower legs [^9af74fbd]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency panniculitis – Incorrect. This is a manifestation of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which is an autosomal codominant condition that primarily affects the lungs and liver. Histologically, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency panniculitis is characterized by liquefactive necrosis of the dermis and subcutaneous septa, which is inconsistent with the histology in this case.
B. Lupus panniculitis – Incorrect. Lupus panniculitis is a form of chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Ten percent of lupus panniculitis patients have signs of systemic lupus erythematosus. The histology is incorrect for lupus panniculitis. Histologic findings of lupus panniculitis are characterized by hyaline necrosis and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates.
C. Pancreatic panniculitis – Correct. Pancreatic panniculitis is a rare cutaneous manifestation of pancreatic disease characterized by painful, erythematous, subcutaneous nodules that can ulcerate and produce an oily substance. In this case, the patient had imaging findings and labs consistent with acute pancreatitis.
D. Poststeroid panniculitis – Incorrect. This occurs within 10 days of rapid tapering or withdrawal of systemic corticosteroid therapy, neither of which the patient experienced.
E. Erythema nodosum – Incorrect. This is one of the most common forms of panniculitis, most often idiopathic in nature, but can also be caused by sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, drugs, and infectious etiologies, such as streptococcal infection. The histology is incorrect for erythema nodosum, which is characterized by septal panniculitis.

### Skin manifestations of intravascular lymphoma mimic inflammatory diseases of the skin [^d103e5f7]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Intravascular lymphoma (IVL) is fatal when it is diagnosed late in the course. Sometimes skin lesions enable early diagnosis, but criteria for diagnosis are not well established.

Objectives

To demonstrate the clinical spectrum of skin lesions of IVL and to correlate it with clinical outcome; to identify features differentiating between B-cell and T-cell IVL with skin involvement.

Methods

Review of 97 articles reporting on total of 224 patients with IVL.

Results

Skin lesions were mentioned in 90 of 224 patients. They were nodules and/or plaques (49%) or macules (22.5%) of red (31%) or blue to livid (19%) colour on the leg (35%), the thigh (41%) and the trunk (31%). Telangiectases were present in only 20% of the patients. Oedema (27.5%) of the legs and pain (24%) were often accompanying. No criteria enabled distinction between lesions restricted to the skin and skin lesions concurrent with IVL in other organs, but when the disease was restricted to the skin, the prognosis was favourable (10% vs. 85% fatal outcome). Skin lesions of T-cell IVL are indistinguishable from those of B-cell IVL.

Conclusions

Forty per cent of all patients with IVL have skin lesions, these being red, sometimes painful plaques located typically on the lower extremities, accompanied by oedema. A clinician risks misinterpreting these changes as thrombophlebitis, erythema nodosum or erysipelas. Neither clinical course nor differentiation of the lymphoma can be predicted from the morphology of skin lesions, but involvement of other organs at the time of diagnosis indicates a poor prognosis.

### Pancreatic cancer presenting as a sister mary joseph's nodule [^ee7f2efe]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 69-year-old man presented with a painful umbilical nodule of 1 month duration. On examination the nodule was blackish in colour with a serous discharging fluid and was 2×2 cm in size, tender and fixed to the skin. There were no scars or sinuses at the umbilicus and no palpable mass or organomegaly on systemic examination. The patient underwent wide local excision of the skin nodule and on histopathology was reported as metastatic adenocarcinoma of the skin. A CT of the abdomen was performed to look for the primary site, which showed a 5×4 cm lesion in the tail of the pancreas. A biopsy from the pancreatic lesion was taken which was reported as an adenocarcinoma. CA19-9 was more than 1000 U/mL. The patient was advised palliative chemotherapy with gemcitabine. He was unwilling to take any further treatment in view of the advanced nature of the disease.

Case presentation

A 44-year-old woman, with a known case of hypertension and hypothyroidism (on amlodipine 5 mg daily and thryoxine replacement therapy), presented with fever, multiple joint pains and skin rash for 1-month duration. Joint pains were bilateral, symmetrical, inflammatory type mainly involving large joints (ankle, knee, elbow and wrist) with no history of morning stiffness, recurrent mouth ulcers, photophobia and Raynaud's phenomenon. On general physical examination, she had fever (101°F) and tachycardia (126 beats/min) with no significant peripheral lymphadenopathy. She had multiple tender erythematous nodules on bilateral shins and forearms, suggestive of erythema nodosum (figure 1). On musculoskeletal examination, bilateral ankle and knee joints were swollen with erythematous overlying skin and tenderness (figure 2), suggestive of acute arthritis. Both passive and active movements were restricted in the affected joints. Examination of her chest, cardiovascular system and abdomen was unremarkable.

### Metastatic spread of serous ovarian carcinoma to the bilateral breasts: a rare presentation [^72ea1236]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Many different aetiologies make up the differential diagnosis for this unusual case. The most common causes for breast redness include infection, malignancy, trauma, dermatological conditions and venous hypertension with infections and mastitis being the most common. Our initial diagnosis for our patient was a primary breast cancer or a metastatic cancer which had spread to the breast. A PET scan revealed activity in the right breast and a skin biopsy consisted with metastatic ovarian cancer. Other diagnoses including infection were dismissed after the breast biopsy revealed cancer and the right breast did not seem infected. Several small skin nodules were noted, which were more consisted with a recurrent cancer. If the biopsies had been negative, though, cellulitis would have been number one on the differential diagnosis. Finally, the patient denied any recent trauma to the breast, which could account for the skin redness or any history of eczema or a skin allergic reaction. An allergic reaction could have been treated with steroid creams or oral medication. Finally, the patient denied any history of venous hypertension. A recent CT scan revealed no evidence of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or superior vena cava syndrome and the patient did not have a right arm shunt for dialysis. Again, secondary to the positive skin biopsy, this diagnosis of venous hypertension was placed lower on the differential.

### T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma / leukemia presenting as a diffuse viral exanthem-like reaction: a clinical and histopathological challenge [^9eeaa255]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous involvement by leukemia, or leukemia cutis, is a rare manifestation of leukemic disorders, most frequently occurring in children. The skin findings, which usually include multiple violaceous or erythematous nodules on the face, most often follow the classic presenting signs and symptoms of leukemia and occur in patients with an established primary diagnosis. Patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and associated leukemia cutis typically present with a solitary firm red to bluish nodule, often with an accompanying mediastinal mass, that can produce respiratory symptoms. In this article, we report a case of a patient with primary T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma presenting with a diffuse exanthem mimicking a viral illness with an associated SET-NUP214 translocation.

### Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma-leg type masquerading as venous eczema [^a331d04f]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma-leg type (PCDLBCL-LT), is a rare high-grade form of primary cutaneous lymphoma. It often presents as red to violaceous nodules or plaques on lower limbs. We report a case of PCDLBCL-LT presenting initially as cellulitis. The skin changes did not respond to oral and intravenous antibiotics and management for venous eczema was subsequently commenced. The patient then developed 2 large deep subcutaneous masses and core biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of a mature high-grade B-cell lymphoma. Review of the patient's history revealed a prior diagnosis of high-grade B-cell lymphoma 22 years previously. This case demonstrates that PCDLBCL-LT can present with clinical signs in keeping with a diagnosis of cellulitis or venous eczema. In the context of progressive nodular skin changes biopsy should always be considered, particularly when the patient has a prior history of a hematologic malignancy.

Benign breast disorders — inflammatory breast cancer suspicion and skin findings: When inflammatory breast cancer is considered in the differential diagnosis, diagnostic mammography and ultrasonography are appropriate first steps, and a punch biopsy of the breast skin should be performed when skin findings suggestive of malignancy are present and not responsive to antibiotic therapy. Skin findings of thickening, edema, peau d'orange appearance, unexplained and persistent erythema, nipple excoriations, and skin ulceration warrant further evaluation to rule out inflammatory breast cancer and other types of breast cancer.

### Exophytic growth on nasal ala [^f234ee9a]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Basal cell carcinoma – Incorrect. Though the tumor is shiny in appearance with telangiectasias, basal cell carcinoma typically presents as a pearly papule or nodule with a smooth surface and raised peripheral borders. Histology would show basaloid nests with characteristic peripheral palisading, cleft formation around nests, and mucinous stroma.
B. Cylindroma – Correct. Though patients typically present with pink-to-red rubbery nodules, cylindroma remains the best diagnosis, given the solitary facial tumor with histology demonstrating basaloid islands within the dermis and subcutis in a pattern mirroring a jigsaw puzzle.
C. Adenoid cystic carcinoma – Incorrect. This is a slow-growing neoplasm that rarely presents in the skin as a tender subcutaneous nodule. While basaloid cells are present on histology, characteristic tubular and cribriform structures are missing in this case.
D. Spiradenoma – Incorrect. While the patient presented with a solitary benign adnexal tumor on her head, spiradenomas are composed histologically of well-circumscribed nodules composed of basaloid cells with admixed lymphocytes and hyaline deposits. It is not uncommon to observe overlapping histologic features of spiradenoma and cylindroma in a tumor, which is sometimes termed spiradenocylindroma. However, no features of spiradenoma are seen in this tumor.
E. Trichoepithelioma – Incorrect. While solitary trichoepitheliomas occur on the face, especially around the nose, they typically present as skin-colored nodules or papules. Histologic examination would reveal a basaloid tumor of follicular differentiation, composed of nests and cords of basaloid cells with peripheral palisading. The tumor typically shows a fibrotic cellular stroma, and scattered papillary mesenchymal bodies may be found.

### Fever and rash [^ee7d974c]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Infectious causes of fever and rash pose a diagnostic challenge for the emergency provider. It is often difficult to discern rashes associated with rapidly progressive and life-threatening infections from benign exanthems, which comprise the majority of rashes seen in the emergency department. Physicians must also consider serious noninfectious causes of fever and rash. A correct diagnosis depends on an exhaustive history and head-to-toe skin examination as most emergent causes of fever and rash remain clinical diagnoses. A provisional diagnosis and immediate treatment with antimicrobials and supportive care are usually required prior to the return of confirmatory laboratory testing.

### Long-term telangiectatic nodule in left shoulder [^f1ef78d3]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

A 70-year-old healthy male presented with a 12-year history of a painful cutaneous vascular lesion on his left shoulder. It had begun as a slowly growing, small, erythematous macula covered by telangiectasias. The pain was triggered by pressure or palpation on the shoulder. Neither cold intolerance nor paroxysmal pain was reported. The patient noticed that symptoms had been increasing in severity over the past two years. Physical examination found a single, well-demarcated, purplish-red dermal nodule, which was 12 mm in diameter. Additionally, it showed multiple, radiating, non-blanching telangiectasias (Fig 1). The lesion was extremely painful on palpation, and restricted shoulder abduction was observed. Complete blood count, coagulation tests, and comprehensive metabolic panel results were within normal ranges. Preoperative imaging studies were not requested. The nodule was completely removed using a 7-mm surgical margin. Only hematoxylin-eosin–staining was carried out (Fig 2). There was no recurrence of the skin lesion in the first year.

### Erythema nodosum: a sign of systemic disease [^40bec6ec]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum, a painful disorder of the subcutaneous fat, is the most common type of panniculitis. Generally, it is idiopathic, although the most common identifiable cause is streptococcal pharyngitis. Erythema nodosum may be the first sign of a systemic disease such as tuberculosis, bacterial or deep fungal infection, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, or cancer. Certain drugs, including oral contraceptives and some antibiotics, also may be etiologic. The hallmark of erythema nodosum is tender, erythematous, subcutaneous nodules that typically are located symmetrically on the anterior surface of the lower extremities. Erythema nodosum does not ulcerate and usually resolves without atrophy or scarring. Most direct and indirect evidence supports the involvement of a type IV delayed hypersensitivity response to numerous antigens. A deep incisional or excisional biopsy specimen should be obtained for adequate visualization. Erythema nodosum represents an inflammatory process involving the septa between subcutaneous fat lobules, with an absence of vasculitis and the presence of radial granulomas. Diagnostic evaluation after comprehensive history and physical examination includes complete blood count with differential; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, or both; testing for streptococcal infection (i.e., throat culture, rapid antigen test, antistreptoly-sin-O titer, and polymerase chain reaction assay); and biopsy. Patients should be stratified by risk for tuberculosis. Further evaluation (e.g., purified protein derivative test, chest radiography, stool cultures) varies based on the individual. Erythema nodosum tends to be self-limited. Any underlying disorders should be treated and supportive care provided. Pain can be managed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

### CD30Lymphoproliferative disorders of the skin [^eddafe42]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Primary cutaneous CD30 + lymphoproliferative disorders encompass lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP), primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL), and indeterminate cases. LyP is a benign disorder characterized by recurrent crops of red or violaceous papulonodules. Patients with LyP are at an increased risk of a secondary malignancy. pcALCL is characterized by a solitary red to violaceous nodule or tumor larger than 20 mm. LyP is benign, is limited to the skin, and self-resolves, with a 5-year survival rate of 100%; pcALCL is limited to the skin and responsive to directed therapies, with a 5-year survival rate of over 95%. Aggressive chemotherapeutic regimens should be avoided.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: diagnostic criteria, subtypes, systemic associations, and workup [^acf2c8eb]. Dermatologic Clinics (2024). Medium credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is an inflammatory neutrophilic dermatosis with variable clinical features. The classic presentation is an ulceration with an erythematous to violaceous undermined border. Extracutaneous manifestations may occur. Associated systemic diseases include inflammatory bowel disease, inflammatory arthritides, and hematologic disorders. The pathophysiologic mechanism of disease is not completely known but likely related to the cumulative impact of inflammation, immune-mediated neutrophilic dysfunction, and genetic predisposition. Incidence is between 3 and 10 people per million but may be greater due to under recognition. In this article, we will discuss the diagnostic criteria, disease subtypes, systemic associations, and workup.

### Pancreatic panniculitis: the "bright" side of the moon in solid cancer patients [^c18e5f5d]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pancreatic panniculitis is a rare complication of pancreas disorders occurring in 0.3–3% of patients, most often accompanied by the pancreatic acinar carcinoma. It presents multiple, painful, deep, ill-defined, red-brown, migratory nodules and plaques of hard elastic consistency; often ulcerated and typically located on the lower proximal and distal extremities. The pathogenesis is not fully understood, but it is thought to result from lipolysis and fat necrosis with secondary tissue inflammation induced by pancreatic enzymes. Histopathology shows subcutaneous lobular fat necrosis with anuclear adipocytes (called ghost cells) surrounded by a mixed inflammatory infiltrate. Focal calcification may also be seen. The treatment is directed to the underlying disorder, which may result in regression of skin lesions.

Case Presentation

We present two cases of pancreatic panniculitis with similar clinical, laboratory, and histopathological features associated with different internal malignancy. The first case, after extensive investigations showed the presence of a pancreatic carcinoma with multiple liver metastases and a poor prognosis. The second one instead is the first case in literature where painful subcutaneous nodules of the legs were the early manifestation of a neuroendocrine carcinoma of the adrenal gland.

Conclusions

Although subcutaneous fat necrosis usually occurs late in the course of a malignancy, recognition of the association with pancreatic panniculitis may prevent a long delay in the diagnosis and management of the occult neoplasm. It should be primarily considered when panniculitis is widespread and persistent, and frequent relapses or tendency to ulcerate of the nodules are regarded as red flags.

### Clinical characteristics of merkel cell carcinoma at diagnosis in 195 patients: the AEIOU features [^7f236dcf]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive skin cancer with a mortality of 33%. Advanced disease at diagnosis is a poor prognostic factor, suggesting that earlier detection may improve outcome. No systematic analysis has been published to define the clinical features that are characteristic of MCC.

Objective

We sought to define the clinical characteristics present at diagnosis to identify features that may aid clinicians in recognizing MCC.

Methods

We conducted a cohort study of 195 patients given the diagnosis of MCC between 1980 and 2007. Data were collected prospectively in the majority of cases, and medical records were reviewed.

Results

An important finding was that 88% of MCCs were asymptomatic (nontender) despite rapid growth in the prior 3 months (63% of lesions) and being red or pink (56%). A majority of MCC lesions (56%) were presumed at biopsy to be benign, with a cyst/acneiform lesion being the single most common diagnosis (32%) given. The median delay from lesion appearance to biopsy was 3 months (range 1–54 months), and median tumor diameter was 1.8 cm. Similar to earlier studies, 81% of primary MCCs occurred on ultraviolet-exposed sites, and our cohort was elderly (90% > 50 years), predominantly white (98%), and often profoundly immune suppressed (7.8%). An additional novel finding was that chronic lymphocytic leukemia was more than 30-fold overrepresented among patients with MCC.

Limitations

The study was limited to patients seen at a tertiary care center. Complete clinical data could not be obtained on all patients. This study could not assess the specificity of the clinical characteristics of MCC.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, this study is the first to define clinical features that may serve as clues in the diagnosis of MCC. The most significant features can be summarized in an acronym: AEIOU (asymptomatic/lack of tenderness, expanding rapidly, immune suppression, older than 50 years, and ultraviolet-exposed site on a person with fair skin). In our series, 89% of primary MCCs had 3 or more of these findings. Although MCC is uncommon, when present in combination, these features may indicate a concerning process that would warrant biopsy. In particular, a lesion that is red and expanding rapidly yet asymptomatic should be of concern.

### Panniculitis in childhood [^fa91c84c]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Panniculitis refers to disorders with inflammation of the subcutaneous fat. Such inflammation can be primary or can be a reaction pattern induced by a systemic process. Some types of panniculitis are seen more commonly or exclusively in children. These include erythema nodosum, subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn, sclerema neonatorum, poststeroid panniculitis, and cold panniculitis. The most typical clinical finding is tender, erythematous subcutaneous nodules. Clinical clues can aid in the diagnosis of the panniculitides, but pathology is often necessary to confirm the diagnosis. In general, the pediatric panniculitides are treated with supportive care and management of any underlying disorders, but certain types such as infectious panniculitis and malignancy-related panniculitis require more specific therapies.

Indirect evidence suggests that evaluation of deeper tissue is more effective at establishing a diagnosis of PAN, and a deep-skin biopsy can be performed by a dermatologist as a deep ("double") punch biopsy.

### Panniculitis [^cce6bf21]. Dermatologic Clinics (2002). Low credibility.

The classification of inflammatory disorders of the subcutaneous tissue has mystified dermatologists for decades. Overlapping clinical and histologic features, and a lack of specific treatments have added to the confusion. This article initially classifies the various panniculititides by their primary histopathologic pattern: (1) septal panniculitis without vasculitis, (2) septal panniculitis with vasculitis, (3) lobular panniculitis without vasculitis, and (4) lobular panniculitis with vasculitis. Subsequently, we describe the key clinical findings in the most important forms of panniculitis. We begin with the most common form of panniculitis, erythema nodosum. Indeed, in many patients suspected of having panniculitis, a worthwhile question to consider initially might be, "Is this, or is this not, erythema nodosum?" before engaging in an elaborate (and expensive) exercise in differential diagnosis.

### Rash decisions: an approach to dangerous rashes based on morphology [^7565e82b]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Rash is a common complaint in the emergency department. Many causes of rash are benign; however, some patients may have a life-threatening diagnosis.

Objective

This review will present an algorithmic approach to rashes, focusing on life-threatening causes of rash in each category.

Discussion

Rash is common, with a wide range of etiologies. The differential is broad, consisting of many conditions that are self-resolving. However, several conditions associated with rash are life threatening. Several keys can be utilized to rapidly diagnose and manage these deadly rashes. Thorough history and physical examination, followed by consideration of red flags, are essential. This review focuses on four broad categories based on visual and tactile characteristic patterns of rashes: petechial/purpuric, erythematous, maculopapular, and vesiculobullous. Rashes in each morphologic group will be further categorized based on clinical features such as the presence or absence of fever and distribution of skin lesions.

Conclusions

Rashes can be divided into petechial/purpuric, erythematous, maculopapular, and vesiculobullous. After this differentiation, the presence of fever and systemic signs of illness should be assessed. Through the breakdown of rashes into these classes, emergency providers can ensure deadly conditions are considered.

### New tender, bleeding papule on the left ear [^75c81813]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis (CNH) is a painful, inflammatory condition that impacts the skin of the ear. It is commonly associated with pressure on the pinna causing a nodule that may have erythema, bleeding and exudate. We present a case of a woman in her 60s with a history of basal cell carcinoma who presented with a new tender spot on the antihelix of her left ear. The tenderness of the new spot forced her to switch from holding her phone to her left ear to using her right ear. A shave biopsy confirmed CNH and ruled out non-melanoma skin cancer. Although most prior cases report association with sleeping on the side of the affected ear, this case was attributed to cell phone use. It is important to remember that non-traditional sources of pressure can also lead to CNH.

### Panniculitis with fever of unknown origin [^c7a6193f]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Based on aetiology, panniculitis is a relatively rare process in children and is among many diseases that cause panniculitis. Other forms of childhood panniculitis include, poststeroidal panniculitis, neonatal scleroderma, cold panniculitis, newborn subcutaneous fat necrosis among others. There are very few reports of panniculitis in children that are well described in adults. The most common type is erythema nodosum, a septal panniculitis without vasculitis, which is clinically defined as the appearance of painful and inflammatory cutaneous nodules that primarily affect the pretibial region of the lower limbs. These nodules typically resolve on their own in 1–6 weeks without ulceration or cutaneous atrophy. It is a pluriaetiological condition that usually develops because of a hypersensitivity response linked to paediatric enteric, tuberculosis or streptococcal infections, as well as beta-lactam and macrolide use. The patient in this instance had subcutaneous nodules, a fever and systemic symptoms, all of which were clinical signs of panniculitis and called for a thorough diagnostic evaluation. Clinically, panniculitis manifests as deep plaques or nodules, irrespective of the aetiology. To arrive at an accurate diagnosis, it is thus important to supplement its investigation with a histological study. Nevertheless, given the restricted capacity of adipose tissue to respond with various patterns, its histology is not easily interpreted. It is the physician's responsibility to decide when to do a skin biopsy, which is the most effective diagnostic tool. It is important to perform the biopsy early on to prevent the lesion from evolving into one with less specific histological changes.

1 Case Presentation

An 11‐year‐old previously healthy male presented with painful skin lesions on the lower legs. In the 6 weeks leading up to presentation, he experienced profound lethargy, polyarthritis of large joints of the extremities, cyclic low‐grade fever, approximately 7 kg weight loss, and bilateral periocular edema. He had traveled to Liberia for 3 weeks, 1 year prior to symptom onset. The patient was not on any medications. The patient was normotensive and intermittently febrile without consistent pattern (T max = 38.5°C). On physical examination, he had hyperpigmented reticulated plaques and painful erythematous nodules on the lower legs, ankles, and dorsal feet (Figure 1), with milder involvement of the hands. He was also noted to have robust bilateral periorbital edema (Figure 2). An extensive workup revealed elevated inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] > 130 mm/h; C‐reactive protein (CRP) 19.5 mg/dL). He had an elevated anti‐streptolysin O (ASO) titer of 592 IU/mL. The remainder of his workup was normal, including DNAse B antibody level, creatinine, urinalysis, terminal complement deficiency testing, immunologic titers, transthoracic echocardiogram, and full body MRI. A punch biopsy from the left foot was taken (Figures 3 and 4).

### Reducing inappropriate investigations for minor lower limb cellulitis [^c3009c22]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Background

Lower limb cellulitis involves infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, presenting as expanding erythema, warmth, tenderness and swelling. Despite being a frequently encountered condition in both the outpatient and inpatient settings, there is a lack of robustly developed and validated diagnostic criteria or tools for use in clinical practice, with no definitive diagnostic algorithm nor a clear biomarker. Routine biochemical and haematological blood tests and blood cultures are not specific for cellulitis. Radiography is not required unless there is clinical suspicion of osteomyelitis, history of trauma to the affected extremity or the presence of a chronic wound. The performance of unnecessary investigations leads to patient risks and wastes resources by potentially confusing the diagnosis and prolonging inpatient lengths of stays. Clinical decision support and evidence-based guidelines are hence key in empowering appropriate and rationalised decision-making in the management of patients with lower limb cellulitis.

### Generalized yellow-white papules in a patient with acute joint pain [^5ab7cb3e]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the best next step in evaluating and managing this patient?
A. Order antinuclear antibodies
B. Recommend arthrocentesis with synovial fluid analysis
C. Order serum fasting triglycerides
D. Measure serum calcium and phosphate
E. Measure serum uric acid

Answers:
A. Order antinuclear antibodies – Incorrect. Connective tissue diseases such as systemic sclerosis and dermatomyositis can present with calcinosis cutis in adults, especially in longstanding cases. However, other suggestive features of connective tissue diseases were absent in this patient.
B. Recommend arthrocentesis with synovial fluid analysis – Correct. Gouty tophi result from the deposition of monosodium urate crystals within soft tissues, most commonly in periarticular regions. They typically develop in longstanding gout, usually after about 10 years of recurrent polyarticular flares, and rarely present as the initial sign of disease. Miliarial tophi are a rare intradermal form of tophaceous gout that presents as small, white, milia-like papules filled with chalky material, as seen in this patient. Two-thirds of cases have occurred in patients without a prior diagnosis of gout and represented the first sign of tophaceous disease. Miliarial tophi often involve nonperiarticular skin, especially the thighs and shins, unlike classic tophi which have a predilection to periarticular skin. Treatment with urate-lowering medications such as allopurinol or febuxostat has shown variable results. Among 11 published cases, 1 case showed complete resolution after 3 months of therapy, 4 cases showed partial improvement over an average of 8 and a half months, and 6 cases were lost to follow-up or had no outcome reported. Given the atypical presentation and lack of gout history, both arthrocentesis and skin biopsy are indicated to confirm the diagnosis in this patient.
C. Order serum fasting triglycerides – Incorrect. Eruptive xanthomas are small, pruritic yellow-to-orange papules, sometimes with surrounding erythema. Eruptive xanthomas are associated with severe hypertriglyceridemia, and not arthritis.
D. Measure serum calcium and phosphate – Incorrect. Secondary, sporadic tumoral calcinosis is characterized by dermal calcium phosphate deposits, typically around large joints, and is usually associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism in the setting of end-stage renal disease. Lesions can grow large (up to 20 cm), causing disfigurement and impaired function. Calcium-phosphorus product may be elevated.
E. Measure serum uric acid – Incorrect. While elevated uric acid levels are associated with gout, they are neither diagnostic nor specific. Many individuals with hyperuricemia do not develop gout, and uric acid levels can be normal during an acute flare.

### An 8-year-old boy with prolonged fever and subcutaneous nodules [^e6dbe749]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

An 8-year-old boy with asthma presented with prolonged fever, malaise, extremity weakness, polyarthralgias, malar rash, and subcutaneous nodules. Physical examination was remarkable for a faint malar rash, flesh-colored papules on the dorsal aspect of the fingers, arthritis of multiple joints in the hands, and subcutaneous nodules. The nodules were firm, nontender, and distributed over multiple extremities and the trunk. The patient was admitted to expedite workup. Initial laboratory test results revealed leukopenia, mild elevation of the aminotransferases, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and normal level of creatine kinase. His echocardiogram was normal. Infectious disease studies were negative. Additional examination revealed dilated capillaries in his nail beds and bilateral hip weakness. MRI of his extremities was negative for myositis or calcification of the nodules. We obtained a biopsy of the subcutaneous nodules, and because the patient remained afebrile during the hospitalization, we discharged him from the hospital with outpatient follow-up. Our expert panel reviews the course of the patient's evaluation and investigation, as well as the implications of his diagnosis based on the tissue pathology from the nodule biopsy.

### Diagnosing common benign skin tumors… [^dc9daeaa]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

9 Lipomas must be clinically differentiated from other tumors. The primary differential diagnosis in a subcutaneous mass is a sebaceous cyst or abscess. Lipomas are soft, flesh-colored nodules that are easily moveable under the overlying skin. Sebaceous cysts are generally identifiable by a central punctum, and abscesses can be identified by the presence of warmth, redness, and pain. Ultrasonography is increasingly used to aid in the diagnosis of lipomas. High-frequency ultrasonography can provide high-resolution images of subcutaneous tumors and surrounding structures. Keratoacanthomas Keratoacanthomas are rapidly growing, squamoproliferative benign tumors that resemble squamous cell carcinoma. They begin as round, firm, reddish or skin-colored papules that develop into dome-shaped nodules with a keratin-filled crater. They may grow to 1 to 2 cm over weeks or months.

There is a slower involution phase over several months, leaving a scar if not excised early in its course. Keratoacanthomas generally occur later in life on sun-exposed areas, primarily the face, arms, and legs. They are attributed to sun exposure, cigarette smoking, human papillomavirus infection, genetic factors, trauma, and chemical carcinogens. 19 Diagnosis is based on the appearance of firm, raised, papules or nodules, ranging from tan to reddish brown. They tend to be darker at the center and fade to normal skin color at the margin. Dermatofibromas exhibit dimpling or retraction of the lesion beneath the skin with lateral compression. 20 No treatment is required unless there is a change in size or color, or bleeding or irritation from trauma. A 2012 study found that 73% of patients who underwent laser ablation reported satisfaction with the results.
21. Cherry Angiomas Cherry angiomas are extremely common lesions that tend to appear with increasing age.

They usually occur as multiple asymptomatic lesions, most commonly on the trunk and arms. They are dome-shaped, small, bright red to violaceous, soft, compressible papules with smooth surfaces that blanch with pressure and bleed profusely with traumatic rupture.

### Plum-colored plaques on the scalp and extremities [^46705d46]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 3: Which of the following is not a cutaneous manifestation of essential thrombocythemia?
A. Livedo reticularis
B. Erythromelalgia
C. Polyarteritis nodosa
D. Raynaud phenomenon
E. Lower extremity ulcers

Answers:
A. Livedo reticularis – Incorrect. This is a purplish, net-like vascular pattern on the skin commonly occurring due to vascular pathology. In ET, the livedo reticularis pattern may be more limited and asymmetric in comparison with the classic/benign form.
B. Erythromelalgia – Incorrect. This is a rare condition characterized by burning pain and erythema at the distal extremities, exacerbated by heat and exercise. While rare, it has been documented in ET.
C. Polyarteritis nodosa – Correct. Polyarteritis nodosa is a medium-vessel vasculitis often affecting numerous organs, while classically sparing the lungs. It is commonly associated with hepatitis B infection, and may also be triggered by blood dyscrasias such as hairy cell leukemia. However, ET is not a known trigger of polyarteritis nodosa.
D. Raynaud phenomenon – Incorrect. This condition results from vasoconstriction of peripheral arteries due to cold exposure. It is associated with ET, and can be treated with avoidance of cold, warm clothing, and calcium channel blockers.
E. Lower extremity ulcers – Incorrect. Ulceration may occur from chronic coagulopathy, as in the case of ET. It may also result from chemotherapeutics, such as hydroxycarbamide, which are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.

### An 11-year-old male with periorbital edema and painful subcutaneous nodules [^f6f4beab]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

As PAN is a medium‐vessel vasculitis, the histopathologic differential diagnosis includes other medium‐vessel vasculitides. These include anti‐neutrophilic cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA) vasculitis, septic vasculitis, and rheumatoid vasculitis. While PAN will typically show neutrophilic karyorrhexis affecting an artery in the deep dermis or subcutaneous tissue, the other entities will demonstrate a superficial and deep perivascular infiltrate, as they tend to affect a broader range of vessel sizes. Additionally, many of these other entities will have unique characteristics that are lacking in PAN, such as the appearance of palisaded granulomas in granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or microorganisms in septic vasculitis.

Treatment guidelines for PAN have not been well‐established given the rarity of disease. However, review of the literature suggests that most pediatric patients are responsive to systemic steroids. Successful treatment with steroid‐sparing agents such as methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, intravenous immunoglobulin, and anti‐TNF alpha agents have been reported for childhood cases of PAN. Severe and/or refractory patients have shown improvement with tocilizumab and rituximab therapies. Multiple authors suggest that penicillin should be considered for patients with increased ASO titers, either to treat an active infection or as prophylaxis for future PAN flares.

There are few case reports and small reviews studying the outcomes within the pediatric population. The largest of these studies included 110 pediatric patients with either cutaneous‐only PAN or systemic PAN. Remission rates were similar at 70% and 65%, respectively. The majority of the systemic PAN patients presented with constitutional symptoms (fevers, fatigue, and weight loss) and elevated acute phase reactants; approximately 24% presented with GI symptoms and 22% presented with neurologic symptoms.

Our patient was treated with a three‐day course of pulsed‐dose methylprednisolone at 30 mg/kg/dose, with rapid improvement in symptoms. He was subsequently discharged on adalimumab 40 mg every 2 weeks, methotrexate 7.5 mg weekly to prevent the generation of anti‐drug antibodies, and a prolonged steroid taper. He was followed by rheumatology every 4–8 weeks for the first year after his initial hospitalization. Two months after his hospitalization, as his ASO titers remained elevated (304.4 IU/mL), the decision was made to start penicillin G prophylaxis at 1.2 million units every 4 weeks. He received 3 months of injections, but ultimately discontinued due to insurance and social challenges. At this time, the patient remains on adalimumab and methotrexate without recurrence.

Spider bites — evaluation emphasizes that most alleged spider bites are simply not spider bites, and a sudden warm, tender lesion with a necrotic center is often diagnosed as a spider bite despite few cases involving an observed spider; in this context, a painful necrotic lesion is more likely to be a bacterial skin infection that likely requires antibiotics. Nevertheless, necrotizing spider bites can occur and are most often caused by recluse spiders (Loxosceles spp.); in the United States, the most common culprit is the brown recluse (or fiddleback) spider (Loxosceles reclusa) found in the south-central United States, and the Mediterranean recluse spider (Loxosceles rufescens) resembles the brown recluse, is native to the Mediterranean basin and the Near East, and has become widespread with a large, nearly worldwide distribution.

Pyomyositis — epidemiology and presentation include pus within individual muscle groups caused mainly by S. aureus, occurrence in temperate climates especially in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or diabetes mellitus, and presenting findings of localized pain in a single muscle group, muscle tenderness, and fever; Staphylococcus aureus accounts for about 90% of pathogens with community-acquired MRSA reported in many nontropical communities, other possible etiologic agents include group A streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and gram-negative enteric bacteria, and blood cultures are positive in 5%–30% of patients.
