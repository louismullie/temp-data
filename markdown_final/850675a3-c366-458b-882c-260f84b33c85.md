## Question

Diabetic regimen for A1c greater than 14

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a plan to manage type 2 diabetes when the A1c is greater than 14 percent. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical significance and risks of an A1c this high. Then, I should confirm when insulin is mandatory and what initial regimen is appropriate. Next, I will examine screening for acute metabolic decompensation and key labs before adjunct therapies. After that, I need to consider comorbidity-driven add-on choices, monitoring and titration logistics, and hypoglycemia education. Finally, I should review de-intensification once stabilized and correct any guideline nuances that could be misread, including the Canadian guidance about " > 1.5 percent" above target, before offering a consolidated recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance of an A1c > 14 percent; at this level, the probability of symptomatic hyperglycemia is high, glucotoxicity is almost certain, and the short-term risk of metabolic decompensation (DKA or HHS) is materially increased, which elevates this to an urgent treatment scenario rather than routine titration, so I need to proceed with an insulin-first mindset and avoid therapeutic inertia from the outset [^111sf3fo] [^112UhBgF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — do the major guidelines actually mandate insulin here; I should verify that the ADA explicitly recommends insulin initiation for very high A1c levels or glucose with symptoms, regardless of prior therapy, and confirm that Canadian guidance aligns for metabolic decompensation, because oral therapy alone is inappropriate at this degree of hyperglycemia even if the patient is treatment-naïve [^111sf3fo] [^11698p33].

> Now, I will specify the initial insulin strategy; if there are catabolic features, random glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL, or clinical instability, I should start a full physiologic basal–bolus regimen, for example total daily insulin in the 0.3–0.5 units/kg/day range split roughly half basal and half prandial, while in less catabolic but still very high A1c cases a basal-first approach at about 0.2 units/kg/day with rapid up-titration and stepwise addition of mealtime insulin can be considered, and I should double-check that these dosing anchors are consistent with primary care and Canadian intensification recommendations [^notfound] [^1128RZ2h] [^111sf3fo].

> Wait, let me verify the stabilization workup before finalizing the outpatient plan; I need to screen for DKA/HHS with ketones, electrolytes including bicarbonate, and serum osmolality, assess hydration status and correct volume depletion, and check renal function before metformin or SGLT2 inhibitor use, and if the phenotype is atypical for type 2 diabetes, I should consider autoantibodies and C-peptide to exclude LADA or type 1 diabetes per comprehensive initial evaluation principles [^111x9jVZ] [^111sf3fo].

> Next, I should review adjunctive pharmacotherapy once glucose is pulled below the danger zone; metformin remains foundational if renal function allows, and for those with established ASCVD, heart failure, or CKD, I should add an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist with proven outcome benefit regardless of A1c, typically after initial insulin-driven stabilization to reduce osmotic and ketotic risks during initiation [^111qNBNG] [^114rkHe5] [^117RJxxH].

> I need to ensure the monitoring cadence matches the severity; in the first weeks, daily fasting and pre-meal SMBG with frequent contact is necessary, basal insulin should be titrated every few days to reach fasting 80–130 mg/dL, and prandial coverage adjusted to pre- and post-meal targets, and while A1c is generally assessed quarterly, I should double-check whether an interim 4–6 week A1c is reasonable here to overcome inertia and accelerate adjustments in this very-high-risk state, recognizing ADA's emphasis on timely intensification [^112UhBgF] [^113pBd7W].

> But wait, what about hypoglycemia; with insulin initiation the risk rises, so I must provide diabetes self-management education and support, teach recognition and treatment of level 2–3 hypoglycemia, and promptly reevaluate the regimen after any significant hypoglycemia to deintensify or switch therapies where appropriate, while screening for impaired awareness at follow-up [^111BMTFs] [^117XMrYB] [^112emDcx].

> Let me consider de-intensification once glucotoxicity abates; in newly diagnosed patients, beta-cell function can rebound, and although I initially thought oral agents alone might suffice even up front, hold on, at A1c > 14 percent I still need initial insulin to stabilize, but after 2–3 months of good control I can trial insulin taper while maintaining metformin and considering a GLP-1 RA or SGLT2 inhibitor for durability and cardiometabolic benefit, whereas in long-standing diabetes sustained insulin is often necessary [^113Dkm39] [^114rkHe5].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should clarify a potential guideline misread; the Canadian recommendation to consider initial combination therapy when A1c is " > 1.5 percent" refers to being more than 1.5 percentage points above the individualized target, not an absolute A1c of 1.5 percent, and I should keep that nuance in mind when framing initial dual therapy outside of frank metabolic decompensation [^112Vy4C8].

> Finally, to pull this together, I will confirm that the plan is insulin-first for A1c > 14 percent with aggressive but safe titration, screening and correcting acute derangements, adding metformin once renal function is adequate, layering in an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist for cardiorenal indications after stabilization, monitoring closely to avoid inertia, educating to prevent and manage hypoglycemia, and reassessing for de-intensification if newly diagnosed physiology recovers, all aligned with ADA and Canadian guidance for very high glycemia thresholds [^111sf3fo] [^11698p33] [^114rkHe5] [^117RJxxH].

---

For patients with A1c > 14%, **immediate insulin therapy** [^111sf3fo] is required to rapidly lower glucose and prevent acute complications. Start **basal-bolus insulin** at 0.5–0.7 units/kg/day [^115HJqyf], split 50% basal and 50% bolus, and titrate daily to fasting 80–130 mg/dL and premeal < 140 mg/dL. Add **metformin** [^114yCGpj] if tolerated, and consider GLP-1 RA or SGLT-2 inhibitor for cardiovascular/renal benefit [^112bMqqZ] [^117RJxxH]. Use CGM or frequent SMBG, monitor for hypoglycemia [^114nSrhe], and reassess every 1–2 weeks to adjust therapy and address adherence. Individualize targets based on comorbidities and hypoglycemia risk [^113pBd7W], and provide diabetes education and lifestyle support [^111BMTFs].

## Initial pharmacologic management

### Insulin therapy

- **Indication**: Immediate insulin initiation is indicated for A1c > 14% [^111sf3fo] or severe hyperglycemia (≥ 300 mg/dL) [^11698p33] [^111n1nm5].

- **Regimen**: Start basal-bolus insulin at 0.5–0.7 units/kg/day [^115HJqyf], split 50% basal and 50% bolus before meals.

- **Titration**: Adjust daily to fasting 80–130 mg/dL and premeal < 140 mg/dL.

- **Monitoring**: Use CGM or frequent SMBG to guide titration and detect hypoglycemia [^114nSrhe].

---

### Adjunctive pharmacologic therapy

- **Metformin**: Add if tolerated for durable A1c lowering, low hypoglycemia risk, and affordability [^112gSxmS] [^114yCGpj].

- **GLP-1 receptor agonists**: Consider for additional A1c lowering, weight loss, and cardiovascular benefit [^117RJxxH] [^112bMqqZ].

- **SGLT-2 inhibitors**: Use in patients with cardiovascular or renal comorbidities [^112bMqqZ] [^117RJxxH].

---

## Non-pharmacologic interventions

Non-pharmacologic interventions should include **lifestyle modifications** — dietary changes, physical activity, and weight management [^1148f6ju] — and **diabetes self-management education** to support adherence and improve outcomes [^111BMTFs].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring and follow-up should include reassessment **every 1–2 weeks** to adjust therapy and support adherence. Additionally, **hypoglycemia monitoring** should involve regular assessment and therapy adjustments as needed [^114nSrhe] [^117XMrYB].

---

## Individualized treatment targets

Treatment targets should be individualized, **tailoring targets** to comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, and patient preferences [^113pBd7W] [^116uW7GJ], and should incorporate **shared decision-making** by engaging patients in setting realistic, individualized goals [^113pBd7W].

---

## Potential complications and risks

- **Hypoglycemia**: Monitor closely and adjust therapy to minimize risk [^113DZUrR] [^114nSrhe].

- **Diabetic ketoacidosis**: Monitor for DKA, especially in insulin-deficient patients [^111sf3fo].

- **Cardiovascular complications**: Address cardiovascular risk factors and monitor closely [^114rkHe5].

### Initial management of severe hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes: an observational study [^115TYDYN]. Diabetes Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Diabetes affects 25.8 million people (8.3%) in the United States, with 1.9 million new cases diagnosed in 2010 alone. While the diagnostic threshold for diabetes is an A1C ≥ 6.5%, patients can present with severe hyperglycemia with A1C values reaching higher than 14%. Severe hyperglycemia may warrant specific and immediate treatment considerations to prevent acute complications, alleviate symptoms, and preserve beta cell function. However, literature regarding the effectiveness of different treatment approaches to manage patients with non-emergent, severe hyperglycemia is limited.

The American Diabetes Association's (ADA) position statement on a patient-centered approach to the management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes recommends that "if a patient presents with significant hyperglycemic symptoms and/or has dramatically elevated plasma glucose concentrations (> 300–350 mg/dL), or an A1C ≥ 10–12%, insulin therapy should be strongly considered from the outset". After symptoms are relieved and glucose levels are decreased, oral agents can be added, and it may be possible to withdraw insulin if preferred. This recommendation makes no distinction between newly diagnosed or drug-naïve patients and treated or established patients and does not provide references or level of evidence.

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) algorithm for glycemic control recommends insulin therapy ± other agents for patients who present with an A1C > 9%. The recommendations state that "for drug naïve patients with A1C levels > 9%, it is unlikely that 1, 2, or even 3 therapy agents will be sufficient".

### Evaluation and management of adult hypoglycemic disorders: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116RgyiU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2009). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hypoglycemia, particularly in the initial evaluation of patients without diabetes, the ES 2009 guidelines recommend the following strategies for patients with hypoglycemia not associated with diabetes mellitus:

- **Review history and physical findings**: Examine all available laboratory data to identify clues to specific disorders, such as drugs, critical illnesses, hormone deficiencies, or non-islet cell tumors.

- **Conduct laboratory measurements during hypoglycemic episodes**: Measure plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, β-hydroxybutyrate, and insulin antibodies. Screen for oral hypoglycemic agents when the cause of hypoglycemia is unclear in a patient who appears well. Observe the plasma glucose response to intravenous injection of 1 mg of glucagon.

- **Simulate conditions for symptomatic hypoglycemia**: In cases where spontaneous hypoglycemic episodes cannot be observed, recreate circumstances that may trigger symptomatic hypoglycemia, such as fasting for up to 72 hours or after consuming a mixed meal.

- **Document endogenous hyperinsulinism**: Base documentation on symptoms, signs, or both, with plasma glucose concentrations less than 55 mg/dL (less than 3 mmol/L), insulin levels of 3 U/mL (18 pmol/L) or more, C-peptide levels of 0.6 ng/mL (0.2 nmol/L) or more, and proinsulin levels of 5.0 pmol/L or more.

- **Identify insulin-induced hypoglycemia**: Determine if hypoglycemia is induced by insulin or insulin-like growth factors, based on symptoms, signs, or both, with plasma β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations less than or equal to 2.7 mmol/L and glucose levels of 25 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) or more following intravenous glucagon administration.

- **Utilize advanced diagnostic investigations**: Obtain diagnostic imaging such as CT or MRI, as well as transabdominal and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) if necessary.

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes [^111zWTnH]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

By the end of the 20th century, metformin's ability to safely lower glucose levels in patients with diabetes had been well-documented on a global scale. In 2002, metformin became the most commonly prescribed oral anti-hyperglycemic medication. In 2005, the International Diabetes Foundation published guidelines recommending metformin as a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes. Nearly 50 years after the rediscovery of metformin, the World Health Organization added metformin to its list of essential medications in 2011.

Numerous clinical trials in the last decade have thoroughly assessed concerns regarding the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis in patients with comorbidities such as renal and hepatic dysfunction or congestive heart failure. Results from such trials continue to support metformin as a safe and effective medication for the vast majority of patients. In fact, the restriction for using metformin in patients with impaired kidney function has recently been relaxed.

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes [^115tekHv]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Metformin is a biguanide that is used as a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is effective as both monotherapy and in combination with other glucose-lowering medications. Metformin is generally well-tolerated with minimal side effects and remains affordable. Although the safety and efficacy of metformin have been well-established, there is ongoing discussion over whether it should continue to be the first choice for therapy, as other anti-hyperglycemic medications exhibit additional advantages in certain populations.

Despite the long-standing history of metformin use, there is limited cardiovascular outcomes data for the drug. Furthermore, available studies fail to provide strong evidence due to either small sample sizes or short durations. Recent data from glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor cardiovascular and renal outcomes trials demonstrated additional protection from diabetes complications for some high-risk patients, which has influenced diabetes management guidelines.

Post-hoc analyses comparing hazard ratios for participants taking metformin at baseline versus those not taking metformin are inconclusive. There are no data to suggest that metformin should not be initiated soon after the diagnosis of diabetes. Furthermore, the initiation of newer glycemic-lowering medications with cardiovascular benefits should be considered in high-risk patients regardless of glycemic control or target HbA1c. However, cost remains a major factor in determining appropriate treatment.

### Effect of intensive versus standard blood glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in different regions of the world: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113Aic7k]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Previous meta-analyses of RCTs of intensive versus standard blood glucose therapy among T2DM patients demonstrated high between-study heterogeneity for mortality outcomes that was insufficiently explained based on differences in patient population alone. In this present analysis, we demonstrated that the heterogeneity in results among 17 global RCTs that studied almost 35,000 T2DM participants may derive from patient or treatment-pattern differences, specifically between North America (NA) and other regions of the world.

There were no major differences between trials conducted in NA and the rest of the world (ROW) for mean age, mean duration of diabetes at the entry level, and mean duration of follow-up. Baseline mean HbA1c levels in trials conducted in NA were higher (10.6%) compared with the ROW (8.07%). Mean reductions in HbA1c level in the intensive group were higher in NA (2.20% in NA and 0.83% in ROW). There was no major difference in the treatment regimens used in the trials conducted in NA and the ROW. Most of the trials used oral agents as primary therapy, and insulin was added in cases where the target A1c was not achieved by maximal doses of oral agents.

The pooled analysis from trials conducted in NA showed significantly higher all-cause mortality, cardiovascular (CV) mortality, and severe hypoglycemia with versus without intensive glycemic treatment. In contrast, when data were pooled from trials conducted in the ROW, no significant increase in death or severe hypoglycemia was observed between intensive and standard treatment groups.

### Insulin therapy in people with type 2 diabetes: opportunities and challenges [^111Rg2EU]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Given the continued interest in defining the optimal management of individuals with type 2 diabetes, the editor of Diabetes Care convened a working party of diabetes specialists to examine this topic in the context of insulin therapy. This was prompted by recent new evidence on the use of insulin in such people. The group was aware of evidence that the benefits of insulin therapy are still usually offered late, and thus the aim of the discussion was how to define the optimal timing and basis for decisions regarding insulin and to apply these concepts in practice.

It was noted that recent evidence had built upon that of the previous decades, together confirming the benefits and safety of insulin therapy, albeit with concerns about the potential for hypoglycemia and gain in body weight. Insulin offers a unique ability to control hyperglycemia, being used from the time of diagnosis in some circumstances, when metabolic control is disturbed by medical illness, procedures, or therapy, as well as in the longer term in ambulatory care.

For those previously starting insulin, various other forms of therapy can be added later, which offer complementary effects appropriate to individual needs. Here we review evidence and circumstances in which insulin can be used, consider individualized choices of alternatives and combination regimens, and offer some guidance on personalized targets and tactics for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes.

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes [^1166XBdv]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). High credibility.

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) first introduced consensus guidelines in 2008 regarding the management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. The guidelines suggested that metformin, alongside lifestyle interventions, should be the first-line therapy. While pharmacologic treatment guidelines for type 2 diabetes in the United States have remained largely consistent, updates in 2019 and 2020 have incorporated additional elements in response to newly available data from cardiovascular and renal outcomes trials. According to the ADA 2020 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, metformin continues to be the preferred initial pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes unless contraindicated or not tolerated by the patient. Additional glucose-lowering agents may be included with metformin, taking into account patient preferences, hypoglycemic risk, and comorbidities.

While the ADA still endorses metformin as the first-line therapy, the updated Standards of Care have become more focused on outcomes rather than prioritizing glycemic control alone. For patients with certain comorbidities, such as high-risk or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure, or chronic kidney disease, it is advised to consider GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and SGLT-2 inhibitors independently of baseline HbA1c or individualized HbA1c targets. In 2019, the European Society of Cardiology, in collaboration with the EASD, took a step further by altering their treatment guidelines. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs are now recommended as first-line therapy for patients with these conditions.

### Pharmacologic glycemic management of type 2 diabetes in adults---2024 update [^11698p33]. Canadian Journal of Diabetes (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, particularly in relation to insulin therapy, the DC 2024 guidelines recommend initiating insulin, with or without metformin, as the initial pharmacologic therapy in patients experiencing metabolic decompensation. This includes conditions such as marked hyperglycemia, ketosis, hyperosmolar state, or unintentional weight loss related to hyperglycemia, and/or severe symptomatic hyperglycemia (such as polyuria, polydipsia, visual blurring). Consider tapering or discontinuing insulin and replacing it with other agents once metabolic stability is achieved.

### Intensifying insulin therapy: What options are available to patients with type 2 diabetes [^1135Rj7n]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The progressive nature of type 2 diabetes (T2D) requires practitioners to periodically evaluate patients and intensify therapy when glycemic targets become unattainable with their treatment regimen. Traditional first- and second-line antidiabetic agents, such as metformin and the sulfonylureas, do not prevent the characteristic decline in beta-cell function associated with T2D. Therefore, insulin replacement therapy can quickly become a necessity in some patients. Basal insulin initiation provides an excellent platform to which rapid-acting prandial insulin doses can easily be added, potentially in a stepwise manner, as the disease progresses.

Premix insulin regimens are another effective intensification option following basal insulin initiation, but they are most effective in insulin-naïve patients. The use of insulin in combination with modern T2D agents, such as incretin-based therapies, has the potential to improve glycemic control while limiting insulin-associated weight gain and hypoglycemia. Further clinical data and approval are required before practitioners can fully endorse this novel approach.

### Treatment escalation and rise in HbA1c following successful initial metformin therapy [^112dRGPL]. Diabetes Care (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to describe the secondary failure of initial metformin therapy in patients who achieved an initial HbA1c (A1C) of 8.0% after at least 6 months on metformin.

- **Results**:
	- The best A1C achieved within 1 year of metformin initiation was the most powerful predictor of avoiding secondary failure. Approximately 50% of subjects whose best A1C was between 7–7.9% added or switched antihyperglycemic drugs within 36 months. In contrast, it took more than 60 months for those in the 6–6.9% A1C category to reach a 50% failure rate. Only about 25% of subjects in the 6–6.9% category failed by 48 months, and more than 80% of subjects in the < 6% category remained below 8% through 60 months.

- **Conclusions**:
	- Whether defined by adding or switching to another drug or by reaching an A1C of 8%, secondary failure is inversely associated with the reduction of A1C achieved within the first year of metformin monotherapy.

### Guideline approach to therapy in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes [^116eGZ17]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Specific advantages and disadvantages of individual main drug classes:

- **Metformin**: Metformin as first-line therapy is in the general consensus, since its efficacy is similar to other antihyperglycemic drugs — besides insulin. It has a large safety margin and can be used by most patients other than a small number who experience gastrointestinal side effects. It decreases hepatic glucose production, has a mild effect on peripheral resistance, and increases both total and active endogenous glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 in response to food. Metformin might also be cardioprotective, mainly in obese type 2 diabetic patients. Moreover, recently published observational studies, as well as animal and cell-line studies, suggest that this drug might be effective in reducing cancer-related morbidity. Thus, metformin is accepted as first-line therapy by both guidelines and pathophysiologic reasoning.

### Glycemic control in type 2 diabetes: time for an evidence-based about-face [^116HHG4U]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Some diabetes guidelines set low glycemic control goals for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, such as a hemoglobin A(1c) level as low as 6.5% to 7.0%, to avoid or delay complications. Our review and critique of recent large randomized trials in patients with type 2 diabetes suggest that tight glycemic control burdens patients with complex treatment programs, hypoglycemia, weight gain, and costs, and offers uncertain benefits in return.

We believe clinicians should prioritize supporting well-being and healthy lifestyles, preventive care, and cardiovascular risk reduction in these patients. Glycemic control efforts should individualize hemoglobin A(1c) targets so that those targets and the actions necessary to achieve them reflect patients' personal and clinical context and their informed values and preferences.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: A patient-centered approach: Position statement of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^117DzHrn]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

For antihyperglycemic management of type 2 diabetes, the comparative evidence basis at the time of writing is relatively lean, especially beyond metformin monotherapy. There is a significant need for high-quality, comparative-effectiveness research, not only regarding glycemic control but also costs and those outcomes that matter most to patients — quality of life and the avoidance of morbid and life-limiting complications, especially cardiovascular disease (CVD). Another issue about which more data are needed is the concept of durability of effectiveness (often ascribed to β-cell preservation), which would serve to stabilize metabolic control and decrease the future treatment burden for patients.

Pharmacogenetics may very well inform treatment decisions in the future, guiding the clinician to recommend a therapy for an individual patient based on predictors of response and susceptibility to adverse effects. We need more clinical data on how phenotype and other patient/disease characteristics should drive drug choices. As new medications are introduced to the type 2 diabetes pharmacopeia, their benefit and safety should be demonstrated in studies versus the best treatment, substantial enough in both size and duration to provide meaningful data on meaningful outcomes. It is appreciated, however, that head-to-head comparisons of all combinations and permutations would be impossibly large. Informed judgment and the expertise of experienced clinicians will therefore always be necessary.

### Redefining the diagnosis of diabetes using glycated hemoglobin [^114R3ZDQ]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The worldwide epidemic of type 2 diabetes continues unabated. Despite extensive efforts to educate providers, patients, and even the public at large on the advantages of early identification and treatment to prevent complications, a large number of patients remain undiagnosed. A serious barrier to enhanced detection of diabetes has been inadequate screening using tests that are somewhat inconvenient to patients and clinicians, and therefore often not optimally implemented. In this issue of Diabetes Care, a joint American Diabetes Association, International Diabetes Federation, and European Association for the Study of Diabetes International Expert Committee examines diagnostic testing for diabetes, specifically the role of A1C, and makes significant new recommendations. While this report has not yet been endorsed as a guideline by either of the associations (or other organizations), it does represent a step in that direction and thus deserves attention.

Clearly, no clinical diagnostic test is perfect. However, to be clinically useful, a test must be accurate, specific, standardized (or easily standardizable), handy, and ideally, inexpensive. While plasma glucose testing meets some of these criteria, its use has been hampered by the need to obtain a sample in the fasting state (most people attend their outpatient visits in the fed state) or under standard carbohydrate challenge conditions, i.e. the oral glucose tolerance test. There also continues to be a degree of uncertainty concerning the diagnostic performance of fasting glucose testing versus that of the oral glucose tolerance test.

### Early insulin treatment in type 2 diabetes: What are the pros [^115LSB6N]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

In summary, aggressive and often temporary use of insulin therapy at disease onset in type 2 diabetes is associated with effective glycemic control with minimal weight gain and hypoglycemia. Early restitution of physiologic insulin secretion and glycemic control could be, in theory, followed by therapies to prolong maintenance of euglycemia, such as thiazolidinediones- or glucagon-like peptide 1–based interventions (at the time of writing not clinically tested). A more timely and selective introduction of insulin replacement therapy, as β-cell function progresses, could facilitate the achievement and maintenance of euglycemia and thus reduce disease-associated complications.

### Efficacy and safety of initial combination therapy in treatment-naïve type 2 diabetes patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115xdTsQ]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Initial hypoglycemic monotherapy is usually employed in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients, as currently recommended by the guidelines of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD). However, initial monotherapy often proves insufficient for achieving or sustaining glycemic targets. Consequently, initial combination therapy has emerged as an alternative approach. The latest position statement from the ADA/EASD advocates for the initial combination of two non-insulin agents in patients with a high baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level (≥ 9.0%). Furthermore, the latest American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) treatment algorithm recommends that patients with an HbA1c level of > 7.5% receive combination therapy with metformin plus an additional drug.

We questioned whether initial combination therapy is genuinely more efficacious than monotherapy in terms of glucose control and confirmed safety. To investigate this, we identified two published systematic reviews and meta-analyses. In one meta-analysis that included 15 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the authors found that compared to metformin alone, combination therapy with metformin plus another anti-diabetes drug resulted in statistically significant reductions of 0.43% in HbA1c level and 14.30 mg/dl in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level. In another meta-analysis that included eight RCTs, the authors reported that, compared to metformin monotherapy, initial combination therapy with dipeptidy

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, specifically with respect to insulin therapy, the DC 2024 guidelines recommend initiating bolus insulin using a stepwise approach. Begin with one injection at the largest meal, then introduce additional mealtime injections later if needed. Titrate dosing to reach postprandial glucose targets.

### What next after metformin in type 2 diabetes? Selecting the right drug for the right patient [^112sWpxw]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

Meta-analyses comparing the effectiveness of different drug classes have demonstrated similar clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c for all classes of second-line drugs when they are added to metformin as dual therapy, but there are differences in weight gain and risk of hypoglycemia. However, the real-world effectiveness of these drugs in routine clinical practice is less well understood. The purpose of this study was to explore the real-world efficacy profiles of oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs) following metformin monotherapy, focusing on glycemic control as a function of baseline phenotypic characteristics.

By using data collected from routine primary care practice, the study aims to generate valuable evidence that is currently lacking to inform clinical decision-making on the management of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who have not responded adequately to metformin monotherapy. A better understanding of patient profiles and treatment practices may lead to improved disease management through better targeting of second-line regimens according to demographic and clinical characteristics to achieve optimal clinical outcomes.

### Considerations on blood glucose management in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116ecBXT]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

In recent years, the benefits of more intensive management in preventing or delaying the development and progression of diabetic complications have been well documented. What is not as well documented is how to motivate the person with diabetes to manage the condition, how to set, assess, and quantify glucose goals, and the glucose variables that should be routinely measured. This review discusses the importance of setting targets and communicating them in a way that the patient understands.

- **Balancing glycaemic targets**: When aiming for a glycaemia target, a balance is required between achieving the reduction of complications and causing an increased degree of hypoglycaemia, as well as between what is achievable and what degree of benefit is gained.

Target values given in guidelines should be adapted by the clinician to take into account the patient's susceptibility to hypoglycaemia, stage and type of complications, age and life expectancy, co-morbidity, social environment, understanding of the steps required, and level of commitment to the treatment.

Several suggestions are given regarding possible improvements and amendments to existing guidelines for diabetes management in treating to glucose goal. For example, attention should be drawn to the need to individualize goals and to consider education, long-term support, patient needs, and treatment outcome when formulating diabetes management plans.

- **Glucose variable properties**: The relative properties of the different glucose variables — fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose (PPG), glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)), and glycated protein — are evaluated in terms of their convenience.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: A consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: A consensus statement of the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^116Ytq72]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

If lifestyle intervention and the maximal tolerated dose of metformin fail to achieve or sustain the glycemic goals, another medication should be added within 2–3 months of the initiation of therapy or at any time when the target A1C level is not achieved. Another medication may also be necessary if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated. The consensus regarding the second medication added to metformin was to choose either insulin or a sulfonylurea (Fig. 2). As discussed, the A1C level will determine in part which agent is selected next, with consideration given to the more effective glycemia-lowering agent, insulin, for patients with an A1C level of > 8.5% or with symptoms secondary to hyperglycemia. Insulin can be initiated with a basal (intermediate- or long-acting) insulin (see Fig. 1 for suggested initial insulin regimens). However, many newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients will usually respond to oral medications, even if symptoms of hyperglycemia are present.

- **Further adjustments**: If lifestyle, metformin, and sulfonylurea or basal insulin do not result in the achievement of target glycemia, the next step should be to start, or intensify, insulin therapy (Fig. 1). Intensification of insulin therapy usually consists of additional injections that might include a short- or rapid-acting insulin given before selected meals to reduce postprandial glucose excursions (Fig. 1). When insulin injections are started, insulin secretagogues (sulfonylurea or glinides) should be discontinued or tapered.

### Should A1C targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against [^1151qPSn]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Today's guidelines generally include the proviso that patients who do not meet the A1C goal should be followed every 2–3 months to enable the adjustment of the ongoing treatment regimen. Additionally, they indicate that clinical judgment should be individually tailored. However, this case-by-case approach may not be the best practice for the vast majority of patients, as the progressive nature of diabetes demands prompt and consistent therapeutic attention.

A well-controlled A1C target is crucial, yet 10% of physicians measure it less than once a year. Before the recent enhanced focus on more structured guidelines with specific recommended A1C targets, diabetes management with antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy was less rigorous.

### Should metformin still be the first line of treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus? A comprehensive review and suggested algorithm [^116K8PvA]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Low credibility.

For more than a century, the high occurrences of coronary and peripheral artery diseases in diabetes mellitus patients have been well recognized; despite that, the ability to improve cardiovascular event rates by optimizing glycemic control has remained elusive. Nevertheless, the last decade has seen several cardiovascular outcome clinical trials (CVOTs) of many antihyperglycemic agents that reported promising results for cardiovascular and renal outcomes. This leads to a hot debate on the ideal drug choice for first-line treatment in T2DM. The purpose of this paper is to review the evidence supporting the use of metformin, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, and incretin-based therapies for the management of individuals with T2DM and discuss the rationale for selection.

### The effects of baseline characteristics, glycaemia treatment approach, and glycated haemoglobin concentration on the risk of severe hypoglycaemia: post hoc epidemiological analysis of the ACCORD study [^113DZUrR]. BMJ (2010). High credibility.

To investigate potential determinants of severe hypoglycaemia, including baseline characteristics, in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial and the association of severe hypoglycaemia with levels of glycated haemoglobin (haemoglobin A(1C)) achieved during therapy, a post hoc epidemiological analysis of a double 2x2 factorial, randomised, controlled trial was conducted. The study was set in diabetes clinics, research clinics, and primary care clinics.

Among 10,209 of the 10,251 participants enrolled in the ACCORD study with type 2 diabetes, a haemoglobin A(1C) concentration of 7.5% or more during screening, and aged between 40–79 years with established cardiovascular disease or 55–79 years with evidence of significant atherosclerosis, albuminuria, left ventricular hypertrophy, or two or more additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease (such as dyslipidaemia, hypertension, smoking, or obesity), interventions were divided into intensive (haemoglobin A(1C) < 6.0%) or standard (haemoglobin A(1C) 7.0–7.9%) glucose control.

- **Main outcome measures**: Severe hypoglycaemia was defined as episodes of "low blood glucose" requiring the assistance of another person and documented by either a plasma glucose level less than 2.8 mmol/l (< 50 mg/dl) or symptoms that promptly resolved with oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon.

Results indicated that the annual incidence of hypoglycaemia was 3.14% in the intensive treatment group and 1.03% in the standard glycaemia group. We found significantly increased risks for hypoglycaemia among women (P = 0.0300) and African-Americans (P < 0.0001).

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2011 [^11146rZz]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Therapy for type 2 diabetes**: The ADA and the EASD published an expert consensus statement on the approach to management of hyperglycemia in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Highlights of this approach include intervention at the time of diagnosis with metformin in combination with lifestyle changes (MNT and exercise) and continuing timely augmentation of therapy with additional agents, including early initiation of insulin therapy, as a means of achieving and maintaining recommended levels of glycemic control (i.e. A1C < 7% for most patients). As A1C targets are not achieved, treatment intensification is based on the addition of another agent from a different class. The overall objective is to achieve and maintain glycemic control and to change interventions when therapeutic goals are not being met.

	- The algorithm considered the evidence for A1C-lowering of the individual interventions, their additive effects, and their expense. The precise drugs used and their exact sequence may not be as important as achieving and maintaining glycemic targets safely. Medications not included in the consensus algorithm, due to less glucose-lowering effectiveness, limited clinical data, and/or relative expense, still may be appropriate choices in individual patients to achieve glycemic goals. Initiation of insulin at the time of diagnosis is recommended for individuals presenting with weight loss or other severe hyperglycemic symptoms or signs.

### What next after metformin? A retrospective evaluation of the outcome of second-line, glucose-lowering therapies in people with type 2 diabetes [^112eaBFQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

After the failure of metformin monotherapy, many second-line, glucose-lowering therapies are available to treat people with type 2 diabetes. The objective of the study was to compare clinical outcomes using common alternative regimens.

- **Design and setting**: This was a retrospective cohort study using data from the U.K.-based General Practice Research Database.

- **Patients**: These were primary care patients with type 2 diabetes who had metformin monotherapy as their first treatment and who then initiated relevant second-line, glucose-lowering regimens during the study period from 2000 to 2010. A total of 27,457 patients were prescribed a second-line therapy, of whom 26,278 (95.7%) were prescribed a regimen with 1,000 or more observations.

- **Main outcome measures**: All-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), cancer, and a combined endpoint of any of these were measured. Secondary endpoints were the change in glycosylated hemoglobin between baseline and 12 months. Time to clinical endpoints was compared using Cox proportional hazards models.

- **Results**: Sulfonylurea monotherapy had significantly higher hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality (HR 1.459, 1.207–1.763); MACE (HR 1.578, 1.187–2.099); stroke (HR 1.444, 1.050–1.987); and the combined endpoint (HR 1.381, 1.194–1.597). Metformin plus pioglitazone had significantly lower adjusted HRs for all-cause mortality (HR 0.707, 0.515–0.970) and the combined endpoint (HR 0.747, 0.612–0.911). Mean glycosylated hemoglobin improved between baseline and 12 months for all regimens other than sulfonylurea.

### Pharmacologic glycemic management of type 2 diabetes in adults---2024 update [^112Vy4C8]. Canadian Journal of Diabetes (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for type 2 diabetes mellitus, particularly in terms of initial therapy, the DC 2024 guidelines recommend offering combination therapy as the initial pharmacologic approach in patients exhibiting marked hyperglycemia, such as an HbA1c level greater than 1.5%, even in the absence of metabolic decompensation. The choice of the second agent to be started alongside metformin should be based on the patient's priorities, preferences, and comorbidities.

### Predictors of insulin initiation in patients with type 2 diabetes: An analysis of the Look AHEAD randomized trial [^112hKpAe]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The decision to initiate insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes is a challenging escalation of care that requires an individualized approach. However, the sociodemographic and clinical factors affecting insulin initiation are not well understood.

- **Objective**: We sought to identify patient factors that were independent predictors of insulin initiation among participants in the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) clinical trial.

- **Design**: Retrospective analysis of a randomized clinical trial.

- **Participants**: Beginning in 2001, Look AHEAD enrolled ambulatory U.S. adults with type 2 diabetes who were overweight or obese and had a primary healthcare provider. Participants were randomized (1:1) to an intensive lifestyle intervention or diabetes support and education. This study examined 3,913 participants across the two trial arms who were not using insulin at baseline.

- **Main measures**: We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the association between participant characteristics and time to insulin initiation. We performed time-varying adjustment for HbA1c measured eight times over the 10-year study period, as well as for multiple clinical and socioeconomic factors.

- **Key results**: A total of 1,087 participants (27.8%) initiated insulin during a median follow-up of 8.0 years. Age was inversely associated with insulin initiation (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.88 per 10 years, P = 0.025). The risk of insulin initiation was greater with a higher number of diabetes complications (P < 0.001 for trend); chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease were independent predictors.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: A patient-centered approach: Position statement of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^116YTgsi]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

A patient-centered approach emphasizes the importance of evidence-based advice, which relies on the existence of primary source evidence emerging from clinical trial results in highly selected patients using limited strategies. This approach does not address the range of choices available or the order of use of additional therapies. Even if such evidence were available, the data would show median responses without addressing the crucial question of which patients responded to which therapy and why.

Patient-centered care is defined as an approach to providing care that respects and responds to individual patient preferences, needs, and values, ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions. This principle should organize healthcare for individuals with any chronic disease, especially given our uncertainties in therapy choice or sequence for type 2 diabetes. Ultimately, patients make the final decisions regarding their lifestyle choices and, to some degree, the pharmaceutical interventions they use. Their implementation occurs in the context of the patients' real lives and relies on the consumption of resources, both public and private.

Patient involvement in medical decision-making is a core principle of evidence-based medicine, which requires synthesizing the best available evidence from the literature with the clinician's expertise and the patient's own preferences. During the clinical encounter, the patient's preferred level of involvement should be gauged, and therapeutic choices should be explored.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: A consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: A consensus statement of the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^113K5e1d]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Numerous reviews have focused on the characteristics of specific diabetes interventions. In addition, meta-analyses and reviews have summarized and compared the glucose-lowering effectiveness and other characteristics of the medications. The aim here is to provide enough information to justify the choices of medications, the order in which they are recommended, and the use of combinations of therapies. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of high-quality studies that provide head-to-head comparisons of the ability of the medications to achieve the currently recommended glycemic levels. The authors highly recommend that such studies be conducted. However, even in the absence of rigorous, comprehensive studies that directly compare the efficacy of all available glucose-lowering treatments and their combinations, we feel that there are enough data regarding the characteristics of the individual interventions to provide the guidelines below.

An important intervention that is likely to improve the probability that a patient will have better long-term control of diabetes is to make the diagnosis early, when the metabolic abnormalities of diabetes are usually less severe. Lower levels of glycemia at the time of initial therapy are associated with lower A1C levels over time and decreased long-term complications.

### Initial management of severe hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes: An observational study [^113Dkm39]. Diabetes Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

A new diagnosis of T2D at the time of presenting with an A1C ≥ 12% was found to be a confounding variable in the regression analysis. Therefore, additional post hoc analyses were performed to evaluate results between newly diagnosed and previously diagnosed patients. There were significantly greater reductions in A1C in newly diagnosed patients compared to patients with established diabetes (−6.3% vs. −2.7%, p = 0.001), with A1C differences emerging within 3–5 months from baseline (see Figure 1).

Twenty-one out of 24 newly diagnosed patients (87.5%) were classified as responders, achieving an A1C ≤ 9%, which was significantly higher than the 41.1% of patients with established diabetes (p < 0.001). In addition, 17 (70.9%) of the newly diagnosed population achieved the ADA-recommended goal A1C of ≤ 7%, as opposed to 12 (13.3%) of previously diagnosed patients. This occurred despite the fact that newly diagnosed patients were less likely to be initially treated with insulin (20.8% vs. 73.3%, p < 0.001) or receive insulin at any point throughout the year (29.2% vs. 81.1%, p < 0.001).

Of note, 16 of the 24 patients (67%) started a single non-insulin medication; 14 of those achieved an A1C ≤ 9% and 10 of those achieved the ADA-recommended A1C of ≤ 7% within a year. Details regarding the other initial treatment regimens of newly diagnosed patients are shown in additional tables not provided in this text.

### Metformin — the gold standard in type 2 diabetes: What does the evidence tell us [^117H2PAq]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Metformin is a cornerstone of oral antidiabetic treatment. Recent joint American and European guidelines recommend instituting metformin therapy along with lifestyle modification at the time type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is diagnosed. Metformin acts to reduce hepatic gluconeogenesis and improve glucose uptake, and it may exert protective effects on pancreatic islet cells. Although metformin therapy produces substantial reductions in HbA1c, it does not produce body weight gain, is not associated with substantial risk for hypoglycemia, and has neutral to positive effects on lipids and blood pressure. The major adverse events associated with metformin are gastrointestinal.

T2DM progresses even with initially effective monotherapy, and most patients will, therefore, receive combination therapy. When selecting agents to co-administer with metformin, a physician must consider efficacy in glycemic control, safety, tolerability, and any effects that may compromise overall efficacy (e.g. effects on body weight, lipids, or blood pressure). In this regard, incretin-based therapies have characteristics that make them particularly suitable for add-on therapy with metformin.

### To what target hemoglobin A1c level would you treat this patient with type 2 diabetes? Grand rounds discussion from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center [^113A6kBq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

In the United States, 9.4% of all adults — and 25% of those older than 65 years — have diabetes. Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness and end-stage renal disease and contributes to both microvascular and macrovascular complications. The management of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a common and important activity in primary care internal medicine practice. Measurement of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) provides an estimate of mean blood sugar levels and glycemic control.

The optimal HbA1c target level among various persons with T2D is a subject of controversy. Guidelines regarding HbA1c targets have yielded differing recommendations. In 2018, the American College of Physicians (ACP) published a guideline on HbA1c targets for nonpregnant adults with T2D. In addition to a recommendation to individualize HbA1c target levels, the ACP proposed a level between 7% and 8% for most patients. The ACP also advised deintensification of therapy for patients who have an HbA1c level lower than 6.5% and avoidance of HbA1c-targeted treatment for patients with a life expectancy of less than 10 years. This guidance contrasts with a recommendation from the American Diabetes Association to aim for HbA1c levels less than 7% for many nonpregnant adults and to consider a target of 6.5% if it can be achieved safely.

Here, two experts, a diabetologist and a general internist, discuss how to apply the divergent guideline recommendations to a patient with long-standing T2D and a HbA1c level of 7.8%.

### Treatment patterns and associated factors in 14 668 people with type 2 diabetes initiating a second-line therapy: Results from the global DISCOVER study programme [^111xSLmQ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Optimal glycaemic control, along with the management of co-morbidities such as hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, and prevention of long-term complications, remains the cornerstone of management for patients with type 2 diabetes. Clinical guidelines recommend an HbA1c target of less than 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) for most patients. To achieve this target, most guidelines recommend the use of metformin in conjunction with diet and lifestyle modifications as first-line therapy. When metformin monotherapy fails to control glycaemic levels, a second glucose-lowering drug should be added to metformin in a timely fashion, within 3–6 months of an HbA1c value above target.

The Japanese guidelines take a different approach and recommend monotherapy (metformin or other) in conjunction with medical nutrition therapy as first-line pharmacological treatment; the choice of first-line glucose-lowering agent should be tailored to the patient's characteristics, and metformin is not recommended over any other agent.

Although guidelines suggest using a personalized approach to select second-line therapy based on patient characteristics (e.g. duration of diabetes, presence of co-morbidities, age, and risk of hypoglycaemia), only the consensus report by the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes provides a clear treatment algorithm based on the presence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease.

### Is it time to change the type 2 diabetes treatment paradigm? Yes! GLP-1 RAs should replace metformin in the type 2 diabetes algorithm [^116wj3RU]. Diabetes Care (2017). Low credibility.

Most treatment guidelines, including those from the American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes and the International Diabetes Federation, suggest metformin be used as the first-line therapy after diet and exercise. This recommendation is based on the considerable body of evidence that has accumulated over the last 30 years, supported by clinical grounds based on metformin's affordability and tolerability. As such, metformin is the most commonly used oral antihyperglycemic agent in the U.S. However, with the release of newer agents in recent years, some suggest that modern approaches to disease management should focus on identifying etiology and correcting underlying biological disturbances.

It is argued that interventions should normalize or at least ameliorate the derangements in physiology driving disease manifestation, specifically hyperglycemia. Therefore, therapies targeting glycemia without addressing underlying pathogenic disturbances are unlikely to provide sustained benefits. The field is experiencing an evolving debate regarding the first step in diabetes management, with a call for a new paradigm. Given this controversy, a Point-Counterpoint debate is presented on this issue. In the point narrative below preceding the counterpoint, Drs. Abdul-Ghani and DeFronzo present their argument for a treatment approach based on correcting the underlying issues.

### The importance of glycemic control: How low should we go with HbA1c? Start early, go safe, go low [^112j7B6K]. Journal of Diabetes and its Complications (2010). Low credibility.

Epidemiologic data indicate a continuous relationship between hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and the risk for microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes. Intensive glycemic control reduces the risk of microvascular complications in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Long-term treatment and follow-up studies have shown that initial intensive control is associated with reduced cardiovascular risk. However, recent intervention trials in older, high-risk patients with Type 2 diabetes have not shown a benefit of intensive control in reducing cardiovascular risk over a rather short-term follow-up period of up to 5 years, with some data indicating that intensive control accompanied by hypoglycemia is detrimental in patients with high cardiovascular risk.

Hypoglycemia with antidiabetic agents — primarily insulin and sulphonylureas — is the main limiting factor in achieving desirable levels of glycemic control. Still, the goal in treating both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes should be to safely get HbA1c as close to normal as possible. In Type 2 diabetes, this goal should be tempered for the time being in patients with shorter life expectancy or co-existing cardiovascular disease or other co-morbidities, in whom a target of 7.0–7.5% may be advisable until we can demonstrate that lower targets in such patients can be safely achieved. Newer agents with a lower risk of hypoglycemia — e.g. insulin analogues, incretin mimetics, and incretin enhancers — may form an integral component of strategies for safely achieving lower HbA1c levels.

### Be-SMART (basal early strategies to maximize HbA1c reduction with oral therapy): Expert opinion [^11759jkR]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

This expert opinion focuses on the timely and appropriate use of basal insulin in T2DM treatment, emphasizing early basal insulin initiation and optimization, along with the role of basal insulin-supported oral therapy (BOT). It discusses the seven vital Ts: treatment initiation, timing of administration, transportation and storage, technique of administration, targets for titration, tablets, and tools for monitoring. The 7-T concept serves as a valuable guide for physicians to enhance their understanding and optimize the early use of basal insulin in diabetes treatment, alongside oral antiglycemic agents, to improve outcomes.

- **Treatment initiation**: Timely insulin initiation leads to a long-term reduction in complications and improved outcomes. Clinical evidence from landmark trials such as the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Intervention and Complications Study (DCCT/EDIC) and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) shows that early glucose control reduces the risk of both macro- and microvascular complications. Studies have demonstrated that targeting postprandial glucose (PPG) can help minimize cardiovascular risk.

"Metabolic karma" is a term that effectively explains glycemic legacy in diabetes. It aids in understanding the benefits of achieving tight glycemic and metabolic control in people with diabetes through appropriately individualized patient-centric therapy. Early insulin initiation can help overcome the glucotoxic effects of hyperglycemia, thereby facilitating "β-cell rest" to preserve β-cells.

### Medication-induced hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus: A review of current literature and practical management strategies [^1166vzZP]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Low credibility.

With the increasing global incidence of diabetes mellitus, physicians may encounter more patients with acute and chronic complications of medication-induced hyperglycemia and diabetes. Moreover, medication-induced diabetes may be an important contributing factor to the high rates of diabetes, and recognizing its impact and risk is a critical step in curtailing its effect on the global population. It has long been recognized that multiple classes of medications are associated with hyperglycemia through various mechanisms, and the ability to foresee this and implement adequate management strategies is important.

Different antihyperglycemic medications are better suited to combat the hyperglycemia encountered with different classes of medications. It is critical that physicians can recognize which agents should be used and which medications to avoid in certain types of medication-induced hyperglycemia. This review discusses the evidence behind the main classes of medications that cause hyperglycemia, their mechanism of action, specific agents associated with worsened glycemic control, and, most importantly, management strategies that are tailored to each specific class.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes, 2018. A consensus report by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^114rkHe5]. Diabetes Care (2018). High credibility.

The American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes convened a panel to update the prior position statements, published in 2012 and 2015, on the management of type 2 diabetes in adults. A systematic evaluation of the literature since 2014 informed new recommendations. These include additional focus on lifestyle management and diabetes self-management education and support.

For those with obesity, efforts targeting weight loss, including lifestyle, medication, and surgical interventions, are recommended. With regards to medication management, for patients with clinical cardiovascular disease, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with proven cardiovascular benefit is recommended. For patients with chronic kidney disease or clinical heart failure and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven benefit is recommended. GLP-1 receptor agonists are generally recommended as the first injectable medication.

### Should A1C targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against [^112ncrVR]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Change in A1C levels**: In a study tracking A1C levels in adults with type 2 diabetes within 3–12 months after the initiation of a new diabetes therapy, out of 15,125 patients starting a new regimen, 81% (12,215) maintained their new therapy regimen without further change during the 3- to 12-month post-initiation observation window, failing to achieve target levels. This data is adapted from Karter et al.

- **Effect of care types on A1C**: The study also evaluated the effect of community care vs. university care, as well as standard "usual care" vs. treatment algorithm–driven therapy, on A1C levels. Results were adapted from Fanning et al.

Poor glycemic management and the departure from target A1C levels are often attributed, in part, to clinical inertia and potentially inappropriate individualization of glycemic targets. Although most individuals with type 2 diabetes will require insulin therapy to maintain A1C < 7.0% nine years after diagnosis, there is substantial resistance to its introduction from both patients and physicians. The delay in insulin initiation can present significant challenges, especially when insulin becomes the next necessary treatment option.

The choice of treatment is often influenced by patient characteristics. For instance, in a cohort of 253,238 subjects, physicians were more likely to initiate therapy modifications in response to poor control if the patient had higher baseline risk factor values and a history of coronary artery disease or end-organ damage. In contrast, physicians were less likely to do so if the patient was from a minority group, both instances being inappropriate individualization. Moreover, factors such as hypertension, patient adherence, age, weight, sex (female), and the duration of diabetes increased the odds of therapy modifications.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^111x9jVZ]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically concerning general principles, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining a complete medical evaluation at the initial visit and follow-up, as appropriate, to:

- **Confirm the diagnosis and classify diabetes**: Conduct necessary assessments to accurately diagnose the type of diabetes and its classification.

- **Assess glycemic status and previous treatment**: Review the patient's glycemic levels and any past treatments undertaken.

- **Evaluate for diabetes complications, potential comorbid conditions, and overall health status**: Examine the patient for any diabetes-related complications and other existing health conditions.

- **Identify care partners and support system**: Determine the individuals who will support the patient's care journey.

- **Assess social determinants of health and structural barriers to optimal health and health care**: Analyze factors that influence the patient's health outcomes and access to care.

- **Review risk factor management in the patient with diabetes**: Examine how risk factors are being managed in the patient.

- **Begin engagement with the patient with diabetes in the formulation of a care management plan including initial goals of care**: Collaborate with the patient to develop a care plan that includes the initial objectives.

- **Develop a plan for continuing care**: Establish a consistent and ongoing care strategy to maintain the patient's health over the long term.

### Translating "nondiabetic" A1C levels to clinical practice: The art of medicine [^111Pfq11]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

It is well recognized that there is a significant delay from the time clinical research findings are first reported to when the results become an integral part of clinical care. With the understanding that the prevalence and incidence of diabetes are increasing worldwide, and that the resulting complications are a major contributor to morbidity and mortality, the need for more rapid clinical translation of research findings for diabetes could not be greater.

Specifically, a large amount of clinical research data has been reported in the recent past that is of great interest to the provider caring for individuals with diabetes. Much of the emphasis for research has been devoted to understanding the contribution of hyperglycemia and its treatment on macrovascular disease. For example, within the last decade, we have not only recognized the pivotal role that chronic hyperglycemia, as assessed with A1C levels, contributes to the development of microvascular complications, but we have also recognized the importance of glycemia in contributing to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Observations from large-scale prospective trials over the last couple of years have reported that in high-risk subjects, intensive therapy to lower A1C levels below suggested targets may not be beneficial or may increase mortality. However, as observed from these studies, we also learned that certain subsets of patients with type 2 diabetes may actually benefit from intensive glycemic control. The most recent analysis, reported in May 2010, has now suggested that mortality may actually be greater for those with lower A1C targets.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2024 [^117XMrYB]. Diabetes Care (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hypoglycemia, specifically focusing on initial evaluation, the ADA 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining a prompt reevaluation of the treatment plan. This includes deintensifying or switching diabetes medications if appropriate, in the event of one or more episodes of level 2 or level 3 hypoglycemia.

### An early assessment of the real-world treatment patterns of type 2 diabetes: A comparison to the 2018 ADA/EASD consensus report recommendations [^111MqiS2]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

In conclusion, the prevalence of guideline-aligned treatment use in 2019 was low, particularly since many patients fit into multiple risk groups with established treatment benefits. This research in the real world reveals that SGLT-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are underutilized and are only partially aligned with treatment recommendations. Lower rates of treatment utilization and larger alignment gaps were seen in the Medicare population. Utilization of recommended therapies is lagging in some clinical and demographic groups, representing potential opportunities to make meaningful improvements in the care for patients with type 2 diabetes. Continued monitoring and evaluation of real-world use data will help inform and improve the implementation of guideline-based treatment in actual prescribing practice and perhaps identify where further consensus is needed to enhance effectiveness in diabetes care.

### Current treatment guidelines and glycated haemoglobin goals for type 2 diabetes: Which patients are most likely to benefit from fixed-ratio basal insulin glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist combinations [^111n1nm5]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

The human body requires insulin to function, and no number of non-insulin medications can address absolute insulin deficiency, as in type 1 diabetes, or a relative insulin deficiency, as in some cases of type 2 diabetes (T2D), when the magnitude of that deficiency exceeds endogenous insulin's ability to overcome insulin resistance.

The need for insulin therapy is an assessment that must be done throughout the course of T2D; indeed, most patients will eventually require insulin therapy. However, this is typically later in the course of therapy following progressive loss of beta-cell function. In T2D, insulin therapy should be considered regardless of antihyperglycemic therapy when glycemic markers are very high (i.e. HbA1c more than 10% or blood glucose more than 300 mg/dL) or with symptomatic hyperglycemia (e.g. catabolic symptoms including weight loss, ketonuria, and ketosis). This early stabilization of glycemia requires basal insulin with or without bolus insulin. Following stabilization, non-insulin antihyperglycemic medications (including GLP-1 RAs) should be considered, particularly in cases of new-onset T2D.

The more typical circumstance is the addition of basal insulin following loss of glycemic control with multiple non-insulin agents. These non-insulin medications should include a GLP-1 RA first, given the advantages of weight loss and low hypoglycemia risk versus starting injectable antihyperglycemic therapy with basal insulin. True once-daily basal insulins are preferred over intermediate-acting insulin.

### Relationship between patient medication adherence and subsequent clinical inertia in type 2 diabetes glycemic management [^111VgnZx]. Diabetes Care (2007). Low credibility.

Clinical inertia has been identified as a critical barrier to glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. We assessed the relationship between patients' initial medication adherence and subsequent regimen intensification among patients with persistently elevated A1C levels.

- **Research design and methods**: We analyzed an inception cohort of 2,065 insured patients with type 2 diabetes who were newly started on hypoglycemic therapy and were followed for at least 3 years between 1992 and 2001. Medication adherence was assessed by taking the ratio of medication days dispensed (from pharmacy records) to medication days prescribed (as documented in the medical record) for the first prescribed hypoglycemic drug. Adherence was measured for the period between medication initiation and the next elevated A1C result measured at least 3 months later. Intensification was defined as a dose increase or the addition of a second hypoglycemic agent.

- **Results**: Patients were aged (mean ± SD) 55.4 ± 12.2 years; 53% were men, and 19% were Black. Baseline medication adherence was 79.8 ± 19.3%. Patients in the lowest quartile of adherence were significantly less likely to have their regimens increased within 12 months of their first elevated A1C compared with patients in the highest quartile (27% vs. 37%, respectively, with increased regimens if A1C is elevated, P < 0.001). In multivariate models adjusting for patient demographic and treatment factors, patients in the highest adherence quartile had 53% greater odds of medication intensification after an elevated A1C (95% CI 1.11–1.93, P = 0.0).

### Hospital management of hyperglycemia in the context of COVID-19: Evidence-based clinical considerations [^111p81HD]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Low credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic led to an unprecedented crisis, and early on, it has been shown that diabetes is an important risk factor for complications and mortality in infected patients, as demonstrated by several studies. Moreover, hyperglycemia, regardless of whether patients have diabetes, is associated with poorer outcomes, which suggests that adequate monitoring and treatment of elevated glycemia in the hospital setting can improve patient outcomes.

In patients with COVID-19, glycemic control may be impaired as a consequence of the infection itself, aggravating pre-existing diabetes and potentially precipitating new-onset diabetes, inflammation, or corticosteroid use — a well-established therapy to reduce COVID-19 complications, especially in the intensive care unit. This article reviews the link between diabetes, hyperglycemia, and COVID-19, with a brief review of potential mechanisms, along with emerging evidence on the effect of glycemic control on COVID-19 outcomes, especially in hospital settings.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: A consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: A consensus statement of the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^1168trzw]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The guidelines and treatment algorithm presented here emphasize the following:

- **Achievement and maintenance of near normoglycaemia**: Achieving an A1C level of less than 7.0% is critical.
- **Initial therapy with lifestyle intervention and metformin**: Lifestyle changes combined with metformin should be the first-line treatment.
- **Rapid addition of medications, and transition to new regimens, when target glycemic goals are not achieved or sustained**: It's crucial to quickly adjust the treatment plan if target goals are not met.
- **Early addition of insulin therapy in patients who do not meet target goals**: Insulin therapy should be introduced early for patients whose goals are not being met.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^1148f6ju]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to initial therapy and treatment intensification, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend offering additional weight management interventions. These include the intensification of lifestyle modifications, structured weight management programs, pharmacologic agents, or metabolic surgery, as appropriate. These interventions are targeted at adult patients with T2DM who have not achieved their individualized weight goals.

### Can 'personalized diagnostics' promote earlier intervention for dysglycaemia? Hypothesis ready for testing [^114Jt8NH]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

The risk associated with progression to diabetes, as well as for cardiovascular complications, increases along a continuum rather than being threshold-dependent. How can we identify those with glucose levels in the upper reaches of normal who are most in need of a preventive intervention? With present criteria, we are likely excluding many individuals who have heightened risk. We introduce here the possibility of using a "personalized" glucose profile to encourage early intervention in subjects in whom glucose metabolism is deteriorating (on an individual level) but not yet abnormal on a population-based norm. We further suggest that "personalized profiles" of hemoglobin A1c and basal plasma insulin may also help encourage appropriately early intervention. The fact that first-line therapies are effective, safe, and simple makes these more sensitive approaches very attractive.

### What next after metformin in type 2 diabetes? Selecting the right drug for the right patient [^111MBDGX]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

The evidence from this study can potentially be used to support better targeting of second-line T2DM therapy. The choice of which drug to offer after metformin should be based on the individual person's phenotypic characteristics, including gender, age, BMI, eGFR, and duration of T2DM. It is important to consider their treatment goals, extent of hyperglycemia, comorbidities, and the beneficial and adverse effects of each class of drug to select the right drug for the right patient.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^116qZT8W]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Glycemic management in type 2 diabetes mellitus has become increasingly complex and, to some extent, controversial. This complexity is due to a widening array of pharmacological agents now available, mounting concerns about their potential adverse effects, and new uncertainties regarding the benefits of intensive glycemic control on macrovascular complications. Many clinicians are therefore perplexed as to the optimal strategies for their patients. Consequently, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) convened a joint task force to examine the evidence and develop recommendations for antihyperglycemic therapy in nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes.

Several guideline documents have been developed by members of these organizations and by other societies and federations. However, an update was deemed necessary because of contemporary information on the benefits/risks of glycemic control, recent evidence concerning the efficacy and safety of several new drug classes, the withdrawal/restriction of others, and increasing calls for a move toward more patient-centered care.

This statement has been written incorporating the best available evidence and, where solid support does not exist, using the experience and insight of the writing group, along with an extensive review by additional experts. The document refers to glycemic control, yet this clearly needs to be pursued within a multifactorial risk reduction framework. This stems from the fact that patients with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk.

### Insulin management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115HJqyf]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Insulin therapy is recommended for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and an initial A1C level greater than 9 percent, or if diabetes is uncontrolled despite optimal oral glycemic therapy. Insulin therapy may be initiated as augmentation, starting at 0.3 unit per kg, or as replacement, starting at 0.6 to 1.0 unit per kg.

When using replacement therapy, 50 percent of the total daily insulin dose is given as basal, and 50 percent as bolus, divided up before breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Augmentation therapy can include basal or bolus insulin. Replacement therapy includes basal-bolus insulin and correction or premixed insulin.

Glucose control, adverse effects, cost, adherence, and quality of life need to be considered when choosing therapy. Metformin should be continued if possible because it is proven to reduce all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events in overweight patients with diabetes.

In a study comparing premixed, bolus, and basal insulin, hypoglycemia was more common with premixed and bolus insulin, and weight gain was more common with bolus insulin. Titration of insulin over time is critical to improving glycemic control and preventing diabetes-related complications.

### Sustained hyperglycemia among patients with diabetes: what matters when action is needed [^112aGSFr]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

We used Kaplan-Meier methods to estimate the mean time to sustained hyperglycemia and the annual proportion facing sustained hyperglycemia from inception, meaning the initiation of oral monotherapy. A Cox proportional hazards model was fitted to evaluate patient factors associated with sustained hyperglycemia. Prescription drug copayment, diabetic complications, and cardiac events were evaluated as time-varying covariates, with diabetic complications and cardiac events treated as flags that turned on (and stayed on) from the date of first occurrence. Patients were followed from therapy initiation through the first occurrence of health plan disenrollment, insulin initiation, or until 31 December 2005. Patients were censored at insulin initiation due to the inherent challenges with using claims data alone to monitor changes in insulin dosing.

Among the subset of eligible patients experiencing sustained hyperglycemia with no recent medication intensification during follow-up, Kaplan-Meier methods described the time to medication intensification and appropriate care. For these estimates, patients were followed from the date of their second elevated A1C level through the first occurrence of health plan disenrollment or medication intensification/appropriate care. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the factors associated with the time to medication intensification and appropriate care.

Patient sociodemographic characteristics such as age, race, sex, marital status, type of insurance coverage, and household income, along with lipid-lowering, antihypertensive, and antidepressant medication use, were evaluated.

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes [^112j2fzB]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Metformin is a biguanide that is used as the first-line treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is effective as monotherapy and in combination with other glucose-lowering medications. It is generally well-tolerated with minimal side effects and is affordable. Although the safety and efficacy of metformin have been well-established, there is ongoing discussion regarding whether metformin should remain the first choice for therapy in all patients, as other anti-hyperglycemic medications have proven to have additional benefits in certain populations. It is important to understand the risks and benefits of both metformin and other anti-hyperglycemic medications before making any change in clinical practice.
