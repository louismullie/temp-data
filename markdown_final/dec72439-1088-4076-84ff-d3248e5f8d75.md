## Question

what is the next step in a patient with an AM cortisol of 2 with a normal cosyntropin stimulation test?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage a morning cortisol of 2 µg/dL with a "normal" cosyntropin stimulation test, and what the next step should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the baseline cortisol and timing make the low value meaningful. Then, I should verify exactly what "normal" means for the specific cosyntropin protocol and assay. Next, I will consider why a very low morning cortisol and a normal cosyntropin response can coexist, and whether this suggests central adrenal insufficiency or an early/evolving primary process. After that, I need to check for confounders such as exogenous steroids, assay interference, and binding proteins. Finally, I will outline immediate actions, definitive testing with ITT or metyrapone if needed, and when to treat empirically with education on stress dosing and emergency hydrocortisone, before closing with a succinct plan.

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance of the baseline value. A morning cortisol of 2 µg/dL is profoundly low; wait, let me verify the thresholds I'm using. Guidelines suggest that a morning cortisol less than 3–5 µg/dL is strongly suggestive of adrenal insufficiency, whereas values greater than roughly 15–18 µg/dL generally exclude it, so 2 µg/dL is unequivocally abnormal in a stable outpatient and should not be ignored [^111XaNxD] [^112hy7cT] [^114x2nk8].

> Hold on, I should verify what "normal" means for the cosyntropin test in this context. Standard interpretation uses a peak cortisol of about 18 µg/dL at 30 or 60 minutes after 250 µg cosyntropin, with many labs using 500 nmol/L (18.1 µg/dL) as the cutoff; however, newer LC-MS/MS assays can justify slightly lower thresholds, around 412–485 nmol/L depending on timing and method, so I need to ensure the reported "normal" response meets the assay-specific peak threshold used locally [^1152153f] [^113YYS7U] [^116vrJD3]. Wait, let me double-check timing as well; if only a 30-minute sample was obtained, a subset peaks at 60 minutes, so a missed 60-minute value could undercall the response, meaning the test might not truly be "normal" if the 60-minute cortisol is subthreshold [^1152153f] [^1151CV8T].

> I will now examine the paradox: a very low morning cortisol with a normal cosyntropin response. Mechanistically, this pattern argues against primary adrenal failure, where the adrenal cortex cannot mount an adequate response to ACTH, and points toward central (secondary or tertiary) adrenal insufficiency in which the pituitary can still respond to supraphysiologic ACTH despite chronic ACTH deficiency; however, wait, let me verify the sensitivity of cosyntropin for central AI because a normal test can miss it. The high-dose cosyntropin test has imperfect sensitivity for central AI, with classic data showing normal responses to ACTH despite impaired HPA axis integrity when tested with metyrapone or insulin tolerance, so a normal cosyntropin does not reliably exclude central AI in the right clinical context [^111Qd6FS] [^111Zvrmz].

> But wait, what if this reflects an early or evolving primary adrenal insufficiency rather than central disease. In some conditions, ACTH may already be elevated while the cosyntropin test remains normal, reflecting compensated or early primary AI; in adrenoleukodystrophy surveillance, for example, patients with markedly elevated ACTH but preserved peak cortisol ≥ 18 µg/dL still warrant stress-dose coverage and close follow-up because this can herald progression to overt primary AI, so I should not dismiss the combination of low morning cortisol and high ACTH solely because the short test is "normal" today [^112pvv8B] [^116fMX4k] [^116rsRRT].

> Next, I should review confounders before labeling the axis. I need to check for recent or ongoing exogenous glucocorticoids, including inhaled, topical, intra-articular, or oral agents, and for drugs like mitotane, ketoconazole, or opioids that suppress the HPA axis. I also need to ensure the sample was truly obtained in the morning, assess cortisol-binding globulin and albumin for assay interference, and consider estrogen therapy that can artifactually raise total cortisol and mask deficiency. If any of these are present, I should repeat testing after an appropriate washout and correct interpretation accordingly [^1174L1xv] [^111cmN7E] [^116vrJD3] [^114aoQnR].

> Let me consider immediate actions while I confirm the diagnosis. With a morning cortisol of 2 µg/dL, I should maintain a low threshold to initiate physiologic glucocorticoid replacement, especially if the patient is symptomatic or faces intercurrent stress, and I should provide adrenal crisis education and prescribe emergency injectable hydrocortisone now rather than later. If the patient is unstable or in crisis, treatment must not be delayed for testing, and blood should be drawn for cortisol and ACTH before the first dose when feasible [^112bMYSQ] [^111Ncj1V] [^111cmN7E].

> For definitive diagnosis when cosyntropin is normal but suspicion remains high, I should confirm central AI with a test that interrogates the entire HPA axis. The insulin tolerance test remains the gold standard for secondary AI, with a normal peak cortisol response around 18–20 µg/dL after adequate hypoglycemia; alternatively, the overnight metyrapone test can demonstrate impaired ACTH reserve if 11-deoxycortisol fails to rise appropriately, and these are preferred over relying on cosyntropin when central AI is strongly suspected despite a normal ACTH stimulation test [^114aoQnR] [^111Qd6FS] [^115oCn8Y].

> Hold on, I should verify how to handle an evolving primary process if ACTH is elevated and the stimulation test remains "normal". In that scenario, even without daily glucocorticoids, stress-dose coverage during illness or procedures is prudent, and I should repeat ACTH and cortisol every 3–6 months, recognizing that progression to frank primary AI can occur. Mineralocorticoid status should be assessed with renin and aldosterone when primary AI is on the table [^112pvv8B] [^116fMX4k] [^116rsRRT].

> Putting this together, my next step is to obtain an 8–9 AM ACTH level urgently to differentiate primary from central etiologies, proceed to insulin tolerance testing if ACTH is inappropriately normal or low with persistent clinical suspicion, and start physiologic hydrocortisone replacement now given the profoundly low morning cortisol, alongside stress-dose education and emergency hydrocortisone prescription. If ACTH is markedly elevated with a "normal" cosyntropin, I should treat as possible early primary AI with stress coverage and close biochemical surveillance rather than falsely reassuring the patient that the axis is intact [^113YYS7U] [^114aoQnR] [^111cmN7E] [^112pvv8B].

The next step is to **repeat morning cortisol and ACTH** to confirm the finding and assess consistency, because a single low morning cortisol with a normal cosyntropin test can reflect transient suppression, assay variability, or early secondary adrenal insufficiency [^112hy7cT] [^111XaNxD]. If the repeat morning cortisol remains **< 5 mcg/dL**, proceed to an **insulin tolerance test (ITT)** or metyrapone test to evaluate the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, as the cosyntropin test can be falsely normal in secondary adrenal insufficiency [^111Qd6FS] [^115oCn8Y]. If secondary adrenal insufficiency is confirmed, initiate physiologic glucocorticoid replacement and evaluate for other pituitary hormone deficiencies [^111cmN7E] [^114aoQnR].

---

## Step 1: confirm the abnormal morning cortisol result

Repeat morning cortisol and ACTH to confirm consistency and exclude **laboratory error** or **transient suppression**; obtain the sample between 6:00 and 10:00 AM to minimize diurnal variation [^112hy7cT]. Interpretation: a **cortisol < 5 mcg/dL** with an **inappropriately normal or low ACTH** supports secondary adrenal insufficiency [^112hy7cT] [^111cmN7E].

---

## Step 2: evaluate for secondary adrenal insufficiency

Because the cosyntropin test assesses adrenal responsiveness to ACTH and can be normal despite hypothalamic or pituitary disease, use **dynamic testing** to evaluate the entire HPA axis [^111Qd6FS] [^115oCn8Y].

- **Insulin tolerance test (ITT)**: gold standard for secondary adrenal insufficiency; a peak cortisol < 18 mcg/dL indicates impaired HPA axis function [^114aoQnR].

- **Metyrapone test**: alternative when ITT is contraindicated; inadequate rise in 11-deoxycortisol indicates secondary adrenal insufficiency [^1174L1xv] [^1112hXHb].

- **Low-dose ACTH test (1 mcg)**: more sensitive than standard-dose for secondary adrenal insufficiency, but not widely available and requires careful preparation [^117LRMPg] [^113D4urs] [^1174L1xv].

---

## Step 3: evaluate for other pituitary hormone deficiencies

If secondary adrenal insufficiency is confirmed, assess for **additional pituitary hormone deficits**:

- **Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4)**: evaluate central hypothyroidism [^114x2nk8].

- **Gonadotropins (LH, FSH) and sex hormones**: assess hypogonadism [^114x2nk8].

- **Prolactin**: elevated in prolactinomas or hypothalamic disease [^notfound].

- **Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)**: screen for growth hormone deficiency [^111Zvrmz].

---

## Step 4: initiate appropriate hormone replacement therapy

If secondary adrenal insufficiency is confirmed, **initiate glucocorticoid replacement** (e.g. hydrocortisone 15–25 mg/day in divided doses) and adjust based on clinical response and stress needs [^111cmN7E]. Provide **patient education** on stress dosing, sick-day rules, and emergency hydrocortisone injection [^112ik7E1].

---

## Step 5: address underlying causes and monitor response

Identify and treat underlying pituitary or hypothalamic causes (e.g. tumors, infiltrative disease, or prior pituitary surgery) [^111cmN7E]. Schedule regular follow-up to monitor hormone levels, clinical status, and adherence, and **adjust replacement therapy** as needed [^112ik7E1].

---

## Summary of recommended next steps

1. **Repeat morning cortisol and ACTH**: Confirm persistent low cortisol and assess ACTH
2. **Perform ITT or metyrapone test**: Evaluate HPA axis integrity
3. **Assess other pituitary hormones**: Identify additional deficiencies
4. **Initiate glucocorticoid replacement**: Treat secondary adrenal insufficiency
5. **Identify and treat underlying causes**: Address etiology and monitor response

---

A morning cortisol of 2 mcg/dL with a normal cosyntropin test suggests **secondary adrenal insufficiency**. The next step is to **confirm the result**, **evaluate the HPA axis** with ITT or metyrapone testing, assess for other pituitary deficits, and start glucocorticoid replacement while addressing the underlying cause [^1174L1xv] [^114aoQnR].

Dynamic tests for diagnosing suspected hypopituitarism — adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) axis assessment includes insulin tolerance and corticotropin (ACTH 1–24, cosyntropin) stimulation with assay-dependent cortisol cutoffs. In insulin tolerance testing, administer insulin, 0.05–0.15 U/kg iv, with the expected normal response that glucose should drop < 40 mg/dL (2.2 mmol/L) and peak cortisol should be > 500–550 nmol/L (> 18.1–20 µg/dL) depending on assay. For the standard-dose corticotropin test, administer ACTH 1–24 (cosyntropin), 250 µg im or iv with cortisol sampled at 0, 30, and 60 min, and cortisol should be at 30 or 60 min > 500–550 nmol/L (> 18.1–20 µg/dL) depending on assay. For the low-dose corticotropin test, administer ACTH 1–24 (cosyntropin), 1 µg iv with samples at 0 and 30 min, and cortisol should be at 30 min > 500 nmol/L (18.1 µg/dL) depending on assay.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — biochemical confirmation pathway: In patients receiving supraphysiologic glucocorticoid doses and at high risk of adrenal insufficiency, taper down glucocorticoids to physiologic replacement doses (avoid dexamethasone), then in Scenario 2 measure early-morning serum cortisol 24 hours after the last glucocorticoid dose. A likelihood bar from HIGH to LOW displays cortisol thresholds at 150 nmol/L 5.0 μg/dL and 300 nmol/L 10.0 μg/dL. Actions presented are to continue glucocorticoid replacement and re-check early-morning cortisol after a few months, continue glucocorticoid replacement and re-check early-morning cortisol after a few weeks and consider dynamic testing, or stop glucocorticoid replacement. Separately, we suggest that if the result is < 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after a few months.

Case 1

An 18-year-old woman contacted her general practitioner because of nausea and abdominal pain. She was previously well except vitiligo, which developed at 3 years of age. An elevated TSH value was found (20 mIE/L, range 0.35–4.9), and she was started on a replacement dose with L-thyroxine. Initially she felt better, but then her symptoms worsened, and she would often throw up after breakfast before going to school. She was referred to an endocrinologist who on suspicion of adrenal insufficiency tested adrenocortical function. In a morning sample he found a serum cortisol at 288 nmol/L (range 60–600), plasma ACTH 5.3 pmol/L (range < 11.6), plasma renin 55.8 mIE/L (range 4.4–46.1), and serum aldosterone at 75.1 pmol/L (range 49–1086), all in the normal range except a slightly elevated plasma renin. However, assay of 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies revealed an extremely elevated value at > 5000 U/mL (range < 1.0).

Due to persisting symptoms, a standard 0.25 mg cosyntropin test was performed 6 months later. Cortisol climbed from 411 to 595 and 602 nmol/L after 30 and 60 minutes, respectively. ACTH in the basal test was 10.1 pmol/L, renin 149 mIE/L, and aldosterone 90.4 pmol/L. TSH was still elevated, and the L-thyroxine dose was increased. She was also started on fludrocortisone since renin was now clearly elevated and aldosterone relatively low. She was also informed of the risk of overt adrenal insufficiency and prescribed cortisone acetate to use in case she got worse. Fludrocortisone improved her nausea and alleviated dizziness, but she still vomited at least twice a week.

During the next 6 months she moved to another city to start college studies. Her mother, who saw her occasionally, noted darkening of the skin. She was then referred to our hospital and when seen at the first appointment, ACTH levels were strikingly elevated (> 278 pmol/L). The corresponding morning cortisol was 209 nmol/L. A new cosyntropin test revealed serum cortisol at 233 nmol/L before and 234 and 225 nmol/L after 30 and 60 minutes, respectively. Daily cortisone acetate replacement was started. Review of her history revealed considerable salt craving.

Diagnosis and genetics in congenital adrenal hyperplasia — In infants with positive newborn screens for congenital adrenal hyperplasia we recommend referral to pediatric endocrinologists (if regionally available) and evaluation by cosyntropin stimulation testing as needed; in symptomatic individuals past infancy, we recommend screening with an early-morning (before 8 AM) baseline serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone measurement by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry; in individuals with borderline 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels, we recommend obtaining a complete adrenocortical profile after a cosyntropin stimulation test to differentiate 21-hydroxylase deficiency from other enzyme defects; and in individuals with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, we suggest genotyping only when results of the adrenocortical profile after a cosyntropin stimulation test are equivocal, or cosyntropin stimulation cannot be accurately performed, or for purposes of genetic counseling.

Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) adrenal surveillance — baseline testing and sampling procedures: In this age group, the recommendation is to monitor ACTH and cortisol every 3 to 4 months under the age of 2 years. Because diurnal variation may not be established in early infancy before 1 year of age, timing of baseline cortisol and ACTH may not be as important compared with later childhood. ACTH should be drawn, placed on ice, and centrifuged, and then separated plasma should either be frozen or immediately processed for most accurate results. If there is clinical concern for adrenal insufficiency, high-dose cosyntropin stimulation (15 μg/kg or 125 μg cosyntropin) testing should be performed without delay. Stimulation testing should also be considered in place of baseline laboratory tests if additional follow-up will be difficult for the patient. If intravenous access is not possible, cosyntropin can be intramuscularly administered and cortisol concentrations measured from blood obtained by heel stick. Samples for cortisol measurement should be drawn prior to and 60 minutes after injection of cosyntropin and ACTH only measured prior to injection.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^113uLZzA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Once glucocorticoids are tapered down to physiologic replacement doses, the panel suggests two possible approaches for the discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy (Fig. 2). Selecting one approach over the other might be driven by patient-related aspects including co-morbidities, co-medication, age and pre-test probability for adrenal insufficiency or by the medical context such as training and experience of the treating clinician or accessibility to laboratory diagnostics. There are no studies showing the superiority of any of these approaches in terms of clinical outcomes or cost-benefit.

Figure 2.
Proposed approach to systemic glucocorticoid discontinuation.

Patients may gradually taper glucocorticoids while being cautiously monitored for clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency. If the patient experiences signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, glucocorticoid regimen should be restarted and not discontinued until recovery of HPA axis is documented. If the patient does not experience any symptoms, the tapering proceeds until glucocorticoid discontinuation.

Alternatively, patients may undergo testing with a morning serum cortisol (sample collected between 8:00 and 9:00) for the determination of HPA axis recovery (R 2.7). If adrenal insufficiency is documented, exogenous glucocorticoid should not be reduced below the lower end of physiologic replacement dose ranges to ensure adequate replacement for adrenal insufficiency, yet still providing a stimulus for HPA-axis recovery. Patients should be retested according to recommendations in 2.7. and further significant dose reduction should only occur with indication of HPA-axis recovery.

R 2.7 — If confirmation of recovery of the HPA axis is desired, we recommend morning serum cortisol as the first test. The value of morning serum cortisol should be considered as a continuum (Considering this continuum, suggested cut-offs in nmol/l and μg/dL are not exact conversions but have been rounded to improve clinical applicability in an international context.), with higher values more indicative of HPA axis recovery. (⊕○○○)

As a guide:

we suggest that the test indicates recovery of the HPA axis if cortisol is > 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL and glucocorticoids can be stopped safely;
we suggest that if the result is between 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL and 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after an appropriate time period (usually weeks to months);
we suggest that if the result is < 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after a few months.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112ik7E1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

This clinical practice guideline addresses the diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency.

Participants

The Task Force included a chair, selected by The Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of the Endocrine Society, eight additional clinicians experienced with the disease, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The co-sponsoring associations (European Society of Endocrinology and the American Association for Clinical Chemistry) had participating members. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration in connection with this review.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to determine the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

Consensus Process

The evidence used to formulate recommendations was derived from two commissioned systematic reviews as well as other published systematic reviews and studies identified by the Task Force. The guideline was reviewed and approved sequentially by the Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee and Clinical Affairs Core Committee, members responding to a web posting, and the Endocrine Society Council. At each stage, the Task Force incorporated changes in response to written comments.

Conclusions

We recommend diagnostic tests for the exclusion of primary adrenal insufficiency in all patients with indicative clinical symptoms or signs. In particular, we suggest a low diagnostic (and therapeutic) threshold in acutely ill patients, as well as in patients with predisposing factors. This is also recommended for pregnant women with unexplained persistent nausea, fatigue, and hypotension. We recommend a short corticotropin test (250 μg) as the "gold standard" diagnostic tool to establish the diagnosis. If a short corticotropin test is not possible in the first instance, we recommend an initial screening procedure comprising the measurement of morning plasma ACTH and cortisol levels. Diagnosis of the underlying cause should include a validated assay of autoantibodies against 21-hydroxylase. In autoantibody-negative individuals, other causes should be sought. We recommend once-daily fludrocortisone (median, 0.1 mg) and hydrocortisone (15–25 mg/d) or cortisone acetate replacement (20–35 mg/d) applied in two to three daily doses in adults. In children, hydrocortisone (∼8 mg/m²/d) is recommended. Patients should be educated about stress dosing and equipped with a steroid card and glucocorticoid preparation for parenteral emergency administration. Follow-up should aim at monitoring appropriate dosing of corticosteroids and associated autoimmune diseases, particularly autoimmune thyroid disease.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^117PTETq]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Adrenal — primary adrenal insufficiency (AI) during immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy: Evaluate AM levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol, with ACTH flagged if > 2× ULN and cortisol if < 3 μg/dL, obtain a basic metabolic panel plus renin and aldosterone, and for indeterminate results consider standard dose ACTH stimulation testing defined by AM cortisol > 3 μg/dL and < 15 μg/dL; adrenal CT is advised for metastasis or hemorrhage. For all grades, Referral to endocrinology and Education on steroid stress dosing, emergency injections, and a medical alert bracelet or necklace, accessory, or system are advised. For G1 (asymptomatic or mild symptoms), Consider holding ICI until patient is stabilized on replacement hormone; initiate hydrocortisone 15–20 mg in divided doses, titrate to maximum of 30 mg daily total dose, and add fludrocortisone starting dose 0.05–0.1 mg/d with renin response targeted to the upper half of the reference range. For G2 (moderate symptoms, able to perform activities of daily living), provide outpatient corticosteroid treatment at 2–3 times maintenance (eg, hydrocortisone 30–50 mg total dose or prednisone 20 mg daily), initiate fludrocortisone 0.05–0.1 mg/d, and decrease stress dose corticosteroids down to maintenance after 2 days. For G3–4 (severe or life-threatening, unable to perform activities of daily living), Hold ICI until patient is stabilized on replacement hormone, provide inpatient management with Normal saline (at least 2L), IV stress dose hydrocortisone 50–100 mg Q 6–8 hours initial dosing, and taper stress dose corticosteroids down to oral maintenance over 5–7 days. Additional considerations include hydrocortisone diurnal dosing — Typically, 2/3 of the dose is given in the morning and 1/3 in the early afternoon — and dose equivalence where Hydrocortisone 20 mg is equivalent to prednisone 5 mg.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — morning serum cortisol testing is the recommended test to examine for recovery of HPA axis following glucocorticoid therapy, obtained as a morning serum cortisol level measured between 8:00 and 9:00 AM after holding glucocorticoid dose for at least 24 hours and only after reaching a physiologic equivalent daily dose such as prednisone 4–6 mg daily or hydrocortisone 15–25 mg total daily dose. Given assay variability, we consider cortisol values greater than 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) as a reasonable threshold to indicate recovery of HPA function following glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency; in patients with higher serum cortisol levels but below 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL), HPA axis recovery is possible and we suggest that the most cost-effective and practical strategy is that these patients continue with physiologic daily dose equivalent glucocorticoid replacement and have morning serum cortisol re-checked every few weeks until recovery occurs, and if cortisol levels remain between 150 nmol/L (5 μg/dL) and 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL), dynamic testing can be considered. Supporting data include that in suspected primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency, morning cortisol ≥ 354 nmol/L (12.8 μg/dL) predicted normal adrenal function with 100% sensitivity, and in patients recovering from endogenous hypercortisolism, morning cortisol ≥ 276 nmol/L (10.0 μg/dL) was associated with no reported symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome or instances of adrenal crises.

### Adrenal insufficiency in adults: a review [^111cmN7E]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Adrenal insufficiency is a syndrome of cortisol deficiency and is categorized as primary, secondary, or glucocorticoid induced. Although primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency are rare, affecting less than 279 per 1 million individuals, glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is common.

Observations

Primary adrenal insufficiency, which involves deficiency of all adrenocortical hormones, is caused by autoimmune destruction, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, pharmacological inhibition (eg, high doses of azole antifungal therapy), infection (eg, tuberculosis, fungal infections), or surgical removal of adrenal cortical tissue. Secondary adrenal insufficiency is caused by disorders affecting the pituitary gland, such as tumors, hemorrhage, inflammatory or infiltrative conditions (eg, hypophysitis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis), surgery, radiation therapy, or medications that suppress corticotropin production, such as opioids. Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is caused by administration of supraphysiological doses of glucocorticoids. Patients with adrenal insufficiency typically present with nonspecific symptoms, including fatigue (50%-95%), nausea and vomiting (20%-62%), and anorexia and weight loss (43%-73%). Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should be suspected in patients who have recently tapered or discontinued a supraphysiological dose of glucocorticoids. Early-morning (approximately 8 am) measurements of serum cortisol, corticotropin, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) are used to diagnose adrenal insufficiency. Primary adrenal insufficiency is typically characterized by low morning cortisol levels (< 5 µg/dL), high corticotropin levels, and low DHEAS levels. Patients with secondary and glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency typically have low or intermediate morning cortisol levels (5–10 µg/dL) and low or low-normal corticotropin and DHEAS levels. Patients with intermediate early-morning cortisol levels should undergo repeat early-morning cortisol testing or corticotropin stimulation testing (measurement of cortisol before and 60 minutes after administration of cosyntropin, 250 µg). Treatment of adrenal insufficiency involves supplemental glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone, 15–25 mg daily, or prednisone, 3–5 mg daily). Mineralocorticoids (eg, fludrocortisone, 0.05–0.3 mg daily) should be added for patients with primary adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal crisis, a syndrome that can cause hypotension and shock, hyponatremia, altered mental status, and death if untreated, can occur in patients with adrenal insufficiency who have inadequate glucocorticoid therapy, acute illness, and physical stress. Therefore, all patients with adrenal insufficiency should be instructed how to increase glucocorticoids during acute illness and prescribed injectable glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone, 100 mg intramuscular injection) to prevent or treat adrenal crisis.

Conclusions and Relevance

Although primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency are rare, glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is a common condition. Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency involves early-morning measurement of cortisol, corticotropin, and DHEAS. All patients with adrenal insufficiency should be treated with glucocorticoids and instructed how to prevent and treat adrenal crisis.

Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) — cosyntropin (corticotropin) test protocol and interpretation: The corticotropin stimulation test is regarded as the diagnostic "gold standard" for primary adrenal insufficiency. Common practice measures cortisol before and 30 or 60 minutes after iv or im bolus administration of 250 μg corticotropin, and the standard-dose (250 μg) short test is widely validated. A low-dose 1 μg variant exists, but available data indicate the 1-μg test does not provide better diagnostic accuracy than the 250-μg test. Interpretation relies on the peak stimulated serum cortisol concentration; results are not significantly affected by diurnal variations so the test can be performed without time constraints, and results may be severely affected in rare conditions such as corticosteroid-binding globulin deficiency, glucocorticoid resistance, and hypersensitivity.

### The biochemical diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency with modern cortisol assays: reappraisal in the setting of opioid exposure and hospitalization [^113n8MFe]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

We aimed to (1) examine the diagnosis of opioid-induced adrenal insufficiency, and (2) investigate the diagnostic value of a morning cortisol < 83nmol/L (3µg/dl) for the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency, using newer more specific cortisol assays and cut-offs.

Design

Retrospective study (5/2015–10/2020).

Participants

Cohort 1 (N = 75): adults who underwent cosyntropin stimulation testing and opioid exposure for > 30 days. Cohort 2 (N = 854): adults, with or without opioid exposure, who had a morning cortisol level measured the same day as stimulation testing.

Measurements

Peak cortisol during cosyntropin stimulation testing. Sensitivity and specificity of morning serum cortisol for adrenal insufficiency.

Results

The prevalence of adrenal insufficiency in patients with chronic opioid exposure who underwent cosyntropin stimulation testing was 4.0% using a cortisol cutoff of < 405nmol/L (14.7µg/dl) versus 19% using the traditional cutoff of < 500nmol/L (18.1µg/dl). For hospitalized patients with and without opioid-exposure, 14 of 22 (64%) patients with morning cortisol levels of < 83nmol/L (3µg/dl) passed cosyntropin stimulation testing. A morning cortisol level of < 348nmol/L (12.6µg/dl) had 100% sensitivity (95% confidence interval: 84.5%-100%) for the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency.

Conclusion

Applying a cutoff of < 405nmol/L (14.7µg/dl), opioid-induced adrenal insufficiency is rare. Nearly 1 out of 6 patients would be reclassified as having adrenal insufficiency applying the guideline-recommended cutoff of < 500nmol/L (18.1µg/dl). Serum morning cortisol < 83nmol/L (3µg/dl) is not a valid diagnostic test for adrenal insufficiency in hospitalized patients, whether or not receiving opioids.

### Genetic risk analysis of a patient with fulminant autoimmune type 1 diabetes mellitus secondary to combination ipilimumab and nivolumab immunotherapy [^114wkQJK]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

As the patient had demonstrated evidence of multiple endocrinopathies, further evaluation of his pituitary function was conducted. This included a prolactin of 6.51 ng/mL (normal 2.64–13.13 ng/mL), LH of 3.8 mIU/mL (normal 1.4–7.7 mIU/mL), FSH of 17.8 mIU/mL (normal 1.3–19.3 mIU/mL), free thyroxine of 0.84 ng/dL (normal 0.52–1.21 ng/dL), testosterone of 64 ng/dL (normal > 300 ng/dL), and free testosterone of 1.9 ng/dL (normal > 9 ng/dL). A subsequent brain MRI performed with pituitary protocol was unremarkable and unchanged compared with a baseline study. An early morning Cosyntropin stimulation test was conducted in October of 2014 following a 5 month maintenance dosage of prednisone at 10 mg daily which was tapered to discontinuation over a period of 6 weeks prior to stimulation testing. Baseline testing of ACTH and cortisol remained undetectable while the cortisol level post-stimulation was inappropriately low at 1.8 microgram/dL (normal 5.0–25.0 microgram/dL). Together, these findings were felt to be consistent with hypophysitis.

In light of the multiple autoinflammatory toxicities, the patient was removed from the study and placed on surveillance comprised of a physical exam, lab assessment, and PET CT imaging every 3 months in addition to dermatologic surveillance every 6 months. Soon thereafter, it was revealed that the patient had been randomized to the combination ipilimumab and nivolumab immunotherapy regimen. His follow-up exams continued to reveal a stable 1.1 cm nodule with low-level FDG avidity within the left gastrocnemius muscle with no other evidence of disease recurrence until September of 2014 when the left gastrocnemius lesion was no longer FDG avid. As of August 2016, the patient has been without evidence of melanoma recurrence and continues on an insulin regimen with an undetectable C-peptide level.

Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) diagnosis — testing guidance states that the task force was unable to reach agreement on a single test that can reliably diagnose CIRCI, although delta cortisol (change in baseline cortisol at 60 min of < 9 μg/dL) after cosyntropin (250 μg) administration and a random plasma cortisol of < 10 μg/dL may be used by clinicians. We suggest against using plasma-free cortisol or salivary cortisol level over plasma total cortisol (conditional, very low quality of evidence).

### Secondary adrenal insufficiency and growth hormone deficiency in patients with fibromyalgia [^115oCn8Y]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients and Methods

We performed a retrospective review of the electronic medical records of all patients with ITT performed at our institution between July 1997 and August 2019 (n = 482). Patients were included in our study if they had a diagnosis of fibromyalgia and demonstrated an abnormal response to insulin during ITT, defined as a peak cortisol < 18 mcg/dL. Patients were excluded if they had other reasons for SAI, including steroid exposure in the last 6 months, daily opioid use ≥ 60 morphine equivalents, or pituitary/hypothalamic pathology. No patients were on oral estrogen. Fibromyalgia was confirmed through the use of clinical notes. Symptoms and exam findings were used to support the diagnosis, but individual widespread pain index or tender point exam scores are not available as this was a retrospective study.

ITT is the gold standard test for the diagnosis of SAI and uses an established protocol to ensure consistency of administering medications, monitoring vital signs, and drawing blood for laboratory testing. This test allows for a concomitant assessment of GH deficiency. In brief, ITT is performed at the Endocrine Testing Center at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota by administering a weight-based dose of intravenous insulin after baseline labs are collected. Capillary glucose is checked every 2–5 minutes according to a protocol. The next set of labs is obtained when capillary glucose is < 40 mg/dL and patient has symptoms of hypoglycemia (around 30 minutes). Once blood is collected, the patient is given oral glucose, and a 10% dextrose infusion is started and continued until the glucose is > 70 mg/dL at two time points at least 5 minutes apart. Blood samples are collected at baseline and 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after hypoglycemia occurs to measure glucose, cortisol, and GH. Peak cortisol of 18 mcg/dl or more and GH of 4 ng/mL or more are considered normal. We chose a threshold of < 4 ng/dL to diagnose GH deficiency on ITT as guidelines recommended using a cutoff of 3.0 to 5.1 ng/dL. Cosyntropin testing is performed in the morning (8–10 am) at the Endocrine Testing Center. In brief, 1 or 250 µg Cosyntropin (Mylan Institutional, Amsterdam, Netherlands) is reconstituted with 2 mL 0.9% sodium chloride and administered over 30 seconds. Samples at baseline and 30 and 60 minutes following injection are obtained and analyzed for total cortisol measurements. Peak cortisol of 18 mcg/dl or more are considered normal.

### The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112uPwWn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline — initial diagnostic testing and evaluation for suspected Cushing's syndrome: After excluding exogenous glucocorticoid use, we recommend testing for Cushing's syndrome in patients with multiple and progressive features compatible with the syndrome and in patients with adrenal incidentaloma. We recommend initial use of one test with high diagnostic accuracy (urine cortisol, late night salivary cortisol, 1 mg overnight or 2 mg 48-h dexamethasone suppression test), and we recommend that patients with an abnormal result see an endocrinologist and undergo a second test, either one of the above or, in some cases, a serum midnight cortisol or dexamethasone-CRH test. Patients with concordant abnormal results should undergo testing for the cause of Cushing's syndrome, patients with concordant normal results should not undergo further evaluation, and we recommend additional testing for patients with discordant results, normal responses suspected of cyclic hypercortisolism, or initially normal responses who accumulate additional features over time.

### Diagnostic accuracy of basal cortisol level to predict adrenal insufficiency in cosyntropin testing: results from an observational cohort study with 804 patients [^116XprXd]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulation testing is the current standard for assessing primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency (AI). We aimed to investigate the value of basal cortisol level for prediction of AI.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed 804 consecutive patients who had high-dose (250 μg, HDT) or low-dose (1 μg, LDT) ACTH testing as part of their diagnostic work-up. Site-specific cut-off levels for AI were < 550 in and < 500 nmol/L in HDT and LDT, respectively.

Results

Overall, 70/400 (17.5%) in the LDT group and 118/404 (29.2%) in the HDT group showed an insufficient increase of cortisol and were categorized as AI. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed an overall area under the curve (AUC) for basal cortisol of 0.88, which was comparable in LDT (area under the curve [AUC] 0.88) and HDT (AUC 0.88). If basal cortisol levels were ≥ 450 nmol/L (n = 234/804, 29.1%), the negative predictive value to rule out AI was 98.7%. If cortisol was ≤ 100 nmol/L (n = 69/804, 8.6%) the positive predictive value was 93.2% to rule in AI. There was a minimal additional value of the 30-minute cortisol level in HDT as compared to the 60-minute result, as well as for delta values.

Conclusion

Basal cortisol levels ≤ 100 and ≥ 450 nmol/L were found in almost half of patients tested for possible AI and had high diagnostic accuracy, abolishing the need for formal ACTH testing. The 30-minute cortisol value in HDT did not increase diagnostic accuracy. These data may help guide clinicians when testing can safely be omitted, thereby reducing expenses and simplifying test protocols.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^115oasT8]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

European Society of Endocrinology/Endocrine Society guideline — dynamic testing for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency can be considered when cortisol remains indeterminate, with no evidence that a specific test is superior; options include 250 µg ACTH (1–24), overnight metyrapone test, and insulin tolerance test; in primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency, a peak cortisol level < 500 nmol/L (< 18.1 µg/dL) at 30 or 60 minutes is indicative; the panel suggests against the use of the 1 µg ACTH (1–24) test because it does not provide better diagnostic accuracy than the standard 250 µg and there are no commercially available preparations; if dynamic testing is chosen, glucocorticoid therapy should be held for at least 24 hours before testing to avoid interference.

Corticotropin stimulation testing for suspected adrenal insufficiency — We suggest the standard dose (250 μg for adults and children ≥ 2 y of age, 15 μg/kg for infants, and 125 μg for children < 2 y of age) iv corticotropin stimulation (30 or 60 min) test over other existing diagnostic tests to establish the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency, and peak cortisol levels below 500 nmol/L (18 μg/dL) at 30 or 60 minutes indicate adrenal insufficiency (2|⊕⊕⊕○).

### Pituitary society guidance: pituitary disease management and patient care recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic-an international perspective [^114x2nk8]. Pituitary (2020). High credibility.

Hypopituitarism diagnosis — initial testing and thresholds include early morning fasted pituitary profiles, prioritized screening for diabetes insipidus (DI), and cortisol cutoffs for adrenal insufficiency (AI). An early morning fasted pituitary profile should be arranged, and if DI is strongly suspected, a non-fasted morning blood sample for serum sodium and osmolality should be collected first because patients with complete DI often present with hypernatremia, avoiding the need for a protracted water deprivation test. For AI, a cortisol level < 3 µg/dL indicates AI while a cortisol level > 15 µg/dL reliably excludes AI, with dynamic testing ordinarily used for intermediate results but possibly delayed during the pandemic. Central hypothyroidism is suggested by a low free T4 with low/normal TSH, and central hypogonadism is suggested by low serum testosterone with low/normal gonadotrophins in non-obese males or low estradiol with low/normal gonadotrophins in pre-menopausal women with amenorrhea or in post-menopausal females.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^111LrPaQ]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

A low serum cortisol (eg, morning cortisol < 140 nmol/L [< 5 mcg/dL], depending on the cortisol assay) in patients without recent confounding medication (eg, exogenous glucocorticoids), is usually suggestive of primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. The gold-standard investigation for primary adrenal insufficiency is an ACTH 1–24 stimulation test (also known as the short synacthen test or the cosyntropin stimulation test), in which 250 mcg of corticotropin is administered parenterally, and cortisol levels measured after 30 and 60 minutes. A peak cortisol concentration below the local laboratory cutoff for the assay (eg, stimulated cortisol < 500 nmol/L [< 18 mcg/dL]) is consistent with primary adrenal insufficiency. A random serum cortisol concentration within the lower part of the normal range may be falsely reassuring in patients who are acutely unwell, who would be expected to be mounting a stress response of cortisol secretion. Therefore, a screening cutoff of morning cortisol greater than 300 nmol/L (> 10.9 mcg/dL) to exclude adrenal insufficiency in hyponatremia is recommended by some experts based on prospective data. Depending on the etiology and clinical presentation, a cortisol level greater than 300 nmol/L may still be inappropriate for a patient under physiologic stress, so this threshold does not definitively exclude pathology, although whether more subtle hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis insufficiency causes hyponatremia is not clear. Those with a morning cortisol less than 300 nmol/L (< 10.9 mcg.dL) may proceed to further evaluation with ACTH and a short synacthen test, unless acutely unwell. Empirical stress-dosing with hydrocortisone should be considered in hyponatremic patients with clinical features suspicious for adrenal insufficiency, a history of long-term exogenous glucocorticoid therapy, and those who are hypotensive or otherwise unwell, to avoid delaying potentially life-saving treatment. There is no universal dosing recommendation for glucocorticoid replacement in this circumstance, but in general patients with hemodynamic instability may benefit from higher IV dosing (eg, 100 mg hydrocortisone stat, then 50 mg IV every 6 hours), with care to monitor for overcorrection of serum sodium. Water diuresis following initiation of glucocorticoid therapy is supportive of adrenal insufficiency as the underlying cause of hyponatremia. Consequently, there is a high risk of serum sodium overcorrection, and requirement for relowering therapy if correction targets are exceeded (see "In Case of Overcorrection: Relowering of Plasma Sodium"). When correcting secondary adrenal insufficiency in patients with pituitary disease, it is important to be aware of the possibility of unmasking underlying AVP deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) concealed by the stimulation of residual AVP production by cortisol deficiency — which can exacerbate overcorrection risk further.

Follow-up monitoring during rhGH therapy — monitoring should include the following at approximately 6- to 12-month intervals: serum IGF-1, fasting glucose or hemoglobin A1c, fasting lipids, BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, serum-free T4, and lumbar spine and total hip bone mineral density measured by DXA when clinically indicated. Additionally, evaluation of overall clinical status including assessment of QoL using the QoL-AGHDA questionnaire at 12-month intervals is suggested, and cardiovascular parameters to consider monitoring during follow-up include systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate, with more detailed examinations such as electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and carotid echo-Doppler performed if clinically indicated according to local best clinical practice. A low threshold for assessing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis via early morning cortisol or cosyntropin-stimulation test in patients not already taking glucocorticoid replacement is suggested whenever patients experience symptoms suggestive of adrenal insufficiency, particularly after a dose increase of rhGH, and bone measurements should be obtained at baseline; if the initial bone DXA scan is abnormal, bone DXA scans should be repeated at 2- to 3-year intervals.

### Normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis by high-dose cosyntropin testing in patients with abnormal response to low-dose cosyntropin stimulation: a retrospective review [^116ZWrbp]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze the interpretation of the 1-microg low-dose adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) test (LDT) for assessment of the presence of adrenal insufficiency (AI) in comparison with the 250-microg or standard high-dose ACTH test (HDT), which uses the same cutoff cortisol value of 18 microg/dL (500 nmol/L) as the lower limit of normal.

Methods

We present a retrospective review of 26 patients referred to the Pituitary Clinic who underwent both the LDT and the HDT for evaluation of the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

Results

Of the 26 study patients, 23 had discordant findings — abnormal LDT and normal HDT results with use of the empiric cortisol cutoff of 18 microg/dL at 30 minutes in response to the ACTH dose. Glucocorticoid replacement therapy was stopped or not started in these patients, and no clinical symptoms of AI developed during a follow-up period ranging from 19 to 24 months.

Conclusion

Our retrospective review of patients' discordant LDT and HDT results questions the reliability of the LDT as a screening test for AI, as currently interpreted. Our data suggest that abnormal results should be evaluated in the context of the clinical picture and that additional testing may be indicated to prevent unwarranted treatment with glucocorticoids. Further studies are needed to establish a safe, sensitive, and specific test for the diagnosis of AI.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) in critically ill patients (part I): Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) 2017 [^114aPjvy]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the 2008 consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) in adult and pediatric patients.

Participants

A multispecialty task force of 16 international experts in Critical Care Medicine, endocrinology, and guideline methods, all of them members of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and/or the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine.

Design/Methods

The recommendations were based on the summarized evidence from the 2008 document in addition to more recent findings from an updated systematic review of relevant studies from 2008 to 2017 and were formulated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The strength of each recommendation was classified as strong or conditional, and the quality of evidence was rated from high to very low based on factors including the individual study design, the risk of bias, the consistency of the results, and the directness and precision of the evidence. Recommendation approval required the agreement of at least 80% of the task force members.

Results

The task force was unable to reach agreement on a single test that can reliably diagnose CIRCI, although delta cortisol (change in baseline cortisol at 60 min of < 9 µg/dl) after cosyntropin (250 µg) administration and a random plasma cortisol of < 10 µg/dl may be used by clinicians. We suggest against using plasma free cortisol or salivary cortisol level over plasma total cortisol (conditional, very low quality of evidence). For treatment of specific conditions, we suggest using intravenous (IV) hydrocortisone < 400 mg/day for ≥ 3 days at full dose in patients with septic shock that is not responsive to fluid and moderate- to high-dose vasopressor therapy (conditional, low quality of evidence). We suggest not using corticosteroids in adult patients with sepsis without shock (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We suggest the use of IV methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day in patients with early moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (PaO₂/FiO₂ < 200 and within 14 days of onset) (conditional, moderate quality of evidence). Corticosteroids are not suggested for patients with major trauma (conditional, low quality of evidence).

Conclusions

Evidence-based recommendations for the use of corticosteroids in critically ill patients with sepsis and septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and major trauma have been developed by a multispecialty task force.

### The utility of the corticotropin test to diagnose adrenal insufficiency in critical illness: an update [^112m9DDh]. Clinical Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

One of the most common dynamic testing procedures for assessment of adrenocortical function is the standard corticotropin or the cosyntropin test. The aim of this review was to examine the evidence base underlying the corticotropin test in the management of the critically ill patient.

Data Synthesis

The principle behind the corticotropin test is the demonstration of an inappropriately low cortisol production in response to exogenous ACTH, a situation analogous to physiological stress. The corticotropin test was originally described in nonstressed subjects, and its applicability and interpretation in the setting of critical illness continues to generate controversy. Attempting to determine the prevalence of an abnormal corticotropin test in critical illness is complicated by the use of different end-points and different populations. Moreover, the test result is also influenced by the assay used for measurement of plasma cortisol. Trials assessing the relationship between corticotropin response and severity of stress and organ dysfunction have produced divergent results, which may reflect differences in the methodology and the association being measured. Moreover, controversy exists with respect to the methodology and the interpretation with respect to the following variables: dose of corticotropin, end-points for assessment of total or free cortisol, effect of plasma cortisol variability, adrenal blood flow and its equivalence with other tests of adrenocortical function.

Conclusions

The corticotropin test is used widely in the evaluation of adrenocortical function in the endocrine clinics. Its role in the critically ill patient is less well established. Several confounding variables exist and to have a 'one-size-fits-all' approach with a single end-point in the face of several methodological and pathophysiological confounders may be flawed and may result in the institution of inappropriate therapy. The current evidence does not support the use of the corticotrophin test in critical illness to assess adrenocortical function and guiding steroid therapy in critical illness.

Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) adrenal surveillance — ACTH < 100 pg/mL branch: In males identified with ALD < 2 years of age, urgent referral to pediatric endocrinology is directed. If ACTH < 100 pg/mL and cortisol ≥ 5 μg/dL, repeat ACTH and cortisol every 3–4 months for the first 2 years of life. If cortisol < 5 μg/dL, consider high dose (15 μg/kg or 125 μg) cosyntropin stimulation testing versus repeat ACTH and cortisol as clinically indicated, with ACTH & cortisol repeated at least every 3–4 months for the first 2 years of life.

### Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112ZVG5G]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia — initial evaluation and genotyping: In infants with positive newborn screens for congenital adrenal hyperplasia we recommend referral to pediatric endocrinologists (if regionally available) and evaluation by cosyntropin stimulation testing as needed. In symptomatic individuals past infancy, we recommend screening with an early‑morning (before 8 AM) baseline serum 17‑hydroxyprogesterone measurement by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. In individuals with borderline 17‑hydroxyprogesterone levels, we recommend obtaining a complete adrenocortical profile after a cosyntropin stimulation test to differentiate 21‑hydroxylase deficiency from other enzyme defects. In individuals with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, we suggest genotyping only when results of the adrenocortical profile after a cosyntropin stimulation test are equivocal, cosyntropin stimulation cannot be accurately performed, or for genetic counseling; genotyping at least one parent aids interpretation because of the complexity of the CYP21A2 locus.

### Diagnosing adrenal insufficiency: which test is best – the 1-microg or the 250-microg cosyntropin stimulation test? [^117LRMPg]. Endocrine Practice (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the available literature on the low-dose cosyntropin stimulation test (CST) for the diagnosis of primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency in both nonstressed and acutely ill patients.

Methods

We performed a MEDLINE search of all English-language literature, published between 1965 and 2007, in which the 1-microg and the 250-microg CSTs were compared in patients with primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency.

Results

The majority of published evidence suggests that the 1-microg CST is more sensitive than the 250-microg CST for the diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency in nonstressed patients. In patients with primary adrenal insufficiency, the low-dose CST is unlikely to add any diagnostic sensitivity to the high-dose CST. In critically ill patients, the 1-microg test is also likely to be more sensitive than the 250-microg test when an appropriate cutoff value is used (25 microg/dL).

Conclusion

The 1-microg CST with a cortisol level determined at 30 minutes after stimulation, with use of a cutoff level of 18 to 20 microg/dL in nonstressed patients and less than 25 microg/dL or an increment of less than 9 microg/dL from baseline in critically ill patients, is the best test that is currently available for establishing the diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^112RBXX5]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — important considerations and stress precautions: The figure states that the proposed cortisol cut-offs are only a guide and may vary according to the cortisol assay used and local protocols, that they only apply to patients who are not under major stress, and that they do not apply to subjects with abnormal CBG and albumin. Footnotes add that exogenous glucocorticoid should not be reduced below the lower end of the physiologic replacement dose range; that some patients with cortisol values close to the proposed 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) cut-off may have suboptimal cortisol response when exposed to major stress, so clinicians should rely on clinical judgment, offer stress glucocorticoid coverage, and that dynamic testing may also be considered; and that some patients may develop glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms and may benefit from gradual tapering rather than abrupt discontinuation.

### Evaluation and management of adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients: disease state review [^114WCf4X]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The definition of normal adrenal function in critically ill patients remains controversial, despite a large body of literature. We review the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients and discuss the authors' personal approach to patient management.

Methods

Extensive literature review, guidelines from professional societies, and personal experience.

Results

A decrease in cortisol breakdown rather than an increase in cortisol production has been suggested as the main contributor to elevated cortisol levels in critically ill patients. The concept of relative adrenal insufficiency has multiple pathophysiologic flaws and is not supported by current evidence. Patients with septic shock who are pressor dependent or refractory to fluid resuscitation may receive a short course of hydrocortisone regardless of their serum cortisol levels or their response to a cosyntropin stimulation test (CST). Patients without septic shock who are suspected to have adrenal insufficiency should have their random cortisol levels measured. In patients with low and near-normal cortisol-binding proteins, a serum cortisol of < 10 or 15 μg/dL, respectively, may trigger need for glucocorticoid treatment. Assays of free cortisol levels offer an advantage over total cortisol levels in patients with low binding proteins. Most critically ill patients have a normal random free cortisol level of > 1.8 μg/dL, although further studies are needed to define a normal range in critically ill patients based on both severity and duration of illness. A CST may be used to further evaluate adrenal function in patients without septic shock who have borderline random serum or free cortisol levels.

Conclusion

Evaluation of adrenal function in critically ill patients is complex. Recent findings of decreased cortisol breakdown in critically ill patients as the main contributor to elevated cortisol levels calls for better-designed studies to explore the optimal evaluation and treatment of adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113YYS7U]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) — optimal diagnostic tests include the following: We suggest the standard dose (250 µg for adults and children ≥ 2 y of age, 15 µg/kg for infants, and 125 µg for children < 2 y of age) iv corticotropin stimulation (30 or 60 min) test over other existing diagnostics tests to establish the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency, and peak cortisol levels below 500 nmol/L (18 µg/dL) (assay dependent) at 30 or 60 minutes indicate adrenal insufficiency. We suggest the low-dose (1 µg) corticotropin test for diagnosis of PAI only when the substance itself is in short supply. If a corticotropin stimulation test is not feasible, we suggest using a morning cortisol < 140 nmol/L (5 µg/dL) in combination with ACTH as a preliminary test suggestive of adrenal insufficiency (until confirmatory testing with corticotropin stimulation is available). We recommend measurement of plasma ACTH to establish PAI, and in patients with confirmed cortisol deficiency, a plasma ACTH > 2-fold the upper limit of the reference range is consistent with PAI. We recommend the simultaneous measurement of plasma renin and aldosterone in PAI to determine the presence of mineralocorticoid deficiency.

### Emergency management of adrenal insufficiency in children: advocating for treatment options in outpatient and field settings [^11448QSq]. Journal of Investigative Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric adrenal insufficiency (AI) — hormonal diagnosis and provocative testing thresholds are as follows: Primary AI is suggested by morning adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) greater than 100 pg/mL with cortisol less than 10 mcg/dL, or ACTH twofold above the upper limit with cortisol less than 5 mcg/dL; an 8:00 AM cortisol of ≤ 3 mcg/dL is highly suggestive, whereas ≥ 18 mcg/dL essentially excludes AI. In acute illness, a random cortisol and ACTH should be obtained prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy, and a serum cortisol less than 18 mcg/dL during acute illness can be indicative of AI. When levels are equivocal, cosyntropin testing should be done; for suspected primary AI, the usual high‑dose is 15 mcg/kg in neonates, 125 mcg in infants < 2 years, and 250 mcg in older children; in secondary AI, either high‑ or low‑dose cosyntropin (1 mcg) has been used to evaluate the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis; regardless of dose, a serum cortisol level > 18 mcg/dL rules out AI, and the 1 mcg dilution should be given intravenously without a 'fluorinated ethylene propylene' catheter.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111L5ei8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society guideline — central adrenal insufficiency diagnosis: We suggest measuring serum cortisol levels at 8–9 AM as the first-line test for diagnosing central adrenal insufficiency and we recommend against using a random cortisol level to diagnose AI. We suggest that a cortisol level < 3 μg/dL is indicative of AI and a cortisol level > 15 μg/dL likely excludes an AI diagnosis. We suggest performing a corticotropin stimulation test when morning cortisol values are between 3 and 15 μg/dL; peak cortisol levels < 18.1 μg/dL (500 nmol/L) at 30 or 60 minutes indicate AI. We suggest that clinicians perform biochemical testing for the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis at least 18–24 hours after the last hydrocortisone dose or longer for synthetic glucocorticoids.

### A single, post-ACTH cortisol measurement to screen for adrenal insufficiency in the hospitalized patient [^1151CV8T]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cosyntropin stimulation testing (CST) is used to screen patients for adrenal insufficiency (AI). Traditionally, CST includes baseline cortisol concentration, the administration of cosyntropin, and cortisol concentration at 30 and 60 minutes poststimulation. There is debate surrounding the utility of testing and cut-off points for concentrations at each time point.

Objective

To determine if a single cortisol measurement at 30 or 60 minutes could replace the traditional approach.

Design

looked retrospectively at inpatients who underwent standard, high-dose CST (n = 702) and evaluated the number of patients who would screen positive for AI by using a single time point (30 or 60 minutes) compared with the traditional CST.

Setting

A tertiary-care, academic medical center.

Patients

Hospital inpatients present between January 2012 and September 2013.

Results

Of tests, 84.3% were normal, which was defined as at least 1 cortisol concentration of 18 mcg/dL or higher at any time after stimulation. The average 60-minute concentration was higher than the average 30-minute concentration (P < .001). A single 60-minute concentration is 100% concordant with the full CST in the intensive care unit (ICU) subgroup and 99.6% concordant in floor patients. A single 30-minute concentration is significantly less concordant, 91.9% and 86.9%, in the ICU and floor subgroups, respectively.

Conclusions

Overall, a single 60-minute cortisol concentration to screen for AI was 99.7% concordant with the traditional CST, and the positive percent agreement was 98%. Fewer false-positive screens would occur with a single 60-minute cortisol concentration compared with a single 30-minute concentration (P < .001). High-dose CST screening may safely be interpreted with single 60-minute poststimulation cortisol serum concentrations.

Pituitary and adrenal irAEs

The evaluation, diagnosis and management of pituitary and adrenal irAEs are presented in tables4 6 respectively. AI, predominantly in the form of glucocorticoid deficiency, is a common sequela of both ir-hypophysitis and ir-adrenalitis. Suspicion for AI is usually based on clinical features and this diagnosis is confirmed with a low morning cortisol, with or without the use of cosyntropin stimulation test. The adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) value differentiates between ir-hypophysitis and ir-adrenalitis. The timing of the blood draw is a key determinant of the interpretability of cortisol levels, as the secretion of cortisol follows a diurnal rhythm. Morning cortisol level should ideally be measured between 06:00 and 10:00 hours. As there is significant interindividual variability in morning cortisol levels in healthy adults, the cut-off value for diagnosis of AI is controversial and assay-dependent. Furthermore, minor discrepancies exist between published cortisol values in mcg/dL and nmol/L due to variations in measurement methodology and rounding. It has been shown that a morning cortisol level of < 5 mcg/dL (138 nmol/L) best predicted AI, and a value of > 13 mcg/dL (365 nmol/L as published in this paper) best predicted normal hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis function. Similarly, a study evaluating basal morning cortisol of three different immunoassays reported values of above 12.2 mcg/dL (336 nmol/L) to 18.3 mcg/dL (506 nmol/L) as predictors of normal response to cosyntropin stimulation, depending on the assay used. The applicability of these findings to ICI-treated patients with cancer has yet to be established. The Endocrine Society suggests a morning cortisol of < 5 mcg/dL (138 nmol/L) in combination with ACTH may be used to make a preliminary diagnosis, and a peak cortisol response of < 18 mcg/dL (500 nmol/L) following cosyntropin stimulation to be used to confirm the diagnosis of AI. These recommendations, however, were made in the context of suspected primary AI, and based on literature which included studies using older assays. In the context of recent-onset ir-hypophysitis, the cosyntropin stimulation test can be falsely normal. Furthermore, cortisol cut-off values have since been reevaluated and debated. To facilitate more efficient diagnosis and treatment, we have proposed cut-offs for consideration of ICI-related AI as morning cortisol level of < 5 mcg/dL (138 nmol/L), or between 5 and 13 mcg/dL (138–359 nmol/L) with suboptimal response to cosyntropin stimulation. These values are by no means absolute and should not be regarded as the sole criterion for diagnosis of AI. In patients who are acutely unwell with clinical features suggestive of AI, a random cortisol measurement can be considered prior to urgent glucocorticoid replacement. There is, however, limited evidence supporting its use in diagnosis of AI. Likewise, a morning cortisol above 13 mcg/dL (359 nmol/L) should not be regarded as a definitive test to exclude AI, although it does decrease the likelihood substantially. Testing should be repeated if clinical suspicion remains. Shift workers may have an altered diurnal rhythm, and their cortisol levels should be interpreted with consideration of their usual sleep–wake hours. Current or recent use of glucocorticoid, regardless of route of administration, may also interfere with the accuracy of cortisol measurement. Whenever the clinical suspicion of AI remains, initiation of empirical glucocorticoid therapy, with a view to repeat cortisol level assessment, should be considered.

### Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117C8UbT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic evaluation in suspected 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD) emphasizes cosyntropin stimulation testing when basal results are inconclusive, using a pharmacological dose of 0.25 mg given intravenously (reduced to 0.125 mg in very low birth weight infants) with samples at baseline and 60 minutes; tests should be deferred until after the first 24 to 48 hours of life, and screening in symptomatic individuals past infancy uses LC–MS/MS serum samples obtained prior to 8 am, with menstruating females sampled in the early follicular phase. At minimum, cortisol and 17OHP should be measured, and cosyntropin stimulation is needed for indeterminate baseline 17OHP levels.

Endocrine assessment in pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) candidates emphasizes common late effects and baseline testing. Multiple late endocrine effects are seen after HCT, including thyroid dysfunction, diabetes, dyslipidemia, growth and bone health problems, adrenal insufficiency, and issues with puberty or fertility. For all patients, we recommend fasting blood glucose, a lipid panel and triglycerides, and thyroid-stimulating hormone as a baseline pre-HCT. Patients with a history of prolonged exposure to steroids may also require a baseline early morning cortisol screening or a cosyntropin stimulation test if there is significant concern for adrenal insufficiency, and preparations also may be made for menstrual suppression, when appropriate.

### Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome following treatment of endogenous Cushing syndrome [^113rigUF]. Pituitary (2022). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Glucocorticoid withdrawal algorithm. TDD, total daily dose

Basal testing is performed at 4- to 6-week intervals during glucocorticoid replacement. A rule of thumb is that the AM cortisol in µg/dL plus the morning dose of hydrocortisone in milligrams should sum to 15–20. Thus, once endogenous cortisol production is measurable, the hydrocortisone dose should be not more than 20 mg on arising. Once the AM cortisol rises to near 5 and then 10 µg/dL, the AM hydrocortisone dose is dropped to 15 and then 10 mg, respectively. Once the AM cortisol is 12–14 µg/dL, recovery is essentially complete, and the morning hydrocortisone dose is dropped to 5 mg for 4–6 weeks and then stopped or held for dynamic testing (Fig. 2). A clinical pearl related to HPA axis recovery is that patients who state that they are finally feeling better and getting over the GWS usually have started to make some endogenous cortisol, yet not enough to stop glucocorticoid tapering. Nevertheless, a smidgeon of endogenous cortisol production with the waning of GWS symptoms is a harbinger that HPA axis recovery is imminent. If basal testing is equivocal, dynamic testing might be necessary. The gold standard testing for central AI is the insulin tolerance test, which is rarely used, and metyrapone testing might be employed once the basal cortisol is > 10 µg/dL. Although designed to test for primary adrenal insufficiency, the cosyntropin stimulation test is often employed in this setting due to greater availability, simplicity, and safety than insulin or metyrapone testing. The duration of full HPA axis recovery can be highly variable depending on the individual and postoperative glucocorticoid dosing.

Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency, more specifically with respect to adrenal function testing, ESICM/SCCM 2017 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend whether to use delta cortisol (change in baseline cortisol at 60 mins of < 9 mcg/dL) after cosyntropin (250 mcg) administration or random plasma cortisol of < 10 mcg/dL for the diagnosis of critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor–related endocrine adverse events (irAEs) — corticosteroid effects and testing guidance — note that high-dose corticosteroids suppress ACTH and may cause persistent central adrenal insufficiency when stopped, with recovery taking weeks to months depending on exposure. Serum cortisol levels should not be routinely measured while patients are on corticosteroid therapy. If diagnosis is needed after acute treatment of presumed adrenal crisis is begun, ACTH stimulation testing may be performed, and endogenous levels can be directly measured 24 hours after the last dose of physiologic hydrocortisone replacement to assess recovery. High-dose corticosteroids and acute nonthyroidal illness can lead to low T3 syndrome that has not been shown to benefit from therapy; in difficult cases, endocrinology consult is recommended.

### Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^11614R75]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) — In infants with positive newborn screens for CAH, we recommend referral to pediatric endocrinologists (if regionally available) and evaluation by cosyntropin stimulation testing as needed. In symptomatic individuals past infancy, we recommend screening with an early morning (before 8 AM) baseline serum 17OHP measurement by LC-MS/MS. In individuals with borderline 17OHP levels, we recommend obtaining a complete adrenocortical profile (defined below) after a cosyntropin stimulation test to differentiate 21OHD from other enzyme defects. In individuals with CAH, we suggest genotyping only when results of the adrenocortical profile after a cosyntropin stimulation test are equivocal, or cosyntropin stimulation cannot be accurately performed (i.e., patient receiving GC), or for purposes of genetic counseling, and the technical remark states that genotyping at least one parent aids in the interpretation of genetic test results because of the complexity of the CYP21A2 locus.

Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

CIRCI diagnosis — adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) testing versus random cortisol: The task force makes no recommendation regarding whether to use delta cortisol (change in baseline cortisol at 60 min of < 9 μg/dL) after cosyntropin (250 μg) administration or a random plasma cortisol of < 10 μg/dL for the diagnosis of CIRCI. The 2008 guidelines suggested that the diagnosis of CIRCI is best made by a delta total serum cortisol of < 9 μg/dL after IV cosyntropin (250 μg) administration or a random total cortisol of < 10 μg/dL, but clinicians have not adopted these diagnostic criteria in their routine practice and the latest Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines suggest not using the ACTH stimulation test to select patients with septic shock that may be treated with hydrocortisone. One single-center randomized trial compared low-dose ACTH (1 μg) with total random cortisol for diagnosis in 59 adults with septic shock, and the low-dose ACTH test was better able to predict a longer duration of vasopressor requirement and hemodynamic response to corticosteroids. Prospective cohort studies found that patients with CIRCI, i.e., total cortisol levels ≤ 10 μg/dL or delta cortisol < 9 μg/dL, had poorer outcomes than patients without CIRCI, and in critically ill children a delta cortisol < 9 μg/dL after the low-dose ACTH stimulation test required higher-dose and prolonged catecholamines, a higher amount of fluid, and a higher mortality rate. Given only one single-center unblinded randomized trial and a small number of prospective cohort studies with low patient numbers, the task force members could not reach a consensus (> 80% agreement) on whether the ACTH stimulation test is superior to random cortisol for the routine diagnosis of CIRCI and thought it is unlikely that a single test can reliably diagnose CIRCI.

### Assessing cortisol levels in non-classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia: focus on the V281L variant [^1119jfDJ]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

While various cortisol levels are proposed, a basal cortisol level < 100 nmol/L (3 μg/dL) or > 330 nmol/L (12 μg/dL) indicates that dynamic testing is unnecessary. A study indicated that a basal morning cortisol level of ⩾400 nmol/L (14.4 μg/dL) is indicative of an adequate response to the ACTH stimulation test. In our study, we determined the cutoff for insufficient response in NCCAH cases to be 13.3 µg/dL (with 77% sensitivity and 66% specificity). In comparison, the value with 100% specificity was found to be 8.9 µg/dL. Studies showing inadequate responses in the ACTH stimulation test reported sufficient basal cortisol levels. Weintrob et al.reported normal basal levels in children with NCCAH, while the delta cortisol response and peak levels were significantly lower compared to controls, suggesting that basal cortisol levels may be misleading in this population. Basal cortisol sensitivity for diagnosing AI is 60%. In nonspecific symptoms where basal tests do not assist in diagnosis or instances of subclinical AI, dynamic tests should be used to support diagnosis by evaluating the response under stress conditions. It has been noted that in NCCAH, cases may achieve cortisol normalization with a delayed response observed 48–72 h after ACTH stimulation. Huerta et al.suggested that in patients, exaggerated 11-deoxycortisol production due to adrenal cortical hypersensitivity partially accounts for preserved cortisol production in 21-OH-deficient NCCAH. However, when evaluating adrenal medullary functions across all subtypes of adrenal hyperplasia requiring treatment, including NCCAH, impairments in epinephrine and cortisol secretion were identified. Presentation with clinical symptoms has been reported in cortisol-deficient NCCAH. In the ACTH stimulation test, attention should be paid to the study methods and new cutoff limits. Considering the safety profiles and accuracies, corticotropin analogs such as tetracosactrin (Synacthen ®), (tetracosactrin): Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland or (Cortrosyn ®) (cosyntropin): Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Rancho Cucamonga, CA, USA are used as first-line stimulation tests, with a cutoff value recommended at 18 µg/dL. This value has been obtained using existing cortisol tests, particularly the widely used Elecsys ® Cortisol immunoassay. For newer assays, such as those using LC-MS/MS, a competitive immunological test that employs monoclonal rather than polyclonal antibodies, it is suggested that a peak cutoff value of 13.5 µg/dL be used in assays with different standardizations (e.g. Elecsys Cortisol II).

Clinical practice points — adrenal insufficiency (AI) with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs): Primary AI can present with adrenal crisis and electrolyte abnormalities, and distinguishing primary from secondary AI guides mineralocorticoid use; testing adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), aldosterone, and renin is helpful. A low morning cortisol may be diagnostic at "3 to 4 ug/dL", and an elevated ACTH can confirm primary AI, though exogenous steroids or concomitant secondary AI must be considered if levels are equivocal. Patients should receive education on stress dosing and be treated with higher parenteral doses during major procedures or acute hospitalization.

### Secondary adrenal insufficiency and growth hormone deficiency in patients with fibromyalgia [^111Zvrmz]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we demonstrate that a subset of patients with FM may be present with concomitant SAI and GH deficiency. The diagnosis of SAI in patients with FM can be challenging. Notably, the majority of these patients had a normal baseline cortisol concentration above 7 mcg/dL, and CST was falsely normal in half of the patients who had this testing. Clinicians need a high index of suspicion for SAI since baseline labs are still in the normal range and may be falsely reassuring. The majority of patients also had concomitant GH deficiency. For patients where SAI is confirmed, we recommend evaluation of growth hormone deficiency with an IGF-1 level and dynamic testing based on clinical suspicion.

We do not propose that all patients with FM should be treated with hydrocortisone and GH replacement therapy. Rather, we suggest a step-wise approach to evaluating patients with FM for SAI, starting with baseline laboratory testing followed by dynamic testing if indicated. When the screening cortisol is low or low-normal (< 10 mcg/dL), this should be followed by a repeat morning cortisol and ACTH. A repeat morning cortisol < 10 mcg/dL raises suspicion for SAI and referral to an endocrinologist should be considered. A cortisol value of < 3 mcg/dL is consistent with SAI and additional testing is often unnecessary. For baseline cortisol levels above 3 mcg/dL, additional testing can help determine if a patient has SAI. A cosyntropin stimulation test is helpful if the test is abnormal, but a normal cortisol response does not rule out SAI. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the accuracy of cosyntropin stimulation test to diagnose SAI reported a high specificity but low sensitivity of 64–83%. Reported sensitivity of cosyntropin stimulation test in patients with FM is even lower, potentially misdiagnosing up to 50% of cases. The sensitivity of cosyntropin stimulation test in this study was also quite low at 21.4%. Therefore, CST may be a helpful test to diagnose SAI in patients with FM but cannot reliably rule out disease.

### How should we interrogate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with suspected hypopituitarism? [^111132b8]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The choice of test used to interrogate the HPA axis should be individualised for each patient and the results interpreted within clinical context and with understanding of potential pitfalls of the test used. An alternative test should be performed if the result is borderline and clinical suspicion is high. Clinical vigilance is required and patients should be made aware of the symptoms and signs of adrenal insufficiency so that assessment can be repeated if necessary. The results should be interpreted rationally and those with apparent borderline normal/abnormal results or values suggestive of partial ACTH deficiency could be treated with short courses of stress dose of glucocorticoids during incurrent illness only.

Normal cutoffs for ACTH and cortisol at baseline and after cosyntropin stimulation — Endocrine Society and Pediatric Endocrine Society guidance: The Endocrine Society's Clinical Practice Guideline recommends standard high-dose cosyntropin stimulation testing (250 μg for children ≥ 2 years of age, 15 μg/kg for infants, and 125 μg for children < 2 years of age) with a peak cortisol level < 18 μg/dL indicating adrenal insufficiency. If stimulation testing is not feasible, the recommendation is to obtain morning cortisol and ACTH levels. A cortisol < 5 μg/dL with a plasma ACTH more than two times the upper limit of normal makes primary adrenal insufficiency highly likely. Elevation of ACTH with normal cortisol may represent the earliest stage of adrenal insufficiency. The Pediatric Endocrine Society in 2006 suggested that an ACTH > 100 pg/mL and cortisol < 10 μg/dL are suggestive of primary adrenal insufficiency and should be followed by cosyntropin testing if the diagnosis is uncertain. Basal serum cortisol levels during the first year of life have limited diagnostic utility, whereas they may be more useful after 1 year of age.

Perioperative adrenal insufficiency risk and postoperative glucocorticoid management — general surgery: Early postoperative adrenal insufficiency (AI) morbidity ranged from 0.96–12.90% with an overall 5.55%, and clinicians start stress doses of glucocorticoids (GC) before surgery in patients with preoperative AI, taper after surgery, and discontinue if repeat testing shows a normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis; in patients with normal preoperative adrenal function, GC are often prescribed in the immediate postoperative period until the HPA axis can be evaluated. A postoperative morning cortisol level higher than 15 μg/dL may mitigate the requirement for postoperative GC treatment, and a morning cortisol measurement might be useful even after intraoperative administration of dexamethasone.

Glucocorticoid replacement and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis recovery — We recommend glucocorticoid replacement with hydrocortisone, 10–12 mg/m²/d in divided doses, either twice or thrice daily, with the first dose taken as soon as possible after waking; although some practitioners prescribe supraphysiological doses (eg, hydrocortisone 20 mg two to three times daily) in the immediate postoperative period, there are no controlled studies that address whether this minimizes glucocorticoid withdrawal, and clinicians can assess HPA axis recovery with a morning cortisol obtained every 3 months, initiating ACTH stimulation testing when the level is 7.4 μg/dL (200 nmol/L) or more, considering the axis recovered if the baseline or stimulated level is approximately 18 μg/dL (500 nmol/L) or greater, while patients with cortisol levels below 5 μg/dL (138 nmol/L) should remain on glucocorticoids until retested in 3–6 months.

Currently, the optimal type and dose of glucocorticoids to use during the taper has not been established. There is also a lack of reliable data comparing different strategies and tapering regimens vary widely in clinical practice. Moreover, there is no compelling evidence to switch intermediate-acting glucocorticoids such as prednisone to hydrocortisone or cortisone acetate to further promote the recovery of the HPA axis. The evidence of the effect of different types and dosages of glucocorticoid taper on the timing of HPA axis recovery and possible symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal remain limited and inconclusive. Consequently, an individualized approach to glucocorticoid taper is possible and necessary.

R 2.6 — We suggest that patients on a physiologic daily dose equivalent, and aiming to discontinue glucocorticoid therapy, either: 1. continue to gradually taper the glucocorticoid dose, while being monitored clinically for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, or 2. be tested with a morning serum cortisol. (⊕○○○)

During the initial glucocorticoid tapering, ACTH and cortisol levels remain suppressed. When the dose of glucocorticoid therapy is lowered, the hypothalamus and pituitary gland start to recover, resulting in increased production of ACTH. ACTH increase can promote the recovery of adrenal function leading to an increase and recovery in cortisol. Complete recovery of cortisol production can remain impaired in a minority of patients (Fig. 1).

Figure 1.
Schematic representation of HPA axis recovery following discontinuation of supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy (adapted from: Prete and Bancos 2021).

There is no compelling evidence to guide optimal tapering. Discontinuation of long-term glucocorticoid therapy necessitates a cautious approach due to an increased risk of adrenal insufficiency, though the risk of clinically relevant adrenal crisis is generally low. Although glucocorticoid dose and treatment duration are associated with the development of adrenal insufficiency, predicting the risk of adrenal insufficiency remains challenging. A uniform approach to tapering the glucocorticoid dose has not yet been established and there is a lack of sufficient data on this topic (see Clinical question II). While some authors recommend a rapid reduction of the glucocorticoid dose to slightly above physiologic daily dose equivalent (eg, 7.5 mg prednisone), followed by a further reduction in smaller steps, others prefer testing of HPA axis to guide further tapering or immediate discontinuation, if normal adrenocortical function is demonstrated. An ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial (TOASST) is testing abrupt cessation vs gradual tapering once a dose of prednisone 7.5 mg is achieved.

To propose an approach for the diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency (AI) by presentation of 2 clinical cases and review of the literature.

Methods

We describe 2 patients who were considered to have a normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis on the basis of an appropriate response to the high-dose (250 microg) cosyntropin stimulation test (HST), with use of a cutoff value of 20 microg/dL. Our first patient had undergone resection of a 4-cm pituitary tumor a few months previously, and the second patient had hyponatremia with empty sella syndrome. Both patients, however, had strong clinical evidence suggestive of secondary AI. On testing by the insulin tolerance test (ITT) in the first patient and the overnight metyrapone test (OMT) in the second patient, secondary AI was diagnosed. We reviewed the literature to compare the utility of the different tests for the diagnosis of secondary AI.

Results

An 8 AM serum cortisol value less than 5 microg/dL or above 13 microg/dL and a stimulated cortisol level less than 16 microg/dL on both the low-dose cosyntropin stimulation test (LST) and the HST as well as above 22 microg/dL on the LST and above 30 microg/dL on the HST can reliably predict the functional status of the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis in chronic secondary AI. Values between these cutoff points may necessitate further assessment with the OMT or ITT based on clinical suspicion.

Conclusion

We recommend a 3-step diagnostic approach, with the first 2 steps performed together-starting with the 8 AM basal cortisol determination in conjunction with either the LST (preferably) or the HST. In cases of an indeterminate response coupled with a strong clinical suspicion, the final step should be definitive testing with the OMT or ITT.

### Cosyntropin [^1139xmyA]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Cosyntropin for Injection, 0.25 mg may be added to glucose or saline solutions and given at the rate of approximately 40 micrograms per hour over a 6-hour period. It should not be added to blood or plasma as it is apt to be inactivated by enzymes. Adrenal response may be measured in the usual manner by determining urinary steroid excretion before and after treatment or by measuring plasma cortisol levels before and at the end of the infusion. The latter is preferable because the urinary steroid excretion does not always accurately reflect the adrenal or plasma cortisol response to ACTH. The usual normal response in most cases is an approximate doubling of the basal level, provided that the basal level does not exceed the normal range. Patients receiving cortisone, hydrocortisone or spironolactone should omit their pre-test doses on the day selected for testing. Patients taking inadvertent doses of cortisone or hydrocortisone on the test day and patients taking spironolactone or women taking drugs which contain estrogen may exhibit abnormally high basal plasma cortisol levels. A paradoxical response may be noted in the cortisone or hydrocortisone group as seen in a decrease in plasma cortisol values following a stimulating dose of Cosyntropin for Injection.

In the spironolactone or estrogen group only a normal incremental response is to be expected. Many patients with normal adrenal function, however, do not respond to the expected degree so that the following criteria have been established to denote a normal response:

How Do I Make the Diagnosis of PAI Once It Is Suspected?

As soon as suspicion of PAI is raised, the patient's clinical condition should determine further action. If the patient is acutely ill and circulatory unstable, treatment with intravenous hydrocortisone and saline infusion should be started without delay. If the patient is stable, diagnostic workup is usually relatively straightforward. Since adrenal function often is severely reduced when patients are symptomatic, cortisol is usually very low and ACTH very high. Likewise, low aldosterone is a potent stimulus of the renin-angiotensin system. Thus, the biochemical fingerprint of PAI is high ACTH and low cortisol and even low dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, high plasma renin or renin activity, and low aldosterone. There is not an exact biochemical definition of PAI, but a cortisol level below 100 nmol/L and an ACTH value 2 times the upper reference limit is diagnostic according to current guidelines. Usually both cortisol and aldosterone levels are low at diagnosis, but sometimes insufficiency of either hormone comes first. In the majority of cases, the diagnosis can be made by analyzing a paired cortisol and ACTH test irrespective of time of the day, but in some cases a slower and more gradual adrenal destruction may occur, with residual cortisol production. In such cases, the cortisol levels may not be overtly low at presentation, although ACTH and/or renin levels are elevated and aldosterone and/or dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels are low. In such cases a cosyntropin stimulation test is needed to gauge the secretory capacity of the adrenal cortex. Current guidelines recommend the standard test where 0.25 mg cosyntropin is given intravenously and cortisol measured before and after 30 and 60 minutes. Traditionally the cut-off has been defined at 550 or 500 nmol/L after 30 and/or 60 minutes. However, introduction of highly specific liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry methods has lowered the threshold to 412 after 30 minutes or 485 nmol/L after 60 minutes. Females treated with oestrogens will have higher cortisol binding globulin levels and thus higher total serum cortisol, which can mask cortisol deficiency. Defined cut-off values for renin and aldosterone do not exist, but high renin and low aldosterone support the diagnosis.

### Diagnosis and management of adrenal insufficiency and adrenal crisis in the emergency department [^111Ncj1V]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Adrenal insufficiency can result in significant patient morbidity and mortality, but due to the range of symptoms and variable clinical course and etiologies, it can be a challenging condition to diagnose and manage.

Objective

This narrative review will discuss the evaluation of an adult patient at risk for a new diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency and the management of a patient with known or suspected adrenal insufficiency.

Discussion

A new presentation of adrenal insufficiency can range from nonspecific, minor symptoms including fatigue, to a life-threatening adrenal crisis with hemodynamic instability. Due to the variety of signs and symptoms, the diagnosis is often missed. Those with known adrenal insufficiency are at risk for adrenal crisis, which may occur due to a variety of triggers. Initial evaluation includes assessment for the underlying etiology or concomitant condition, laboratory analysis, and imaging, when clinically indicated. Although not necessary for evaluation in the emergency department setting, the diagnosis is confirmed by specific testing such as the cosyntropin stimulation test. The mainstay of treatment in adrenal crisis is hydrocortisone, intravenous fluid, glucose repletion, and treatment of the underlying acute trigger.

Conclusions

Emergency clinicians must be prepared to recognize, evaluate, and manage those with known or suspected adrenal insufficiency or adrenal crisis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113tgrnE]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) in pregnancy — testing thresholds: The cosyntropin stimulation test is the test of choice in pregnant women if adrenal insufficiency is suspected, and in a small cohort of healthy pregnant women the peak total cortisol response after ACTH injection was higher than in the nonpregnant state (median, 1000 nmol/L [37 μg/dL]) in the second and third trimesters, with postpartum responses returning to median 700 nmol/L [26 μg/dL]. Accordingly, it has been suggested to use higher diagnostic cortisol cutoffs of 700 nmol/L (25 μg/ dL), 800 nmol/L (29 μg/dL), and 900 nmol/L (32 μg/dL) for the first, second, and third trimesters, respectively.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115YL4Q1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary adrenal insufficiency, more specifically with respect to morning cortisol, ES 2016 guidelines recommend to consider using a morning cortisol < 140 nmol/L in combination with ACTH as a preliminary test suggestive of adrenal insufficiency, if a corticotropin stimulation test is not feasible.

### How should we interrogate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with suspected hypopituitarism? [^113ADgBo]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Hypopituitarism is deficiency of one or more pituitary hormones, of which adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) deficiency is the most serious and potentially life-threatening. It may occur in isolation or, more commonly as part of more widespread pituitary failure. Diagnosis requires demonstration of subnormal cortisol rise in response to stimulation with hypoglycemia, glucagon, ACTH(1–24) or in the setting of acute illness. The choice of diagnostic test should be individualised for the patient and clinical scenario. A random cortisol and ACTH level may be adequate in making a diagnosis in an acutely ill patient with a suspected adrenal crisis e.g. pituitary apoplexy. Often however, dynamic assessment of cortisol reserve is needed. The cortisol response is both stimulus and assay- dependent and normative values should be derived locally. Results must be interpreted within clinical context and with understanding of potential pitfalls of the test used.

Morning serum cortisol thresholds for recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis: If confirmation of recovery is desired, we recommend morning serum cortisol as the first test and consider values as a continuum. As a guide, we suggest recovery if cortisol is > 300 nmol/L or 10 µg/dL and glucocorticoids can be stopped safely; we suggest continuing the physiologic dose and repeating morning cortisol when results are between 150 nmol/L or 5 µg/dL and 300 nmol/L or 10 µg/dL; and we suggest continuing the physiologic dose and repeating morning cortisol after a few months when results are < 150 nmol/L or 5 µg/dL.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1152153f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary adrenal insufficiency, more specifically with respect to corticotropin stimulation test, ES 2016 guidelines recommend to consider using the standard dose test over other existing tests (250 mcg for adults and children ≥ 2 years of age, 15 mcg/kg for infants, and 125 mcg for other children < 2 years of age). Peak cortisol levels below 500 nmol/L (18 mcg/dL) at 30 or 60 minutes indicate adrenal insufficiency.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^111hsJH7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

In patients with higher serum cortisol levels but below 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL), HPA axis recovery is possible. In such cases, we suggest that the most cost-effective and practical strategy is that these patients continue with physiologic daily dose equivalent glucocorticoid replacement and have morning serum cortisol re-checked every few weeks until recovery occurs. If cortisol levels remain between 150 nmol/L (5 μg/dL) and 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL), dynamic testing can be considered.

In a study of patients with suspected primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency, morning cortisol ≥ 354 nmol/L (12.8 μg/dL) predicted normal adrenal function with 100% sensitivity. One might also extrapolate some of the cut-off values from experiences with therapy of endogenous Cushing syndrome. In patients recovering from endogenous hypercortisolism, morning cortisol ≥ 276 nmol/L (10.0 μg/dL) was associated with no reported symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome or instances of adrenal crisis. Given these considerations, and the fact that there is substantial variability in the calibration between different cortisol assays, we consider cortisol values greater than 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) as a reasonable threshold to indicate recovery of HPA function following glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency.

### The low-dose ACTH stimulation test: is 30 minutes long enough? [^1125j4vm]. Endocrine Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Controversy persists regarding the use of the low-dose adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test (LDST) for the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency (AI) and optimal test result interpretation. However, many centers are now using the LDST to assess cortisol secretion adequacy, and some only use a 30-minute cortisol level to determine adrenal sufficiency or AI. This study examined both 30- and 60-minute cortisol levels to assess whether the interpretation of the test was affected when both cortisol levels were taken into consideration.

Methods

Data were obtained by retrospective chart review from a single pediatric endocrinology unit over a 7-year period. We identified 82 patients who completed the LDST. Their mean age was 11.7 years, and 37% were female. Cortisol levels were evaluated at baseline and 30 and 60 minutes after cosyntropin administration. A cutoff value ≥ 18 μg/dL was used to define adrenal sufficiency.

Results

We found that 54% of patients reached peak cortisol levels at 60 minutes, and 11 patients who did not pass the test at 30 minutes did so at 60 minutes. The only predictive characteristic was weight status; overweight and obese individuals tended to peak at 30 minutes, and normal and underweight individuals tended to peak at 60 minutes.

Conclusion

Although further studies are necessary to confirm our findings, it appears that measuring cortisol both 30 and 60 minutes following synthetic ACTH administration may be necessary to avoid overdiagnosing AI.

### Evaluating the low-dose ACTH stimulation test in children: ideal times for cortisol measurement [^112d7tnr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Central adrenal insufficiency (AI) can be diagnosed with the low-dose ACTH stimulation test (LDST). Protocols determining timing of cortisol sampling vary, with 30 minutes after stimulation being most common.

Objectives

To determine optimal times to draw cortisol levels and factors predicting timing of peak cortisol levels in children undergoing LDST.

Design

Retrospective chart review of LDSTs between February 2014 and September 2017.

Setting

The Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario.

Patients

Patients 3 months to 20 years who underwent LDSTs.

Intervention

LDSTs were performed with cortisol levels at 0, 15, 30, and 60 minutes after 1 μg cosyntropin. Cortisol values < 18 μg/dL (500 nmol/L) determined AI.

Main Outcome Measures

The incremental value of testing cortisol at 15 or 60 minutes, in addition to the standard 30-minute sample, was estimated.

Results

A total of 221 patients met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 9.7 years, and 32% were female. Peak cortisol levels were 19%, 67%, and 14% at 15, 30, and 60 minutes, respectively. One false positive LDST result would be prevented for every 24 (95% CI, 13 to 46) or 55 (95% CI, 22 to 141) patients tested at 15 or 60 minutes in addition to the standard 30-minute test. Of the 122 patients who passed the LDST, discontinuing the 15- and 60-minute samples would have misdiagnosed 12 patients (9.8%). Glucocorticoid exposure, age, and body mass index z scores were independent predictors of peak cortisol timing.

Conclusion

Although the majority of patients peak 30 minutes after cosyntropin administration, testing cortisol levels at 15 and 60 minutes reduces the risk of false positive LDSTs.

### The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113yNRnH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the study was to develop clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome.

Participants

The Task Force included a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS) of The Endocrine Society, five additional experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions. The guidelines were reviewed and approved sequentially by The Endocrine Society's CGS and Clinical Affairs Core Committee, members responding to a web posting, and The Endocrine Society Council. At each stage the Task Force incorporated needed changes in response to written comments.

Conclusions

After excluding exogenous glucocorticoid use, we recommend testing for Cushing's syndrome in patients with multiple and progressive features compatible with the syndrome, particularly those with a high discriminatory value, and patients with adrenal incidentaloma. We recommend initial use of one test with high diagnostic accuracy (urine cortisol, late night salivary cortisol, 1 mg overnight or 2 mg 48-h dexamethasone suppression test). We recommend that patients with an abnormal result see an endocrinologist and undergo a second test, either one of the above or, in some cases, a serum midnight cortisol or dexamethasone-CRH test. Patients with concordant abnormal results should undergo testing for the cause of Cushing's syndrome. Patients with concordant normal results should not undergo further evaluation. We recommend additional testing in patients with discordant results, normal responses suspected of cyclic hypercortisolism, or initially normal responses who accumulate additional features over time.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111XaNxD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Central adrenal insufficiency — initial biochemical evaluation is as follows: We suggest measuring serum cortisol levels at 8–9 AM as the first-line test for diagnosing central AI. We recommend against using a random cortisol level to diagnose AI. We suggest that a cortisol level < 3 μg/dL is indicative of AI and a cortisol level > 15 μg/dL likely excludes an AI diagnosis. We suggest performing a corticotropin stimulation test when morning cortisol values are between 3 and 15 μg/dL to diagnose AI. Peak cortisol levels < 18.1 μg/dL (500 nmol/L) at 30 or 60 minutes indicate AI. We suggest that clinicians perform biochemical testing for the HPA axis at least 18–24 hours after the last HC dose or longer for synthetic GCs.

### Congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guidelines for the role of medical perioperative management for patients with functioning pituitary adenomas [^117HLkV8]. Neurosurgery (2025). High credibility.

Functioning pituitary adenomas — postoperative hormone monitoring for Cushing disease (CD) emphasizes early cortisol thresholds and limited utility of immediate ACTH testing: Most studies reported immediate postoperative serum cortisol levels of 2–5 ug/dL within the first 72 hours postoperatively as threshold levels for early remission and the indication for glucocorticoid initiation, and more stringent cortisol cutoff levels (< 2 ug/dL) predict CD remission in the short-term (< 12 months), intermediate-term (12–24 months), and long-term (> 24 months). The systematic review yielded 23 studies, including 19 providing Class III and 4 providing Class II evidence, with no Class I studies. A general cortisol threshold of 2 to 5 ug/dL offers reasonable predictive accuracy for CD remission, and a more stringent cortisol threshold of < 2 ug/dL is recommended to improve predictive accuracy. For adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), variable postoperative cutoff values have been proposed, including < 5 pg/mL and < 20 pg/mL, but ACTH testing is challenging due to its short half-life (< 10 min), and less compelling evidence exists for concomitant postoperative ACTH testing. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend additional postoperative testing (midnight salivary cortisol testing, 1 mg Dexamethasone suppression testing, or CRH-stimulation testing). No single cortisol or ACTH cutoff values are predictive of long-term CD recurrence, so lifelong patient follow-up is necessary.

### Cosyntropin [^117APebk]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

1.000000000000000e+00

The control plasma cortisol level should exceed 5 micrograms/100 mL.

2.000000000000000e+00

The 30-minute level should show an increment of at least 7 micrograms/100 mL above the basal level.

3.000000000000000e+00

The 30-minute level should exceed 18 micrograms/100 mL. Comparable figures have been reported by Greig and co-workers (2).

Plasma cortisol levels usually peak about 45 to 60 minutes after an injection of Cosyntropin for Injection and some prefer the 60-minute interval for testing for this reason. While it is true that the 60-minute values are usually higher than the 30-minute values, the difference may not be significant enough in most cases to outweigh the disadvantage of a longer testing period. If the 60-minute test period is used, the criterion for a normal response is an approximate doubling of the basal plasma cortisol value. In patients with a raised plasma bilirubin or in patients where the plasma contains free hemoglobin, falsely high fluorescence measurements will result. The test may be performed at any time during the day but because of the physiological diurnal variation of plasma cortisol the criteria listed by Wood cannot apply. It has been shown that basal plasma cortisol levels and the post Cosyntropin for Injection increment exhibit diurnal changes. However, the 30-minute plasma cortisol level remains unchanged throughout the day so that only this single criterion should be used (3).

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration whenever solution and container permit. Reconstituted Cosyntropin for Injection should not be retained.

### Employing a results-based algorithm to reduce laboratory utilization in ACTH stimulation testing [^114oSEyD]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The High Dose Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH) Stimulation Test is the gold standard to diagnose adrenal insufficiency. Normal adrenal function is defined as a peak cortisol response to pharmacologic stimulation with cosyntropin of ≥ 18 μg/dL. Our practice was to obtain cortisol levels at 0, 30 and 60 min after cosyntropin administration. Once a value of ≥ 18 μg/dL has been obtained, adrenal insufficiency is ruled out and there is little diagnostic utility in subsequent stimulated levels.

Methods

We aimed to decrease laboratory utilization by developing a results-based algorithm in the electronic medical record (EMR). Cortisol levels were analyzed on the 0 and 60 min samples; then an EMR discern rule automatically generated an order to analyze the 30-min sample if the 60-min cortisol level was subnormal.

Results

Exclusion of adrenal insufficiency was excluded using one stimulated cortisol level in 8% prior to algorithm development. After several plan-do-study-act cycles, 99% of normal tests were performed using only one stimulated cortisol level.

Conclusions

This laboratory-based algorithm resulted in reduced laboratory utilization, and aligned our practice to recommendations of the Pediatric Endocrine Society. Similar algorithms could be created for other dynamic tests to reduce unnecessary laboratory utilization.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1174L1xv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

R 2.8 — We suggest against routinely performing a dynamic test for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency in patients tapering or stopping glucocorticoid therapy. (⊕○○○)

Rationale

Morning cortisol measurement can serve as a simple approach to HPA axis assessment, obviating the need for other tests in many patients (see recommendation 2.7). However, if cortisol remains indeterminate (see 2.7), dynamic testing can be considered. The decision to carry out dynamic testing should consider the test's availability, feasibility, costs and regional accessibility. There is no evidence that a specific test in the context of glucocorticoid treatment is superior. Dynamic testing options include 250 µg ACTH (1–24) and, less commonly, overnight metyrapone and insulin tolerance tests. The 250 µg ACTH (1–24) test only examines the direct response of the adrenal gland to supraphysiologic ACTH stimulation. In primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency, a peak cortisol level < 500 nmol/L (< 18.1 μg/dL), depending on assay, at 30 or 60 minutes is indicative of adrenal insufficiency. As suppression of the HPA axis subsequently results in adrenocortical atrophy with impaired cortisol response, the test may yield less reliable results in patients on shorter duration of glucocorticoid therapy. The overnight metyrapone stimulation test and insulin tolerance test are more labor-intensive and can be associated with significant adverse effects. They assess the entire HPA axis, but head-to-head studies comparing different dynamic tests in this patient population are lacking. Furthermore, most of the published studies using dynamic testing to diagnose glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency rely on ACTH (1–24) stimulation. The panel suggests against the use of the 1 µg ACTH (1–24) test since it does not provide better diagnostic accuracy than the standard 250 µg and there are no commercially available preparations of 1 µg ACTH (1–24). If dynamic testing is employed, it should be done after holding any glucocorticoid therapy for at least 24 hours to avoid interference in steroid measurements.

R 2.9 — We suggest awareness of possible glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency in patients: 1. with current or recent use of non-oral glucocorticoid formulations presenting with signs and symptoms indicative of adrenal insufficiency, or 2. using multiple glucocorticoid formulations simultaneously, or 3. using high dose inhaled or topical glucocorticoids, or 4. using inhaled or topical glucocorticoids for > 1 year, or 5. who received intra-articular glucocorticoid injections in the previous 2 months, or 6. receiving concomitant treatment with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors.

### Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in severe sepsis and septic shock [^1112hXHb]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Rationale

Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients has relied on random or cosyntropin-stimulated cortisol levels, and has not been corroborated by a more accurate diagnostic standard.

Objective

We used the overnight metyrapone stimulation test to investigate the diagnostic value of the standard cosyntropin stimulation test, and the prevalence of sepsis-associated adrenal insufficiency.

Methods

This was an inception cohort study.

Measurements and Results

In two consecutive septic cohorts (n = 61 and n = 40), in 44 patients without sepsis and in 32 healthy volunteers, we measured (1) serum cortisol before and after cosyntropin stimulation, albumin, and corticosteroid-binding globulin levels, and (2) serum corticotropin, cortisol, and 11beta-deoxycortisol levels before and after an overnight metyrapone stimulation. Adrenal insufficiency was defined by postmetyrapone serum 11beta-deoxycortisol levels below 7 microg/dl. More patients with sepsis (31/61 [59% of original cohort with sepsis] and 24/40 [60% of validation cohort with sepsis]) met criteria for adrenal insufficiency than patients without sepsis (3/44; 7%) (p < 0.001 for both comparisons). Baseline cortisol (< 10 microg/dl), Delta cortisol (< 9 microg/dl), and free cortisol (< 2 microg/dl) had a positive likelihood ratio equal to infinity, 8.46 (95% confidence interval, 1.19–60.25), and 9.50 (95% confidence interval, 1.05–9.54), respectively. The best predictor of adrenal insufficiency (as defined by metyrapone testing) was baseline cortisol of 10 microg/dl or less or Delta cortisol of less than 9 microg/dl. The best predictors of normal adrenal response were cosyntropin-stimulated cortisol of 44 microg/dl or greater and Delta cortisol of 16.8 microg/dl or greater.

Conclusions

In sepsis, adrenal insufficiency is likely when baseline cortisol levels are less than 10 microg/dl or delta cortisol is less than 9 microg/dl, and unlikely when cosyntropin-stimulated cortisol level is 44 microg/dl or greater or Delta cortisol is 16.8 microg/dl or greater.

### Approach to the patient with possible Cushing's syndrome [^116LF6pP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Clinical decision making for patients with suspect hypercortisolism involves a complex diagnostic assessment. Cushing's syndrome remains one of the most challenging endocrine pathologies. Most clinical features overlap with those of common diseases found in the general population, and some patients have an atypical clinical presentation with only isolated symptoms. Recently, several studies have suggested that the prevalence of Cushing's syndrome is higher than previously thought. Therefore, efficient screening tests are needed to identify the few uncovered patients also among unselected high-risk ambulatory patients with disorders potentially related to cortisol excess. The recommended diagnostic tests are 24-h urinary free cortisol, 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test, and late-night salivary cortisol. Once the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the next step is the measurement of plasma ACTH. Then, dynamic test and appropriate imaging procedures are the most useful noninvasive investigations for the differential diagnosis. Patients with Cushing's disease are generally responsive to the CRH test and to high-dose glucocorticoid feedback. Bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling is considered the gold standard for establishing the origin of ACTH secretion, and it is recommended in patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome whose clinical, biochemical, or radiological studies are discordant or equivocal. The present clinical case shows that even if rare, the ectopic ACTH secretion should be considered also in those cases where the pretest probability is low. The management of Cushing's syndrome depends on the exact knowledge of its various causes, paying attention to the many potential diagnostic pitfalls. The choice of test, the modality of specimen collection (blood, urine, and saliva), the quality of measurement (assay methodology and standardization), and close dialogue among endocrinologists, chemical pathologists, and neuroradiologists are key factors for optimal care of patients.

Diagnosis of CAH — In infants with positive newborn screens for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), we recommend referral to pediatric endocrinologists (if regionally available) and evaluation by cosyntropin stimulation testing as needed; in symptomatic individuals past infancy, we recommend screening with an early morning (before 8 AM) baseline serum 17OHP measurement by LC-MS/MS; in individuals with borderline 17OHP levels, we recommend obtaining a complete adrenocortical profile after a cosyntropin stimulation test to differentiate 21OHD from other enzyme defects; in individuals with CAH, we suggest genotyping only when the adrenocortical profile after a cosyntropin stimulation test is equivocal, cosyntropin stimulation cannot be accurately performed (i.e., patient receiving GC), or for purposes of genetic counseling; technical remark: genotyping at least one parent aids in the interpretation of genetic test results because of the complexity of the CYP21A2 locus.

### Cosyntropin [^113hVyTb]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS & USAGE

Cosyntropin for Injection is intended for use as a diagnostic agent in the screening of patients presumed to have adrenocortical insufficiency. Because of its rapid effect on the adrenal cortex it may be utilized to perform a 30-minute test of adrenal function (plasma cortisol response) as an office or outpatient procedure, using only 2 venipunctures (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section).

Severe hypofunction of the pituitary - adrenal axis is usually associated with subnormal plasma cortisol values but a low basal level is not per se evidence of adrenal insufficiency and does not suffice to make the diagnosis. Many patients with proven insufficiency will have normal basal levels and will develop signs of insufficiency only when stressed. For this reason a criterion which should be used in establishing the diagnosis is the failure to respond to adequate corticotropin stimulation. When presumptive adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed by a subnormal Cosyntropin for Injection test, further studies are indicated to determine if it is primary or secondary.

Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) is the result of an intrinsic disease process, such as tuberculosis within the gland. The production of adrenocortical hormones is deficient despite high ACTH levels (feedback mechanism). Secondary or relative insufficiency arises as the result of defective production of ACTH leading in turn to disuse atrophy of the adrenal cortex. It is commonly seen, for example, as result of corticosteroid therapy, Sheehan's syndrome and pituitary tumors or ablation.

The differentiation of both types is based on the premise that a primarily defective gland cannot be stimulated by ACTH whereas a secondarily defective gland is potentially functional and will respond to adequate stimulation with ACTH. Patients selected for further study as the result of a subnormal Cosyntropin for Injection test should be given a 3 or 4 day course of treatment with Repository Corticotropin Injection USP and then retested. Suggested doses are 40 USP units twice daily for 4 days or 60 USP units twice daily for 3 days. Under these conditions little or no increase in plasma cortisol levels will be seen in Addison's disease whereas higher or even normal levels will be seen in cases with secondary adrenal insufficiency.

### Can 1 microg of cosyntropin be used to evaluate adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients? [^112VqNBH]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the utility of cosyntropin 1 microg in assessing adrenal function in critically ill patients.

Data Sources

A computerized literature search using MEDLINE, EMBASE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and the Cochrane Database (1966-August 2004) was undertaken for trials evaluating cosyntropin 1 mug using the following search terms: adrenocorticotropin-releasing hormone (ACTH), cosyntropin, adrenal insufficiency, cortisol, corticosteroids, glucocorticoids, sepsis, septic shock, diagnosis, critically ill, intensive care, and critical care. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA SYNTHESIS: Identifying patients with sepsis with relative adrenal insufficiency (AI) using cosyntropin testing may identify those likely to benefit from corticosteroids. The results of 5 heterogeneous studies in non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients suggest that both 1 microg and 250 microg of cosyntropin stimulate similar cortisol responses and that testing using both doses correlates well with results from insulin tolerance testing. Some data from non-ICU patients suggest that the 1-microg test may be more sensitive to detect AI; 3 heterogeneous studies in ICU patients confirmed the improved sensitivity of the 1-microg test.

Conclusions

Use of cosyntropin 1 microg should detect AI in all patients who would have been diagnosed using 250 microg. Unfortunately, all of the clinical trials evaluating the role of corticosteroids in septic shock that used the cosyntropin stimulation test administered 250 microg. Extrapolation of the existing guidelines to treat patients with septic shock testing positive for relative AI using the 1-microg test may provide effective therapy to appropriate patients not diagnosed by the 250-microg testing or may introduce additional adverse effects in patients who should not receive corticosteroids. Large-scale, head-to-head comparison data of steroid effectiveness after 1- and 250-microg ACTH stimulation tests are needed to expand upon these promising results.

Primary adrenal insufficiency — corticotropin test recommendation and performance state that 2.2 We suggest the low-dose (1 μg) corticotropin test for diagnosis of PAI only when the substance itself is in short supply. (2|⊕⊕○○); evidence notes that the stimulated increase of cortisol after 30 or 60 minutes in healthy individuals is comparable for both low-dose (1 μg) and high-dose (250 μg) corticotropin tests, resulting in a lower cutoff threshold (mean −2SD) of 500 nmol/L (18 μg/dL), that stimulated serum cortisol concentrations differ considerably at 60 minutes between both conditions, with a further rise in the high-dose test and a decrease of cortisol in the low-dose test, and that cosyntropin-stimulated cortisol levels are slightly higher at 60 vs 30 minutes although the 30-minute time point has been validated against the insulin tolerance test; overall, the low-dose and high-dose corticotropin stimulation tests yield comparable results in the diagnostic workup of PAI and the low-dose test adds no further sensitivity or specificity over the high-dose test.

Adrenal Insufficiency

Screening for Adrenal Insufficiency

Recommendations

All boys and men, but not girls and women, should be routinely screened for adrenal insufficiency with early morning cortisol and adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) measurements.
Screening for adrenal insufficiency should be initiated in the first 6 months of life. Then, patients should be screened every 3–6 months before the age of 10 years and yearly thereafter. Screening should be performed parallel to MRI where possible.
All patients in whom symptoms suggestive of adrenal insufficiency manifest should undergo prompt evaluation for adrenal insufficiency to identify and prevent an adrenal crisis. If the patient is in crisis, a random cortisol and ACTH level measurement is sufficient (provided that serum specimens are drawn before glucocorticoid administration); if mildly symptomatic, early morning fasted cortisol and ACTH measurement is preferred.
All patients who are screened for adrenal insufficiency, or after diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency, should also be screened for mineralocorticoid deficiency with plasma renin and serum electrolytes.
All patients in whom symptoms suggestive of mineralocorticoid deficiency manifest should undergo prompt evaluation with plasma renin and serum electrolytes.

Primary adrenal insufficiency is common in male patients with ALD, but rare in women.e28, e29 Screening in adult patients should continue irrespective of age because it is inexpensive, and early diagnosis offers a large potential health benefit.

Adrenal insufficiency is characterized by low or normal early morning cortisol levels with high levels of ACTH. For diagnosis, random cortisol and ACTH can be used when early morning measurement is not an option; however, when the results are ambiguous, patients should be retested with early morning fasted cortisol and ACTH. Synthetic ACTH stimulation testing can be restricted to ambiguous cases or when early morning fasted cortisol and ACTH are difficult to obtain. Besides glucocorticoid deficiency, some patients also develop mineralocorticoid deficiency (hypoaldosteronism).e30, e31

Treatment of Adrenal Insufficiency

Recommendations

If adrenal insufficiency is present, we recommend glucocorticoid replacement therapy by an endocrinologist.
Mineralocorticoid replacement therapy should not be initiated based on symptoms alone but should also take into account plasma renin and serum electrolyte abnormalities.
Routine evaluation of bone health with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry measurements in boys with adrenal insufficiency and glucocorticoid replacement therapy is not recommended.
No consensus was reached on the evaluation of bone health in men.

Patients with ambiguous results such as abnormal ACTH with normal or borderline cortisol values on stimulation testing should be managed per existing guidelines. e30, e31 Long-term glucocorticoid replacement therapy has been associated with impaired bone health. e32

### Normal cortisol response to corticotropin in patients with secondary adrenal failure… [^111Qd6FS]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- A normal plasma cortisol response to exogenous corticotropin has been advanced as a reliable indication of adequate hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function in patients suspected of having secondary adrenal failure. We have examined the validity of this diagnostic strategy in five patients who had undergone hypophysectomy and 27 patients recently treated with glucocorticoids. Eleven of the patients had normal adrenal responses to cosyntropin but had subnormal responses when the entire hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis was examined using metyrapone; no patient who responded normally to metyrapone failed to respond to cosyntropin. Inducing hypoglycemia with insulin yielded results concordant with the results induced by metyrapone in four patients tested. A normal cortisol response to corticotropin alone should not be relied on to exclude secondary adrenal insufficiency.

To do this it is necessary to demonstrate normal activity of the entire hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which can be conveniently examined using metyrapone. Cunningham SK, Moore A, McKenna TJ. Normal Cortisol Response to Corticotropin in Patients With Secondary Adrenal Failure. Arch Intern Med. 1983; 143: 2276–2279.

Glucocorticoid replacement and recovery of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis after remission: We recommend that hypocortisolemic patients receive glucocorticoid replacement and education about adrenal insufficiency after surgical remission. We recommend follow-up morning cortisol and/or ACTH stimulation tests or insulin-induced hypoglycemia to assess the recovery of the HPA axis in patients with at least one intact adrenal gland, assuming there are no contraindications, and we also recommend discontinuing glucocorticoid when the response to these test(s) is normal. We recommend re-evaluating the need for treatment of other pituitary hormone deficiencies in the postoperative period.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112hy7cT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) — interim morning cortisol strategy when corticotropin stimulation is not feasible: We suggest using a morning cortisol < 140 nmol/L (5 μg/dL) in combination with ACTH as a preliminary test suggestive of adrenal insufficiency; this suggestion is only applicable in acute situations when waiting for the corticotropin stimulation would unnecessarily delay appropriate therapy and should not be used for community-based screening. In the absence of exogenous glucocorticoids, a basal cortisol < 140 nmol/L (5 μg/dL) drawn in the morning (6 to 10 AM) is suggestive of adrenal insufficiency, although the choice of a morning cortisol to rule out adrenal insufficiency with 100% sensitivity is controversial, with studies arguing levels from > 285 nmol/L (10.3 μg/dL) to > 480 nmol/L (17 μg/dL), and there is no evidence to support the use of random cortisol to rule out adrenal insufficiency. The cortisol of 140 nmol/L (5 μg/dL) is typically below or near the lower limit of normal (6 to 10 AM) in reference populations for assays in contemporary clinical laboratories: 113–131 nmol/L (4.1–4.7 μg/dL).

Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) adrenal surveillance — management when ACTH is high but stimulation test passes: If a patient has an ACTH > 300 pg/mL but passes high-dose cosyntropin stimulation testing (peak cortisol ≥ 18 μg/dL), hydrocortisone should be prescribed for episodes of physiologic stress, such as febrile illness, vomiting, and surgical procedures, and counseling given in regards to oral and intramuscular administration of hydrocortisone, as this may represent an early stage of evolving adrenal insufficiency.

### Adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test during high-dose glucocorticoid therapy [^112hE555]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To define the effective time frame of adequate serum cortisol response to the short standard 250-microg adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test (ACTH-ST) after initiation of high-dose glucocorticoid therapy in order to assist in the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency.

Methods

We performed an ACTH-ST at 4 different times in hospitalized patients, who had a documented intact hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and were receiving high-dose dexamethasone therapy for nonendocrine diseases, to determine the time until the serum cortisol response is compromised. The ACTH-ST was performed at the following time intervals after initiation of dexamethasone therapy - 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. The outcome measures were cortisol levels measured at 0, 30, and 60 minutes after administration of 250 microg of cosyntropin.

Results

Of the overall group of 11 study patients, all those (n = 8) tested within the first 72 hours after initiation of dexamethasone therapy had an adequate response (serum cortisol level at 60 minutes, ≥ 18 microg/dL). Two of the 3 patients tested at 96 hours after initiation of dexamethasone therapy had a suppressed cortisol response at 60 minutes. At 30 minutes, all cortisol levels except 1 were inadequate (< 18 micro/dL).

Conclusion

This study suggests indirectly that the ACTH-ST may be used for the diagnosis of suspected adrenal insufficiency within the first 3 days after initiation of empiric glucocorticoid therapy. An inadequate response of serum cortisol at 60 minutes to the ACTH-ST may be indicative of adrenal insufficiency in this setting. Additional studies with more patients in each therapy time point are needed to confirm these initial results.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112JmMZZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) — testing indications and urgent management are summarized as follows: We recommend diagnostic testing to exclude primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) in acutely ill patients with otherwise unexplained symptoms or signs suggestive of PAI. We recommend confirmatory testing with the corticotropin stimulation test in patients with clinical symptoms or signs suggesting PAI when the patient's condition and circumstance allow. In patients with severe adrenal insufficiency symptoms or adrenal crisis, we recommend immediate therapy with iv hydrocortisone at an appropriate stress dose prior to the availability of the results of diagnostic tests. We suggest that the etiology of PAI should be determined in all patients with confirmed disease.
