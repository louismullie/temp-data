## Question

Resolution criteria for Hhs

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the resolution criteria for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why HHS resolution is not simply "glucose normalization". Then, I should verify the authoritative source for resolution criteria. Next, I will extract and state the exact criteria, making sure I include the biochemical thresholds and clinical endpoints. After that, I should double-check the rationale behind each component and how it aligns with pathophysiology. Finally, I will consider special situations like mixed DKA/HHS, pediatric nuances, and practical monitoring cadence, and close with a concise synthesis that clinicians can apply at the bedside.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context so I don't jump to conclusions: HHS is defined by marked hyperglycemia, severe hyperosmolality, and profound dehydration with minimal ketosis, and its morbidity is tightly linked to osmotic shifts and volume deficits, so resolution must reflect both biochemical correction and clinical recovery rather than a single lab value like glucose alone [^62c6bda2] [^51092c31].

> I need to verify the authoritative source for resolution criteria; the most explicit, consensus-based definition comes from the 2023 Joint British Diabetes Societies (JBDS) guideline, which operationalizes resolution as a composite of biochemical and clinical endpoints rather than any single parameter, and this is the standard I should anchor to [^e678c4ec] [^62c6bda2].

> Now, let me extract the exact criteria and state them precisely so there's no ambiguity: HHS is considered resolved when all of the following are met — serum osmolality less than 300 mOsm/kg, hypovolemia is corrected with urine output at least 0.5 mL/kg/h, cognitive status has returned to the patient's pre-morbid baseline, and blood glucose is less than 15 mmol/L; I should confirm that these are the four pillars and that they must be achieved together, not in isolation [^e678c4ec] [^62c6bda2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about why these components matter; I should review the rationale so the criteria are clinically meaningful: osmolality less than 300 mOsm/kg reflects reversal of the hypertonic state that drives neurologic injury, urine output at least 0.5 mL/kg/h indicates restored intravascular volume and renal perfusion, return of baseline cognition signals correction of cerebral dehydration and osmotic injury, and glucose less than 15 mmol/L is a pragmatic threshold that tracks metabolic improvement while acknowledging that glucose alone is insufficient to declare resolution [^62c6bda2] [^51092c31].

> Wait, let me verify the osmolality calculation so I don't misstate it: JBDS uses [(2 × sodium) + glucose + urea] to approximate measured osmolality, and they emphasize that effective osmolality (often excluding urea) is less relevant for HHS resolution monitoring, so I should keep the full formula in mind when tracking the decline toward less than 300 mOsm/kg [^8eadd9a0] [^28cc673c].

> I should confirm the clinical caveat that normalizing glucose or sodium in isolation does not equal resolution; JBDS explicitly warns against declaring resolution based on a single normal value, and this is especially important because sodium can appear "worse" as glucose falls due to transcellular shifts, even as overall osmolality improves, so I need to ensure the composite is assessed holistically [^e678c4ec] [^6c5d2cda].

> Next, I should review special situations; for mixed DKA/HHS, resolution still hinges on correcting ketonemia and acidosis per DKA principles while also meeting the HHS osmolality and clinical criteria, so I need to ensure both pathways are satisfied before stopping insulin and fluids, and I should double-check that insulin timing is individualized to the dominant process [^825ddac1] [^62c6bda2].

> Let me consider pediatric nuances so I don't overgeneralize from adults: children with HHS often have even larger fluid deficits and higher risks of rhabdomyolysis and thrombosis, so while the same resolution concept applies, I should verify that volume repletion, electrolyte monitoring, and cautious insulin initiation are prioritized, and that resolution is declared only when osmolality, perfusion, and neurologic status normalize with safe glucose decline rates [^a945c918] [^3335a16f].

> I need to ensure the monitoring cadence supports safe confirmation of resolution; JBDS recommends frequent osmolality checks early on, with fluid rates adjusted to achieve a gradual osmolality decline of about 3–8 mOsm/kg/h to mitigate neurologic complications, and I should confirm that mental status, urine output, and electrolytes are trended in parallel to avoid premature de-escalation [^6c5d2cda] [^62c6bda2].

> But wait, what if the patient improves clinically yet osmolality remains borderline or glucose lingers near 15 mmol/L; I should double-check for ongoing osmotic diuresis, under-resuscitation, or persistent precipitating illness, because JBDS emphasizes that biochemical and clinical assessments must proceed in tandem and that complete normalization can take up to 72 hours, so I should not force premature resolution labeling if the trajectory is still correcting [^48509f2c] [^6c5d2cda].

> In summary, I should confirm that HHS resolution is a composite state defined by osmolality less than 300 mOsm/kg, adequate urine output reflecting corrected hypovolemia, return of baseline cognition, and glucose less than 15 mmol/L, with the key principle that no single parameter suffices and that management must continue until all four are achieved in a clinically stable patient [^e678c4ec] [^62c6bda2].

---

Resolution of HHS is defined by **osmolality < 300 mOsm/kg**, **urine output ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/h**, **return of baseline cognition**, and **glucose < 15 mmol/L** [^e678c4ec] [^62c6bda2]. These criteria reflect correction of hyperosmolality, volume status, and metabolic derangement; **normalization of glucose alone is insufficient** [^e678c4ec]. Resolution should be confirmed with serial assessments, and insulin infusion should continue until all criteria are met to prevent relapse [^c54599f2].

---

## Biochemical resolution criteria

Key biochemical thresholds for HHS resolution:

| **Parameter** | **Resolution criterion** |
|-|-|
| Serum osmolality | < 300 mOsm/kg (calculated as 2 × [Na+] + glucose + urea) [^e678c4ec] [^62c6bda2] |
| Blood glucose | < 15 mmol/L (270 mg/dL) [^e678c4ec] [^62c6bda2] |
| Effective serum osmolality | < 300 mOsm/kg (calculated as 2 × [Na+] + glucose) [^notfound] |

---

These thresholds reflect correction of the **hyperosmolar state** and hyperglycemia, which are central to HHS pathophysiology [^06e9a3f5].

---

## Clinical resolution criteria

Clinical markers are essential to confirm resolution:

- **Urine output**: ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/h, indicating restored renal perfusion and corrected hypovolemia [^e678c4ec] [^62c6bda2].
- **Cognitive status**: Return to the patient's pre-morbid baseline, reflecting correction of hyperosmolar encephalopathy [^e678c4ec] [^62c6bda2].
- **Hemodynamic stability**: Stable blood pressure and heart rate without ongoing support [^notfound].

---

## Rationale behind the resolution criteria

The criteria are designed to ensure:

- **Correction of hyperosmolality**: Gradual reduction in osmolality mitigates cerebral edema and osmotic demyelination risks [^6c5d2cda].
- **Restoration of volume status**: Adequate urine output and hemodynamic stability indicate successful rehydration [^notfound].
- **Neurological recovery**: Return of baseline cognition signifies reversal of hyperosmolar encephalopathy [^notfound].
- **Metabolic control**: Glucose < 15 mmol/L reflects sufficient insulin effect and reduced osmotic diuresis [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and reassessment

Resolution should be confirmed with **serial assessments**:

- **Frequency**: Hourly glucose and osmolality initially, then every 2–4 hours as stability improves [^6c5d2cda].
- **Clinical assessment**: Continuous monitoring of urine output, mental status, and vital signs [^48e1dddb].
- **Electrolytes**: Potassium, sodium, and renal function checked every 2–4 hours initially [^48e1dddb].

---

## Potential pitfalls and complications

Premature cessation of therapy can lead to **relapse** or incomplete correction. Rapid shifts in osmolality or glucose can cause cerebral edema or osmotic demyelination, so changes should be gradual and closely monitored [^6c5d2cda]. Underlying precipitants (e.g. infection) must be treated to prevent recurrence [^25097eca].

---

## Summary of HHS resolution criteria

| **Criterion** | **Resolution threshold** |
|-|-|
| Serum osmolality | < 300 mOsm/kg |
| Blood glucose | < 15 mmol/L |
| Urine output | ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/h |
| Cognitive status | Return to baseline |

---

Resolution of HHS is a **composite of biochemical and clinical endpoints**, with osmolality < 300 mOsm/kg, urine output ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/h, return of baseline cognition, and glucose < 15 mmol/L as the key criteria. These ensure safe, effective reversal of the hyperosmolar state and its complications [^e678c4ec] [^62c6bda2].

6 DEFINITION OF RESOLUTION OF HHS

Because the precise definition of HHS has not been agreed, it is difficult to give a precise definition of when HHS has resolved. Different authors have used different criteria for resolution, with some using osmolality as the criteria, others using volume status or cognitive status. It is important to remember that a normal glucose or sodium concentration in isolation is not sufficient to say that the episode has resolved. It can also be difficult to gauge the degree of dehydration at the bedside. However, we propose that a holistic approach be used.

Resolution of HHS can be defined as outlined in Table 3.

Abstract

Hyperosmolar Hyperglycaemic State (HHS) is a medical emergency associated with high mortality. It occurs less frequently than diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), affects those with pre‐existing/new type 2 diabetes mellitus and increasingly affecting children/younger adults. Mixed DKA/HHS may occur. The JBDS HHS care pathway consists of 3 themes (clinical assessment and monitoring, interventions, assessments and prevention of harm) and 5 phases of therapy (0–60 min, 1–6, 6–12, 12–24 and 24–72 h). Clinical features of HHS include marked hypovolaemia, osmolality ≥ 320 mOsm/kg using [(2×Na +) + glucose+urea], marked hyperglycaemia ≥ 30 mmol/L, without significant ketonaemia (≤ 3.0 mmol/L), without significant acidosis (pH > 7.3) and bicarbonate ≥ 15 mmol/L. Aims of the therapy are to improve clinical status/replace fluid losses by 24 h, gradual decline in osmolality (3.0–8.0 mOsm/kg/h to minimise the risk of neurological complications), blood glucose 10–15 mmol/L in the first 24 h, prevent hypoglycaemia/hypokalaemia and prevent harm (VTE, osmotic demyelination, fluid overload, foot ulceration). Underlying precipitants must be identified and treated. Interventions include: (1) intravenous (IV) 0.9% sodium chloride to restore circulating volume (fluid losses 100–220 ml/kg, caution in elderly), (2) fixed rate intravenous insulin infusion (FRIII) should be commenced once osmolality stops falling with fluid replacement unless there is ketonaemia (FRIII should be commenced at the same time as IV fluids). (3) glucose infusion (5% or 10%) should be started once glucose < 14 mmol/L and (4) potassium replacement according to potassium levels. HHS resolution criteria are: osmolality < 300 mOsm/kg, hypovolaemia corrected (urine output ≥ 0.5 ml/kg/h), cognitive status returned to pre‐morbid state and blood glucose < 15 mmol/L.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^6a64d0e6]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

American Diabetes Association Standards of Care in Diabetes — diagnostic tests and recommendations state that "Diabetes may be diagnosed based on A1C or plasma glucose criteria", with plasma glucose criteria including the fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h plasma glucose (2-h PG) during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or random glucose accompanied by classic hyperglycemic symptoms or hyperglycemic crises (diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA] and/or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state [HHS]). Recommendation 2.1a (B) directs to "Diagnose diabetes based on A1C or plasma glucose criteria" with these plasma glucose options, and recommendation 2.1b (B) states that "In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia (e.g., hyperglycemic crises), diagnosis requires confirmatory testing"; additionally, "FPG, 2-h PG during 75-g OGTT, and A1C are appropriate for screening and diagnosis".

These guidelines are evidence based as far as that evidence exists, otherwise, they reflect a consensus derived from an analysis of the published literature in English and the views of specialist diabetes clinicians in the United Kingdom. The emphasis throughout is on ensuring that biochemical evaluation must go hand in hand with clinical evaluation. Correction of the biochemistry alone does not guarantee a good outcome. They are intended for use by any healthcare professional that manages HHS in adults.

Management of those < 18 years old managed by the paediatric team should follow the following guidelines

The care pathway for the management of HHS is divided into timeline phases to emphasise the importance of regular monitoring and updates in treatments and initiate escalations where appropriate (Figures 1 and 2).

### Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children: pathophysiological considerations and suggested guidelines for treatment [^e1ade482]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Mixed HHS and DKA — children with severe hypertonicity plus substantial ketosis and acidosis — requires combined management: Treatment must take into account potential complications of both diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS), with frequent reassessment of circulatory status and fluid balance to guide therapy. To maintain adequate circulatory volume, the rate of fluid administration will generally exceed that used for treatment of typical DKA, and the rate of electrolyte administration required to maintain normal concentrations is also likely to exceed that used for DKA. Insulin treatment is necessary to resolve ketosis and continuous insulin infusion should be started after the initial fluid bolus(es), recognizing that insulin administration may produce a more rapid decline in glucose concentration and therefore a potential decrease in intravascular volume.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management [^7edd4f24]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Hyperglycemia and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) — field thresholds and testing emphasize glucose cutoffs and dehydration severity. If someone with diabetes is found to be hyperglycemic (plasma glucose level > 250 mg·dL−1), assess for HHS or DKA, and individuals with type 1 diabetes should be able to test for blood or urine ketones if they have unexplained hyperglycemia. In HHS, serum glucose level usually > 600 mg·dL−1 with extreme dehydration with a fluid deficit of 8 to 12 L.

### Impact of a hyperglycemic crises protocol [^09edcf02]. Endocrine Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an adult hyperglycemic crises protocol based upon the 2009 American Diabetes Association (ADA) consensus statement.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of patients treated before and after protocol implementation at a university teaching hospital. A total of 256 adult patients met the criteria for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) and were treated with an insulin infusion between February 2011 and February 2012 (nonprotocol n = 143, protocol n = 113). Protocol efficacy was evaluated by assessing time to resolution of DKA or HHS, length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU), and LOS in the hospital. Protocol safety was evaluated by assessing the numbers of patients with hypoglycemic and hypokalemic events.

Results

Patients on the hyperglycemic crises protocol experienced a 9.2 hour (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.70–13.70; P < .001) decrease in time to resolution, with nonprotocol patients (n = 143) resolving in 22.78 hours and protocol patients (n = 113) resolving in 13.58 hours. There was no difference in safety outcomes, including the number of patients with moderate hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 70 mg/dL), severe hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 50 mg/dL), or hypokalemia (K+ < 3.3 mmol/L).

Conclusion

Implementation of a hyperglycemic crises protocol decreased times to resolution of DKA and HHS without increasing the rate of hypoglycemia or hypokalemia.

### Diabetes care in the hospital: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^c54599f2]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state — clinical management details: Presentations vary and include euglycemic DKA defined as plasma glucose levels < 200 mg/dL (< 11.1 mmol/L) in the presence of ketosis and metabolic acidosis, necessitating individualized treatment based on careful clinical and laboratory assessment. In critically ill and hemodynamically unstable individuals with DKA or HHS, continuous intravenous insulin is the standard of care, and successful transition to subcutaneous insulin requires administering basal insulin 2–4 h before stopping the intravenous insulin to prevent recurrence and rebound hyperglycemia. For mild or moderate DKA, there is no significant difference in outcomes for intravenous human regular insulin versus subcutaneous rapid-acting analogs when combined with aggressive fluid management, and selected individuals with uncomplicated DKA may sometimes be treated with subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogs in the emergency department or step-down unit. The use of bicarbonate in DKA made no difference in the resolution of acidosis or time to discharge, and its use is generally not recommended.

### Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children: pathophysiological considerations and suggested guidelines for treatment [^48364efd]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Figure 3 — pediatric HHS algorithm delineates insulin timing and dosing across branches: For HHS, begin when glucose concentrations no longer decline with fluid alone and use IV insulin 0.025–0.05 units/kg/hr, and treat to decrease glucose 75–100 mg/dL/hr (4.1–5.5 mmol/L/h); another branch begins after initial fluid bolus with IV insulin 0.05–0.1 units/kg/hr depending on degree of acidosis; initial fluid resuscitation includes bolus 0.9% saline 20 cc/kg, repeat until peripheral perfusion established.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome: review of acute decompensated diabetes in adult patients [^6a304466]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome (HHS) are life threatening complications that occur in patients with diabetes. In addition to timely identification of the precipitating cause, the first step in acute management of these disorders includes aggressive administration of intravenous fluids with appropriate replacement of electrolytes (primarily potassium). In patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, this is always followed by administration of insulin, usually via an intravenous insulin infusion that is continued until resolution of ketonemia, but potentially via the subcutaneous route in mild cases. Careful monitoring by experienced physicians is needed during treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis and HHS. Common pitfalls in management include premature termination of intravenous insulin therapy and insufficient timing or dosing of subcutaneous insulin before discontinuation of intravenous insulin. This review covers recommendations for acute management of diabetic ketoacidosis and HHS, the complications associated with these disorders, and methods for preventing recurrence. It also discusses why many patients who present with these disorders are at high risk for hospital readmissions, early morbidity, and mortality well beyond the acute presentation.

3 MIXED DKA/HHS

In HHS there is usually no significant ketosis/ketonaemia (blood ketones ≤ 3.0 mmol/L), although a mild acidosis (pH < 7.3, bicarbonate > 15.0 mmol/L) may accompany those affected by acute kidney injury or severe sepsis. Some people have severe hypertonicity and ketosis and acidosis (mixed DKA and HHS). This situation is likely to reflect a relative insulin deficiency due to beta cell exhaustion as a result of temporary glucotoxicity and excess counter‐regulatory hormone production. These individuals may require a modification of this treatment guideline to take into account which aspect predominates. If a predominant diagnosis is unclear (HHS vs. mixed HHS/DKA), early specialist input should be sought to help tailor management according to the individual's need. However, if ketone concentrations are high (blood ketones > 3.0 mmol/L), then the DKA protocol may be appropriate (Figure 4).

FIGURE 4
The overlap between diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) and how to approach management.

Treat as mixed DKA/HHS if all the following criteria are met: marked hypovolaemia, marked hyperosmolality (osmolality ≥ 320 mOsm/kg), pH < 7.3, bicarbonate < 15 mmol/L and blood ketones > 3.0 mmol/L. Start a Fixed Rate Intravenous Insulin Infusion (FRIII) and IV fluids immediately and treat according to DKA pathway using 0.1 units/kg/h. IV fluid replacement should aim to achieve a positive balance of 3–6 L during the first 12 h and the remaining replacement of estimated fluid loss during the following 12 h, although complete normalisation of biochemistry may take up to 72 h.

### Hyperglycemic crisis [^1975430a]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperglycemic crisis is a metabolic emergency associated with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus that may result in significant morbidity or death. Acute interventions are required to manage hypovolemia, acidemia, hyperglycemia, electrolyte abnormalities, and precipitating causes. Despite advances in the prevention and management of diabetes, its prevalence and associated health care costs continue to increase worldwide. Hyperglycemic crisis typically requires critical care management and hospitalization and contributes to global health expenditures.

Objective

Diagnostic and resolution criteria and management strategies for diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic crisis are provided. A discussion of prevalence, mortality, pathophysiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, evaluation, and management considerations for hyperglycemic crisis are included.

Discussion

Emergency physicians confront the most severe sequelae of uncontrolled diabetes and provide crucial, life-saving management. With ongoing efforts from diabetes societies to incorporate the latest clinical research to refine treatment guidelines, management and outcomes of hyperglycemic crisis in the emergency department continue to improve.

Conclusion

We provide an overview of the evaluation and treatment of hyperglycemic crisis and offer a concise, targeted management algorithm to aid the practicing emergency physician.

### Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state [^ffa0c91c]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) is an underrecognized diabetic emergency with high morbidity and mortality. Many features of HHS overlap with those of diabetic ketoacidosis but key differentiators for HHS are serum osmolality greater than 320 mOsm/kg, lack of metabolic acidosis, and minimal to no presence of ketones. HHS is often triggered by an underlying illness-most commonly infection but may also be triggered by stroke, acute coronary syndrome, and other acute illnesses. Treatment guidelines recommend aggressive volume-repletion of osmotic losses in addition to insulin therapy, plus treatment of the underlying cause.

### Principles of child health care financing [^1f08682f]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Principles of child health care financing — coverage of essential pediatric benefits states that federal payers and regulators of health care services for children should exercise their full authority to ensure, insofar as it is possible, that children, adolescents, and young adults have access to a uniform standard of essential pediatric health care benefits across all geographies, and that if, and to the extent that, existing regulatory authority cannot achieve this goal, new legislative solutions should be enacted; the HHS should provide clear regulatory guidance that identifies Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment benefits as the standard for pediatric essential health benefits; preventive care and wellness benefits for children, adolescents, and young adults should be consistent with current recommendations in Bright Futures and, in accord with ACA provisions, preventive and wellness benefits, including immunizations recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the AAP, should be exempt from any cost sharing; all health care benefits should be sufficient in the type, amount, frequency, duration, setting, and scope to enable care that achieves the best clinical outcome for the condition(s) under treatment; and the HHS should provide guidance on medical necessity specific to the needs of children, with medically necessary services for children described as promoting normal growth and optimal development, preventing, diagnosing, treating, ameliorating, or palliating the effects of specified conditions, and being in accord with generally accepted standards of medical practice based on credible scientific evidence or on evidence-informed clinical expert recommendations.

### Diabetic emergencies presenting during the COVID-19 pandemic: a retrospective case analysis [^a3ced1fc]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

We conducted a retrospective case analysis of patients with diabetes admitted to the medical wards of North Middlesex Hospital, London, during the COVID‐19 pandemic between 15 March and 15 April 2020. The inclusion criteria were: (1) positive swab testing for COVID‐19, (2) admission due to a diabetic emergency. We recorded details regarding the length of hospital stay, features of the metabolic emergency, time until resolution, treatment pathways utilized, clinical course of the patient, clinical outcome at 7 days post admission. Data for the study were extracted from routine hospital records. Notes were manually reviewed for results as well as for follow‐up information. The study was part of a departmental audit, evaluating treatment pathways for patients with diabetic emergencies during the pandemic, and has been approved by the Ethics Department of our Hospital.

2.1 Diagnosis of COVID‐19

Primarily patients with clinical features matching the UK government case definition for COVID‐19, or patients who had biochemical/radiological features of COVID‐19 received one COVID‐19 PCR swab at the time of admission. During the time of this study, our local policy was not to re‐swab patients if the PCR swab result was negative, despite a high clinical suspicion. Clinical suspicion was based on symptomatic, biochemical or radiological evidence consistent with COVID‐19.

2.2 Diagnostic criteria for diabetic emergencies

DKA: all ofblood glucose concentration > 11mmol/l or known to have diabetes, blood ketones > 3.0 mmol/l, venous pH < 7.3 and/or bicarbonate concentration < 15mmol/l

HHS: clinically hypovolaemic with markedly raised blood glucose concentration (> 30 mmol/l), without hyperketonaemia (ketones < 3 mmol/l) or acidosis (pH > 7.3) with raised osmolality (> 320 mosmol/kg)

Mixed DKA/HHS: clinical overlap state where features are present from the above clinical syndromes.

2.3 Control group

We also had a group of patients who underwent treatment for a diabetic emergency without being investigated or treated for COVID‐19. These patients were used as comparators to investigate significant metabolic differences.

Table 6.8 — Diagnostic criteria for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) state that all criteria must be met; DKA requires diabetes/hyperglycemia with "Glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or prior history of diabetes", ketosis with "β-Hydroxybutyrate concentration ≥ 3.0 mmol/L or urine ketone strip 2+ or greater", and metabolic acidosis with "pH < 7.3 and/or bicarbonate concentration < 18 mmol/L"; HHS requires hyperglycemia "Plasma glucose ≥ 600 mg/dL (33.3 mmol/L)", hyperosmolality "Calculated effective serum osmolality > 300 mOsm/kg (calculated as [2×Na+ (mmol/L) + glucose (mmol/L)] or total serum osmolality > 320 mOsm/kg [2×Na+ (mmol/L) + glucose (mmol/L) + urea (mmol/L)]", absence of significant ketonemia "β-Hydroxybutyrate concentration < 3.0 mmol/L OR urine ketone strip less than 2+", and absence of acidosis "pH ≥ 7.3 and bicarbonate concentration ≥ 15 mmol/L".

The American Diabetes Association (ADA), European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), Joint British Diabetes Societies for Inpatient Care (JBDS), American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE), and Diabetes Technology Society (DTS) convened a panel of internists and diabetologists to update the ADA consensus statement on hyperglycemic crises in adults with diabetes, published in 2001 and last updated in 2009. The objective of this consensus report is to provide up-to-date knowledge about the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) in adults. A systematic examination of publications since 2009 informed new recommendations. The target audience is the full spectrum of diabetes health care professionals and individuals with diabetes.

### Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state: a historic review of the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment [^d6050a8e]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

The hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) is the most serious acute hyperglycemic emergency in patients with type 2 diabetes. von Frerichs and Dreschfeld described the first cases of HHS in the 1880s in patients with an "unusual diabetic coma" characterized by severe hyperglycemia and glycosuria in the absence of Kussmaul breathing, with a fruity breath odor or positive acetone test in the urine. Current diagnostic HHS criteria include a plasma glucose level > 600 mg/dL and increased effective plasma osmolality > 320 mOsm/kg in the absence of ketoacidosis. The incidence of HHS is estimated to be < 1% of hospital admissions of patients with diabetes. The reported mortality is between 10 and 20%, which is about 10 times higher than the mortality rate in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Despite the severity of this condition, no prospective, randomized studies have determined best treatment strategies in patients with HHS, and its management has largely been extrapolated from studies of patients with DKA. There are many unresolved questions that need to be addressed in prospective clinical trials regarding the pathogenesis and treatment of pediatric and adult patients with HHS.

Pediatric HHS — targets for glucose and sodium correction during fluid therapy emphasize gradual changes: With adequate rehydration, serum glucose concentrations should decline by 75 to 100 mg/dL/hr (4.1–5.5 mmol/L/h), and lack of appropriate decline in serum glucose should prompt reassessment and evaluation of renal function; although there are no data to indicate an optimal rate of decline in serum sodium, a rate of 0.5 mEq/L per hour has been recommended for hypernatremic dehydration; replacement of urinary losses is recommended, and 0.45% saline solution approximates the typical urine sodium concentration during osmotic diuresis.

### Evaluation of hyperglycaemic emergency admissions to a major tertiary centre over a two-year period [^fc87a5e8]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In the mixed DKA/HHS subgroup (n = 24), 19/24 (79%) individuals were treated with the DKA protocol, while five of 24 (20.8%) were treated with the HHS protocol. Both the DKA (0.1 units/kg/h) and HHS protocols (0.05 units/kg/h) are fixed insulin rates based on body weight. The HHS insulin infusion starting dose (0.05 units/kg/h) was amended from the 2009 consensus guidelines. It was at the discretion of the treating endocrinologist to decide which protocol to follow.

In general, individuals treated with the HHS protocol were older, had slightly worse initial renal function and were slightly less acidotic and ketotic (Table 1). Individuals treated with the DKA protocol had slightly longer length of stay. The rates of hypokalaemia were similar regardless of the protocol used, but the rates of hyponatremia were higher in participants treated with the DKA protocol. Among some clinicians, the administration of basal insulin while on fixed‐rate intravenous insulin infusion has led to concerns about hypoglycaemia or hypokalaemia. Several studies have since reported that co‐administration of low‐dose basal insulin during insulin infusion reduces the time to DKA resolution without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia. Similarly, only a single case of hypoglycaemia was identified in our study following treatment with the DKA protocol. While the sample size was small, it is reassuring that the gentler HHS protocol can be used to treat mixed DKA/HHS with minimal adverse events, potentially resulting in a lower rate of electrolyte complications.

Hyperglycemic crisis recognition and sick day/home management — clinical directives include: hyperglycemic crisis should be considered in all individuals presenting with polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, vomiting, dehydration, and change in cognitive state; individuals at risk for DKA should be counseled on early signs and symptoms, provided urine and/or blood ketone tests, and educated on timely self-management; individuals treated with intensive insulin therapy should not stop or hold their basal insulin even if not eating; those with mild ketosis and potential precipitating factors, particularly if glucose levels exceed 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L), may be managed at home, and when hemodynamically and cognitively intact may treat mild DKA with frequent glucose and ketone monitoring, noncaloric hydration, and subcutaneous insulin; individuals should seek immediate medical attention if unable to hydrate orally, if glucose does not improve with insulin, with altered mental status, or signs of worsening illness; because HHS is associated with greater volume depletion and typically triggered by acute illness, suspected HHS should be immediately evaluated and treated in the inpatient setting.

1 INTRODUCTION

Until the publication of the first edition of this document, national guidelines on the management of hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) in adults had been uncommon. As is now well recognised, HHS is different to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and treatment requires a different approach. Although typically occurring in those aged over 45, HHS can present in children and younger adults, often as the initial presentation of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

HHS is uncommon. In the United States, it accounts for only 13% of hyperglycaemia‐related emergency admissionsbut has a higher mortality than DKA. There are no recent publications from the United Kingdom on mortality in HHS, but reported series suggest mortality may have improved though remains high at between 15% and 20%.,

HHS often develops over many days, and consequently, the dehydration and metabolic disturbances are usually more extreme than with DKA. Many people with diabetes have severe but transient elevations of blood glucose — the difference between this and HHS, being the duration of hyperglycaemia and the accompanying dehydration.

As with many serious but rare metabolic emergencies, the evidence for treatment is based more on clinical experience and consensus than randomised controlled trials. What is clear is that the greater mortality and morbidity in HHS is only in part related to age and co‐morbidities. There has been controversy around the speed and type of fluid replacement and when insulin should be introduced. However, the use of the previous edition of this guideline has standardised practice across many parts of the United Kingdom, with most teams feeling they were of good quality and safe.

2 DEFINITION AND DIAGNOSIS

International guidelines vary as to the precise definition of HHS, but there are characteristic features that differentiate it from other hyperglycaemic states such as DKA. Defining HHS by osmolality alone is inappropriate without considering other clinical features (Figure 3).

FIGURE 3
Definition and characteristic features of a person with HHS.

Previously called HyperOsmolar Non‐Ketotic (HONK) coma, it was apparent that most of these people were not comatosed but were extremely ill. Changing the name to Hyperosmolar Hyperglycaemic State (HHS) allows for the fact that some people with severely raised blood glucose may also be mildly ketotic and acidotic. The reasons why these people do not develop ketoacidosis are not fully understood. In HHS, insulin levels are just adequate to prevent ketogenesis but fail to counteract hyperglycaemia. Therefore, the presentation is mainly driven by extreme levels of hyperglycaemia and consequent osmotic diuresis.

People with HHS are generally older than those with DKA, but increasingly, as the diabetes pandemic crosses generational boundaries, it may be seen in young adults and even children as the first presentation of newly diagnosed diabetes.HHS has a slower onset than DKA. This is important because the brain tissue of those who develop HHS, particularly in those who are older, is at higher risk of injury due to rapid shifts in sodium, water and glucose. Therefore, to prevent significant neurological damage, HHS requires less aggressive fluid resuscitation and slower glucose‐lowering than DKA.

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) are potentially life-threatening complications of diabetes mellitus. Although DKA and HHS share similar features, they are distinct clinical entities requiring different treatment measures.

Objective

This case illustrates that the clinical distinction between these two entities can be difficult at times, especially in children who can present with an overlapping picture.

Case Report

We report an interesting case of a 12-year-old whose initial presentation of diabetes was a mixed picture of hyperosmolar DKA and HHS coma complicated by myocardial strain and acute renal insufficiency. The myocardial strain resolved completely with resolution of the metabolic abnormalities.

Conclusions

Emergency physicians should be cognizant of varied presentations of hyperglycemic emergencies in children to initiate appropriate management for better outcomes.

5 ESCALATION OF MANAGEMENT

Care for people with HHS can be complex, they often have multiple co‐morbidities and may require intensive monitoring. The presence of one or more of the following should prompt discussion about the need for admission to a High‐Dependency Unit/Level 2 environment. Immediate senior review by a clinician skilled in the management of HHS should be considered:
Measured or calculated Osmolality > 350 mOsm/kg
Sodium > 160 mmol/L
Venous/arterial pH < 7.1
Hypokalaemia (< 3.5 mmol/L) or hyperkalaemia (≥ 6 mmol/L) on admission
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) < 12 or abnormal AVPU (Alert, Voice, Pain, Unresponsive) scale
Oxygen saturation < 92% on air (assuming normal baseline respiratory function)
Systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg
Pulse > 100 or < 60 bpm
Urine output < 0.5 ml/kg/h
Serum creatinine > 200 μmol/L and/or acute kidney injury
Hypothermia
Macrovascular event such as myocardial infarction or stroke
Other serious co‐morbidity

### Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children: pathophysiological considerations and suggested guidelines for treatment [^a945c918]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Pediatric hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) fluid therapy — initial management should focus on volume expansion and perfusion restoration, with a minimum initial bolus of 20 mL/kg of isotonic saline solution (0.9% NaCl) and assumed fluid deficits of approximately 12% to 15% of body weight; subsequently, 0.45% to 0.75% NaCl should be given to replace the deficit over 24 to 48 hours, and isotonic fluids are recommended initially then followed by more hypotonic (0.45%-0.75% saline solution) fluids, with isotonic fluids restarted if perfusion and hemodynamic status worsen as osmolality declines; administration of isotonic fluids (0.9% saline solution) during ongoing osmotic diuresis may increase serum sodium concentration, which is undesirable as it may perpetuate the hyperosmolar state.

8 COMPLICATIONS

HHS has high mortality because it may be due to, or complicated by, vascular events such as myocardial infarction, stroke or peripheral arterial and venous thrombosis. Neurological complications, such as cerebral oedema and ODS are uncommon but can be seen as a complication of the rapid changes in osmolality during treatment of HHS.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hyperosmolar hyper‐glycaemic state (HHS) and mixed presentations are diabetes emergencies. We performed a retrospective cohort study to examine the demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment approaches and outcomes of participants requiring inpatient management for DKA and/or HHS at Prince of Wales Hospital, a tertiary facility in Sydney, Australia, between May 2022 and April 2024.

Definitions of HHS and DKA based on the American Diabetes Association (ADA) consensus report were used. Individuals with combined DKA and HHS had to meet both DKA and HHS criteria. We extracted demographic data from each participant during the index hospitalisation, the type of treatment protocol used (DKA, HHS) alongside the outcome and complications of treatment. Outcomes and complications of treatment included the presence of electrolyte derangements (corrected hyponatremia, hypokalaemia), hypoglycaemia, intensive care unit admission, length of stay and mortality. The SPSS statistics software (version 24.0; IBM) was used to undertake all statistical analyses. Independent sample t‐tests were undertaken for continuous data and Pearson's chi‐squared tests for categorical data. Adjustment for multiple comparisons were not undertaken. p < 0.05 defined statistical significance.

Rapid changes in osmolality may be harmful. 0.9% sodium chloride solution should be used as the principal fluid to restore circulating volume and reverse dehydration because it is relatively hypotonic compared to the serum in someone with HHS. Check osmolality every hour initially and the rate of fluid replacement adjusted accordingly to ensure a positive fluid balance sufficient to promote a gradual decline in osmolality. Fluid replacement alone (without insulin) will lower glucose concentrations which will lower serum osmolality by causing a shift of water into the intracellular space. This inevitably results in a rise in serum sodium (a fall in blood glucose of 5.5 mmol/L will result in a 2.4 mmol/L rise in sodium). This is not necessarily an indication to give hypotonic solutions. A rising sodium is only a concern if the osmolality is not declining concurrently. If the inevitable rise in serum sodium is much greater than 2.4 mmol/L for each 5.5 mmol/L fall in blood glucose this would suggest insufficient fluid replacement.

Overall, the rate of fall of serum sodium should not exceed 10 mmol/L in 24 h. A safe rate of fall of plasma glucose should not be more than 5 mmol/h. However, if the osmolality is no longer declining despite adequate fluid replacement with 0.9% sodium chloride solution and an adequate rate of fall of plasma glucose is not being achieved, then 0.45% sodium chloride solution should be substituted. There are no data to justify using fluids that are less concentrated than 0.45% sodium chloride solution.

Complete normalisation of electrolytes and osmolality may take up to 72 h.

2.2 Biochemical abnormalities

HHS should not be diagnosed using biochemical parameters alone. However, the blood glucose is markedly raised (usually ≥ 30 mmol/L), as is the osmolality (usually ≥ 320 mOsm/kg). Osmolality is useful as an indicator of severity and for monitoring the rate of change with treatment. Serum osmolality is often provided in biochemistry reports, either calculated or measured, but can be calculated using the formula [(2×Na +) + glucose + urea]. This formula gives the best approximation to measured osmolality, although a more accurate formula has been derived. For the sake of clarity, calculated osmolarity and measured osmolality is referred to as osmolality in this guideline. Urea is not an effective osmolyte but including it in the calculation is important in the hyperosmolar state, as it is one of the indicators of severe dehydration. The laboratory calculation may use a different formula and that laboratory measurement is a batched procedure, that is, may run once a day, so not usually available for rapid repeat measurements unless it is discussed with the laboratory. An increasing number of emergency departments and critical care units use blood gases machines that provide point of care measurement of osmolality.

### Is our understanding of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state accurate? [^5312f712]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) are two distinct hyperglycemic emergencies with different pathophysiological and clinical profiles. While DKA is more common, HHS carries higher mortality rates. Although low-dose insulin protocols used for DKA are often applied, no optimal, evidence-based strategies specific to HHS have been established.

Objectives

To examine clinical characteristics and the outcomes of HHS and DKA syndromes, and to characterize the factors contributing to a higher mortality rate in HHS. To contribute to the development of effective treatment strategies, with the goal of reducing HHS mortality in future research.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of admissions for HHS and DKA in adult patients between 2015 and 2021 in a large tertiary center. Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with HHS vs. DKA were compared. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality.

Results

Total 608 patients were included in the study, 223 (37%) patients in the HHS group and 385 (63%) in the DKA group. Patients in the HHS group were older (77.4 vs. 43.6 years, p < 0.001), had more infection as a trigger (41.7% vs. 20.5%, p < 0.001) and more co-morbidities. In-hospital mortality rate was higher in the HHS group (41.2% vs. 4.7%, p < 0.001), however, matched multivariate analysis showed no significant differences for in-hospital mortality (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.18–1.02).

Conclusion

Metabolic abnormalities alone do not appear to explain the worse outcomes observed in HHS compared to DKA. Our findings indicate that baseline comorbidities, age and infection trigger have more significant impact on outcomes than the patients' metabolic status.

### Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children: pathophysiological considerations and suggested guidelines for treatment [^d3ac2580]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) in children — presentation, dehydration pathophysiology, cerebral edema risk, and fluid management — shows overlap with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), as HHS is distinct from DKA but patients may present with features of both conditions, and children with HHS are often treated with DKA protocols. The gradually increasing polyuria and polydipsia of HHS may go unrecognized; as a result, both dehydration and electrolyte loss are profound in HHS, with fluid losses in adults estimated to be twice those of DKA, and obesity and hyperosmolality can make assessment of dehydration unreliable. Despite severe electrolyte losses and total body volume depletion, hypertonicity preserves intravascular volume and signs of dehydration may be less evident; during therapy, declining serum osmolality moves water out of the intravascular space with a decline in intravascular volume, osmotic diuresis may persist for hours, and ongoing urinary fluid losses early in treatment may be considerable. Because of these factors, children with HHS require more aggressive replacement of intravascular volume during treatment than do children with DKA to avoid the vascular collapse that contributes to the high mortality rate. Patients are believed to be at risk for cerebral edema if the rate of decline in serum osmolality exceeds brain clearance of osmotically active particles; however, in one case report with severe hyperglycemia and hyperosmolality (435 mosm/Kg) and intracranial pressure monitoring during treatment, no increase in intracranial pressure occurred during fluid resuscitation.

The clinical calculator "Curaçao Criteria for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia" for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

The Curaçao Criteria is a diagnostic scoring system specifically designed for Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome. This calculator is used in the clinical setting to help diagnose HHT, a genetic disorder that leads to abnormal blood vessel formation in the skin, mucous membranes, and often in organs such as the lungs, liver, and brain.

The Curaçao Criteria includes four components: spontaneous, recurrent nosebleeds; multiple telangiectasias in typical locations (lips, oral cavity, fingers, nose); a direct line first-degree relative with HHT; and visceral lesions such as gastrointestinal telangiectasia or arteriovenous malformations in the lungs, liver, brain, spine, or gastrointestinal tract.

A diagnosis of HHT is considered "definite" if three or more criteria are present, "possible" or "suspected" if two criteria are present, and "unlikely" if fewer than two criteria are present.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the Curaçao Criteria, but it should be noted that it is designed for use in patients with a suspected diagnosis of HHT. It may not be applicable or

The Curaçao Criteria for Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is a tool used to assess the likelihood that an individual has HHT based on specific clinical and familial indicators. The evaluation involves four key questions about symptoms and family history. Each question can be answered with a simple yes or no, and each affirmative answer contributes 1 point to the total score.

Here's how the scoring works:

- **Spontaneous, recurrent nosebleeds**: 1 point
- Multiple telangiectasias at characteristic sites (lips, oral cavity, fingers, and nose): 1 point
- Visceral lesions such as gastrointestinal telangiectasia, or arteriovenous malformations in the lungs, liver, brain, or spine: 1 point
- A first-degree relative meeting the diagnostic criteria for HHT: 1 point

The total score ranges from 0 to 4 based on the user's responses. This score determines the interpretation of the likelihood of having HHT:

- A score of less than 2 means the criteria are not met, suggesting it's unlikely the person has HHT.
- A score of exactly 2 suggests the criteria for possible HHT are met, indicating a potential but uncertain diagnosis needing further evaluation.
- A score of 3 or higher indicates the criteria for definite HHT are met, strongly suggesting the presence of HHT in the individual.

This systematic approach guides medical professionals in identifying individuals who may require further investigation or treatment for HHT.

### Risk factors for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in pediatric type 2 diabetes [^cd02b98b]. Pediatric Diabetes (2023). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) are hyperglycemic emergencies that can occur in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the setting of insulin deficiency. In both conditions, hyperglycemia contributes to osmotic diuresis, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities. It is thought that the relative state of insulin deficiency contributes to the differing clinical presentations. DKA occurs in the state of profound insulin deficiency, resulting in the lack of suppression of gluconeogenesis, increased glycogenolysis and lipolysis, and decreased glucose utilization. Increased lipolysis results in the conversion of free fatty acids to ketones including beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetone, and acetoacetate. The ensuing acidemia and acute symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain prompt patients and families to seek emergent medical care. In HHS, while insulin deficiency is present, there is still sufficient insulin production to suppress gluconeogenesis and prevent lipolysis. Dehydration is more profound in HHS, and severe electrolyte abnormalities can occur. Hyperosmolarity, a consequence of severe dehydration and hyperglycemia, results to maintain circulatory volume. While reversal of ketoacidosis with insulin infusion is the mainstay of DKA management, volume repletion and gradual correction of hyperglycemia are essential to prevent vascular collapse in HHS. As the clinical presentation of DKA and HHS can be similar, biochemical criteria are used to distinguish between these two entities. In HHS, venous pH is above 7.25 (arterial pH > 7.3), serum bicarbonate is above 15 mmol/L, plasma glucose concentration is above 600 mg/dL, ketones are absent or small in quantity, and an effective (not measured) serum osmolarity is above 320 mOsm/kg.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management [^4d2ab4c7]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Wilderness diabetes care — recommendations on ketosis kits, field management, and evacuation — Those with insulin-dependent diabetes should know the signs and symptoms of ketosis, carry a serum and/or urine ketone testing kit, and know how to treat ketones during wilderness activities, and it may be prudent to carry both as a contingency in the event of failure due to environmental conditions (Evidence grade: 1B). Ketosis may be safely managed in the wilderness if an athlete with diabetes and the athlete's healthcare provider are comfortable with a treatment protocol and if the patient is able to take oral hydration and nutrition and shows no signs of altered mental status (Evidence grade: 2C). Both HHS and DKA should be considered medical emergencies managed by emergent removal or evacuation to definitive care (Evidence grade: 1A), healthcare providers covering events or expeditions in the wilderness should have the ability to monitor blood glucose and ketones and have a basic familiarity with how to treat and triage glucose abnormalities (Evidence grade: 1C), and there should be a plan for evacuation in the case of a hyperglycemic emergency (Evidence grade: 1A).

### Gaps in our knowledge of managing inpatient dysglycaemia and diabetes in non-critically ill adults: a call for further research [^b7133e85]. Diabetic Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

When considering hyperglycaemic emergencies, DKA is one area of inpatient diabetes care that has been extensively studied over the last 100 years. However, there remain areas of uncertainty. One example is 'what is the correct resuscitation fluid to administer'? Despite the large numbers of people admitted to DKA, there have been very few trials looking at this and the answer remains unclear. Cerebral oedema, another feared complication, was thought to be due to the rate of fluid administration, administration of bicarbonate or the rapid shifts in osmolality. However, the largest randomised controlled trial from 2018 has questioned those theories. Whether the factors that predispose children to develop cerebral oedema are the same in adults remains unknown.

When considering hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic syndrome (HHS), to date there have been no prospective studies assessing the optimal management of this population, despite a 10‐fold higher mortality than DKA. The current protocols used have evolved over time and remain largely based on expert consensus.

### Humidification during invasive and noninvasive mechanical ventilation: 2012 [^f3b584d7]. Respiratory Care (2012). Medium credibility.

Resources for humidification — Appropriate equipment should be available to provide adequate humidification of inspired gas, including a humidification device, a system to monitor inspired gas temperature and to alarm when the temperature falls outside a preset range (for HH), sterile water for HH, and equipment necessary to adhere to universal precautions. Humidifier performance specifications should be checked to assure adequate heating and humidification during expected peak inspiratory flow rate and minute ventilation; HHs selected for use should meet the specifications of the ISO. Personnel should be licensed or credentialed with necessary training and demonstrated skills to correctly evaluate humidification during mechanical ventilation, assess the patient and the patient‑ventilator system, and exercise appropriate clinical judgment.

### Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children: pathophysiological considerations and suggested guidelines for treatment [^10fd32c7]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children — conclusions on epidemiology and management: HHS may be occurring with increased frequency in children and adolescents, and although population-based data are lacking, available literature suggests that pediatric HHS may differ from adult HHS. Pediatric HHS appears to occur most often in otherwise healthy children and adolescents with type 2 DM, particularly in obese African American males, and both rhabdomyolysis and a malignant hyperthermia-like syndrome may occur as complications. Mixed features of DKA and HHS may be more common in children than in adults, there may be a tendency toward inadequate rehydration in children with HHS, and increased awareness of pediatric HHS and differences in management strategy between DKA and HHS are needed to improve outcomes.

### Hyperglycemic hypernatremic hypertonic state: a predominant HHS subtype and its clinical and diagnostic features [^67944125]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) with concurrent hypernatremia is an emerging and under-investigated subtype of HHS.

Objective

To investigate the clinical characteristics, prevalence, and diagnostic parameters of this under-recognized HHS subtype.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of consecutive adults with diabetes admitted with HHS from 2018 to 2024 at a single institution. We assessed measured and corrected sodium, free water deficit, calculated effective serum osmolarity, calculated total serum osmolarity, and coexisting diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and metabolic acidosis.

Results

Among 174 patients with HHS, hypernatremia based on measured sodium (> 145 mmol/L) was uncommon (14/174, 8%), consistent with prior reports. However, hypernatremia based on corrected sodium for hyperglycemia was highly prevalent (166/174, 95.4%), suggesting that HHS with hypernatremia is the predominant subtype of HHS. Effective serum osmolarity > 300 mOsm/L was more sensitive than total serum osmolarity > 320 mOsm/L for diagnosing HHS. Additionally, 65.5% (114/174) of HHS cases had concurrent DKA, suggesting that the traditional exclusion of significant ketonemia and acidemia in HHS diagnosis may warrant reconsideration.

Conclusion

HHS with hypernatremia, defined by corrected sodium, is highly prevalent and clinically relevant, as corrected sodium better reflects the true free water deficit. HHS management should include evaluating both measured and corrected sodium, adopting effective serum osmolarity > 300 mOsm/L as a more sensitive diagnostic criterion, and reevaluating the exclusion criteria of significant ketonemia and acidosis. These refinements may enhance diagnostic accuracy and enable more personalized fluid management in HHS.

### Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state [^a531cfcc]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) is the most serious acute complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Emergency department management focuses on prompt diagnosis and restoration of hemodynamic stability with appropriate fluid therapy while maintaining electrolyte homeostasis. Identification of any precipitating illness is essential. The emergence of HHS as a critical presentation of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adolescents is highlighted.

### Management of diabetes-related hyperglycaemic emergencies in advanced chronic kidney disease: review of the literature and recommendations [^767de197]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Despite the substantial progress in the management of diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains one of the most common complications. Although uncommon, diabetic emergencies [diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS)] can still occur in stage 4 and 5 CKD, at times with less typical clinical manifestations due to the altered pathophysiology, presence of chronic metabolic acidosis and effect of haemodialysis on glycaemic control and metabolic parameters. The purpose of this article is to review the current literature and provide recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of DKA, euglycaemic DKA and HHS in people with advanced CKD.

Methods and Results

Guidance on the management of diabetes-related emergencies mainly focuses on individuals with preserved renal function or early-stage CKD. Existing literature is limited, and recommendations are based on expert opinions and case reports. Given the clinical need for amended guidelines for this population, we are proposing a management algorithm for DKA and HHS based on clinical and metabolic parameters.

Conclusions

In this review article, we propose treatment algorithms for diabetes-related hyperglycaemic emergencies in people with advanced CKD. Further research is needed to validate our proposed algorithms.

### Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children: pathophysiological considerations and suggested guidelines for treatment [^f91b6621]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Electrolyte imbalances (potassium, phosphate, and magnesium) in pediatric hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) are emphasized as more severe than in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), with specific management guidance: Potassium replacement should begin once concentrations are normal and renal function is adequate, be initiated at 40 mEq/L of replacement fluid, and be monitored at least every 2 to 3 hours during insulin administration with possible hourly monitoring and cardiac monitoring; bicarbonate therapy is contraindicated; phosphate deficits are more severe in HHS and intravenous solutions containing a 50:50 mixture of potassium phosphate and potassium chloride generally permit adequate replacement, with phosphate concentrations monitored at least every 3 to 4 hours; and for patients with hypocalcemia and low magnesium, magnesium replacement should be considered with a recommended dose of 25 to 50 mg/kg/dose for 3 to 4 doses given every 4 to 6 hours, with a maximum infusion rate of 150 mg/min and 2 g/h.

### Child with suspected type 2 diabetes [^1359bba9]. PES (2021). High credibility.

Child with suspected type 2 diabetes — diagnostic criteria and laboratory features include the following: diabetes is defined as fasting blood glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl, 2 hour post prandial glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl after glucose load of 1 gm/ kg (maximum dose: 75 gm), HbA1c ≥ 6.5% or random blood glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl in patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia, and in the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, result should be repeated. Simultaneous c-peptide level is elevated and undetectable pancreatic autoantibodies include islet cell antibodies (ICA), GAD-65, insulin antibodies, IA2A and ZnT8. Most commercial laboratories may have the assays to test for some/ most of the autoantibodies accurately. Should be done after discussion with the endocrinologist. Electrolyte abnormalities include pseudo-hyponatremia (secondary to blood glucose elevation), metabolic acidosis, elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine (secondary to dehydration), and liver function abnormality (secondary to Non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis [NASH]). Children with Type 2 diabetes can present in DKA and are also more likely to present with Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS), both of which are medical emergencies.

### Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children: pathophysiological considerations and suggested guidelines for treatment [^cb6f2378]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children — management in mixed DKA/HHS: In children with mixed diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS), guidelines for adjusting insulin and dextrose infusions should be similar to those generally recommended of DKA, with frequent reassessment of circulatory status and readjustment of fluid administration rates as dictated by clinical status. Insulin therapy dictates close attention to potassium and phosphate concentrations. In these patients, the risk of CE is higher than in classical HHS, so fluid treatment should therefore be aimed at ensuring adequate circulatory volume and cerebral perfusion while avoiding excess fluid administration, and frequent monitoring of mental status is essential.

### Diagnosis and acute management of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children and adolescents [^3335a16f]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) is an indolent process characterized by significantly increased levels of serum glucose, high osmolality, and electrolyte abnormalities. The incidence of HHS has steadily risen in the pediatric population over the past several years. Patients with HHS often present with profound dehydration, fatigue, and early mental status changes. Primary emergency management of HHS involves fluid replacement, hemodynamic support, correcting electrolyte derangements, and addressing complications and underlying illnesses. Insulin is not an initial therapy in HHS and should be considered only after the patient's fluids and electrolytes have been repleted. Unlike in diabetic ketoacidosis, HHS patients are not acidotic, although children may present with mixed HHS/diabetic ketoacidosis syndromes. Complications of HHS include thrombosis, rhabdomyolysis, and, rarely, malignant hyperthermia.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® methodology [^b8faf089]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The ACR Appropriateness Criteria® (AC) are evidence-based guidelines that guide physicians on appropriate image ordering. The AC development and revision process follows a transparent methodology that includes the systematic analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established guidelines standards (the Institute of Medicine's Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust) and methodologies (the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) to rate the benefits and potential risks, or appropriateness, of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In the October 2020 release, the methodology is applied in the development of 198 AC documents covering 1,760 clinical scenarios to make more than 8,815 recommendations, authored by more than 600 members representing multiple expert societies, and using more than 6,200 references. The ACR is recognized as a qualified provider-led entity by CMS for the development of appropriate use criteria. This paper describes the methodology and illustrates adherence to the process in the development of the AC.

### Incidence and characteristics of the hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state: a Danish cohort study [^345db448]. Diabetes Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) is a rare and life-threatening complication of diabetes. We aimed to estimate the incidence of HHS and describe the clinical and biomarker profiles of patients with HHS, including subgroups with acidosis and acute kidney injury.

Research Design and Methods

This nationwide, descriptive cohort study used Danish registry data during years 2016–2018 to identify acutely admitted patients fulfilling the hyperglycemia and hyperosmolarity criteria of HHS (glucose ≥ 33 mmol/L and osmolarity [2 × sodium + glucose] ≥ 320 mmol/L).

Results

We identified 634 patients (median age, 69 years (first quartile; third quartile: 58; 79) who met the criteria of HHS among 4.80 million inhabitants aged ≥ 18 years. The incidence rates were 16.5 and 3.9 per 10,000 person-years among people with known type 1 (n = 24,196) and type 2 (n = 251,357) diabetes, respectively. Thirty-two percent of patients with HHS were not previously diagnosed with diabetes. Patients were categorized as pure HHS (n = 394) and combined HHS and diabetic ketoacidosis (HHS-DKA; n = 240). The in-hospital mortality rate for pure HHS was 17% and 9% for HHS-DKA.

Conclusions

The incidence of HHS was higher among patients with type 1 diabetes compared with type 2 diabetes. HHS is a spectrum of hyperglycemic crises and can be divided in pure HHS and HHS-DKA. In one-third of patients, HHS was the debut of their diabetes diagnosis.

### Assessment of the clinical outcome of a symptom-based outpatient hyperglycemia protocol [^874fff77]. Diabetes Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) contribute significantly to the estimated US$174 billion annual cost of diabetes mellitus. Of the $116 billion in medical expenditures attributed to diabetes, approximately 50% ($58 billion) are inpatient costs.DKA and HHS are managed initially by hospital emergency departments (EDs), followed by inpatient medical care. A typical ED visit involves at least a 4-hour wait time, is inconvenient, and the average costs for a visit without admission are estimated at ≥ $1000. Wait time in the ED has increased in the last decade due to an increasing number of patients using the ED at the same time that more EDs are closing their doors.

Nationally recognized management protocols only exist for hospital settings. These protocols exist as initial treatment after the DKA or HHS diagnosis has been established. There is evidence to suggest type 1 diabetes patients with mild DKA can be managed with rapid-acting insulin analogs in an outpatient setting.–It is currently unknown if symptomatic, mild hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes patients can be managed adequately in an outpatient setting. Most diabetes education centers have policies and procedures to contact physicians when a patient presents with high blood glucose (BG) levels. However, no established outpatient hyperglycemia protocol exists. The literature does describe common causes of acute metabolic decompensation: acute illness (ie, infection, myocardial infection), noncompliance with treatment, and new-onset diabetes. Significant contributing factors within the noncompliance group are omission of insulin therapy and substance abuse (especially alcohol and cocaine). Even using the costs in 1998, national estimates for hospitalization for diabetic emergencies are high at $10,876, with an average length of stay of 6.6 days.

### Voluntary guidelines for managing food allergies in schools and early care and education programs [^b1ea35e6]. CDC (2013). Medium credibility.

Voluntary guidelines for managing food allergies — evidence base and development methods are described: CDC staff reviewed documents and eliminated sources that were outdated (earlier than 2000), were superseded by more current data or recommendations, in conflict with current standards of clinical and school-based practice, reflected international recommendations not relevant to U.S. schools or early care and education (ECE) programs, or were limited to adult food allergies. CDC staff relied heavily on the content and references in the 2010 Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Food Allergy in the United States, and while the 2010 guidelines did not address the management of patients with food allergies outside of clinical settings (and thus did not directly address the management of food allergies in schools), they were deemed an important source for informing the clinical practice recommendations for managing risks for children with food allergies. To ensure alignment with other chronic condition guidance, staff added search terms including "school", "asthma", "diabetes", "epilepsy", "chronic condition", and "management", and used information from three documents: Students with Chronic Illness: Guidance for Families, Schools, and Students, Managing Asthma: A Guide for Schools, and Helping the Student with Diabetes Succeed: A Guide for School Personnel. They analyzed best practice documents, state school food allergy guidelines (n = 14), and relevant organizations' position statements for compatibility with expert priorities, common themes, and the accuracy and clarity of recommendations based on clinical standards and scientific evidence. CDC also solicited expertise and input from the Office of the General Counsel; Office of Safe and Healthy Students, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education; Office for Civil Rights; and Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, U.S. Department of Education (ED); the Civil Rights Division, U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ); and the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Early Childhood, Administration for Children and Families, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

### Management of hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) in adults: an updated guideline from the joint British diabetes societies (JBDS) for inpatient care group [^28cc673c]. Diabetic Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Serum sodium, a close approximation to osmolality in the absence of hyperglycaemia, may be reassuringly normal or even low in the presence of hyperglycaemia. The addition of glucose to the extracellular space causes an osmotic shift of free water into the extracellular fluid and a resultant dilution of serum sodium.

There are many different formulae to calculate osmolality, for example [(2×Na +) + glucose + urea], [2(Na + +K +) + glucose], and [2×Na + + glucose]. The best approximation to measured osmolality can be calculated using the formula [(2×Na +) + glucose + urea], though a more accurate formula has been derived. However, as urea is an ineffective osmolyte, it can be omitted from the equation to allow calculation of tonicity (or effective osmolality). This is of the greatest importance when someone is hyponatraemic since tonicity indicates risk of cerebral oedema, that is, hypo‐osmolality.

Thus, an individual with a Na + 122 mmol/L, glucose 13 mmol/L, urea 23 mmol/L has a calculated osmolality of 280 mOsm/kg and an effective osmolality of 257 mOsm/kg, whereas a person with a Na + 122 mmol/L, glucose 30 mmol/L, urea 4 mmol/L has a calculated osmolality of 278 mOsm/kg and an effective osmolality of 274 mOsm/kg. So the person with the raised urea has a much lower effective osmolality and is therefore at a greater risk of osmotic demyelination should correction of the hyponatraemia be too fast. The hyponatraemia in an individual with a blood glucose of 30 mmol/L is largely dilutional and will correct as the glucose falls (corrected Na + = 122 + (2.4 × 4) = 131.6). In the hyperosmolar state, osmolality is useful as an indicator of severity and for monitoring the rate of change with treatment. If frequent measurement of osmolality is not practical, osmolality should be calculated using the formula [(2×Na +) + glucose + urea]. This is the formula used throughout this guideline.

Table 4: Prioritized future questions for time-limited trials in critical care outlines key unanswered questions by stakeholder. For patients, surrogates, and families, questions address perspectives on the concept, best communication wording, benefits and harms, ensuring a collaborative process centered on the patient's perspective, participation factors, and effects on trust in clinicians and health systems. For interprofessional clinicians who care for critically ill patients, questions are grouped by "Consider phase", "Plan phase", "Support phase", and "Reassess phase", and address identifying appropriate patients, uncertainty, determining and tailoring duration, clinical criteria of improvement and/or deterioration, documentation, dissemination across large teams and staffing rotations, defining major changes warranting reconsideration, and addressing unanticipated changes or rotational revisits to plans. For health systems, questions focus on supporting optimal implementation, impacts on health systems, and ensuring systemic biases do not propagate inequities.

### Severe complications after initial management of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome and diabetic ketoacidosis with a standard diabetic ketoacidosis protocol [^a6d4cb6a]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) is a clinical entity not identical to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and with a markedly higher mortality. Children with HHS can also present with concomitant DKA. Patients with HHS (with or without DKA) are profoundly dehydrated but often receive inadequate fluid resuscitation as well as intravenous insulin therapy based on traditional DKA protocols, and this can lead to devastating consequences. In this article, we briefly review HHS along with a report of an adolescent who presented with HHS and DKA and was initially managed as DKA. She went into hypotensive shock and developed severe, multiorgan failure. A thorough understanding of the pathophysiology of HHS and its differences from DKA in terms of initial management is crucial to guide management and improve outcomes. Additionally, fluid therapy in amounts concordant with the degree of dehydration remains the mainstay therapy.

### Decompensated hyperglycemic hyperosmolarity without significant ketoacidosis in the adolescent and young adult population [^24ed0930]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Aim

To identify patients aged 10–30 years with probable hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS), to describe demographic and clinical profiles, and to attempt to assess risk factors for poor outcomes.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study (medical records review).

Setting

A 944-bed tertiary care teaching and research hospital and a 425-bed affiliated facility.

Patients

10–30 year-old patients with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis of HHS or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Patients with a serum glucose > 600 mg/dl in the absence of significant ketoacidosis (possible HHS) were profiled. Further stratification based on measured or calculated serum osmolarity > 320 mOsm/kg (probable HHS) was undertaken.

Interventions

Patients received treatment for hyperglycemic crises, consisting primarily of fluids, electrolyte replacement and insulin.

Measurements and Main Results

Of the 629 admissions, 10 with a diagnosis of HHS and 33 with a diagnosis of DKA met the initial study criteria for HHS. 60% were African Americans and 89% were new-onset diabetics. From this group, 20 admissions had serum osmolarity ≥ 320 mOsm/kg. Fisher's exact test and Pearson coefficients were used to examine associations between risk factor and poor outcomes and correlations between admission data and length of hospital stay, respectively. Serious complications occurred in four patients (including two deaths, 10% mortality) and were limited to those with unreversed shock over the first 24 hours of admission and who received < 40 ml/kg of intravenous fluids over the first 6 hours of treatment.

Conclusions

HHS was underdiagnosed in this population and occurred disproportionately in African Americans. Serious complications occurred exclusively in those with unreversed shock and inadequate fluid resuscitation.

### Evaluation of hyperglycaemic emergency admissions to a major tertiary centre over a two-year period [^a4321dec]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

TABLE 1
Characteristics on individuals with mixed DKA/HHS treated with either the DKA or HHS protocol.

TABLE 2
Comparison between participants who were admitted into HDU/ICU vs. those who were admitted directly onto the wards. [Correction added on 20 May 2025 after first online publication: In the first column of the hypokalaemia row, the numbers have been updated.]

Our study has several limitations. As it was conducted at a single tertiary hospital with a small cohort, the findings may not be extrapolated to all participants. Additionally, we only reviewed participants who presented through the Emergency Department and were admitted under Endocrinology. Although it is unlikely, we cannot fully exclude the possibility that some participants with hyperglycaemic emergencies were admitted under a different specialty.

In conclusion, in a small cohort of mixed DKA/HHS participants, treatment with either the HHS or DKA protocol did not result in substantially different outcomes. Hypokalemia and hyponatremia are common complications in all subtypes of hyperglycaemic emergencies, and enhanced recognition is necessary to prevent these issues. Larger studies, informed by the more recent 2024 ADA guidelines, are required to determine the optimal IV insulin infusion regimens for participants presenting with mixed DKA/HHS.

### An effective approach to high blood pressure control: a science advisory from the American Heart Association, the American college of cardiology, and the centers for disease control and prevention [^0de980e1]. Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Call-to-Action, Next Steps, and Conclusions

It is critical that the AHA, ACC and CDC, together with other organizations, continue to identify, define, and implement exemplary local, regional, and national programs that facilitate better blood pressure awareness, treatment, and control together with improving other cardiovascular health factors and behaviors. Arming healthcare providers, health systems, and communities with proven tools, algorithms, strategies, programs, and other best practices along with expertise and technical assistance for improving blood pressure awareness, treatment, and control is essential to reducing the tremendous burden of cardiovascular risk.

This advisory serves as a call to action for broad-based efforts to improve hypertension awareness, treatment, and the proportion of patients treated and controlled. There is a clear need to provide enhanced, evidence-based, blood pressure treatment systems for providers, including standardization of protocols and algorithms, incentives for improved performance based on achieving and maintaining patients at blood pressure goals, and technology-facilitated clinical decision support and feedback. As noted previously, health system wide implementation of focused evidence-based hypertension treatment algorithms together with regularly scheduled performance feedback within a coordinated multifactorial management program have been associated with substantially improved hypertension control in large populations and varied clinical practice settings.– This approach can facilitate the ability to emphasize existing evidence-based recommendations and integrate new evidence as it becomes available. Successful best practices or innovations can be further identified and then disseminated health system wide. Such an approach is scalable, sustainable, and of high value, especially as the use of electronic medical records becomes even more widespread nationally. This advisory has provided a number of examples of algorithms from successful programs that can be readily implemented in diverse healthcare settings. Greater participation in innovative programs such as the AHA's Heart 360 personal health record, AHA/ASA's Get With The Guidelines Program, the AHA/ADA/ACS Guideline Advantage Program, and the HHS Million Hearts initiative, as well as the ACC's National Cardiovascular Data Registries (NCDR)and CDC Coverdell Stroke registry, should also be encouraged and incentivized.

Route of insulin administration — subcutaneous preferred with limited intravenous exception: Studies demonstrate that subcutaneous rapid-acting insulins quickly and safely correct elevated BG concentrations in patients at risk for complications from significant hyperglycemia, indicating a comparable effect to intravenous regular insulin infusion. Therefore, the task force recommends the use of subcutaneous insulin to correct hyperglycemia in the ambulatory setting with the following exception: intravenous insulin boluses may be appropriate when severe hyperglycemia (> 300 mg/dL) is detected in the absence of DKA or HHS and the patient is undergoing a short procedure. A single intravenous bolus dose of regular insulin has a short duration of action, which requires repeated dosing and close monitoring.

The writing committee discussed all recommendations with the consideration of the risk vs benefit of an intervention and the strength of the evidence. To assess consensus after discussions, the writing committee members participated in surveys. A predefined threshold of 80% approval for each recommendation was required, with a quorum of two-thirds of the writing committee. An initial failure to reach consensus was resolved by subsequent discussions, revisions as needed, and revoting. Writing committee members with RWI did not vote on recommendations concerning relevant topics. The final mean consensus over all recommendations was 97.3%, with 32 of 73 recommendations reaching 100% consensus.

1.6. Class of recommendation and level of evidence

Recommendations in this guideline are designated with a class of recommendation (COR) and a level of evidence (LOE). The COR denotes the strength of the recommendation based on an assessment of the magnitude and certainty of the benefits in proportion to the risks. The LOE reflects the quality of the evidence that supports the recommendation based on type, quantity, and consistency of data from clinical trials and other sources (Table 1).

For clarity and usefulness, each recommendation is linked to the supportive evidence through the specific references from the literature used to justify the LOE rating, which are also summarized in the evidence tables (Appendix 3). Each recommendation is accompanied by supportive text. Algorithms and tables provide a summary of the recommendations, intended to assist clinicians at the point of care.

1.7. Document review and approval

The HRS invites public and stakeholder involvement in document development. In addition to patient representation on the writing committee, draft recommendations were posted for public comment, and contribution was solicited from regulatory agencies and patient organizations.

This guideline was approved by the writing committee and underwent internal review by the HRS Scientific and Clinical Documents Committee. The document underwent external peer review by reviewers appointed by HRS and each of the collaborating societies, and revisions were made by the chairs. A record of writing committee response to reviewer comments and rationale is maintained by the HRS.

1.8. Document updates

The HRS Scientific and Clinical Documents Committee reviews each clinical practice document for currency at least every 5 years, or earlier in the event of newly published data. Literature is routinely monitored to evaluate the continued validity of recommendations.

### Atherogenic dyslipidemia in metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes: therapeutic options beyond statins [^91bb9c25]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2006). Low credibility.

Fibrates: new evidences from HHS, BIP extensions and FIELD

Fibrates have been used in clinical practice for more than four decades due to their ability substantially to decrease triglyceride levels, to increase HDL-cholesterol levels and in addition to reduce LDL-cholesterol moderately but significant.

Due to their beneficial effects on glucose and lipid metabolism, PPAR's alpha agonists (fibrates) are good potential candidates for reducing the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) in subjects with metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Although less clinical intervention studies have been performed with fibrates than with statins, there are evidences indicating that fibrates may reduce risk of cardiovascular disease and particularly non-fatal MI. Interestingly, reduction of cardiovascular disease with two of the fibric acid derivates – gemfibrozil and bezafibrate – was more pronounced in patients displaying baseline characteristics very similar to metabolic syndrome definitions.

There have been no direct head-to-head comparisons of a statin with a fibrate in any clinical endpoint trial. However, compared with statins, fibrates appear to more selectively target the therapeutic goals in obese individuals with features of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome (i.e. with near-goal LDL-cholesterol and inappropriate HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels).

Gemfibrozil: confirmed long-term efficacy

The primary-prevention trial Helsinki Heart Study (HHS) showed that treatment with gemfibrozil led to a significant reduction in major cardiovascular events. Regarding secondary prevention, in the VA-HIT study (Veterans Affairs High-density lipoprotein cholesterol Intervention Trial) – which included 30% of diabetic patients – gemfibrozil reduced the occurrence of major cardiovascular events by 22%. Similarly, reduction of cardiovascular disease with gemfibrozil was more pronounced in patients displaying above three of the features of metabolic syndrome.

The 18-year results from the Helsinki Heart Study shows that patients in the original gemfibrozil group had a 23% lower risk of CAD mortality compared with the original placebo group. But those in the highest tertile of both body-mass index and triglyceride level at baseline had the most dramatic risk reductions with gemfibrozil – 71% for CAD mortality and 33% for all-cause mortality.

These results are entirely consistent with the original positive results of HHS and are strongly supported by the findings of VA-HIT.

### Efficacy of a new protocol of premixed 70 / 30 human insulin in Haitian youth with diabetes [^832f45c8]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Baseline and Study Treatment Protocols

The baseline treatment protocol included twice-daily insulin doses, one or two SMBG tests per day, a monthly 10-minute visit and the recommendation to present the SMBG and insulin adjustment reports at each visit. The carbohydrate (CHO) counting method, which included Haitian meals, was refreshed.

Patients were provided with free SMBG supplies, insulin and syringes through the Life for a Child Program. Hyperglycemic crises including diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) were defined according to the consensus guidelines of the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD). The biochemical criteria, which are generally associated with a variable clinical presentation, for the diagnosis of DKA were: blood glucose (BG) > 200 mg/dL (11 mmol/L), venous pH < 7.3 or bicarbonate < 15 mmol/L, ketonemia or ketonuria. The criteria for HHS included: BG > 600 mg/dL (33.3 mmol/L), venous pH > 7.25 or arterial pH > 7.30, serum bicarbonate > 15 mmol/L, small ketonuria, absent to mild ketonemia, effective serum osmolality > 320 mOsm/kg, altered consciousness (e.g. obtundation, combativeness) or seizures. Severe hypoglycemia was defined in adulthood as an asymptomatic hypoglycemic event associated with severe cognitive impairment (including coma and convulsions) requiring external assistance by another person to actively take corrective actions. In childhood, it was defined as an event associated with severe neuroglycopenia resulting in coma or seizure and requiring parenteral therapy (glucagon or intravenous glucose).

### Management of food allergy in schools: clinical report [^27d86376]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Food allergy management in schools — federal laws and protections include Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, USDA regulations 7 CFR Part 15b, Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), American Disabilities Act of 1990 and ADA Amendments of 2008, and The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act 2011. Section 504 protects the rights of students with disabilities, including food allergy, and a 504 Plan is a written, enforceable agreement ensuring implementation of policies, procedures, and protocols. USDA regulations require that substitutions be available for meals for students whose medical condition restricts diet, with licensed physician documentation identifying the disability, major life activity impacted, allergen to avoid, and replacement foods. FERPA protects a student's education records, including private health information, and such information shall only be shared with those necessary to protect student safety. The ADA protects the civil rights of individuals, including students with disabilities, and unlike Section 504, applies to some private schools that do not receive federal funding. The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act required HHS and the Department of Education to develop voluntary guidelines for schools and early childhood programs to manage food allergies and severe allergic reactions in children.

### Primary outcomes for resuscitation science studies: a consensus statement from the American Heart Association [^45413d45]. Circulation (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The guidelines presented in this consensus statement are intended to serve researchers, clinicians, reviewers, and regulators in the selection of the most appropriate primary outcome for a clinical trial of cardiac arrest therapies. The American Heart Association guidelines for the treatment of cardiac arrest depend on high-quality clinical trials, which depend on the selection of a meaningful primary outcome. Because this selection process has been the subject of much controversy, a consensus conference was convened with national and international experts, the National Institutes of Health, and the US Food and Drug Administration.

Methods

The Research Working Group of the American Heart Association Emergency Cardiovascular Care Committee nominated subject leaders, conference attendees, and writing group members on the basis of their expertise in clinical trials and a diverse perspective of cardiovascular and neurological outcomes (see the online-only Data Supplement). Approval was obtained from the Emergency Cardiovascular Care Committee and the American Heart Association Manuscript Oversight Committee. Preconference position papers were circulated for review; the conference was held; and postconference consensus documents were circulated for review and comments were invited from experts, conference attendees, and writing group members. Discussions focused on (1) when after cardiac arrest the measurement time point should occur; (2) what cardiovascular, neurological, and other physiology should be assessed; and (3) the costs associated with various end points. The final document underwent extensive revision and peer review by the Emergency Cardiovascular Care Committee, the American Heart Association Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee, and oversight committees.

Results

There was consensus that no single primary outcome is appropriate for all studies of cardiac arrest. The best outcome measure is the pairing of a time point and physiological condition that will best answer the question under study. Conference participants were asked to assign an outcome to each of 4 hypothetical cases; however, there was not complete agreement on an ideal outcome measure even after extensive discussion and debate. There was general consensus that it is appropriate for earlier studies to enroll fewer patients and to use earlier time points such as return of spontaneous circulation, simple "alive versus dead", hospital mortality, or a hemodynamic parameter. For larger studies, a longer time point after arrest should be considered because neurological assessments fluctuate for at least 90 days after arrest. For large trials designed to have a major impact on public health policy, longer-term end points such as 90 days coupled with neurocognitive and quality-of-life assessments should be considered, as should the additional costs of this approach. For studies that will require regulatory oversight, early discussions with regulatory agencies are strongly advised. For neurological assessment of post-cardiac arrest patients, researchers may wish to use the Cerebral Performance Categories or modified Rankin Scale for global outcomes.

Conclusions

Although there is no single recommended outcome measure for trials of cardiac arrest care, the simple Cerebral Performance Categories or modified Rankin Scale after 90 days provides a reasonable outcome parameter for many trials. The lack of an easy-to-administer neurological functional outcome measure that is well validated in post-cardiac arrest patients is a major limitation to the field and should be a high priority for future development.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^3ba3b5bc]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

ACC/AHA clinical practice guideline methodology — alignment with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) processes is emphasized: The goal of this guiding document is to ensure alignment between the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval processes for drugs and devices and the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) guideline recommendations. Foundational principles state that AHA/ACC Guidelines should not recommend the use of non–FDA-approved drugs or devices and that AHA/ACC Guidelines provide a Class of Recommendation (COR) and Level of Evidence (LOE) for many FDA-approved drugs or devices for a specific clinical diagnosis. Throughout this document, the term "FDA approval" is used to encompass drug approvals and device clearances, and the report notes considerable nuances and provides relevant questions and proposed answers to guide incorporation of FDA processes into AHA/ACC guideline methodology.

### Pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis with hyperosmolarity: clinical characteristics and outcomes [^ac0a779b]. Endocrine Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Studies of hyperglycemic emergencies with hyperosmolality, including hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) and "mixed presentation" with features of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and HHS, are lacking in children. Objectives were to determine the incidence of DKA, HHS, and mixed presentation in a pediatric population, to characterize complications, and to assess accuracy of associated diagnosis codes.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study of 411 hyperglycemic emergencies in pediatric patients hospitalized between 2009 and 2014. Hyperglycemic emergency type was determined by biochemical criteria and compared to the associated diagnosis code.

Results

Hyperglycemic emergencies included: 333 DKA, 54 mixed presentation, and 3 HHS. Altered mental status occurred more frequently in hyperosmolar events (P < .0001), and patients with hyperosmolarity had 3.7-fold greater odds of developing complications compared to those with DKA (P = 0.0187). Of those with DKA, 98.5% were coded correctly. The majority (81.5%) of mixed DKA-HHS events were coded incorrectly. Events coded incorrectly had 3.1-fold greater odds of a complication (P = 0.02).

Conclusion

A mixed DKA-HHS presentation occurred in 13.8% of characterized hyperglycemic emergencies, whereas HHS remained a rare diagnosis (0.8%) in pediatrics. Hyperosmolar events had higher rates of complications. As treatment of hyperosmolarity differs from DKA, its recognition is essential for appropriate management.

Abbreviations

AMS = altered mental status; DKA = diabetic ketoacidosis; EMR = electronic medical record; HHS = hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state; ICD-9 = International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision; ISPAD = International Society of Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes; NODM = new-onset diabetes mellitus; T1DM = type 1 diabetes mellitus; T2DM = type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children: pathophysiological considerations and suggested guidelines for treatment [^a130289d]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Complications (thrombosis, rhabdomyolysis, malignant hyperthermia, and CE) in pediatric hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) include thromboembolism for which prophylactic low-dose heparin lacks proven benefit and carries bleeding risk; therefore, heparin treatment should generally be reserved for children with central venous catheters who are immobile for > 24 to 48 hours, with compression stockings considered. Rhabdomyolysis may occur and monitoring of creatine kinase concentration every 2 to 3 hours is recommended, with prompt nephrology consultation if suspected. A malignant hyperthermialike syndrome has been reported, and treatment with dantrolene should be initiated early for children with fever and a rise in creatine kinase. Altered mental status is common with osmolality greater than 330 mOsm/Kg at presentation, but declines after improvement in the hyperosmolar state are unusual and should prompt further investigation; patients should be monitored for headache and changes in consciousness, and severe dehydration, electrolyte disturbance, and hypertonicity are far more frequent causes of death than CE, so concerns about possible CE should not deter giving necessary fluids.

### Assessment of the clinical outcome of a symptom-based outpatient hyperglycemia protocol [^79c2bdfe]. Diabetes Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Methods and Procedures

Clinical decision-making related to acute hyperglycemia was summarized with the creation of an assessment document (see Appendix 1). The assessment document was intended as a medical decision-making tool to determine appropriateness for outpatient treatment. Patients who gave consent were managed by the use of a protocol for hyperglycemia using FSBS, rapid-acting insulin analog, hydration (either intravenous [IV] or oral), diabetes self-management education, and discharge instructions (see Appendix 2). The goal was to decrease BG levels by 75–100 mg/dL per hour.

The initial insulin dose was 0.15 units/kg subcutaneously (SQ) into the abdomen. This is the IV dose recommended by the ADA for HHS management. Subcutaneous administration was chosen so that the protocol would be simple, and because IV access in the outpatient environment is often unavailable. Subsequent insulin doses were determined by the physician and pharmacist. Any subsequent dose was very patient specific, and based on several factors: 1) the rate of decline of the BG level after the first insulin dose; 2) amount of hydration given; 3) the type of diabetes; 4) body weight; 5) body habitus; and 6) total daily insulin dose for current insulin users. Type2 diabetes patients may have required additional insulin doses depending on the level of insulin resistance. Type 1 diabetes patients (a small percent of our diabetic population) are very insulin sensitive, and therefore required small amounts of insulin. Protocol patients received either a telephone follow-up or an appointment with the primary-care physician or pharmacist-diabetes educator within 72 hours.

### 2025 ACC / AHA clinical practice guidelines core principles and development process: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^3f957593]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Social determinants of health (SDOH) — All clinical practice guideline recommendations should consider SDOH, the structural determinants and conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age that affect health, functioning, and quality of life; five key domains comprise SDOH, including economic stability, neighborhood and built environment, education, social and community context, and health and health care; strategies to integrate SDOH in electronic health records and data repositories are necessary to ensure that these standards can be deployed to achieve more equitable and optimal health outcomes, and SDOH affect a wide range of health risks, outcomes, and quality-of-life indicators and contribute to health disparities; therefore, it is critical to incorporate SDOH into clinical practice, addressing them with each and every patient.

### Hierarchical composite endpoints in clinical trials for multimorbid older adults [^5909f23b]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Box 1
Examples of studies that may employ proposed hierarchical composite endpoints in clinical trials for multimorbid older adults

Competing risks are a frequent challenge in trials among multimorbid older adults, where death can preclude observation of other clinically relevant outcomes such as hospitalization, functional decline, or changes in quality of life. When all components are time-to-event measures and death is explicitly included in a conventional composite endpoint, competing risk concerns are largely addressed. However, many trials analyze continuous or ordinal outcomes (e.g. change in eGFR, quality-of-life scores) over a shorter follow-up period to demonstrate 'proof of concept' and/or for feasibility reasons. In these cases, conventional mean-difference analyses typically rely on data from survivors only or assign arbitrary worst scores to deceased patients, which can bias results. HCEs offer a principled alternative by allowing death to be explicitly included in the hierarchy: pairwise comparisons are resolved on death first when relevant, while continuous outcomes are compared among surviving patients using prespecified clinically meaningful thresholds. This approach preserves the power advantage of continuous endpoints, avoids survivor-only bias, and ensures that deaths are properly accounted for in the overall treatment effect estimate.

While HCEs provide flexibility, defining an appropriate hierarchy can be complex, particularly for multimorbid older adults. The order of outcomes must balance clinical significance with patient-centered goals, which may vary widely among these patients. For instance, some patients might prioritize survival while others may prefer independence and quality of life over longevity, especially if living with severe medical complications. Establishing an optimal hierarchy would require input from clinicians, patients, and caregivers, as well as a clear understanding of disease progression. A potential solution could be to construct a patient-specific hierarchy of clinical outcomes, informed by individual preferences. Data on these preferences can be collected during study participation. Based on the ranked importance of outcomes (e.g. first, second, or nth priority), weights can be assigned and subsequently incorporated into the calculation of the 'win' in hierarchical composite endpoints. Nonetheless, standardization and validation of outcome hierarchies are essential to enhance the acceptability of HCEs in clinical trials. To support this, regulatory agencies could establish formal validation frameworks for the components of HCEs. In parallel, trial sponsors should engage early with regulators, provide justification for the chosen hierarchy based on clinical relevance, and conduct pre-specified sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of trial findings.

### Reducing the global burden of myopia by delaying the onset of myopia and reducing myopic progression in children: the academy's task force on myopia [^1a127a96]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Reversible homonymous hemianopia in a newly diagnosed diabetic man — a 53-year-old healthy man presented with acute-onset left homonymous hemianopia (HH) suggestive of a right occipital lobe stroke. Serum glucose was severely elevated (999 mg/dl, normal 64−138), consistent with hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS). Perimetry revealed left HH, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated right occipital lobe subcortical T2 hypointensity without diffusion restriction; this pattern is inconsistent with ischemic stroke and has been described in HHS. At 1 month, the perimetry and MRI anomalies normalized with the treatment of diabetes.

### Recommendations for clinical trial design in acute kidney injury from the 31st Acute Disease Quality Initiative consensus conference. A consensus statement [^6964075b]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment studies

Phase 2 trials serve a key fundamental purpose in the development of treatments for AKI, encompassing evidence of efficacy and dose–response, safety, and feasibility (Fig. 1). The endpoints selected to evaluate efficacy must provide a reliable measure of response to the treatment. This can be qualified as categorical (i.e. no response; favorable response; adverse response) or as continuous (i.e. changes in measures of kidney function, damage or other biological variables). Evidence-informed thresholds for endpoints are necessary to describe but are currently largely uncertain. Ideally, these endpoints are highly correlated, and even causally correlated, with validated patient-centered endpoints. There is recognition that the trial design may guide the selection of context-specific endpoints for phase 2 trials. For example, a phase 2 trial evaluating a novel drug or biologic agent to modify kidney injury in patients with persistent AKI may have endpoints that differ from a phase 2 trial evaluating the implementation of a care process bundle in clusters of patients with persistent AKI.

A key objective of phase 2 trials is an evaluation of whether the trial is feasible to successfully perform and complete given that phase 2 trials have a fundamental role in the rationale and justification for progression to a phase 3 trial. The pursuit of phase 3 trials based on non-feasible phase 2 trials may ultimately compromise the rigorous evaluation of promising treatments for AKI. This may result from premature termination, loss of internal validity due to protocol violations (e.g. treatment crossover), and information bias due to missed or incomplete endpoint assessment. There are abundant measures of feasibility that phase 2 trials must consider: randomization features, enrollment measures, protocol fidelity (e.g. treatment delivery), and endpoint measures (e.g. biologic sampling; ascertainment).

These feasibility measures may be independent of the expected biologic action (or clinical action) of the treatment being evaluated.

### Defining the time-limited trial for patients with critical illness: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^d6bb3754]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2024). High credibility.

Time-limited trial in critical care — conceptual framing and objectives are described with strong operational consensus but varied views on aims; although a "majority (> 50%) of Delphi participants agreed or strongly agreed with each potential objective of a time-limited trial, none met our a priori defined consensus threshold". Potential objectives listed include to increase the patient's and/or surrogate decision maker's readiness to make decisions about limiting or withdrawing life-sustaining interventions, to decrease uncertainty about the patient's prognosis, to help align expectations about the benefits and downsides of life-sustaining interventions, and to decrease uncertainty about the patient's goals, priorities, and/or treatment preferences. The committee also concludes the approach is "distinct from current 'usual care'" because it is explicitly proposed and endorsed by the patient and/or surrogate(s), and that time-limited trials can be considered for an individual, specific life-sustaining therapy or for life-sustaining care in general.

### Tracing and assessing the evolution of clinical guidelines [^78555b66]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Critically, over the years, the methods used to formulate and justify guidelines have evolved and the LOE and COR categories have not remained static (Table). 3, 4, 5 In 2012, the American College of Cardiology Foundation/AHA convened a summit to update clinical practice guideline methodology. 6 As a result, the methodology of the guidelines evolved to align more closely with recommendations from the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine). This major effort was executed by 5 working groups (organized around the following themes: developing guidelines deemed trustworthy, initiating a systematic review, finding and assessing individual studies, synthesizing evidence, and reporting systematic reviews). The major outcomes of the methodology summit were that all guideline writing groups include patients, conduct a formal systematic review, articulate a detailed and specific relationship with industry policy, balance representation across race/ethnicity and sex (among others), and expand the review process (ie, expanded beyond subject matter experts only to important stakeholder groups, including governmental representatives). In 2016, the AHA/ACC made efforts to create guidelines that are parsimonious and focus on high‐quality evidence in order to improve the utility of the guideline to the healthcare provider because historically a large proportion of recommendations were based on LOE C and a modest proportion on LOE A. 5

### 36th international symposium on intensive care and emergency medicine: brussels, belgium. 15–18 March 2016 [^1600dd3c]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Results: We identified 14 patients with severe hypernatraemia over the past two years in our Critical Care Unit. The plasma sodium range was 160 to 196 mmol/L. All values > 170 mmol/L occurred in patients with hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS). The underlying aetiology was as follows: 4 (28.6%) patients HHS, 1 (7.1%) patient diabetic ketoacidosis, 1 (7.1%) patient lithium-induced diabetes insipidus and 8 (57.1%) patients with dehydration secondary to unreplaced water loses. In no case was the rate of correction greater than 10 mmol/L per day. The average length of time for correction to normal sodium level of 145 mmol/L was 6 days. Three patients (21.4%) died in Critical Care. Two patients (14.3%) died following discharge to the ward. The remaining 9 patients (64.3%) were discharged home to their primary residence. All patients had neurological symptoms on presentation, primarily confusion. One patient presented with seizures. All patients were treated with 5% dextrose. One patient developed hypernatraemia in Critical Care. Moderately elevated sodium levels were untreated in this patient prior to the diagnosis of severe hypernatraemia. The remaining patients all presented with hypernatraemia.

Conclusions: Severe hypernatraemia is associated with a high mortality rate of 35.7%. Physicians should be aware of the excessive risk associated with this condition and diagnosis should be followed by prompt rehydration and intensive clinical and biochemical monitoring.

### Thirty years of personal experience in hyperglycemic crises: diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state [^e11f0f3c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Context

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) cause major morbidity and significant mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus. For more than 30 yr, our group, in a series of prospective, randomized clinical studies, has investigated the pathogenesis and evolving strategies of the treatment of hyperglycemic crises. This paper summarizes the results of these prospective studies on the management and pathophysiology of DKA.

Setting

Our earliest studies evaluated the comparative efficacy of low-dose vs. pharmacological amounts of insulin and the use of low-dose therapy by various routes in adults and later in children. Subsequent studies evaluated phosphate and bicarbonate therapy, lipid metabolism, ketosis-prone type 2 patients, and use of rapid-acting insulin analogs as well as leptin status, cardiac risk factors, proinflammatory cytokines, and the mechanism of activation of T lymphocytes in hyperglycemic crises.

Main Outcome

The information garnered from these studies resulted in the creation of the 2001 American Diabetes Association (ADA) technical review on DKA and HHS as well as the ADA Position and Consensus Paper on the therapy for hyperglycemic crises.

Conclusions

Areas of future research include prospective randomized studies to do the following: 1) establish the efficacy of bicarbonate therapy in DKA for a pH less than 6.9; 2) establish the need for a bolus insulin dose in the initial therapy of DKA; 3) determine the pathophysiological mechanisms for the absence of ketosis in HHS; 4) investigate the reasons for elevated proinflammatory cytokines and cardiovascular risk factors; and 5) evaluate the efficacy and cost benefit of using sc regular insulin vs. more expensive insulin analogs on the general ward for the treatment of DKA.
