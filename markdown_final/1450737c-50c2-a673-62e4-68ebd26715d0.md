## Question

Nursing care plan for patient with neuroendocrine cancer with Mets. Small bowel obstructions and anxiety relating to self care with tpn at home

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a nursing care plan for a patient with metastatic neuroendocrine cancer, malignant small bowel obstruction, and anxiety about home TPN self-care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and prognosis to frame goals of care. Then, I should verify the indication and appropriateness of home parenteral nutrition in this setting. Next, I will assess anxiety and self-care barriers. After that, I will construct nursing diagnoses and align interventions with evidence-based guidelines. Finally, I will define monitoring, evaluation, and contingency plans, including when to discontinue HPN, and I will double-check that each element is supported by appropriate sources.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and prognosis so I don't jump to conclusions. Metastatic neuroendocrine tumors often have indolent biology, and patients may live for years, but malignant bowel obstruction from mesenteric fibrosis or peritoneal disease changes the calculus for nutrition support and symptom burden, so I need to check performance status, disease trajectory, and estimated life expectancy before endorsing HPN [^6723bb92] [^60903534]. Hold on, I should verify that MASCC emphasizes individualized prognostic assessment and shared decision-making because physician survival estimates are often overly optimistic and should be supplemented with clinical and laboratory factors before committing to HPN [^1b4672b4].

> Next, I should review the indication for home parenteral nutrition in malignant bowel obstruction. MASCC suggests HPN may maintain quality of life in a very selected subset of MBO patients, but the evidence is observational and heterogeneous, with median survival ranging from roughly 15 to 155 days and complication rates around 6–21%, so I need to ensure we are not extrapolating beyond the data [^56339441] [^66dc37ce]. Wait, let me verify the NET-specific signal: a small NET case series showed nutritional stabilization and low line sepsis, suggesting potential benefit in indolent disease, but I should not overgeneralize from eight patients and must weigh this against guideline cautions [^5ef62e34]. I should also confirm that ASPEN and ASCO advise against routine PN in advanced cancer except in carefully selected patients with reasonable performance status and nonfunctioning GI tracts, with predefined goals and time-limited trials [^ef76436c] [^9a3c4737].

> I will now examine the patient's anxiety and self-care capacity, because even if HPN is medically reasonable, success hinges on adherence and psychosocial readiness. Anxiety about HPN is common and can stem from fear of complications, body image changes, sleep disruption, and the burden of sterile technique, so I need to screen for these domains and plan targeted education and coping strategies [^234928c5]. Hold on, I should verify that NET patients have high rates of anxiety and depression, often multifactorial, and that SSRIs are generally safe in NETs, which supports pharmacologic management when indicated [^710c5856]. I should also confirm that structured education and caregiver involvement reduce complications and improve confidence with HPN, reinforcing the need for a robust training program before discharge [^f8c8ecf5].

> Let me formulate nursing diagnoses carefully, and I will double-check that they map to evidence-based priorities. Risk for impaired nutrition related to malignant small bowel obstruction and inability to meet needs orally is appropriate, and I should specify that HPN is a compensatory strategy with defined goals and stop criteria to align with MASCC and ASPEN guidance [^56339441] [^ef76436c]. Anxiety related to loss of normal eating, fear of HPN complications, and uncertainty about prognosis is also accurate, and I should tie this to measurable outcomes like reduced anxiety scores and improved self-efficacy [^717b1f31]. Risk for infection related to central venous catheter for HPN is real, with reported line infections in 6–21% of MBO cohorts, so I need to ensure aseptic technique training and surveillance plans are explicit [^66dc37ce]. Finally, deficient knowledge regarding HPN administration, monitoring, and troubleshooting requires a structured education plan with return demonstrations and caregiver integration [^f8c8ecf5].

> Now, I should outline interventions, and I need to ensure each is supported by guidelines or best practices. For nutrition, I will coordinate with the nutrition support team to individualize the PN prescription, start low dextrose to mitigate refeeding risk, and set a time-limited trial with predefined success metrics such as weight stabilization and functional goals, consistent with ASPEN and ASCO recommendations [^ef76436c] [^9a3c4737]. I should confirm vascular access preference for a tunneled central line or PICC and arrange home nursing for initial infusions and catheter care, as MASCC prefers central access for home PN and structured home services reduce complications [^24151ad3] [^23e5db6a]. For anxiety, I will provide psychoeducation about HPN, teach coping strategies, and consider SSRIs if anxiety is moderate to severe, given NET safety data and end-of-life anxiety guidance [^710c5856] [^717b1f31]. For infection risk, I will implement aseptic technique training, weekly dressing changes, and a 24/7 helpline, aligning with HPN safety standards and NET-specific supportive care principles [^f8c8ecf5] [^824764a8].

> Next, I should review monitoring and evaluation, and I need to ensure the cadence matches stability and risk. Daily weights, strict intake/output, and glucose checks during the first week are prudent, with transition to weekly labs for electrolytes, renal and hepatic function, and trace elements once stable, consistent with home PN monitoring guidance [^cd6ac6b5]. I should double-check that we document catheter site assessments, signs of infection, and pump alarms at each visit, and that we reassess anxiety and self-care confidence at least weekly initially, then monthly, using validated tools where feasible [^e8d97d34]. Hold on, I should verify that we also track functional goals agreed upon at initiation, such as ambulation distance or activities of daily living, to judge whether the HPN trial is meeting its intended aims [^9a3c4737].

> I need to ensure we have clear criteria for modifying or discontinuing HPN, and I should confirm these are discussed upfront. If the patient experiences repeated line infections, progressive disease with declining performance status, or if goals of care shift toward comfort-only, then HPN should be stopped or not initiated, consistent with MASCC and ESMO guidance on avoiding burdensome interventions near the end of life [^a888b9c1] [^d915cd38]. But wait, what if the patient is not improving toward the agreed functional goal by the predefined endpoint, such as 4–6 weeks? In that scenario, I should recommend discontinuation and pivot to comfort-focused care, documenting the shared decision-making conversation with the patient and family [^9a3c4737].

> Let me consider special NET-specific issues so I don't miss important nuances. Mesenteric fibrosis is common in small bowel NETs and can drive recurrent obstruction; if HPN enables stabilization, I should reassess whether palliative-intent surgery could improve quality of life, recognizing that decisions should be made in a NET-experienced MDT and that HPN may be a long-term need in this population [^60903534] [^360feeca]. I should also remember that somatostatin analogs may palliate hormone-related symptoms and could be continued even when disease-directed therapy is not pursued, which may indirectly reduce anxiety by improving flushing and diarrhea control [^e5ede148].

> Finally, I should double-check that discharge planning and caregiver support are explicitly addressed. Early involvement of home health, infusion vendor, and a 24/7 nursing hotline are essential, and I will provide written and video education materials with competency validation before discharge, aligning with HPN best practices and NET supportive care guidance [^f8c8ecf5] [^824764a8]. Hold on, I should verify that we also connect the patient with psychosocial resources and, if appropriate, peer support, as these interventions can mitigate isolation and anxiety associated with chronic HPN dependence [^65f165de].

Diagnosis

MBO is a clinical diagnosis that is confirmed with radiological imaging. Historically, abdominal x-rays were recommended to be the initial imaging modality, but their sensitivity to detect MBO is moderate and poses challenges in detecting the exact site, cause, or complications derived from MBO. Contrast computed tomography (CT) is more valuable as it provides diagnostic precision. The American College of Radiology recommends the use of CT of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous (IV) contrast for patients with suspected acute small BO and either a CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast or a CT enterography for patients suspected to have intermittent or low-grade small BO.

Advanced care planning and goals of care conversations

When patients with advanced cancers are diagnosed with MBO, clinicians should acknowledge that medical decisions are directed at extending life, minimizing distressing symptoms, and maximizing quality of life. Care should be holistic and person-centered with focus on the interrelationship between physical, psychosocial, and spiritual issues. Clinicians should encourage patients to substitute decision-makers with who they can communicate their values and goals to assist them with medical decision-making when they no longer have the capacity. In some jurisdictions, written advance care documents are legislated and may include options of appointing a formal decision-maker on the loss of capacity, statements about values and goals, and even binding refusals of specific interventions.

Before offering interventions for MBO management, clinicians should take into consideration the risks associated with the interventions in addition to the patient's estimated prognosis, performance status, comorbidities, location of care and ease of further assessment and support (e.g. home parenteral nutrition programs may not be universally available). Financial implications may also impact whether an intervention might be offered or undertaken. Furthermore, patients may have strongly held views about the interventions that they would accept and their decisions can change over time, especially when the benefit of therapy or intervention may no longer exceed the burden, and cessation may be considered appropriate by their clinicians or even desired by the patient. Clinicians are encouraged to discuss these possible scenarios with patients and their families before commencing interventions, such as total parenteral nutrition. As patients approach the end of their lives, their goals of care may shift from disease management and life prolongation to symptom management and quality of life.

Psychosocial and palliative care considerations in MBO emphasize limited high-quality MBO-specific research, the importance of early palliative care and communication, and the family impact of home-based parenteral nutrition. Although the need for emotional and psychological support for both patient and family in the context of MBO is equally acknowledged, high-quality studies which focus specifically on the context of MBO are limited; clear communication, counselling and referral to early palliative care were identified as important considerations, and early palliative care referral was beneficial particularly when patients were not candidates for surgery. Given the nature and range of complex symptoms associated with MBO, early palliative care has been suggested. In studies of home-based parenteral nutrition for women with advanced ovarian cancer and MBO, caregivers described vulnerability and family disruption, while patients recognized the lifeline of spending quality time with family; communication around changing goals of care is essential to foster clear and decisive clinical decision making in partnership with patients and families.

### Home parenteral nutrition in patients receiving palliative care: a curriculum-based review [^874f3f4c]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Difficulty with maintaining nutritional intake is common in patients with cancer. European guidance suggests that wherever possible nutritional support should first be provided by the oral or enteral route. Where this is not possible, for example, in malignant small bowel obstruction, parenteral nutrition (PN) may be considered. In palliative care, it is generally accepted that the significant risks and burdens of PN outweigh the potential benefits in patients with an expected survival < 2 months. Determining prognosis is crucial when helping patients to make decisions regarding appropriate care pathways; however, this remains challenging. An overview of clinical issues and prognostic indicators related to selecting patients appropriately for palliative PN is given to cover the relevant advanced competencies of the 2010 Gastroenterology Curriculum. The organisation of Home Parenteral Nutrition (HPN) services in England is described including the associated risks and burdens of HPN in the palliative patient.

Advanced cancer and palliative parenteral nutrition (PN) — The primary objective for initiating nutrition support therapy (NST) in advanced cancer patients is "to conserve or restore the best possible quality of life and to control any nutrition related symptoms that cause distress". "There are limited data on the use of PN in palliative care", and "home PN may lengthen survival and improve quality of life in carefully selected patients". Favorable candidates include those with "Karnofsky score > 50", "inoperable bowel obstruction", "minimal symptoms from disease involving major organs such as brain, liver, and lungs", and "indolent disease progression". If patients are to benefit, "they (1) must be physically and emotionally capable of participating in their own care; (2) should have an estimated life expectancy of > 40–60 days; (3) require strong social and financial support at home, including a dedicated in-home lay care provider; and (4) must have failed trials of less invasive medical therapies".

If a parenteral nutrition trial is initiated, it should be evaluated after a prospectively agreed upon fixed time period with a specific goal (eg, able to walk to the mailbox), and parenteral nutrition should be stopped if no significant benefit has occurred and when death appears imminent.

### When is parenteral nutrition appropriate? [^c1e5685a]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) and parenteral nutrition (PN) — PN has been shown to improve quality of life and confer survival benefit in patients with MBO who are expected to survive 2–3 months. In a retrospective study of 115 patients with MBO, median survival during PN was 6.5 months; Eleven patients survived 12 months or longer, and 2 patients were alive 4 years after initiating PN. PN use during inpatient palliative care was reported in 1.8% of patients. Larger series include a meta-analysis of home PN in inoperable MBO involving 437 patients and a multicenter observational study including 414 subjects with bowel obstruction listed as the indication in two-thirds of cases. Reported PN-related complications were low in a recent study, including zero cases of line-related sepsis.

Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) management — patient-centered decision-making and prognostic assessment emphasizes that clinicians should take into consideration the risks associated with the interventions in addition to the patient's estimated prognosis, performance status, comorbidities, location of care and ease of further assessment and support, and clinicians are encouraged to discuss these possible scenarios with patients and their families before commencing interventions, such as total parenteral nutrition; as patients approach the end of their lives, their goals of care may shift from disease management and life prolongation to symptom management and quality of life, physician prediction of survival is known to be inaccurate and often overly optimistic, and objective and laboratory factors associated with a short or poor prognosis include deterioration in performance status, weight loss, progressive disease in other organs, elevated C-reactive protein, reduced albumin, and leucocytosis; prognostic models incorporating physician prediction of survival and clinical and laboratory factors improve the accuracy of clinical prediction, and the treating clinician should offer sensitive discussions about treatment options, expected outcomes, possible adverse effects or burdens, and how to measure success, with assessments of illness understanding and decision-making wishes being essential and goals of care conversations requiring careful exploration with the patient's best interest being foremost.

Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) is supported by observational evidence with high risk of bias and shows variable survival, equivocal quality-of-life effects, notable complication risks, and context-specific selection criteria. Thirteen studies (all observational with a high risk of bias), including 721 participants reported that the median survival intervals were variable, between 15 to 155 days, and only three studies reported validated quality of life measures, showing equivocal results. In adverse event reporting, between 6 and 21% of patients developed a central venous catheter infection or were hospitalized because of complications related to parenteral nutrition. Potential prognostic criteria for survival and benefit of HPN may include performance status — ECOG < 2; patients may not benefit due to factors including depression (up to 24%). For dying patients, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) practical guideline suggests that treatment recommendations should be based on comfort, and parenteral hydration and nutrition are unlikely to provide any benefit for most patients at the end of life.

Malignant bowel obstruction nutrition and hydration — diet progression, parenteral hydration, and home parenteral nutrition (HPN): When a patient is initially diagnosed with MBO, they should be made Nil Per Os (nothing by mouth), and then when the acute MBO resolves fully or partially, a symptom led, slow and graded reintroduction to oral diet is recommended; This may include clear fluids, free or full fluids, texture modified low fiber diet (soft, minced, and pureed), and if tolerated back to normal textured low fiber diet; Nutrition interventions should be initiated in patients with advanced cancers only when the benefits of these interventions on quality of life and survival outweigh the risks, with clear expectations discussed by a multidisciplinary team with patients and families; Parenteral hydration does not prevent or improve symptoms, such as thirst or dry mouth, nor does it increase survival, and in excessive amounts, it may bring on fluid overload, peripheral, and pulmonary edema; Parenteral hydration should not be initiated routinely in the last days of life; Home parenteral nutrition may be beneficial and maintain the quality of life in a very selected group of patients with MBO; Central venous access is preferred for home parenteral nutrition delivery; In an end-of-life home, parenteral nutrition should be discontinued (or not initiated) as it raises the risk of complications — and may prolong suffering.

### Preparing the patient for home parenteral nutrition and for a successful course of therapy [^8c7fd72e]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Preparing the patient for home parenteral nutrition (HPN) is a collaborative effort among many different clinicians. Identifying patients who will transition home with parenteral nutrition (PN) as early as possible allows for a thoughtful and safe approach. Communication regarding the HPN goals is critical to the patient's success, whether the requirement for PN is temporary or permanent. Management of these complex patients is best served by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in the area of nutrition support. Adherence to available guidelines that define best practice is imperative in all aspects of care for the patient on HPN.

### Can we improve the management of inoperable malignant bowel obstruction? Results of a feasibility study of elemental diet as an alternative to parenteral nutrition in patients with advanced gynaecological cancer [^39eb3c6c]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Home PN is widely adopted in Europe and the USA but to a lesser extent in the UK. This may be due to the financial pressures of the NHS, as well as poor access to specialist units with appropriate MDT teams trained to provide PN in the community. Reviews of the literature have shown that home PN is expensive and demonstrated that there is insufficient evidence to show that it positively impacts patient's quality of life. One in four patients registered for home PN in the UK is diagnosed with a malignancy. The number of gastrointestinal obstructions has increased more than any other condition, with ovarian cancer being the most common reason. The low number of patients in the UK having PN at home, as well as few successful surgical interventions undertaken at a late stage of disease, indicate that the vast majority of patients in the terminal phase of their illness with IBO may not be offered any nutrition and are discharged home without it. This is potentially due to a lack of well-researched protocols on how to manage feeding in patients at the end of life.

### Home parenteral nutrition in neuroendocrine tumour intestinal failure: improved quality of life and longevity [^5ef62e34]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2020). High credibility.

Background

Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are neoplastic yet behave differently to typical cancers. Despite often being slow growing, they can lead to significant gastrointestinal complications including intestinal failure (IF). The use of home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in neoplastic conditions is rising, primarily for palliation and bridging through treatments for cancer, but remains a challenging decision with a paucity of high-grade evidence-based guidance.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of patients with NET on HPN was performed. Data collected included the cause of IF, complications encountered with HPN and changes in nutritional assessments.

Results

Eight patients were identified, all with metastatic NET. Median weight improved following HPN commencement and line sepsis was the sole complication. All patients had stabilisation and optimisation of nutritional and hydration status.

Conclusions

HPN is commenced to improve or maintain patients' nutritional status during often lifelong treatment. The principle aim in providing HPN was to improve survival and quality of life. While NETs are cancers, our case series demonstrates the potential of HPN to actively support longer term survival in the subgroup of patients who develop IF.

Much of the research conducted on IBO has focussed on options for symptom control in complete bowel obstruction, with recommendations for the management of vomiting and abdominal pain, advice on placing venting gastrostomy tubes, and whether to commence PN as a feeding option. There do not appear to be any published clinical trials on managing nutrition and diet in patients who have sub-acute obstruction and are able to tolerate some food and fluids. Meeting nutritional requirements orally in this patient group is challenging, if not impossible, and the emphasis should be placed on managing patient and carer expectations by ensuring that patients are not simply told to drink sips of water if PN is not an option and resolution of the obstruction is unlikely, i.e. in the case of those who are inoperable and have exhausted all treatment options. Qualitative research has shown that patients and family members place a lot of importance on food and fluids and the role of nutrition at this point. Many have expressed concerns over what type of foods they can eat and struggle with the concept of no nutritional intake at all. A study by Sowerbutts et al. showed that patients experience a profound sense of loss at the inability of being able to consume food and fluids orally. One case report described the anxiety of a patient who believed that she would starve to death before she passed away from her cancer diagnosis. The comments made by the interviewed participants in this study support these views. The full qualitative study was not conducted, but some of the discussions with the patients indicate that a qualitative assessment examining the views of patients, their families and carers would be useful to further understand their attitudes and opinions.

A Japanese randomised controlled trial of Crohn's disease patients assigned to either half-ED or normal diet did not show any difference between quality of life scores using the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire. It is not possible to extrapolate the data to advanced cancer patients, and more research is required to investigate whether ED is a viable option in the palliative setting. The limitations of this study, the use of concomitant medication and other confounding factors related to an underlying malignancy do not make it possible to conclusively state that ED improves global health and quality of life. However, the changes in scores suggest that ED is well tolerated and should be considered as an alternative in patients for whom PN is not indicated and who are reaching the terminal stage of the disease. Only 26 women contributed to symptoms and quality of life assessment, and this is also a limitation of the study.

### Home parenteral nutrition for people with inoperable malignant bowel obstruction [^66ccdd44]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

People with advanced ovarian or gastrointestinal cancer may develop malignant bowel obstruction (MBO). They are able to tolerate limited, if any, oral or enteral (via a tube directly into the gut) nutrition. Parenteral nutrition (PN) is the provision of macronutrients, micronutrients, electrolytes and fluid infused as an intravenous solution and provides a method for these people to receive nutrients. There are clinical and ethical arguments for and against the administration of PN to people receiving palliative care.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in improving survival and quality of life in people with inoperable MBO.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 1), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), BNI, CINAHL, Web of Science and NHS Economic Evaluation and Health Technology Assessment up to January 2018, ClinicalTrials.gov (http://clinicaltrials.gov/) and in the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal (http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/). In addition, we handsearched included studies and used the 'Similar articles' feature on PubMed for included articles.

Selection Criteria

We included any studies with more than five participants investigating HPN in people over 16 years of age with inoperable MBO.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted the data and assessed risk of bias for each study. We entered data into Review Manager 5 and used GRADEpro to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We included 13 studies with a total of 721 participants in the review. The studies were observational, 12 studies had only one relevant treatment arm and no control and for the one study with a control arm, very few details were given. The risk of bias was high and the certainty of evidence was graded as very low for all outcomes. Due to heterogeneity of data, meta-analysis was not performed and therefore the data were synthesised via a narrative summary. The evidence for benefit derived from PN was very low for survival and quality of life. All the studies measured overall survival and 636 (88%) of participants were deceased at the end of the study. However there were varying definitions of overall survival that yielded median survival intervals between 15 to 155 days (range three to 1278 days). Three studies used validated measures of quality of life. The results from assessment of quality of life were equivocal; one study reported improvements up until three months and two studies reported approximately similar numbers of participants with improvements and deterioration. Different quality of life scales were used in each of the studies and quality of life was measured at different time points. Due to the very low certainty of the evidence, we are very uncertain about the adverse events related to PN use. Adverse events were measured by nine studies and data for individual participants could be extracted from eight studies. This revealed that 32 of 260 (12%) patients developed a central venous catheter infection or were hospitalised because of complications related to PN.

Authors' Conclusions

We are very uncertain whether HPN improves survival or quality of life in people with MBO as the certainty of evidence was very low for both outcomes. As the evidence base is limited and at high risk of bias, further higher-quality prospective studies are required.

### Surgery for recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer [^a8abd05c]. Current Oncology Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Prospective randomized studies have now placed cytoreductive surgery as part of the treatment package also for patients at relapse, following the treatment paradigm in the primary setting of the disease. Still, patients should be aware that the disease will remain chronic even at complete tumor resection and that consolidation with systemic treatment postoperatively will be required. Palliative surgery for bowel-related symptoms such as obstruction should be considered after failure of conservative measures and after careful consideration of the patient's overall prognosis, quality of life, previous treatments, future therapeutic options, and co-morbidities. Iatrogenic induced short bowel syndrome with the necessity of long life total parenteral nutrition should be avoided, and plans for surgery should be agreed within a multidisciplinary setting.

A dye is injected through the catheter into the ducts and an x-ray is taken. If the ducts are blocked by a tumor, a fine tube may be inserted into the duct to unblock it. This tube may be left in place to keep the duct open. Tissue samples may also be taken and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. Treatment Option Overview Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for patients with pancreatic NETs.
- The following types of treatment are used:

- Surgery
- Chemotherapy
- Hormone therapy
- Hepatic arterial occlusion or chemoembolization
- Targeted therapy
- Supportive care
- New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
- Treatment for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors may cause side effects.
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
- Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
- Follow-up tests may be needed.

The following types of treatment are used: Surgery An operation may be done to remove the tumor. One of the following types of surgery may be used: Supportive care Supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment. Supportive care for pancreatic NETs may include treatment for the following:

- **Diarrhea may be treated with**:
- Intravenous fluids with electrolytes such as potassium or chloride.
- Somatostatin-type drugs such as octreotide.
- Low blood sugar may be treated by having small, frequent meals or with drug therapy to maintain a normal blood sugar level.
- High blood sugar may be treated with drugs taken by mouth or insulin by injection.
- Hepatic arterial occlusion, with or without systemic chemotherapy.
- Chemoembolization, with or without systemic chemotherapy. Use our clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

You can search for trials based on the type of cancer, the age of the patient, and where the trials are being done. General information about clinical trials is also available.
- Fluids and hormone therapy to replace fluids and electrolytes that have been lost from the body.
- Surgery to remove the tumor and nearby lymph nodes.
- Surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible when the tumor cannot be completely removed or has spread to distant parts of the body. This is palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life.

Patient perspective and outcomes

Some patients with NENs live for many years with persistent and troublesome GI symptoms, and optimal management requires the combined expertise of gastroenterology, dietetics, specialist nurses and psychological support. As the disease progresses, palliative care support can also be helpful. Early investigation (tables6 7) to identify reversible causes for new symptoms is important.

### No place like the hospital [^d902e4bd]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2011). Low credibility.

The gold standard for end-of-life care is home hospice. A case is presented in which a patient dying of irreversible small bowel obstruction from metastatic cancer insisted on remaining in the acute care hospital for care when alternative sites of care, including a skilled nursing facility and residential hospice, were available to her and covered by her health insurance plan. The ethical issues raised by this case are discussed from the perspective of the patient, the clinical team, the hospital, and the insurance company. Over the past decade, hospital-based palliative care consultation and general inpatient hospice care have sought to improve the quality of dying in the hospital. To the extent that such efforts have been successful, they may result in increasing demand for the hospital as the site for terminal care in the future.

Purpose

To provide evidence-based recommendations on the management of malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) for patients with advanced cancer.

Methods

The Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) MBO study group conducted a systematic review of databases (inception to March 2021) to identify studies about patients with advanced cancer and MBO that reported on the following outcomes: symptom management, bowel obstruction resolution, prognosis, overall survival, and quality of life. The review was restricted to studies published in English, but no restrictions were placed on publication year, country, and study type. As per the MASCC Guidelines Policy, the findings were synthesized to determine the levels of evidence to support each MBO intervention and, ultimately, the graded recommendations and suggestions.

Results

The systematic review identified 17,656 published studies and 397 selected for the guidelines. The MASCC study group developed a total of 25 evidence-based suggestions and recommendations about the management of MBO-related nausea and vomiting, bowel movements, pain, inflammation, bowel decompression, and nutrition. Expert consensus-based guidance about advanced care planning and psychosocial support is also provided.

Conclusion

This MASCC Guideline provides comprehensive, evidence-based recommendations about MBO management for patients with advanced cancer.

### MASCC multidisciplinary evidence-based recommendations for the management of malignant bowel obstruction in advanced cancer [^02eac1b8]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

MBO is a significant complication for patients living with cancer. The approach should be multi and inter-disciplinary to improve the management of these patients and support their families. Studies indicate the need to improve the quality of research and subsequent interventions in this domain (refer to Table 3 for a summary of suggestions and recommendations). Communication around changing goals of care is essential to foster clear and decisive clinical decision making in partnership with patients and families. Further prospective and innovative studies are needed to improve the care for patients with MBO.

Advanced care planning and goals of care — communication and decision-making in MBO: When patients with advanced cancers are diagnosed with MBO, clinicians should acknowledge that medical decisions are directed at extending life, minimizing distressing symptoms, and maximizing quality of life; care should be holistic and person-centered with focus on the interrelationship between physical, psychosocial, and spiritual issues; clinicians should encourage patients to substitute decision-makers to communicate values and goals for times when they no longer have capacity, and in some jurisdictions written advance care documents may include appointing a formal decision-maker, statements about values and goals, and binding refusals of specific interventions.

Home PN (HPN) initiation in adults — recommendations and safety steps: Establish organizational policies that delineate circumstances in which initiation of home PN (HPN) can take place outside the acute care setting; delineate patient-centered eligibility criteria for initiating PN safely in the home setting; develop strict protocols and procedures for initiating PN in the home setting, monitoring response to therapy, and documenting outcomes; conduct a comprehensive medical, clinical, and psychosocial assessment of HPN candidates to assess risk factors for adverse events related to initiating PN; and consider initiating PN therapy at home only when assessment confirms that the benefits greatly outweigh the risks. Additional guidance states that PN should be initiated outside an acute care environment only when the interprofessional assessment process determines that the benefits of initiating PN at home outweigh the risks, and protocols typically stipulate that fluid and electrolyte disturbances be corrected prior to initiating PN; an infusion of conventional intravenous fluids may be warranted for patients with dehydration or electrolyte deficits; and the initial PN prescription should contain a relatively low-dextrose dose to reduce the risk of refeeding syndrome or other metabolic disturbances.

### Practical considerations when providing palliative care to patients with neuroendocrine tumors in the context of routine disease management or hospice care [^6a60496e]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

How do we define palliative care, and when should it be started?

Palliative care is a medical subspecialty that focuses on alleviating the symptoms and stress associated with serious medical illness. Palliative care is appropriate for any patient with a high symptom burden at any pointin the illness trajectory. It is highly individualized to the needs of the patient and family and should be provided concurrently with disease-directed therapy. Palliative care is a larger approach to care and should be offered to those at any point in their cancer journey. Hospice differs from palliative care since it provides care specifically at the end of life and in a place which a patient calls home, be it a private residence or institution. Palliative care seeks to treat the whole patient by managing their physical, emotional, and psychosocial distress. All practitioners should strive to provide this type of care; however, patients with complex symptoms may benefit from referral to specialist palliative care providers. This can be provided in the inpatient or outpatient setting (including at home and in the community) and involves an interdisciplinary team which may include physicians, nurses, social workers, and spiritual care providers.

Multiple trials have shown the benefit of early palliative care referrals in oncology patients; however, there are no established guidelines on when to refer patients. Many providers as well as the American Society of Clinical Oncology consider referral within 8 weeks of diagnosis of advanced cancer to be the ideal, based on previous randomized controlled trials in patients with lung cancer. Patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) represent a unique population, as many have metastatic disease at presentation, yet can have prolonged survival rates for years. Since these patients can have a heavy symptom burden, a common criterion for referral to palliative care is to help manage debilitating physical symptoms such as pain, dyspnea, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue. Patients who have progressed through multiple lines of treatment may be referred for discussions to enhance their understanding of the prognosis. Palliative care referral may also be appropriate in helping patients with advanced care planning and to elicit end-of-life preferences care to ensure that all treatments are consistent with a patient's individual goals of care.

Mesenteric fibrosis

Clinical practice guidance

Abdominal pain can be difficult to manage and requires a close collaboration between pain and palliative care teams and dietitians.
Early and sustained dietetic input is needed to optimise nutritional status and prevent malnutrition.
Resection of fibrotic tissue or of involved bowel segments may offer symptomatic relief, but risks short bowel syndrome.
Despite stage IV disease, surgery may be an option but must be agreed in a NEN MDT.
Long-term home parenteral nutrition is a valid alternative to surgery if the risks of surgery are considered too high.

The development of mesenteric fibrosis (desmoplasia) is difficult to predict; there is no specific blood marker and imaging may not identify subtle fibrosis.

Fibrosis causes shrinkage and fixation of the mesentery and mesenteric root to the retroperitoneum, potentially causing small bowel obstruction. Entrapped small and large mesenteric blood vessels may lead to arterial and venous ischaemia. Compromised absorption secondary to obstructive or ischaemic processes can lead to malnutrition and rarely short bowel syndrome. While the underlying NEN often remains indolent, fibrosis may affect anticancer treatment options. For example, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy can exacerbate obstruction in 22–30% of patient, requiring steroids and surgery. It is unclear whether stenting of the superior mesenteric vein affects symptoms and quality of life.

The impact of somatostatin analogue therapy on fibrotic processes in patients remains unclear. Corticosteroids may have a role and there are promising preclinical studies using terguride (5-HT2A/B antagonist) and tamoxifen. There is an unmet need for therapy targeting mesenteric fibrosis.

Resection of fibrotic tissue or involved bowel segments may offer symptomatic relief, but home parenteral nutrition may help improve nutrition and reduce the oral intake which induces pain. Its use in NENs often extends significantly longer than in other cancers, with low catheter-related complications. It is vital not to forget the role home can play when surgical resection is deemed too risky.

### Quality of care of oncological patients with home parenteral nutrition [^9404140a]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

With sufficient preparation for HPN, discharge management from the hospital and the home delivery of PN works well. HPN has been associated with few complications (e.g. low rate of catheter infections), the nutritional status (bw and BMI) was stabilized and the current QoL of the patients could be maintained. Overall, from the patient's point of view, HPN was perceived as little or no burden in addition to the underlying disease. It would be important to collect more data on this topic in larger patient groups and in different countries.

### Clinical-practice recommendations for the management of bowel obstruction in patients with end-stage cancer [^9e96cc0a]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2001). Low credibility.

The paper highlights a series of questions that doctors need to consider when faced with end-stage cancer patients with bowel obstruction: Is the patient fit for surgery? Is there a place for stenting? Is it necessary to use a venting nasogastric tube (NGT) in inoperable patients? What drugs are indicated for symptom control, what is the proper route for their administration and which can be administered in association? When should a venting gastrostomy be considered? What is the role of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and parenteral hydration (PH)? A working group was established to review issues relating to bowel obstruction in end-stage cancer and to make recommendations for management. A steering group was established by the (multidisciplinary) Board of Directors of the European Association for Palliative Care (EAPC) to select members of the expert panel, who were required to have specific clinical and research interests relating to the topic and to have published significant papers on advanced cancer patients in the last 5 years, or to have particular clinical expertise that is recognised internationally. The final constitution of this group was approved by the Board of the EAPC. This Working Group was made up of English, French and Italian physicians involved in the field of palliative care for advanced and terminal cancer patients; and of English, American and Italian surgeons who also specialized in artificial nutrition (Dr. Bozzetti) and a professor of health economics. We applied a systematic review methodology that showed the relative lack of RCTs in this area and the importance of retrospective and clinical reports from different authors in different countries. The brief was to review published data but also to provide clinical opinion where data were lacking. The recommendations reflect specialist clinical practice in the countries represented. Each member of the group was allocated a specific question and briefed to review the literature and produce a position paper on the indications, advantages and disadvantages of each symptomatic treatment. The position papers were circulated and then debated at a meeting held in Athens and attended by all panel members. The group reviewed all the available data, discussed the evidence and discussed what practical recommendations could be derived from it. An initial outline of the results of the review and recommendations was produced. Where there were gaps in the evidence, consensus was achieved by debate. Only unanimous conclusions have been incorporated. Subsequently the recommendations were drawn together by Carla Ripamonti (Chairperson) and Robert Twycross (Co-Chair) and refined with input from all panel members. The recommendations have been endorsed by the Board of Directors of the EAPC. It was concluded that surgery should not be undertaken routinely in patients with poor prognostic criteria, such as intra-abdominal carcinomatosis, poor performance status and massive ascites. A nasogastric tube should be used only as a temporary measure. Medical measures such as analgesics, anti-secretory drugs and anti-emetics should be used alone or in combination to relieve symptoms. A venting gastrostomy should be considered if drugs fail to reduce vomiting to an acceptable level. TPN should be considered only for patients who may die of starvation rather than from tumour spread. PH is sometimes indicated to correct nausea, whereas regular mouth care is the treatment of choice for dry mouth. A collaborative approach involving both surgeons and physicians can offer patients an individualized and appropriate symptom management plan.

Regarding medical management for palliative care in patients with cancer, more specifically with respect to management of bowel obstruction (nutritional support), MASCC 2022 guidelines recommend to keep the patient NPO initially when diagnosed with malignant bowel obstruction, and then switch to a symptom-led, slow and graded reintroduction to oral diet when acute malignant bowel obstruction resolves fully or partially, including clear fluids, free or full fluids, texture-modified low-fiber diet (soft, minced, and pureed) and if tolerated back to normal-textured low-fiber diet.

Qualitative synthesis

Parenteral nutrition

Three studieswere included; all reported findings from 57 interviews from the same study group: 20 women with ovarian cancer, mean age 67 (± SD 7.5), and 13 family caregivers.

Palliative venting gastrostomies

One studywas included. The study included 11 participants (10/11 women; 7 with gynaecological cancer and 4 with colorectal cancer). Twelve interviews were conducted: 11 initial face-to-face interviews and 1 telephone reinterview.

Interview findings

All quotes are from patients unless otherwise highlighted and are shown in online supplemental file 3.

Two key themes emerged: (1) A stark decision: do or die; (2) Hope versus reality of the intervention.

A stark decision: do or die

Patients and carers felt there was no good alternative to PN. They viewed the choice as between life (PN) or death (starve).

It's either die with food or (home PN) for the rest of your days and I'd sooner live and be on (PN)

Well, to me it was a no option thing. I don't think they could have done anything else, bar starve me… if that's what's keeping me alive, it's what I have to have isn't it. So I don't think (there was) a decision as such, if there was no other… if I can't eat, it will be next best thing(PN)

Whether this belief was a result of over-optimistic emphasis from clinicians on possible survival benefits (given the lack of level 1a evidence regarding survival) or received in this manner because of the serious nature of the situation was not clear. Whichever, with such stark alternatives, most were trusting of their clinical team and felt they had little choice but to agree with a decision already made.

Certainly yes, I mean what's the alternative… you just have to go with what the doctors recommend, I think. (PVG)

### Supportive care for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma: symptom control and nutrition [^b2a1e2aa]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is most frequently a fatal disease with many associated morbidities. Clinicians skilled in its treatment are adept at management of symptoms caused by local and systemic effects of the malignancy. Patients should be assured that there are many treatments that can be used aggressively to maintain their comfort and independence for as long as possible. Patients should be encouraged to inform their health care providers of any discomfort or medical or psychological problems they are experiencing. At times, referrals to specialists can be beneficial for consideration of specific symptom-improving interventions. Timely referral to a palliative medicine service and hospice can have significant beneficial impact on the total care of the patient and on home caregiver.

Management of anxiety and depression related to hormonal syndromes for palliation and at the end of life

Symptoms of anxiety and depression are normal given the uncertainties of living with NETs at all stages, including at the end of life. In patients with small intenstine (SI) NET, the prevalence of depression and anxiety is 50 and 35%, respectively. These symptoms may be due to various causes, including the release of biogenic amines (5-HIAA). In addition to the management of hormone excess with SSA (or other medications for other functional NETs), first-line antidepressants such as SSRIs appear safe in NET patients with and without carcinoid syndrome.

La Salvia et al. study showed that mood disturbances, including depression and anxiety, psychoses, cognitive impairment, and sleeping alterations, are reported in NET patients, especially in patients with carcinoid symptoms, and negatively impact health-related quality of life and are associated with reduced survival rates. Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas also are associated with a higher risk of anxiety and depression. The principal cause is the dysfunction of the noradrenergic system. Consequently, early medical intervention to achieve remission of the symptoms can improve the patient's physical and mental well-being.

Management of mesenteric fibrosis for palliation and at the end of life

Mesenteric fibrosis (MF) can affect patients with SI-NETs. Many SI-NETs either present or develop mesenteric lymph node metastases (despite often having a small primary tumor of < 1cm). The lymph node metastasis can grow silently and often induce MF in the surrounding tissue of the mesentery. SI-NETs can release several growth factors and vasopeptides that can cause various symptoms such as flushing and diarrhea but can also cause tissue damage such as carcinoid heart disease and fibrosis leading to MF. MF may occur in up to 50% of SI-NETs with encasement of prominent blood vessels such as the superior mesenteric vessels. MF can create contraction and tethering of bowel loops, obstruction, intussusception, and possibly ischemia. This can produce severe pain and discomfort (especially postprandial), diarrhea, ascites, malabsorption, and malnutrition, as well as ischemic-related complications. MF can significantly impact the quality of life of patients with NETs and especially at the end of life. Unfortunately, it is not well-diagnosed or recognized in many patients with SI-NET.

### Quality of life and lived experience of patients with short bowel syndrome treated with teduglutide and weaning off home parenteral nutrition: a qualitative analysis of patient diaries [^234928c5]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a condition characterised by the malabsorption of nutrients due to the significant resection of small intestine as a result of conditions such as Crohn's disease, cancer and ischaemia. Patients typically have less than 30% or 150 cm of small bowel remaining and many have a stoma. Individuals with SBS often require parenteral nutrition (PN) to maintain adequate nutrition and hydration.

Although life-sustaining, the reliance on PN is also associated with life-threatening complications, including infections related to the central venous catheter through which it is administered, and metabolic disturbances leading to liver and bone disease. The PN solution is typically self-administered by the patient and infused continuously or intermittently for the same 12-hour period, usually overnight. This regimen can be highly disruptive to individuals and their families, impacting sleep and social activities. In addition, management of SBS requires patients to resist food cravings and to deal with stoma pouching system mishaps. Consequently, patients with SBS may experience psychological distress related to their condition, including anxiety over the constant threat of catheter-related bloodstream infection, depression and body image concerns. This dependence on PN and related challenges can negatively impact quality of life (QOL).

Home parenteral and enteral nutrition (HPEN) has evolved to become a very successful, lifesaving treatment in the management of patients with intestinal and oral failure, respectively. Nevertheless, the provision of HPEN remains intrusive, expensive, and continues to be associated with significant morbidity. The management of HPEN by a nutrition support team that optimally includes an experienced clinician, nurse specialist, dietitian, and pharmacist reduces HPEN-related morbidity and may reduce costs associated with its use. Because clinical expertise in the management of patients receiving HPEN is not widely available, the referral of these patients to experienced centers for periodic assessment should be encouraged.

Palliative care and small bowel neuroendocrine tumor (NET) surgery — Some palliative interventions may be considered for quality-of-life improvement even when active treatment of NET is no longer pursued. Patients with small bowel NETs may be experiencing the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome and symptoms associated with the tumor burden and mesenteric and retroperitoneal fibrosis, and debate is ongoing regarding the role of palliative-intent surgery in the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes. For patients undergoing primary surgery of small bowel NETs, the 30-day mortality is below 2% and the morbidity is lower than 20%, and resection of primary small bowel NETs in selected patients with metastatic disease may be considered when feasible to relieve existing symptoms and avoid future symptoms and for its potential survival advantage.

Conclusions

In summary, although several prognostic variables have been described in the literature, none were found to significantly impact survival in our study. This underscores the complexities involved in clinical decision-making and highlights the necessity for an MDT to discuss each patient on an individual basis. We acknowledge that decisions regarding the initiation of HPN in patients with palliative malignancy are complex and influenced not only by patient factors, but by factors such as country, clinician attitudes and local healthcare systems.

### Inoperable malignant bowel obstruction: palliative interventions outcomes-mixed-methods systematic review [^3d80cf2f]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2024). High credibility.

Survival and PVG use data were largely confounded as many of those who received a PVG also received PN. Unlike PN there is a less strong plausible physiological rationale for a survival benefit, other than the potential of reduced mortality and morbidity through reducing the risk of aspiration. Nonetheless, as with the PN data, patients perceived PVG to provide a survival benefit and again this was a key determinant for agreeing to PVG placement.

Symptoms were improved by PVG but not measured or discussed for PN. Burdens (to patients and carers) were an issue for both interventions, with the reality often at odds with the expected experience, with some not being prepared for the impact of both the process of having the intervention, and of living with it.

Performance and nutritional status appear to be maintained, or improved, by PN. Our review demonstrates a potential relationship between performance status and anticancer treatments which may increase survival in this situation. Nonetheless, for most outcomes data were sparse and drawn from low quality evidence. A potential area of further investigation is whether PN improves performance status enough to allow further anticancer treatment in those previously deemed unsuitable.

For both interventions, health service utilisation and place of death data were variable, and the impact on these outcomes is unclear. Health service utilisation data were descriptive, highlighting that around 80% of patients die at home or in hospice care. Readmissions overall are low, but for a subgroup are many, likely reflective on the varying disease stages and performance statuses. Both interventions appear to allow patients to spend time out of hospital and valuable time at home. One of the largest studies to investigate health service utilisation within MBOconcluded that PVG is associated with fewer readmissions and lower intensity healthcare utilisation at the end of life, compared with medical management or surgery.

A place of death outside of hospital could be a motivating factor for choosing these interventions. This was demonstrated in the PN qualitative literature, which highlighted that a key benefit of the intervention was allowing time at home with loved ones. Previous research has also emphasised for those with advanced cancer home care is the most common preferred place of death, with inpatient hospice care as second preference

### Can we improve the management of inoperable malignant bowel obstruction? Results of a feasibility study of elemental diet as an alternative to parenteral nutrition in patients with advanced gynaecological cancer [^23d4c865]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inoperable malignant bowel obstruction (IBO) is a common occurrence in patients with ovarian cancer. The rates reported in the literature are mainly based on ovarian and colorectal cancer complications and vary from 5 to 51% and 10 to 28%, respectively. Epidemiological data in other malignancies is less well reported. Bowel obstruction is frequently the terminal event in the course of malignant disease, and few treatment options make a significant impact at this stage. Surgical interventions can be considered, but unfortunately, many patients present with bowel strictures caused by peritoneal carcinomatosis and are subsequently deemed inoperable. This is due to the widespread nature of metastatic disease occurring at several sites within the small and large bowel mesentery, peritoneum and the surface of the bowel. This presentation is frequently coupled with multiple relapses, resistance to chemotherapy and therefore very poor prognosis. The survival rate for patients with cancer-related carcinomatous bowel obstruction (excluding the initial presentation when the disease is still sensitive to chemotherapy) is limited to a few weeks.

Patients frequently present with nausea and vomiting, which can be controlled with anti-emetic drugs, anti-secretory drugs and/or insertion of a nasogastric tube for drainage and to allow bowel rest. Nutrition is usually a major issue since, depending on the degree of small and/or large bowel obstruction, many patients cannot tolerate oral or enteral feeding (EN). This is particularly common in those with widespread peritoneal disease, causing recurrent symptoms after eating solid food. Due to the lack of well-designed clinical trials and inconsistent results, there is controversy regarding recommendations on the use of clinically assisted nutrition (EN or parenteral nutrition (PN)) in palliative care patients. Current guidelines suggest that EN or PN should be considered in patients 'with an inability to ingest or absorb sufficient nutrients'. In cancer patients, PN is recommended if malnutrition is more likely to cause progression than the disease itself. Despite the recommendations, there is no consensus about the use of PN in patients with cancer, its effectiveness and the optimal timeframe for the introduction of feeding. The nutritional management of IBO varies according to local policy and often presents a major dilemma due to the variance in symptoms, as well as the location and severity of the disease.

Discharge management and patient satisfaction with preparation for discharge

After hospital discharge, the vast majority (94.0%; n = 125) of patients who started HPN (n = 133) went home; 1.5% were admitted to a nursing home, 1.5% to a rehabilitation facility and 0.8% to a hospice (missing data: 2.3%).

To avoid an interruption in care, 33.8% (n = 45) of patients were prescribed HPN by the hospital for the first few days at home. The initial conversation about the upcoming discharge, involving participants such as patients, relatives, hospital doctors, the nutrition team, nursing services, or others, occurred a median of 3.0 days before discharge (mean ± SD: 6.1 ± 8.5 days). Additionally, 78.2% (n = 104) of patients received a repeated explanation of the discharge steps. A discharge notification from the hospital went out to the treating physician before discharge for 16.5% (n = 22) of the patients. Joint planning for post-discharge care was conducted for 92.5% (n = 123) of the patients (Fig. 1). 82.7% (n = 110) received nutritional counseling, during which the target amount and administration method of parenteral nutrition were discussed together with the patient and, if necessary, their relatives or the responsible nursing staff, with the goal of ensuring an adequate intake of energy as well as macro- and micronutrients while considering the patient's daily routine.

### Practical considerations when providing palliative care to patients with neuroendocrine tumors in the context of routine disease management or hospice care [^90353bac]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

Patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms have unique disease-related symptoms that impact palliative care needs during routine disease management and at the end of life. There are special considerations around the use of palliative treatments when caring for patients with advanced neuroendocrine neoplasms that should be taken into account: disease biology and prognosis, as well as symptoms that may be related to location and burden of disease and/or hormone secretion. SSAs can palliate symptoms of hormone excess, such as flushing and diarrhea, that impact quality of life; however, there remain challenges related to cost and access to SSA therapy for patients receiving hospice care. Patients with pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma and functional pancreatic NETs also may have profound symptoms that require specific palliation during the course of their disease and at the end of life. Other issues that are unique to patients with advanced NETs include MF and bowel or biliary tract obstruction that may require intervention. Awareness of these issues and other important medical and cost issues covered in this white paper will allow well-informed discussion and multidisciplinary care to maximize the patient quality of life during routine care and at the end of life.

- Provide privacy and quiet time at the patient's usual or planned time for defecation.
- Provide a toilet or bedside commode and appropriate assistive devices; avoid bedpan use whenever possible. Treatment of Acute Bowel Obstruction Careful serial examinations are necessary to manage patients with progressive abdominal symptoms that may be due to acute bowel obstruction. The principles of supportive care in this setting include bowel rest, volume resuscitation, correction of electrolyte imbalances, and transfusion support if necessary. These measures may precede or accompany decompression efforts. When bowel obstruction is partial, decompression of the distended bowel may be attempted with nasogastric tubes or intestinal tubes.

The use of these tubes may reduce edema, relieve fluid and gas accumulation, or decrease the need for multiple stage procedures. However, surgery may be necessary within 24 hours if there is complete, acute obstruction. Dietary discretion is advised to minimize the risk of tube obstruction by solid food. If the obstruction improves, the valve can be closed, and the patient may once again benefit from enteral nutrition. Sometimes, decompression is difficult even with a gastrostomy tube in place. Accumulation of fluid may interfere with decompression because several liters of gastrointestinal secretions may be produced per day. Pharmacological symptom management may be necessary. In the.

Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs)

The majority of GI symptoms in patients who have NENs, do not result from excess production of hormones.
Gastroenterologists should be involved in the NEN MDT.
Surgery and systemic treatments for NENs, particularly somatostatin analogues, frequently cause abnormal GI symptoms.
Common causes of GI symptoms include PEI, BAD and SIBO.
Starting pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) is appropriate without faecal elastase measurement in those with steatorrhoea starting after treatment with a somatostatin analogue.
Prophylactic cholecystectomy should be considered when undertaking initial surgery for NENs to prevent recurrent or chronic pancreatitis.
In an existing non-functioning NEN, new GI symptoms should prompt investigation to exclude a change in hormone secretion.
If a NEN directly contributes to GI symptoms, either from pressure effects or from hormonal secretion, debulking surgery or systemic therapies should be considered.
Surgical management of mesenteric fibrosis should be considered, even in a metastatic setting, if quality of life is impaired significantly (and if there is a reasonable prognosis from the NEN).
Dietetics and multidisciplinary nutrition teams should be involved in patient care, especially in those at risk of short bowel syndrome from either mesenteric fibrosis or its surgical management.
NENs are associated with an increased risk of developing other cancers so new unexplained symptoms should prompt investigations for other GI cancers.

Mesenteric fibrosis

Abdominal pain can be difficult to manage and requires a close collaboration with pain and palliative care teams and dietitians.
Early and sustained dietetic input is needed to optimise nutritional status and prevent malnutrition.
Resection of fibrotic tissue or of involved bowel segments may offer symptomatic relief but risks short bowel syndrome.
Despite stage IV disease, surgery may be an option but must be agreed in a NEN MDT.
Long-term home parenteral nutrition is a valid alternative to surgery if the risks of surgery are considered too high.

Conclusion

This study demonstrated that a PNE-led, MNST produced measurable improvements in the care of long-term HPN patients. The MNST made numerous recommendations for HPN management, most of which were accepted by the treating physicians. MNST input improved patients' self-assessed overall health, while reducing adverse outcomes, rehospitalisation and hospital LOS. If extended to the entire population of long-term HPN patients, we believe that MNSTs could have a significant impact on the quality and cost of HPN care.

### Practical considerations when providing palliative care to patients with neuroendocrine tumors in the context of routine disease management or hospice care [^6723bb92]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

For patients with NETs in particular, however, there are several special considerations around the use of palliative treatments. First, the acuity vs chronicity of the underlying NET may impact decision-making regarding palliative interventions. The assessment of the burden and risks of treatments may vary between those with aggressive disease with limited life expectancy compared with those with indolent disease expected to live many years or decades with indolent NET. For some patients with particularly aggressive NETs (life expectancy of months to a year or two), palliative care needs are very similar to those with other aggressive, life-threatening cancers. As such, many of the interventions and their intensity are similar. However, for some patients, their diagnosis of NET may be a long-term, nearly chronic challenge, with palliative interventions limited by the reality of the cost/benefit consideration. For example, opioids are typically not indicated for chronic pain due to the risks of endocrinologic complications, opioid misuse, and concerns about the efficacy of these analgesics for long-term pain. As a result of these challenges, opioids may not be indicated for pain in the setting of long-term NET. However, for severe symptoms, opioids may become a mainstay of palliative treatment, especially in those with aggressive NET disease likely to cause the death of the patient before significant complications can accumulate. Second, given that diarrhea is a major burdensome symptom for many patients with NETs (including due to carcinoid syndrome, cholecystectomy, partial colonic resection, and/or pancreatic insufficiency), the negative side effect of opioids as analgesics for people with non-NET cancers (i.e. constipation), often becomes a positive side effect for people with NETs complicated by both diarrhea and pain. Analgesic doses of opioids may become a major component of an antidiarrheal regimen. Third, a number of symptoms seen commonly in patients with NET secondary to hormonal secretion are relatively rare in patients with other cancers, including flushing, hypertension, hypoglycemia, and symptomatic nutritional deficiencies.

### Intestinal occlusion by gynecological cancers treated by percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and lanreotide: an aviano national cancer institute experience [^0f6ccf74]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common type of cancer in the world and it has the lowest survival rate of all gynecological cancers. In 2020, there is an estimation of about 21.750 new cases diagnosed per year and about 13,940 ovarian cancer deaths in the USA. In many cases at the time of diagnosis, it is already at an advanced stage. Malignant bowel obstruction is a common and distressing complication of advanced gynecological cancer and peritoneal carcinomatosis. The obstruction gives rise to a vicious cycle of increased intestinal secretion and fluid accumulation with the resultant damage to the intestinal epithelium causing an inflammatory response. The symptoms are principally nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain: all these symptoms are debilitating for the patient and difficult to manage at home. Management of obstruction due to advanced cancer is likely to require intravenous hydration and parenteral nutrition alongside pharmaceutical interventions and the use of nasogastric tubes; however, these procedures are distressing for the patients. For this reason, the treatment of the terminal patients to improve and ensure a good quality of life is the primary goal of palliative care.

Almost all the patients with gynecological cancer have undergone multiple surgical treatments as well as a number of cycles of chemo- or radiotherapy. The patients normally have a poor performance status, thus making surgical treatment a poor option due to the high mortality and morbidity rate.

To date, gastrointestinal decompression through a nasogastric tube is the first-line procedure in patients with disseminated peritoneal carcinomatosis and small bowel obstruction, but this treatment is poorly tolerated and it has many side effects, involving wing necrosis, laryngeal disorders, esophageal-gastric lesions, or aspiration pneumonia.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is a simple method for achieving nonsurgical gastric decompression in patients suffering from metastatic abdominal tumors and upper gastrointestinal tract obstruction.

Decompressive PEG is an endoscopic medical procedure in which a tube is passed into the patient's stomach through the abdominal wall. PEG is relatively easy to use and allows obstructive symptoms to be resolved in the majority of patients. Special medical skills are not required and the patient may be easily managed at home together with support therapy and pain management. Once PEG has been performed, it is possible to take fluids and semi-liquid foods, offering the patient a chance to taste flavors.

Surgical treatment is central to management of small bowel neuroendocrine tumors (SBNETs). Current controversies include whether to resect asymptomatic primary tumors in the setting of unresectable metastases, the role of minimally invasive surgery, and how best to incorporate/sequence medical treatments. Low SBNET incidence, long event-times, and variability in disease burden, surgical technique, and institutional treatment preferences remain obstacles to conducting randomized surgical trials for SBNETs. With increasing referral of these patients to high-volume centers, cooperation between experienced SBNET clinicians should allow design of high-quality randomized trials to test new treatments and answer key questions.

### Role of primary tumor resection for metastatic small bowel neuroendocrine tumors [^d48226aa]. World Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

While small bowel resection is well established as standard of care for curative-intent management of localized and loco-regional small bowel neuroendocrine tumors (SB-NETs), resection of the primary tumor in the setting of metastatic disease is debated. This review addresses the role of primary tumor resection for stage IV well-differentiated grade 1 and 2 SB-NETs. While survival benefits have been reported for primary tumor resection in the setting of metastatic disease, these studies are limited by selection bias and thus controversial. The main clinical benefits of primary tumor resection for stage IV disease involve the prevention of potentially debilitating complications associated with mesenteric fibrosis, including intestinal obstruction, mesenteric ischemia and angina, venous congestion, malabsorption, and malnutrition. Patients with metastases undergoing initial resection of the primary SB-NETs appear to have fewer episodes of care and re-intervention for loco-regional complications than those who do not undergo resection. As recommended by the NANETS and ENETS guidelines, resection of the primary tumor for stage IV SB-NETs should be strongly considered to avoid future loco-regional complications and potentially to improve survival. All patients with stage IV SB-NETs should be assessed by a surgeon experienced in the management of NETs to consider surgical therapies, including resection of the primary tumor despite metastatic disease.

When a patient is initially diagnosed with MBO, they should be made Nil Per Os (NPO; nothing by mouth), and when the acute MBO resolves fully or partially, a symptom led, slow and graded reintroduction to oral diet is recommended, which may include clear fluids, free or full fluids, texture modified low fiber diet and, if tolerated, return to normal textured low fiber diet (level of evidence: IV; grade: B). Nutrition interventions should be initiated in patients with advanced cancers only where the benefits on quality of life and survival outweigh the risks, with clear expectations discussed by a multidisciplinary team with patients and families (level of evidence: IV; grade: B).

### Small bowel obstruction from a dislodged feeding tube [^9a491313]. Age and Ageing (2004). Low credibility.

Elderly nursing home patients may suffer from inadequate oral nutritional intake for a variety of reasons. In some of them, nutritional status cannot be maintained without the use of enteral feeding. Nasogastric tube feeding is associated with significant patient discomfort, and may lead to significant complications. Thus, in those who require long-term enteral tube feeding, a gastrostomy tube may be necessary. Although surgical insertion may occasionally be required, percutaneous insertion with upper endoscopy assistance is usually safe and feasible. This case represents an unusual complication of such a gastrostomy tube, which draws attention to the need for appropriate care of these tubes.

### Surgery as a principle and technical consideration for primary tumor resection of small bowel neuroendocrine tumors [^35e96035]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

Resection of SB-NETs should be considered in all patients, including patients with metastatic disease who are surgically fit. Key considerations include assessment of multifocality and resection of mesenteric nodal masses with the use of mesenteric-sparing approaches, and accepting of R1 margins if necessary to clear disease while avoiding short bowel syndrome. Consultation with NET-experienced surgeons should be sought prior to concluding to unresectability of locoregional disease. Decision making and management should also be tailored to patient factors, such as age and comorbidity, and goals of care.

### How to manage small intestine (jejunal and ileal) neuroendocrine neoplasms presenting with liver metastases? [^64835eeb]. Current Oncology Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Small intestinal neuroendocrine neoplasms (siNENs) are slowly growing tumours with a low malignant potential. However, more than half of the patients present with distant metastases (stage IV) and nearly all with locoregional lymph node (LN) metastases at the time of surgery. The value of locoregional treatment is discussed controversially.

Recent Findings

In stage I to III disease, locoregional surgery was currently shown to be curative prolonging survival. In stage IV disease, surgery may prolong survival in selected patients with the chance to cure locoregional disease besides radical/debulking liver surgery. It may improve the quality of life and may prevent severe local complications resulting in a state of chronic malnutrition and severe intestinal ischaemia or bowel obstruction. Locoregional tumour resection offers the opportunity to be curative or to focus therapeutically on liver metastasis, facilitating various other therapeutic modalities. Risks and benefits of the surgical intervention need to be balanced individually.

### Surgical management of malignant bowel obstruction: strategies toward palliation of patients with advanced cancer [^cd10edf1]. Current Oncology Reports (2009). Low credibility.

The management of malignant bowel obstruction is a challenging problem because of the poor definition of malignant bowel obstruction compounded by its myriad clinical presentations. Surgeons are called upon to perform invasive procedures designed to alleviate symptoms or correct the underlying obstruction. Unfortunately, interventions may carry a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Balancing these risks and potential benefits is complicated, and there is a paucity of data to help guide these difficult decisions. The surgeon is further handicapped when he or she is not understanding of the patient's disease status, prognosis, or long-term goals. Diligent discussion with the primary team and frank discussions with the patient and his or her family are essential to formulate an appropriate plan. It is also essential that the surgeon have a thorough understanding of the surgical options to relieve or palliate malignant bowel obstruction as well as effective nonsurgical interventions. The best approach may be appropriate surgical intervention coupled with aggressive medical management.

### Small bowel obstruction in the elderly: a plea for comprehensive acute geriatric care [^63098a79]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction is one of the most frequent emergencies in general surgery, commonly affecting elderly patients. Morbidity and mortality from small bowel obstruction in elderly is high. Significant progress has been made in the diagnosis and management of bowel obstruction in recent years. But little is known whether this progress has benefitted outcomes in elderly patients, particularly those who are frail or have a malignancy as cause of the obstruction, and when considering quality of life and functioning as outcomes. In this review, we discuss the specific challenges and needs of elderly in diagnosis and treatment of small bowel obstruction. We address quality of life aspects and explore how the concept of geriatric assessment can be utilized to improve decision-making and outcomes for elderly patients with a small bowel obstruction.
