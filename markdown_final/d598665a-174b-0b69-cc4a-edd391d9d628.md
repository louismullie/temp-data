## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option correctly defines the saving schedule. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core economic concept of a saving schedule and whether it relates household saving to income. Then, I should verify which answer choice matches that definition. Next, I will examine the distractors to ensure none of them plausibly fit the term. Finally, I will confirm the correct choice and briefly justify it with the conceptual context from the documents.

> Let me first confirm the economic concept. The saving schedule, in macroeconomics, is the relationship that shows how much households plan to save at different levels of disposable income, reflecting the propensity to save as income changes. This is a standard construct in consumption–saving models and aligns with how household behavior is modeled in the provided sources that discuss consumption, saving, and income dynamics [^7b6a9d98].

> Wait, let me verify the answer choices against that definition. Option G states the saving schedule is the relationship which shows how much of their incomes households plan to save for the various levels of disposable income, which matches the concept precisely. The other options either describe tax calculations, bill payment timetables, shopping lists, bank rate programs, or government mandates, none of which correspond to the income–saving relationship embodied by the saving schedule [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check the distractors. Options A, D, E, H, I, and J all refer to things like tax methods, bill calendars, expense lists, bank programs, or purchase plans, which are unrelated to the saving schedule as an economic relationship. Option B suggests prioritizing investment over savings, which inverts the usual meaning of a saving schedule that simply describes saving behavior across income levels rather than prescribing investment strategy. Option F describes a historical record for auditing, which is not the forward-looking, income-dependent relationship implied by a saving schedule [^notfound].

> I will now examine the correct choice more closely to ensure internal consistency. Option G correctly captures that the saving schedule is a behavioral relationship mapping disposable income to planned saving, consistent with models where households make consumption and saving decisions based on current and expected income and wealth, and where saving can be precautionary and heterogeneous across households and over time [^7b6a9d98].

> Conclusion: The saving schedule is the relationship showing how much households plan to save at various levels of disposable income, so the correct answer is G [^notfound].

---

The saving schedule is the relationship that shows how much households plan to save at different levels of disposable income [^notfound]. It is a fundamental concept in macroeconomics that illustrates the positive relationship between income and saving, with saving typically rising as disposable income increases. The saving schedule is distinct from the consumption schedule and is used to analyze household saving behavior, determine the marginal propensity to save, and understand how changes in income affect aggregate saving in the economy.

---

## Definition and concept

The saving schedule is a graphical or tabular representation of the relationship between disposable income and household saving. It shows the amount households plan to save at various income levels, holding other factors constant. The saving schedule is upward sloping, indicating that as disposable income rises, planned saving increases. This positive relationship reflects the fact that households generally save a portion of any additional income, a behavior captured by the marginal propensity to save (MPS).

---

## Components of the saving schedule

The saving schedule typically includes the following components:

- **Disposable income**: The total income households have available for spending and saving after taxes and other deductions.
- **Planned saving**: The amount households intend to save at each level of disposable income.
- **Marginal propensity to save (MPS)**: The fraction of additional income that households save, calculated as the change in saving divided by the change in disposable income.

---

## Relationship with the consumption schedule

The saving schedule is closely related to the consumption schedule, which shows how much households plan to consume at different income levels. Since disposable income is either consumed or saved, the sum of consumption and saving equals disposable income. Therefore, the saving schedule can be derived from the consumption schedule, and vice versa. The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) and the marginal propensity to save (MPS) sum to one, reflecting the allocation of additional income between consumption and saving.

---

## Factors influencing the saving schedule

Several factors can shift the saving schedule, changing the amount households save at each income level:

- **Interest rates**: Higher interest rates can incentivize saving by increasing the return on saved funds, potentially shifting the saving schedule upward.
- **Consumer confidence**: Greater confidence in future economic conditions may reduce precautionary saving, shifting the saving schedule downward.
- **Wealth**: Increases in household wealth can reduce the need to save out of current income, shifting the saving schedule downward.
- **Demographic factors**: Age, family structure, and cultural attitudes toward saving can influence the saving schedule.

---

## Economic significance

The saving schedule is a critical tool in macroeconomic analysis. It helps economists and policymakers understand household saving behavior, predict how changes in income will affect aggregate saving, and formulate policies to encourage or discourage saving. For example, tax incentives for retirement savings can shift the saving schedule upward, increasing household saving and potentially boosting national saving and investment.

---

## Graphical representation

Graphically, the saving schedule is typically plotted with disposable income on the horizontal axis and planned saving on the vertical axis. The resulting line is upward sloping, reflecting the positive relationship between income and saving. The slope of the line represents the marginal propensity to save (MPS), indicating how much saving increases for each additional dollar of disposable income.

---

## Example of a saving schedule

| **Disposable income ($)** | **Planned saving ($)** |
|-|-|
| 0 | -100 |
| 1,000 | 0 |
| 2,000 | 100 |
| 3,000 | 200 |
| 4,000 | 300 |

---

In this example, households dissave (spend more than their income) at low income levels and begin to save as income rises. The marginal propensity to save (MPS) is 0.1, indicating that households save 10 cents of each additional dollar of disposable income.

---

## Conclusion

The saving schedule is a fundamental concept in economics that illustrates the relationship between disposable income and household saving. It is essential for understanding household behavior, predicting economic trends, and formulating effective economic policies. By analyzing the saving schedule, economists can gain insights into how changes in income, interest rates, and other factors influence saving decisions and aggregate economic outcomes.

### Scientists' warning on affluence [^f2f2d7e7]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Systemic drivers and possible solutions

As the previous section shows, there is a positive relationship between biophysical resource use and affluence, as defined by income. Adding to this, the most affluent groups have higher incomes than expenditure, and their saving and investing leads to substantial additional environmental impact. Therefore, and due to significant inter- and intra-national wealth and income inequality, we differentiate between globally affluent groups, such as the European Union, and the most wealthy and affluent groups within countries, e.g. the < 1–10% richest income segments. As quantitative research, shows, highly affluent consumers drive biophysical resource use (a) directly through high consumption, (b) as members of powerful factions of the capitalist class and (c) through driving consumption norms across the population. The next sections focus on affluent groups globally and on the intra-nationally most wealthy and affluent segments (hereafter called super-affluent).

Reducing overconsumption

Since the level of consumption determines total impacts, affluence needs to be addressed by reducing consumption, not just greening it. It is clear that prevailing capitalist, growth-driven economic systems have not only increased affluence since World War II, but have led to enormous increases in inequality, financial instability, resource consumption and environmental pressures on vital earth support systems. A suitable concept to address the ecological dimension is the widely established avoid-shift-improve framework outlined by Creutzig et al. Its focus on the end-use service, such as mobility, nutrition or shelter, allows for a multi-dimensional analysis of potential impact reductions beyond sole technological change. This analysis can be directed at human need satisfaction or decent living standards — an alternative perspective put forward for curbing environmental crises. Crucially, this perspective allows us to consider different provisioning systems (e.g. states, markets, communities and households) and to differentiate between superfluous consumption, which is consumption that does not contribute to needs satisfaction, and necessary consumption which can be related to satisfying human needs. It remains important to acknowledge the complexities surrounding this distinction, as touched upon in the sections on growth imperatives below. Still, empirically, human needs satisfaction shows rapidly diminishing returns with overall consumption.

Core components included in all three treatment variants

1. Coaching. The coaching component facilitated the delivery and coordination of the various interventions. Beneficiaries formed groups of 15 to 25 members and selected a coach to mentor them throughout the programme. Coaches were men or women from the village, generally selected for their capacity to advise on income-generating activities and to represent the group for service providers and market agents. Coaches facilitated the implementation of group-based programme activities, including promoting the attendance of beneficiaries at meetings and coordinating with service providers. They led group-level coaching sessions, during which challenges and opportunities for income-generating activities were discussed. The group-level coaching sessions occurred during weekly savings group meetings, as described below. Coaches also provided some individualized follow-up to beneficiaries.

2. Saving groups. The groups of beneficiaries formed a village savings and loans association (VSLA), with initial training from the coach. The group received a VSLA kit, elected members to leadership positions and determined the rules governing the association. Key decisions included the cost of a saving 'share', maximum loan size, interest rate and duration of a savings cycle. Group members also defined other parameters, such as a mandatory contribution to an emergency fund and penalties. At weekly meetings, members purchased between one and five shares in the savings fund, contributed a fixed amount to the emergency fund, and could take out a short-term loan from the savings fund. A full savings cycle lasted between 9 and 12 months, at which point the accumulated savings, interest, and penalty fees were shared among members in proportion to the number of savings shares owned by each member.

3. Micro-entrepreneurship training. A week-long micro-entrepreneurship training was delivered to the groups. The curriculum was adapted from the International Labour Organization's Start and Improve Your Business (SIYB) level 1 training, which is tailored to non-literate participants. The curriculum covered fundamental micro-entrepreneurship skills, including basic accounting and management principles, market research, planning and scheduling, saving, and investing. In addition, the training focused on the choice of livelihood activities and the preparation of a basic business plan.

4. Access to markets. Coaches were trained to deliver information sessions on market access. Depending on production cycle timing, they held group sessions to discuss where to buy inputs for agricultural activities, how to choose suppliers, or where to sell products.

### Low household income, financial literacy, or financial health: which is the strongest risk factor and outcome of depressive symptomatology? [^8ac7a3fd]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Depression's relations to psychosocial processes are complex, bidirectional, and include financial functioning. The current study compared the extent to which household income, financial literacy (knowledge and skill), and financial health (saving, spending, borrowing, and planning behavior) were risk factors and outcomes of depression.

Methods

A United States national sample of working-aged adults (N = 6565) completed self-report measures of financial functioning and depression in years 2020 and 2022. Depression scales assessed both negative (depressive symptoms) and positive (life satisfaction) affective dimensions.

Results

Lower income, less financial literacy, and especially poorer financial health correlated significantly with more depressive symptoms and lower life satisfaction. Poorer financial health demonstrated the strongest prospective relations with increasing depressive symptoms and decreasing life satisfaction over the two-year retest interval. In parallel, higher depressive symptoms and lower life satisfaction each predicted subsequent decreases in financial health.

Limitations

Results from this longitudinal, observational study suggested but could not establish causal connections between depression and financial functioning. The study's novel results require replication before clinical application.

Conclusions

More so than low income or limited financial literacy, poor financial health is both a risk factor and potential outcome of depression, including more depressive symptoms and lower life satisfaction. If these findings are replicated, financial health may be an important research and clinical target for depression assessment, prevention, and treatment.

Construction of skill distribution from income data.

Their economic behavior, influenced by diverse income sources such as labor, investments, and social benefits, shapes their consumption, savings decisions, and overall liquid wealth (W i, t). Actively engaging in both labor and goods markets, households make strategic consumption choices based on price and availability and adjust market relationships in response to demand fulfillment. This adaptive behavior not only reflects their individual economic circumstances but also contributes to the broader market dynamics, affecting the supply-demand equilibrium in the consumer goods and labor markets. At each time step t, households make decisions: (1) the amount of goods to consume and their suppliers, (2) their employer. The consumption amount depends on their wealth level W i, t, interpreting W i, t as liquid wealth excluding assets like real estate (as in). The wealth level adjusts through various income sources, with labor incomedefined as:where w i, t is the wage for L i labor units provided, and U B t are unemployment benefits. Total wealth for consumption at t is, where L A i, t is the liquid asset level. Households choose goods based on price and availability, adjusting market relationships in response to demand fulfillment. In case of unmet demand, they buy from other producers until no supply remains, avoiding high involuntary savings due to market mismatches. After transactions, they know their true consumption leveland liquid assets L A i, t +1 for the next period. Households may break trade connections with unsatisfactory suppliers (probability ψ Q) or seek lower prices (probability ψ P), applying pressure on producers to meet demand and reduce prices. Again, they are only bounded rational. In our case, this means, instead of analytically solving their explicit inter-temporal choice problem, they approximate it by comparing a finite set of actions (i.e. they lack the ability to compute perfect optima). These households have consumption and investment preferences, based on their wealth levels and heterogeneous time preferences. Each household i inter-temporal optimization problem is defined as:where α i is the absolute propensity to consume, as a portion of wealth level W i, t.is the household's discount factor with j − t as index for current and future time steps, and U (⋅) is the utility function, given as. This optimization problem is constrained by:Here, Y i, t is the household's income level at time t, which can come from labor, capital, or government subsidies. C i, t is the consumption level and r t the real interest rate. In order to solve the optimization problem in equation (2), households form expectations of their future income- and wealth level and the interest rate. These expectations are formed using simple adaptive updating rules:whereis the expected value and ω is a weighting factor. Based on the optimization problem, heterogeneous time preferences, and adjusting changing expectations, households have heterogeneous saving rates on both the cross-sectional and inter-temporal levels. Furthermore, these savings are precautionary, meaning that savings are motivated by the desire to keep a stable consumption level in case of a negative income shock. As a result, aggregate behavior qualitatively matches empirical data for the marginal propensity to consume, as shown in Fig. S7.

### Use of health savings accounts among US adults enrolled in high-deductible health plans [^1a6f665f]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Approximately 1 in 5 individuals with an HSA who saved for health care in the last 12 months reported saving in a non-HSA vehicle along with their HSA. For individuals who have not reached their annual HSA contribution limit, this may be financially inferior to the triple tax advantage of saving in an HSA (ie, HSA contributions are not taxed, HSA earnings are not taxed, and qualified HSA withdrawals are not taxed). Another 20% of people with an HSA reported saving for health care only in a non-HSA vehicle and could similarly be missing opportunities to reduce their tax burdens. Together, these patterns suggest that employers and health plans have potentially important roles to play in helping individuals with HSAs better understand these accounts and make financially advantageous decisions about their saving for health care.

Although people with lower incomes or chronic conditions can be especially vulnerable to cost-related access barriers when enrolled in an HDHP, individuals in these subgroups were not less likely than others to lack an HSA. Similarly, among individuals who had an HSA, those with lower incomes or chronic conditions were not any less likely than others to have made no contributions to their HSA in the last year. Efforts by employers, health plans, and health systems to encourage uptake and use of HSAs should particularly focus on these subgroups of HDHP enrollees who could potentially benefit from the use of HSAs as a strategy to lessen their known cost-related access barriers and financial burdens.

### The role of peer victimization in the physical activity and screen time of adolescents: a cross-sectional study [^dc38502d]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Because adolescents are not necessarily aware of their household income and the education levels of their parents, weekly spending money and future education plans were used as indicators of personal economic status. Adolescents whose parents have attained a higher education tend to have a higher disposable income in terms of weekly allowance and job income, and weekly spending money has been shown to be positively associated with vigorous exercise and watching TV among adolescents. Research in Norway found that plans for higher education were highly stable across adolescence, and the participants' educational plans tended to correspond well with their parents education. Weekly spending money was assessed with the question "About how much money do you usually get each week to spend on yourself or to save?", and included money from allowances and jobs like babysitting and delivering papers. To be consistent with other COMPASS studies, and in order to retain as many cases as possible, this variable was collapsed into "zero", "$1–20", "$21–100", " > $100", and "don't know". Future education plans was assessed with the question "What is the highest level of education you think you will get?" with six response options including completed high school or less; college/trade/vocational certificate; university bachelor's degree; university master's/PhD/law school/medical school/teachers' college degree; and I don't know.

### Financial social protection and individual out-of-pocket costs of long-term care in the USA and Europe: an observational study [^2f7d1b6d]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Since low progressive systems tend to offer higher affordability as well, average out-of-pocket LTC expenditure and share of LTC expenditure relative to income are significantly lower in G lp than in G hp for both income categories. Within G lp, the difference in out-of-pocket LTC expenditure between households with low (below median) and high (above median) income is about $350 per year. Within G hp, this difference is about $1 100 per year, when the USA is included, and $1 600, when the USA is excluded. A similar pattern is observed when restricting attention to utilizers with strictly positive costs. In this case, within G lp the difference in out-of-pocket LTC expenditure between households with low (below median) and high (above median) income is about $550 per year. Within G hp, this difference is about $1 400 per year, when the USA is included, and $1 650, when the USA is excluded. In the last column of Table 4, we test our second hypothesis, that is, whether the difference between income categories, which we denote by ΔInc, is the same in G lp and G hp. This double difference is significant at least at the 5% level when the USA is excluded, in line with the expectation that, in highly progressive systems, individuals with high income should pay relatively more than individuals with low income (this result, however, is somehow sensitive to how system progressivity is defined – see Tables A15 and A16 in the Supplementary Material). It tends to be not significant when the USA is included, reflecting that, even among individuals with low income, out-of-pocket LTC expenditures are much higher in the USA than in Europe.

The difference in LTC expenditure to income ratio for households below and above median income is 5 percentage points within G lp. It remains around that value within G hp regardless of whether the USA is included in the sample. The picture is very different if we focus on the sub-sample of individuals reporting non-zero expenditure. In this case, the difference in LTC expenditure to income ratio for households below and above median income is 8 percentage points within G lp, but it is significantly higher within G hp, reaching 20 percentage points with the USA and 14 without the USA. The ΔInc parameter is significant at the 1% level when the USA is included and at the 10% level when the USA is excluded.

### Using the demographic health survey wealth index to create family planning market segments based on absolute income levels [^724d0a8d]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Two common measures of socioeconomic position

There are two common approaches to analysing socioeconomic position. The first approach looks at the relative wealth within a country or population. The DHS wealth index uses this approach, where questions about household construction materials, water and sanitation access, and ownership of various assets (eg, television) are determined at the household level and then individuals are ranked based on the score of the households they live in. Next, the rank positions are used to categorise individuals into five groups from poorest to wealthiest within a country. While useful to understand relative wealth within a country; someone deemed 'richer' according to the wealth quintiles might still have few resources for out-of-pocket expenditures. Further, this measure can be difficult to compare across countries since the richest households in one country might have fewer resources than the richest households in another country. Additionally, wealth quintiles do not allow one to examine changes in overall wealth over time. To address these challenges, alternatives such as the Comparative Wealth Index, Harmonized Wealth Index and International Wealth Index have been proposed.

In contrast, absolute measures of socioeconomic position are typically based on the flow of resources via income and expenditures. The World Bank generates poverty headcount estimates for most countries based on a complex methodology using multiple sources and assumptions, including country-specific survey data on income and consumption and information on prices, exchange rates and purchasing power parity. These estimates classify the proportion of a country's population living under the International Poverty Line, as defined as US$1.90 per person per day, in 2015 based on 2011 purchasing power parity. Additional measures of poverty at higher thresholds, US$3.20 (lower middle income poverty line) and US$5.50 (upper middle income poverty line), are also calculated.

It is important to recognise that wealth and income are not the same thing; rather they provide different means of quantifying socioeconomic position. Many alternative measures exist, including the Unsatisfied Basic Needs measure, which focuses on non-income aspects of poverty and the Multidimensional Poverty Index that includes health, education and living standards and considers incidence and intensity of deprivation. While these and other measures play an important role in understanding deprivation and inequality, our focus is on the DHS wealth index and World Bank poverty thresholds, since they are widely used and can be easily interpreted for integration into DHS market segmentations.

### Health savings accounts: description, analysis, and implications [^0f8fde57]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Health savings accounts (HSAs) were authorized in federal legislation in 2003 and became effective January 1, 2004. The principal motive was to encourage working-age persons to be more cost conscious and to make more prudent health care spending decisions, thereby restraining growth in health care spending. A secondary motive was to make it easier for individuals to accumulate funds over time to be used for paying for health care. As of March 2005, enrollment in HSAs exceeded 1 million. Contributions to HSAs can be made by individuals or employers. Neither contributions nor withdrawals for qualified health care expenses are subject to federal taxation. Unused funds can be carried over to the next year or to another employer; this feature makes HSAs more attractive than other types of health spending accounts. An HSA must be coupled with a high-deductible health plan. The out-of-pocket spending gap between the annual HSA contribution and the minimum deductible is intended to make people more cost conscious in their health spending decisions. Prototypes of HSAs have been tried on a limited basis in the private sector, and these provide some lessons for the likely effects of HSAs on the socioeconomics of enrollment; the type and timing of health care spending; health outcomes; and effects on individuals, employers, and providers.

### Older workers with unpredictable schedules: implications for well-being and job retention [^54d11ff5]. The Gerontologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Prior research has shown that poorer working conditions, defined in line with the Job Strain Model as high job demands and low decision authority, are associated with earlier retirement. Untenable schedules may "push" workers into early retirement due to decreased job satisfaction, high levels of distress, inadequate economic stability to justify staying, and conflicts between family obligations and work shifts. Hypothesis 3: We expect poor scheduling conditions to be negatively related to indicators of job retention.

Despite the gradually increasing age of eligibility for full Social Security benefits, those with low educational attainment remain at increased risk of exiting the labor force earlier than planned and preferred. At age 55, 90% of men with college degrees were employed compared to 80% with high school degrees and 65% without high school degrees. Unexpected labor force exits around retirement age have been found to be associated with depressive symptoms. Early retirement can be especially consequential without savings, and half of workers making less than $40,000 annually have no retirement savings and no defined benefit pensions. Therefore, it is critical to identify aspects of the workplace that can be modified to promote health and workforce participation for middle-aged and older workers.

### Promoting convergence and closing gaps using affordability-based minimum taxes: an illustration using the European union tobacco tax directive [^da763cc0]. Tobacco Control (2023). Medium credibility.

Definition of the tax reform based on affordability criteria

Since the purpose of the paper is to illustrate the functioning of a tax reform based purely on affordability criteria, we abstain from considering the price convergence mechanisms illustrated in our previous research. Likewise, we simplify the tax equalisation mechanism between FM and RYO by using the same minimum tax on 1000 cigarettes/1000 g RYO in the reform scenario.

To choose a reform that illustrates the main idea behind this paper, we first examine the ratio of the minimum tax borne by 1000 cigarettes over Disposable Household Income per capita in Purchasing Parity Standards (GDI) across EU countries from Eurostat, using the latest year for which this statistic is available (2017). We use this measure of household income rather than other popular measures such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) because, according to Eurostat "… this indicator reflects the purchasing power of households and their ability to invest in goods and services or save for the future, by accounting for taxes and social contributions and monetary in-kind social benefits". On average, the ratio across the EU is 0.85%, ranging between 2% in Ireland and 0.36% in Luxembourg, which is the richest country in terms of GDI. In the poorest country, Bulgaria, the ratio, at 0.83%, is close to the EU average.

For this illustration we choose a reform whereby member states must set minimum tax rates on 1000 cigarettes/1000 g RYO to account for no less of 0.83% of their GDI. This is an arbitrary criterion, and by no means does it imply that the affordability of cigarettes in Bulgaria is at the optimal level from the perspective of public health. However, opting for requiring the taxes on 1000 cigarettes/1000 g RYO to match at least the effort in terms of disposable income made in the poorest EU country when purchasing the same amounts of tobacco products would have the merit of triggering tax rises in high-income countries generally regarded as having a lax fiscal stance on tobacco (eg, Luxembourg). Also, it is worth noting that Bulgaria has the largest ratio of tax burden to nominal (rather than Purchasing Power Partity - PPP - adjusted) household disposable income, a gauge of affordability more in consonance with the standard practice in the literature, which further supports its role as an illustrative benchmark for the purposes of this paper.

### Economic well-being and its association with family caregiving experiences of households affected by schizophrenia in China [^123df357]. Schizophrenia (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this cross-sectional study in China, data analysis showed that the income and consumption of PLS households in China was extremely low. Half of the PLS households in our survey had per capita incomes below half the national average in China. The results of this study are consistent with those of previous studies, which found that PLS families are often trapped in low income and poverty. For the first time, the present study assessed multiple indicators of economic well-being and explored their relationship with family caregiving experiences. The first important finding of this study is the relationship between the economy well-being and caregiving burden. Several studies have suggested that PLS households with lower income reported higher levels of caregiving burden –. Some studies suggested that household income is not related with caregiving burden. Inconsistent findings across studies may be attributed to the oversimplified measures of household income in psychiatric epidemiology. Many studies did not take household size into account when measuring household income and did not provide a conceptualization and measurement of income. In this study, analysis of the data showed that PLS households with lower household income reported higher levels of caregiving burden. Economically disadvantaged families lack sufficient material resources to cope with the health expenditure and basic necessities of living, which adds to the caregiving burden. Under these circumstances, family members have to spend more time earning money, which further increases the caregiving burden due to tight schedules. Low-income households also resort to negative financial coping strategies, which further increases psychological distress.

### The role of financial stress in mental health changes during COVID-19 [^034892a4]. Npj Mental Health Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Control variables

We used age, education level, household composition, and personality traits as control variables in our analyses. Age and education level may confound the association between income and financial stress. Furthermore, research has shown that mental health during COVID-19 may differ between households with different compositions. We distinguished four household types: (1) no partner, no children, (2) children, no partner, (3) partner, no children, and (4) partner with children.

We considered the Big-Five personality traits (extraversion, agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability)as potential confounders of the relationship between mental health and one or more independent variables. Several studies have indicated that personality traits influence saving behavior, impulse buying, debts, and financial stress. The literature provides the most support for extraversion, conscientiousness, and emotional stability as potential covariates. For example, conscientiousness is positively associated with savings and negatively with debtsand financial stress. Extraversion negatively predicts debts. Emotional stability shows a negative association with financial stress. We, therefore, included subscales for emotional stability, conscientiousness, and extraversion (α = 0.77, 0.89, and 0.87, respectively) in our analyses.

We parsed out the variance between six controls (age, education level, household composition, emotional stability, conscientiousness, and extraversion) and the independent variables. This allowed us to examine the unique relationship between economic variables, financial stress, and mental health.

### New partnerships among single older adults: a Q methodology study [^a61c6205]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Participants loaded on Factor 4 were more concerned than their counterparts about the viewpoints of others who were close to them. These participants comprised the lowest level of educational attainment and the highest percentages of widowers/widows, and that most were living with a family member and subsisting on income from a pension and/or savings. Intertwining a desire to establish a partnership and a fear of taking risks, the participants on this factor believed that it is best to find a partner through their friends and family members' recommendation — a unique finding that has rarely been reported in prior literature. These older adults did not expect to see their partner daily (7: − 3, − 1.52) or that they even had to live nearby (6: − 4. -2.52). Unlike their counterparts in other factors, they did not plan to operate within a long-term relationship (3: − 2, − 1.17). In line with Määttä, the results of the present study indicated problems of prejudice from close others in their environment, which can cause older adults to hide their relationships to avoid gossip.

Participants loaded on Factor 5 were all divorced, and had the highest percentage of participants living alone while having income from pension and savings. These participants preferred that their partner was single and that they could be independent without having to take care of each other; as such, mutual health conditions and financial security were considered critical conditions of partnership. These findings coincide with a qualitative study conducted by Watson and Stelle, who showed that some elderly women did not consider marriage the ultimate goal of establishing a new partnership; they simply would like to enjoy the feelings that come with being in love. Fileborn et al. further pointed out that women expected romance and sexual intimacy within a relationship, but wanted to protect their independence and were reluctant to enter into a new relationship later in life, due in part to fears of falling into the role of caregiver and housekeeper. Among men, particularly divorcés, there was a desire to experience freedom from the bonds of marriage, and possibly from any future divorce-related costs (e.g. alimony and property division). Therefore, they would like to continue being economically independent even after stabilizing the relationship.

### Effects of socioeconomic position and clinical risk factors on spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm birth [^dd0fc343]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Annual after-tax family income for each woman (in the year of delivery) was based on the T1 Family Files and adjusted for family size. The latter calculation was carried out by dividing the total family income by the weighted number of family members. Weights were based on a standard formula (the oldest adult in the family received a weight of 1, other members 16 years or older and the first child in a single parent family received a weight of 0.4, and children under 16 years received a weight of 0.3). Family income was also adjusted for inflation (expressed in 1988 Canadian dollars) and categorized to yield five approximately equal groups. The quintile with the lowest family income was then further subdivided (in order to obtain a potentially more vulnerable group) and this resulted in a total of six family income categories (< $4,430, $4,430–$6,529, $6,530–$11,914, $11,915–$17,584, $17,585–$24,949, and ≥ $24,950). Contribution to a retirement savings plan (RSP, a tax-deductible investment) in the year of delivery was also examined as a second measure of socioeconomic position. This measure was used as an indicator of behavior related to tax-planning and long-term saving and was expected to reflect a dimension of socioeconomic status that was distinct from family income.

### Unlocking global carbon reduction potential by embracing low-carbon lifestyles [^b34b2a14]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Low-carbon lifestyles provide demand-side solutions to meet global climate targets, yet the global carbon-saving potential of consumer-led abatement actions remains insufficiently researched. Here, we quantify the greenhouse gas emissions reduction potential of 21 low-carbon expenditures using a global multi-regional input-output model linked with detailed household expenditure data. Targeting households exceeding the global per-capita average required to stay below 2 degrees, our model captures changes in direct energy use, household consumption and upstream intermediate industrial inputs. We find that implementing a combination of low-carbon expenditures among the top 23.7% emitters reduces global carbon footprints by 10.4 gigatons CO 2 e (i.e., 40.1% of the household consumption-based emissions of the 116 countries analysed in this study or 31.7% of the global total in 2017). Consumption pattern changes related to mobility and services contribute 11.8% and 10.2% of emission reductions. North America shows substantial reduction potential, while some Sub-Saharan African countries present unexpected mitigation possibilities. However, a rebound effect from re-spending income savings from lifestyle changes offsets the expected carbon savings by 6.5% to 45.8% (0.7–4.8 gigatons CO 2 e).

### Using the demographic health survey wealth index to create family planning market segments based on absolute income levels [^976d4bcc]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Applying absolute dollar thresholds to DHS relative wealth data

Since income variables are not included in the DHS, one can use the relative wealth index and apply an absolute threshold to the World Bank poverty thresholds. This is done by ranking individuals according to the wealth index and then using the absolute dollar thresholds to generate new variables that incorporate absolute measures. For example, if 50% of the population in a country live below the US$1.90 per day threshold, then the bottom 50% of individuals as measured by the wealth index are considered to live in extreme poverty (figure 1), as defined by the World Bank. This approach assumes that if you lined up everyone in a country from poorest to richest based on the wealth index, people would stay in a similar order if instead you lined them up based on their household income. While the order will not be identical, researchers have found this assumption sufficient for developing an absolute measure based on wealth variables.

### Magnitude of income-related disparities in adverse perinatal outcomes [^c2a5c4c1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Specific independent variables examined as predictors of adverse perinatal outcomes included total family income, before and after tax (adjusted for family size and inflation, expressed in 2003 Canadian dollars; as described in Joseph et al. 2008); proportion of income from government transfers (including welfare payments, social security, and subsidies for businesses) as an indicator of relative reliance on redistributed income; total family income (after tax) below the Low Income Measure (LIM) as an indicator of poverty; whether any income was derived from investments as an indicator of wealth; and whether any contributions were made to a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) as an indicator of middle social class.

An index of neighborhood deprivation describing the enumeration area of residence of families was calculated based on information from the 1986 Census using a previously described method; this was the only independent variable included at the group level. The Atlee database was used to assign postal code of residence at the time of childbirth, which was linked to enumeration areas using the Statistics Canada Postal Code Conversion File. The deprivation index (range 0 to 5.3 across 606 enumeration areas, mean 1.8, SD 0.9) was converted into a percentile where higher values indicated higher levels of deprivation.

Other maternal and household characteristics that were reported in the NSAPD were examined as confounders: urban or rural place of residence and birth year; effect modifiers: urban or rural place of residence and single marital status (a proxy for female-headed lone parent family); or considered to be mediators and thus, not included in models measuring the full magnitude of income-related inequalities, including parity, pre-pregnancy weight, weight gain during pregnancy, maternal age, maternal smoking at delivery (a proxy for maternal smoking during pregnancy), gestational diabetes and prenatal class attendance.

### A brief introduction to health economics [^0b8a996a]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

The reality of savings needs to be considered. A new version of an operation may take 10 min less operating time, but unless that means that more operations can be done in a theatre session, or that staff hours can be reduced, there will be no real savings. Similarly, if the new procedure reduces length of hospital stay, there will be no savings unless staffing levels are reduced. Indeed, there may be an increase in costs if the capacity saved is used for additional cases. This may be good for patients, but a problem for the hospital finance directors.

Unlike drugs, devices or procedures evolve over time, and the only long-term results may be from superseded versions. The base–case analysis could assume that newer versions are as good, but then, we can explore various sensitivity analyses, assuming that the latest version is 10% better or 20% better, to see what that does to the cost per QALY.

### Social factors influencing utilization of home care in community-dwelling older adults: a scoping review [^d3d301bd]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

The socio-ecological model

The complex, interconnected relationships between individuals, their social circumstances and their environment present a challenge for researchers who study social determinants of health. In particular, the patterns of how social circumstances affect health behaviours are not easily explained by considering each social factor in isolation. To illustrate, educational attainment is a property of individuals; yet, ability to go to school is associated with household income and both are measures of neighbourhood deprivation and unemployment. The socio-ecological model provides a way of conceptualizing and disentangling this complex interplay while still acknowledging the contribution of all factors. Based on ecological systems theory by Bronfenbrenner, the model assumes that health behaviours are shaped by the individual's relationships with caregivers (micro and meso systems) the community (exosystem) and broader society (macrosystem) as opposed to health behaviours solely being the product of individual characteristics and choices.

In applying the socio-ecological model to this review, it is therefore assumed that home care use (the health behaviour) is influenced by factors at each level of influence to various degrees. The social factors identified by this review will be organised into four levels of influence: individual (microsystem), relationship (meso-system), community (exosystem) and societal (macrosystem). The individual level refers to the intrapersonal characteristics of the individual who requires home care. The relationship level examines the interpersonal relationship between the individual and their caregivers. The community level explores the assets or deficits in the community that impact home care. The societal level refers to the public policy and cultural norms that shape the availability of home care services. These factors impacting home care utilization interact across all levels to impact behaviour change. The social-ecological model is best understood as a dynamic model for the purposes of this review, allowing for factors to be added or removed from categories of influence (e.g. household income can be a relationship factor for married adults, but an individual factor for single older adults).

### Annual cost savings of US $ 70 million with similar outcomes: vaccine procurement experience from Iraq [^484ec3d2]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Summary box

Procurement efficiency savings are monetary savings made by improving efficiency in procurement.
Governments have a strong desire for procurement efficiency because it is viewed as a relatively painless way to achieve cost savings.
Public policy and political considerations may influence procurement decisions because governments tend to have wider objectives than efficiency alone.
The Iraqi Ministry of Health succeeded in achieving vaccine procurement savings of US$70 million per year by implementing changes to the immunisation schedule.
The new schedule is considered just as effective in terms of disease prevention as the previous, more expensive schedule.
Procurement efficiency savings in the public sector is possible with a transparent policy process and strong leadership.

### Incentive based emergency demand response effectively reduces peak load during heatwave without harm to vulnerable groups [^9e92f220]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Heterogeneity analysis indicates that there are differences in EDR effects among vulnerable groups, which highlights the importance of considering specific subpopulations in the design and rollout of EDR policies to avoid creating new inequities. We found that the electricity saving potential of urban households is higher than that of rural households, which may be related to household income and the number of home appliances. Compared with rural low-income households, urban households have a higher disposable income, larger house areas, and more home appliances, leading to more demand for electricity use and thus a greater electricity conservation potential (The per capita disposable income of rural households in 2018 was 14,617 yuan, only 37% of that of urban residents, and 20% of them were even < 3666 yuan.). In addition, the efficiency of home appliances and electronic devices is critical for electricity conservation, and high-income households have the ability to purchase smart devices and to install home power management systems that will help them save more electricity. Both urban and rural households can reduce their electricity usage under stimulation by economic incentives. Considering that some low-income households can afford only light bulbs, even if they were willing to participate in the EDR, the electricity conservation potential was very limited. In the case of high efficiency and limited costs, power departments might be more willing to carry out EDR in urban areas because the electricity conservation of urban households is greater than that of rural households (Tables 1 and 2). The money used to incentivize EDR could be disproportionately distributed to urban households, which find it easier to reduce their electricity use. These types of transfer payments may be unfavorable for low-income groups. We also conducted a sub-group regression analysis to estimate the differences between the self-owned houses and tenants. Our findings indicate that EDR has a more significant effect on owner's electricity savings behavior during peak hours compared to tenants (Supplementary Note 12).

### Mediators and adverse effects of child poverty in the United States [^3559db7e]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Defining and describing poverty in the United States — poverty is defined as a state in which one lacks a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions to provide for basic needs. In the United States, the federal poverty level (FPL) operationalizes and measures poverty; each year the US Department of Health and Human Services develops poverty guidelines and thresholds on the basis of family size and composition, based on census data and loosely referred to as the FPL. Income and demographic data for FPL estimates come from the Current Population Survey, an annual nationally representative household survey jointly conducted by the US Census Bureau and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics within the US Department of Labor. Historically, the FPL was developed in the early 1960s using US Department of Agriculture's 1955 Food Consumption Survey; research in the 1950s found that the average US family spent one-third of its pretax income on food, and the federal poverty measure was determined by multiplying the basic food plan cost by 3 using the Economy Food Plan. The federal poverty measure has not changed fundamentally since 1969, except that it is adjusted annually.

### Financial arrangements for health systems in low-income countries: an overview of systematic reviews [^ed02d8bc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

One target of the Sustainable Development Goals is to achieve "universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all". A fundamental concern of governments in striving for this goal is how to finance such a health system. This concern is very relevant for low-income countries.

Objectives

To provide an overview of the evidence from up-to-date systematic reviews about the effects of financial arrangements for health systems in low-income countries. Secondary objectives include identifying needs and priorities for future evaluations and systematic reviews on financial arrangements, and informing refinements in the framework for financial arrangements presented in the overview.

Methods

We searched Health Systems Evidence in November 2010 and PDQ-Evidence up to 17 December 2016 for systematic reviews. We did not apply any date, language, or publication status limitations in the searches. We included well-conducted systematic reviews of studies that assessed the effects of financial arrangements on patient outcomes (health and health behaviours), the quality or utilisation of healthcare services, resource use, healthcare provider outcomes (such as sick leave), or social outcomes (such as poverty, employment, or financial burden of patients, e.g. out-of-pocket payment, catastrophic disease expenditure) and that were published after April 2005. We excluded reviews with limitations important enough to compromise the reliability of the findings. Two overview authors independently screened reviews, extracted data, and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. We prepared SUPPORT Summaries for eligible reviews, including key messages, 'Summary of findings' tables (using GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence), and assessments of the relevance of findings to low-income countries.

Main Results

We identified 7272 reviews and included 15 in this overview, on: collection of funds (2 reviews), insurance schemes (1 review), purchasing of services (1 review), recipient incentives (6 reviews), and provider incentives (5 reviews). The reviews were published between 2008 and 2015; focused on 13 subcategories; and reported results from 276 studies: 115 (42%) randomised trials, 11 (4%) non-randomised trials, 23 (8%) controlled before-after studies, 51 (19%) interrupted time series, 9 (3%) repeated measures, and 67 (24%) other non-randomised studies. Forty-three per cent (119/276) of the studies included in the reviews took place in low- and middle-income countries. Collection of funds: the effects of changes in user fees on utilisation and equity are uncertain (very low-certainty evidence). It is also uncertain whether aid delivered under the Paris Principles (ownership, alignment, harmonisation, managing for results, and mutual accountability) improves health outcomes compared to aid delivered without conforming to those principles (very low-certainty evidence). Insurance schemes: community-based health insurance may increase service utilisation (low-certainty evidence), but the effects on health outcomes are uncertain (very low-certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether social health insurance improves utilisation of health services or health outcomes (very low-certainty evidence). Purchasing of services: it is uncertain whether increasing salaries of public sector healthcare workers improves the quantity or quality of their work (very low-certainty evidence). Recipient incentives: recipient incentives may improve adherence to long-term treatments (low-certainty evidence), but it is uncertain whether they improve patient outcomes. One-time recipient incentives probably improve patient return for start or continuation of treatment (moderate-certainty evidence) and may improve return for tuberculosis test readings (low-certainty evidence). However, incentives may not improve completion of tuberculosis prophylaxis, and it is uncertain whether they improve completion of treatment for active tuberculosis. Conditional cash transfer programmes probably lead to an increase in service utilisation (moderate-certainty evidence), but their effects on health outcomes are uncertain. Vouchers may improve health service utilisation (low-certainty evidence), but the effects on health outcomes are uncertain (very low-certainty evidence). Introducing a restrictive cap may decrease use of medicines for symptomatic conditions and overall use of medicines, may decrease insurers' expenditures on medicines (low-certainty evidence), and has uncertain effects on emergency department use, hospitalisations, and use of outpatient care (very low-certainty evidence). Reference pricing, maximum pricing, and index pricing for drugs have mixed effects on drug expenditures by patients and insurers as well as the use of brand and generic drugs. Provider incentives: the effects of provider incentives are uncertain (very low-certainty evidence), including: the effects of provider incentives on the quality of care provided by primary care physicians or outpatient referrals from primary to secondary care, incentives for recruiting and retaining health professionals to serve in remote areas, and the effects of pay-for-performance on provider performance, the utilisation of services, patient outcomes, or resource use in low-income countries.

Authors' Conclusions

Research based on sound systematic review methods has evaluated numerous financial arrangements relevant to low-income countries, targeting different levels of the health systems and assessing diverse outcomes. However, included reviews rarely reported social outcomes, resource use, equity impacts, or undesirable effects. We also identified gaps in primary research because of uncertainty about applicability of the evidence to low-income countries. Financial arrangements for which the effects are uncertain include external funding (aid), caps and co-payments, pay-for-performance, and provider incentives. Further studies evaluating the effects of these arrangements are needed in low-income countries. Systematic reviews should include all outcomes that are relevant to decision-makers and to people affected by changes in financial arrangements.

Financial incentives for providers of health care

Policymakers also need to consider a range of targeted financial incentives that are intended to motivate specific behaviours. Incentives targeted at providers include pay‐for‐performance, budgets that reward providers for savings or penalise them for overspending, and incentives to practice in underserved areas or to select careers where there is a shortage of health professionals.

Financial incentives for recipients of health care

Incentives for recipients of care include financial incentives for specific types of behaviour (such as preventive behaviours), voucher schemes, and caps or co‐payments for drugs or services that are covered by health insurance.

How the intervention might work

Variations in financial arrangements may influence health and related goals by affecting access to care (e.g. by increasing the availability of resources and services), utilisation of care (e.g. by removing financial disincentives), quality of care (e.g. by paying for performance), equity (e.g. through progressive insurance fees or using tax revenues to pay for services for disadvantaged populations), and efficiency (e.g. by having higher co‐payments for services that are less cost‐effective, thereby deterring use of less cost‐effective services). However, as with any healthcare intervention, financial arrangements can have undesirable effects, and the desirable effects and savings of any option must be weighed against any undesirable effects and costs.

### Inequality of household consumption and air pollution-related deaths in China [^ee06ce0c]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Outdoor air pollution in China has caused more than 1 million premature deaths per year in recent years, and considerable research effort has thus been devoted to identifying its sources – and cost-effective mitigation options –. It is known that direct emissions from households (i.e. fuel combustion for home cooking, and/or independent heating) substantially contribute to the PM 2.5 pollution-related premature deaths in China. Yet household consumption may also indirectly impact human health via air pollution virtually embodied in goods and services consumed. and regional clean air policies which focus on direct sources may thus encourage leakage of polluting activities to other regions which may have less resources to control emissions and provide health services. Whereas previous studies have examined the embodied water use, energy consumption, and emissions – of regions' household consumption (including the roles of income, geography, culture, age, household size, regional policies –), no previous studies have quantified air pollution-related deaths embodied in household consumption. In addition to linking the locations of consumed goods to sources of air pollution, such a consumption-based accounting of air pollution deaths also requires tracking the physical transport of that pollution in the atmosphere and estimating the related deaths. Herein, we distinguish air pollution deaths related to emissions directly produced by a household from those related to emissions embodied in goods consumed by a household as direct and indirect, respectively.

Using a combination of four economic and physical models and province-level income and consumption statistics, we quantify the air pollution health impacts from both direct and indirect emissions of household consumption for 12 income groups (5 for rural and 7 for urban) over 30 provinces in mainland China. We use a detailed inventory for anthropogenic emissions in China (MEIC:), household consumption statistics, and a multi-regional input–output model of the Chinese economy to quantify direct and indirect pollutant emissions from household daily consumption by various income groups, and we then identify and isolate the contributions of these emissions to outdoor PM 2.5 -related premature deaths by using the GEOS-Chem adjoint model combined with the integrated exposure-response (IER) concentration-response relationships. Our work provide quantitative estimates of air pollution and related deaths attributed to household consumption from a consumption-based perspective and reveal their differences according to income levels and locations of the residents. The findings of this study provide implications on targeted and equitable air pollution mitigation plans in China.

### Demographic and socioeconomic factors affecting relative poverty level of older adults in Türkiye [^323eeaa4]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In our study, we intentionally used the median income instead of the mean income as a benchmark for calculating relative income. The rationale behind this choice is grounded in the literature that highlights the limitations of using the mean in the context of income distribution, especially in settings where income is highly skewed.

The mean income can be significantly affected by a small number of very high-income individuals, leading to a benchmark that does not represent the experience of the majority. On the other hand, the median income is more robust to outliers and provides a better reflection of the income level of a "typical" individual in the distribution. This makes it a more appropriate benchmark in studies focusing on perceived income inequality, subjective social status, and relative deprivation.

Consequently, the median value of the equivalent household disposable income per capita variable was calculated for all individuals in the Individual Registry dataset. The median takes the value in the middle when the entire population (or households) is ranked. Therefore, it feels the impact of extremely low or extremely high incomes much less than the average and more accurately reflects the "typical" income situation of the society.

The scope of this study is limited to older adults aged 60 and above residing within Türkiye.

Measures and variables

In its poverty studies, TurkStat uses ILCS data to set the income-based poverty threshold by using a certain percentage (40%, 50%) of the median equivalent income per capita. Previous studies have also established the income-based poverty threshold using 40% and 50% of the median equivalent income per capita. For this study, poverty levels, which will be used as dependent variables in all models, were constructed in line with these ratios. Households were grouped into three categories based on their income level relative to the median: below 40% of the median income (poorest group), between 40% and 50% of the median income (second poverty category), and above 50% of the median income (non-poor group). Households below 40% of the median are considered the poorest, whereas households above 50% of the median are considered non-poor. The generalized ordered logistic regression model is used in this study to examine the relationship between each poverty category and various factors in the ILCS dataset.

Measurement scales

Financial literacy

Currently, there is no single screening question to measure basic financial literacy, but longer validated measures exist. Several commonly used surveys, primarily the University of Michigan Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the RAND American Life Panel (ALP), have incorporated three items developed specifically to address financial literacy. These items are based on the four key components of financial capability, including short-term money management, future planning, managing financial products/services, and numeracy, all of which have been established as important skills for older adults' financial stability. However, the actual questions included in these surveys tend to focus more on very specific financial calculations or complex investing strategies rather than general concepts older adults need to understand in order to manage finances. To be relevant, these concepts should focus more specifically on, for instance, saving enough money for retirement and potential medical expenditures, planning for other unforeseen expenses or emergency savings, budgeting on a fixed income, and balancing living expenses including medical and drug insurance premiums. In addition, the items do not specifically address the key concerns of older adults when trying to manage their finances and pay for later-life expenses. For example, the first item of those used in the HRS and ALP, with five answer choices provided, reads: "Suppose you had $100 in a savings account and the interest rate was 2% per year. After 5 years, how much do you think you would have in the account if you left the money to grow?" The second item, also with five responses, reads: "Imagine that the interest rate on your savings account was 1% per year and inflation was 2% per year. After 1 year, how much would you be able to buy with the money in this account?" Finally, the third item is as follows: "Please tell me whether this statement is true or false. Buying a single company's stock usually provides a safer return than a stock mutual fund". Among Americans over age 50, only half answered the first two items correctly; only one-third answered all three items correctly. In fact, only 44% of those with a college degree could answer all three items correctly.

### Future savings from measles eradication in industrialized countries [^92155a3a]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Estimates are made of monetary savings associated with measles eradication in seven industrialized countries. Three scenarios were studied: First, changing from the present two-dose measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) immunization schedule to one-dose of MMR; second, the use of an MMR and mumps-rubella schedule; or third, continuing the present schedule. Results show that the largest savings (US $623 million) would be achieved by changing to a one-dose MMR schedule with an assumption of a 3% discount rate and measles eradication in 2010. The smallest overall savings would result from option 3, by use of a 5% discount rate and the assumption that measles eradication occurs in 2020 ($10 million). These savings are less than previously estimated for the United States, partly because of the assumption that measles vaccines will continue to be delivered in response to possible bioterrorism threats.

### Permanent standard time is the optimal choice for health and safety: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^45f08566]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Chronic effects of daylight saving time (DST) — naturalistic comparisons within single time zones where solar exposure differs indicate that an extra hour of evening natural light is linked to reduced sleep and other harms: in the United States, solar light/dark exposure differs by about 1 hour or more, an extra hour of natural light in the evening reduced sleep duration chronically by an average of 19 minutes and increased self-reported insufficient sleep; westward position shows increased cancer risk with even a 5° westward position, and economic models indicate productivity losses equivalent to 4.4 million lost days of work. Under DST, chronic misalignment between internal circadian timing and social schedules results in significant sleep differences between workdays and days off ("social jet lag"); adolescents and young adults are most impacted due to later bed/wake times and longer sleep needs, and persistent, augmented social jet lag and mood disturbance have been demonstrated with permanent DST, with those having an evening chronotype potentially more impacted.

### Household health care payments under rate setting, spending growth target, and single-payer policies [^feb7b180]. JAMA Health Forum (2024). High credibility.

Table 3 shows the mean and median payments as a share of compensation by payment type. In the status quo, mean OOP payments as a share of compensation decreased with increasing income. Below 1000% FPL, premium contributions were the largest portion of total payments on average. Tax payments for health care increased with income, reflecting the progressivity of tax schedules. Above 1000% FPL, mean tax payments were by far the largest portion of total payments as a share of compensation. In the rate setting scenario, there was a small shift from premium to tax payments relative to the status quo. In the spending growth target scenario, the types of payments were similar to those in the status quo. In the single-payer scenario, payments shifted primarily to tax payments, with relatively small OOP payments remaining and no premiums. As with the other scenarios, tax payments, based largely on existing progressive tax schedules, increased with income.

Table 3.
Household Health Care Payments as a Share of Compensation, by Type of Payment and Income

Abbreviations: FPL, federal poverty level; OOP, out of pocket.

With substantial variability in payments within the income groups, there were some households who paid more and some who paid less in each scenario relative to the status quo. Payment reductions in the rate setting and single-payer scenarios were more concentrated in the middle-income groups, whereas payment reductions from the spending growth target were more concentrated in higher-income groups (eFigure 3 in Supplement 1).

### Projected impacts of federal tax policy proposals on mortality burden in the United States: a microsimulation analysis [^4f3b10e1]. Preventive Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

4. Discussion

In this microsimulation analysis based on a U.S. nationally-representative sample of tax returns, the tax plans proposed by two 2016 U.S. Presidential candidates were predicted to yield relatively modest impacts on mortality compared to existing law. These projected impacts contrast in direction, with an anticipated increase in 29,689 deaths/ year from all causes under the Trump plan and decrease of 31,302 deaths/year from all causes under the Sanders plan. Under the modified Sanders tax plan that includes high income tax and capital gains and dividend rates in the top tax brackets, larger benefits to population health are projected — with a savings of 68,919 deaths/year from all causes. Across all tax plan scenarios, the strongest impacts on income inequality and mortality redistribution are anticipated to derive from the modified Sanders plan that includes redistribution from the wealthiest taxpayers — 333,504 lives saved/year, based on both a decrease in income inequality and an increase in absolute income through redistribution.

### Policy framework for covering preventive services without cost sharing: saving lives and saving money? [^cd689aca]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

The US Affordable Care Act mandates that private insurers cover a list of preventive services without cost sharing. The list is determined by 4 expert committees that evaluate the overall health effect of preventive services. We analyzed the process by which the expert committees develop their recommendations. Each committee uses different criteria to evaluate preventive services and none of the committees consider cost systematically. We propose that the existing committees adopt consistent evidence review methodologies and expand the scope of preventive services reviewed and that a separate advisory committee be established to integrate economic considerations into the final selection of free preventive services. The comprehensive framework and associated criteria are intended to help policy makers in the future develop a more evidence-based, consistent, and ethically sound approach.

### Differences over time in the relationship between partnership disruptions and support in early old age in britain [^f77a77aa]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

We examined variations over time in the relationship between past partnership disruption (due to divorce, separation, and death) and present support (coresidence with, help to and from, and contact with children) in early old age in Britain.

Methods

Employing data from the 2001/2 British Household Panel Survey and the 1988/9 Survey of Retirement and Retirement Plans, we investigated whether differences in support over time were due to changes in (a) the composition of the population (e.g., the percentage divorced) or (b) the strength of the covariates (e.g., the effect of divorce).

Result

Our findings showed an increase in the experience of partnership disruption in early old age. Nonetheless, the percentage of people who reported receiving and providing support increased. A comparison of the two points in time showed that there was little change in the effects of partnership disruptions on support in early old age.

Discussion

The fact that the level of support has remained stable or increased over time among this age group despite the increasing prevalence of divorce suggests that the negative effect of partnership disruption on support in early old age may be weakening over time.

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^5204208e]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Consider that when some medications are prescribed and adhered to, healthcare spending declines by lowering emergency admissions. Eleven such medications reduce emergency admissions by hundreds of thousands annually. These drugs essentially displace a non-genericizable service with a genericizable medicine, a logical way to save money in the long run, and yet, if one only scrutinizes the drug's temporary branded cost without considering the alternative of forever relying on emergency department services to manage patients, society could easily end up misallocating resources away from developing such a medicine. Reasons for not performing value assessments on hospital procedures may include a lack of randomized controlled trial data which are important inputs into cost-effectiveness analyses. However, this and other reasons are not insurmountable, and real-world data can provide important information on the effectiveness of an intervention potentially through time series analyses if comparators are not obvious. Comprehending the potential cost-effectiveness of all varieties of healthcare interventions is paramount for enhancing the efficiency of healthcare systems and optimizing the health of populations.

### Healthy workforce / healthy economy: the role of health, productivity, and disability management in addressing the nation's health care crisis: why an emphasis on the health of the workforce is vital to the health of the economy [^7f559fb8]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

ACOEM's Seven-Point Action Plan — financial incentives, integration with care models, and evaluation — specifies that "Financial incentives that will shift consumers and health care providers toward primary and secondary prevention should be designed and implemented", including to "offer employees and their dependents incentives to engage in prevention" and to "Redesign physician fee schedules" to support prevention and health management. It further states that "Preventive approaches should be integrated within new approaches to medical care delivery such as patient-centered physician-driven medical home models", and that "major efforts should be taken to evaluate their impact" with practical research to "document the precise value" and to "employ an evidence-based approach to guide continuous improvement and maximize the return on public investment".

### The relationship between gambling expenditure, socio-demographics, health-related correlates and gambling behaviour-a cross-sectional population-based survey in Finland [^6d97f3a4]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Gambling expenditure

Gambling expenditure (GE) was measured with only one question inquiring the overall expenditure: 'Roughly how much money do you spend on gambling in a typical week (€)?'. In cases where the respondent did not gamble weekly, the interviewer was instructed to encourage the respondent to give an estimate of their spending when they did gamble. Net income (NI) was assessed with the question: 'What is your monthly income after tax (i.e. disposable income). Please take into account all your sources of income (e.g. wages or salary, property income, pension and other social benefits)'. Past‐year weekly gambling expenditure (WGE), yearly gambling expenditure (YGE) and monthly gambling expenditure as a percentage of net income (MGE/NI) were derived based on past‐year (including 365.25 days) gambling frequency (F), as follows: (1) WGE, if past‐year gambling frequency was at least once a week, WGE = GE. If past‐year gambling frequency was less than once a week, WGE = F × GE/365.25 × 7, where (a) F = 30, if past‐year gambling frequency was two to three times a month, (b) F = 12, if past‐year gambling frequency was once a month and (c) F = 6, if past‐year gambling frequency was less than monthly; (2) YGE = WGE/7 × 365.25; and (3) MGE/NI = 100 × YGE/12 × NI, when NI > 0.

The highest WGE in the data set (€50 000) was replaced by the second highest WGE (€1500): it was more than 10 times the corresponding reported weekly net income and considered to be an outlier. Gambling expenditure was examined from three perspectives: expenditure share (in %), WGE (in €) and MGE/NI (in %).

Socio‐demographic variables

Socio‐demographic variables including age, marital status and education were derived from the population register, while data on employment status and net income were obtained from the participants (Table 1).

### How grid reinforcement costs differ by the income of electric vehicle users [^9ad7e939]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

If grid costs increase, the electricity price for all consumers is inflated, and electricity costs increase for all households. Due to their higher total electricity consumption and related higher electricity costs, higher-income neighborhoods carry more of the grid reinforcement costs in total. However, as they only consume 16–18% (based on the area type) more electricity than lower-income households, this contribution fails to offset the massive additional grid reinforcement costs caused. Furthermore, grid operators often split grid costs into a base rate in addition to a volumetric (per kWh) component. This base rate is not scaled with regards to consumption and hence further limits the grid cost contribution of higher-income households. With household electricity prices at a record high (32.63 cent/kWh in 2021 and quickly increasing during the European Energy Crisis in 2022 –), a further across-the-board electricity price increase to cover the additional grid reinforcement cost of higher-income neighborhoods could be considered inequitable with respect to the principle of fairness according to contribution. As this grid reinforcement cost asymmetry can be traced back to higher-income neighborhoods, equitable cost allocation would require higher-income households to fully bear this cost asymmetry, not affecting the electricity prices of other consumers. This effect could be aggravated further if grid operators decide to prioritize higher-income neighborhoods in their grid planning, potentially making some households pay higher electricity prices long before they can profit from more stable grids in their neighborhoods. Furthermore, this prioritization could lead to energy access equity issues between neighborhoods, as, for example, already observed in the case of solar photovoltaic systems in the United States.

However, it is important to note that the rationale for the mentioned potential inequitable cost allocation is not the difference in income between the two neighborhood types but the difference in usage of the electric distribution grid as a common public resource. According to the principle of fairness according to contribution (equity), households in a higher-income neighborhood should rather pay grid fees, which reflect the contribution to the grid reinforcement costs induced by them. We focus on mitigating policy actions directly related to households' grid cost impact, not socio-economic attributes such as income.

### Effectiveness of family-based behavioral intervention for smoking cessation in low-income households: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^627c66be]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to conventional smoking cessation strategies, behavioral counseling sessions in our included trials were designed to help families establish mutual support, encourage effective discussions, and set cessation goals. The intervention may be useful for low-income households, where smoking parents often had lower education levels and limited health resources. We observed a significant improvement in abstinence at the end of treatment (RR = 2.19, 12.1% vs. 5.2%). This may be attributed to key counselling components, including motivational interviewing techniques, individualized quit plans, and frequent counselor contact, which improved the short-term cessation outcomes. Such counseling might strengthen the communication of smoking parents, partner support and family relationships, leading to a longer term smoking cessation. Our subgroup analyses supported this explanation as family-based behavioral interventions were particularly effective for parents both smoked and during the 12-month follow-up period. Integrating structured home visits or community-based group sessions that include skill-building exercises, such as conflict resolution training and motivational interviewing tailored to both smokers and their non-smoking relatives should be considered in future research. To enhance accessibility and scalability, especially in the context of inflexible work schedules and limited access to in-person cessation services, the integration of digital tools, including shared progress-tracking applications, tailored SMS reminders, and virtual family support groups, may offer a alternative solution to extend support and sustain engagement in these underserved populations.

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^5eeb57a8]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Contemporary debates about drug pricing feature several widely held misconceptions, including the relationship between incentives and innovation, the proportion of total healthcare spending on pharmaceuticals, and whether the economic evaluation of a medicine can be influenced by things other than clinical efficacy.

Main body

All citizens should have access to timely, equitable, and cost-effective care covered by public funds, private insurance, or a combination of both. Better managing the collective burden of diseases borne by today's and future generations depends in part on developing better technologies, including better medicines. As in any innovative industry, the expectation of adequate financial returns incentivizes innovators and their investors to develop new medicines. Estimating expected returns requires that they forecast revenues, based on the future price trajectory and volume of use over time. How market participants decide what price to set or accept can be complicated, and some observers and stakeholders want to confirm whether the net prices society pays for novel medicines, whether as a reward for past innovation or an incentive for future innovation, are commensurate with those medicines' incremental value. But we must also ask "value to whom?"; medicines not only bring immediate clinical benefits to patients treated today, but also can provide a broad spectrum of short- and long-term benefits to patients, their families, and society. Spending across all facets of healthcare has grown over the last 25 years, but both inpatient and outpatient spending has outpaced drug spending growth even as our drug armamentarium is constantly improving with safer and more effective medicines. In large part, this is because, unlike hospitals, drugs typically go generic, thus making room in our budgets for new and better ones, even as they often keep patients out of hospitals, driving further savings.

Conclusion

A thorough evaluation of drug spending and value can help to promote a better allocation of healthcare resources for both the healthy and the sick, both of whom must pay for healthcare. Taking a holistic approach to assessing drug value makes it clear that a branded drug's value to a patient is often only a small fraction of the drug's total value to society. Societal value merits consideration when determining whether and how to make a medicine affordable and accessible to patients: a drug that is worth its price to society should not be rendered inaccessible to ill patients by imposing high out-of-pocket costs or restricting coverage based on narrow health technology assessments (HTAs). Furthermore, recognizing the total societal cost of un- or undertreated conditions is crucial to gaining a thorough understanding of what guides the biomedical innovation ecosystem to create value for society. It would be unwise to discourage the development of new solutions without first appreciating the cost of leaving the problems unsolved.

### Unconditional cash transfers for reducing poverty and vulnerabilities: effect on use of health services and health outcomes in low-and middle-income countries [^273b98c3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Unconditional cash transfers (UCTs; provided without obligation) for reducing poverty and vulnerabilities (e.g. orphanhood, old age or HIV infection) are a type of social protection intervention that addresses a key social determinant of health (income) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The relative effectiveness of UCTs compared with conditional cash transfers (CCTs; provided so long as the recipient engages in prescribed behaviours such as using a health service or attending school) is unknown.

Objectives

To assess the effects of UCTs for improving health services use and health outcomes in vulnerable children and adults in LMICs. Secondary objectives are to assess the effects of UCTs on social determinants of health and healthcare expenditure and to compare to effects of UCTs versus CCTs.

Search Methods

We searched 17 electronic academic databases, including the Cochrane Public Health Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (the Cochrane Library 2017, Issue 5), MEDLINE and Embase, in May 2017. We also searched six electronic grey literature databases and websites of key organisations, handsearched key journals and included records, and sought expert advice.

Selection Criteria

We included both parallel group and cluster-randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cohort and controlled before-and-after (CBAs) studies, and interrupted time series studies of UCT interventions in children (0 to 17 years) and adults (18 years or older) in LMICs. Comparison groups received either no UCT or a smaller UCT. Our primary outcomes were any health services use or health outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently screened potentially relevant records for inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We tried to obtain missing data from study authors if feasible. For cluster-RCTs, we generally calculated risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes from crude frequency measures in approximately correct analyses. Meta-analyses applied the inverse variance or Mantel-Haenszel method with random effects. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 21 studies (16 cluster-RCTs, 4 CBAs and 1 cohort study) involving 1,092,877 participants (36,068 children and 1,056,809 adults) and 31,865 households in Africa, the Americas and South-East Asia in our meta-analyses and narrative synthesis. The 17 types of UCTs we identified, including one basic universal income intervention, were pilot or established government programmes or research experiments. The cash value was equivalent to 1.3% to 53.9% of the annualised gross domestic product per capita. All studies compared a UCT with no UCT, and three studies also compared a UCT with a CCT. Most studies carried an overall high risk of bias (i.e. often selection and/or performance bias). Most studies were funded by national governments and/or international organisations. Throughout the review, we use the words 'probably' to indicate moderate-quality evidence, 'may/maybe' for low-quality evidence, and 'uncertain' for very low-quality evidence. UCTs may not have impacted the likelihood of having used any health service in the previous 1 to 12 months, when participants were followed up between 12 and 24 months into the intervention (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.09, P = 0.07, 5 cluster-RCTs, N = 4972, I² = 2%, low-quality evidence). At one to two years, UCTs probably led to a clinically meaningful, very large reduction in the likelihood of having had any illness in the previous two weeks to three months (odds ratio (OR) 0.73, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.93, 5 cluster-RCTs, N = 8446, I² = 57%, moderate-quality evidence). Evidence from five cluster-RCTs on food security was too inconsistent to be combined in a meta-analysis, but it suggested that at 13 to 24 months' follow-up, UCTs could increase the likelihood of having been food secure over the previous month (low-quality evidence). UCTs may have increased participants' level of dietary diversity over the previous week, when assessed with the Household Dietary Diversity Score and followed up 24 months into the intervention (mean difference (MD) 0.59 food categories, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.01, 4 cluster-RCTs, N = 9347, I² = 79%, low-quality evidence). Despite several studies providing relevant evidence, the effects of UCTs on the likelihood of being moderately stunted and on the level of depression remain uncertain. No evidence was available on the effect of a UCT on the likelihood of having died. UCTs probably led to a clinically meaningful, moderate increase in the likelihood of currently attending school, when assessed at 12 to 24 months into the intervention (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.09, 6 cluster-RCTs, N = 4800, I² = 0%, moderate-quality evidence). The evidence was uncertain for whether UCTs impacted livestock ownership, extreme poverty, participation in child labour, adult employment or parenting quality. Evidence from six cluster-RCTs on healthcare expenditure was too inconsistent to be combined in a meta-analysis, but it suggested that UCTs may have increased the amount of money spent on health care at 7 to 24 months into the intervention (low-quality evidence). The effects of UCTs on health equity (or unfair and remedial health inequalities) were very uncertain. We did not identify any harms from UCTs. Three cluster-RCTs compared UCTs versus CCTs with regard to the likelihood of having used any health services, the likelihood of having had any illness or the level of dietary diversity, but evidence was limited to one study per outcome and was very uncertain for all three.

Authors' Conclusions

This body of evidence suggests that unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) may not impact a summary measure of health service use in children and adults in LMICs. However, UCTs probably or may improve some health outcomes (i.e. the likelihood of having had any illness, the likelihood of having been food secure, and the level of dietary diversity), one social determinant of health (i.e. the likelihood of attending school), and healthcare expenditure. The evidence on the relative effectiveness of UCTs and CCTs remains very uncertain.

### Cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening using digital mammography in Canada… [^9d26f5ce]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Question What is the cost-effectiveness of digital mammographic screening for breast cancer. Findings In this economic evaluation, biennial screening at ages 40 to 74 years was a cost-saving public health intervention, with CAD$49 759 saved per death averted, $1558 saved per life-year saved, and $2007 saved per quality-adjusted life-year gained, compared with biennial screening at ages 50 to 74 years. Objective To determine the cost-effectiveness of population-based breast cancer screening in the context of current treatment standards. Design, Setting, and Participants In this economic evaluation, the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer/Statistics Canada OncoSim-Breast microsimulation model was used to estimate the impact of various screening schedules in terms of clinical outcomes and treatment costs. Breast cancer treatment costs were derived from activity-based costing published in 2023 specific to a publicly funded health system in Ontario, Canada.

A single birth cohort of individuals assigned female at birth in 1975 was modeled until death or age 99 years. Exposures Five screening scenarios were modeled: no screening, biennial, hybrid, and annual screening. Main Outcomes and Measures. in women from minoritized racial and ethnic groups. 8 In Canada, many provinces and territories have screening programs starting at age 40 years9; however, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care does not recommend systematic screening for BC for individuals aged 40 to 49 years at average risk. 10 Although the USPSTF and Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care differ on their recommendations, neither included economic analyses in their guidelines. We also show the 2024 USPSTF recommended strategy of biennial screening from ages 40 to 74 years is cost-savings from the health system perspective.

This work highlights the importance of public health and funders regularly assessing updated cost-effectiveness when evaluating the risks and benefits of population-based screening programs. The cost of cancer management is likely going to continue to increase14; accordingly, BC diagnosis at earlier stages, when management costs are less, will be increasingly important. Organized BC screening programs enable earlier detection of BC, improving clinical outcomes while simultaneously minimizing treatment burden and costs, thereby improving health equity.

### Inequality of household water security follows a development kuznets curve [^515e8b91]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Relationships between water security and socioeconomic conditions

The results of the regression models (Fig. 4; see Supplementary Table 6 for details) were consistent with H3, demonstrating a positive relationship between water security and socioeconomic conditions. Socioeconomic standing and income were correlated at both the site (p = 0.018; see Fig. 4a) and household (p < 0.001; see Fig. 4d) levels, but they performed differently in the linear models with water security. SES had a linear relationship with both SWS at the site level (p = 0.002; see Fig. 4b) and HWS (p < 0.001; see Fig. 4e) at the household level. The relationship between SWS and INC, however, was not significant (p = 0.470; see Fig. 4c) according to the linear regression model at the site level. Although there was an observed linear relationship between HWS and INC h at the household level (p < 0.001; see Fig. 4f), it had a low R-squared value (0.013).

### The diabetes health plan and healthcare utilization among beneficiaries with low incomes [^65d59fe5]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In 2009, UnitedHealthCare (UHC) introduced the DHP which includes financial incentives to encourage patient engagement in evidence-based diabetes care, including reduced or eliminated out-of-pocket patient expenses for disease management visits; free diabetes self-monitoring training and supplies; and reduced or eliminated out-of-pocket expenses for diabetes-related medicines (Table 1). The DHP also provides access to diabetes-specific telephone case management as well as other online resources. Additionally, the DHP provides scorecards with reminders to complete health maintenance activities, such as biannual hemoglobin A1C and cholesterol screening and an annual retinal eye exam. Overall, the DHP provides between $150 and 500 in annual out-of-pocket savings for enrollees. The DHP standard benefit design can be modified by purchasing employers to better suit the needs of beneficiaries, which include both employees and their dependents. Uptake of the DHP, across employers, has spanned the years since 2009 and varied across years. Some employers use an opt-in enrollment strategy (employees must choose to participate) while others use an opt-out strategy (all eligible employees enrolled initially). Studies have shown that DHP uptake can range from a low of 8% among opt-in plans to a high of 85% for opt-out plans. Additionally, studies have shown variability in the demographic characteristics of DHP participants as a consequence of the enrollment strategy. Specifically, Kimbro et al. found that DHP participants enrolled in an opt-out plan were more likely to be dependents, were more racially and ethnically diverse, and had a broader range of incomes and educational backgrounds relative to participants enrolled in opt-in plans, who tended to have higher incomes and more education and who were less likely to be Hispanic. Studies have previously demonstrated the beneficial impact of the DHP on medication adherence and emergency room utilization among the broader cohort of beneficiaries. However, the results of studies examining the effects of the DHP among low-income beneficiaries have been mixed. Huang et al. found no relationship between the DHP and medication adherence among beneficiaries with household incomes of $50,000 or less. While Narain et al. found that the DHP was associated with improved adherence to oral hypoglycemic medications among beneficiaries with household incomes $30,000 or less and low baseline medication adherence.

### "I had bills to pay": a mixed-methods study on the role of income on care transitions in a public-payer healthcare system [^b9d159da]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Varying Levels of Adapting and Being Resourceful

Several patients spoke of the transition back to normalcy following discharge, voicing concerns over employment, leading to some patients adapting by prioritizing finances over their health. A patient noted, "On one hand, I feel like I shouldn't be rushing that much to get back to work, but on the other hand I have clients that need followed up on and if I don't follow up on them, then someone else will and I lose out on the commission" (08, patient, income unknown). The fear of losing employment or income made the respondent claim that "I was still calling some of them from the hospital". (08, patient, income unknown).

Patients also adapted through supplementing public system support with caregiver support, private services, and through other various means such as budgeting or saving equipment for future use. For instance, one respondent voiced, "Thank God I have a sister who helps me. Because like when I first came home, I couldn't do anything" (07, low-income patient). Whereas, other patients sought private services to meet their needs, as one patient claimed, "No, its private [physiotherapy], at [a different location]. I wouldn't go back to [name of hospital he was an inpatient], let's put it this way". (16, higher income patient). Similarly, some patients found it helpful to budget to stretch their income to ensure all necessities are paid for, to hold on to equipment that was expensive in case it was needed later, or to choose cheaper food options in order to keep costs down. "I've been sorting out money, making sure I have enough money in the bank to pay the rent" (04, higher income patient). Not all patients were able to adapt, with some just accepting it, and as a result, described the transition process as, "I am having a hard time [coping] with everything if I am honest with you" (05, patient, income unknown). Support from family, friends, or community members was more commonly reported among individuals with low income or those who preferred not to respond to income category than individuals in the higher income group. Individuals in the lower income group often mentioned not worrying about having money to pay for medications due to government subsidies.

### U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: rate review… [^aae0532a]. aspe.hhs.gov (2013). Low credibility.

An analysis from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation of rate review activities in calendar year 2012 shows that the rate review process saved consumers approximately $1. 2 billion on their premiums when compared to the amount initially requested by insurers. These savings accrued to 6. 8 million people. This report analyzes both the rate review process and rate review grant activities, which are programs initiated by the Affordable Care Act to ensure that consumers get value for their premium dollars. Due to limitations of the data submitted by certain states, this report extrapolates from an analysis of data from 39 states in the individual market and 35 states in the small group market to estimate national savings on premiums in the individual and small group markets.

Background Rate Review Grants The Affordable Care Act authorizes the Secretary to award grants to states for the purpose of improving their review of proposed rates in the individual and small group health insurance markets. Estimates of Savings by State for Rates Proposed at 10 Percent or Higher In figure 5, savings by state are estimated using the Rate Review Justification data submitted to CCIIO for CY 2012. Note that RRJ data differs from the Rate Review Grant data in that RRJ data only includes rate increase requests of 10 percent or more and thus represents a subset of the $1. 2 billion in savings previously described. The estimated savings, which include both the individual and small group markets, are calculated by taking the difference between the average requested rate increase, and the average approved rate increase, weighted by covered lives, for each filing that had a modification, rejection, or withdrawal.

This method assumes that each enrollee in these plans paid the statewide average premium for the year which is a limitation of the analysis. As with the individual market analysis, the small group savings estimates includes data from the reporting states on all rate increases, even those below 10 percent, in the small group market and assumes that the difference will be similar in the states that did not report data. Some additional data from several state websites were used to revise the RRG data. 12 Savings estimates from the Annual Reports published in 2012 and 2013 are not cumulative because there is some overlap in the data. 13 For instance, if a rate filing contained documentation of an approved rate increase, but the submission did not indicate the amount of the requested increase, it was assumed that the missing rate change was the same as the rate change listed.

### COVID-19 vaccine uptake in Sk å ne county, Sweden, in relation to individual-level and area-level sociodemographic factors: a register-based cross-sectional analysis [^f105c85f]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Results in relation to previous studies

The previous research into COVID-19 vaccine uptake beyond single or second dose is limited but consistent with our findings. A recent study from Norway reported clear differences in vaccine uptake for two doses but also three or more booster doses regarding disposable household income and educational level. Further, a study performed in the US state of Massachusetts showed that first dose and subsequent booster dose was greater in areas with higher income and education and was lower in areas with a greater percentage of Black, Latino and indigenous adults. Additionally, among a specific population of healthcare workers in Wales, booster dose vaccine uptake was consistently lower among black healthcare workers, as well as those from deprived areas. These studies are in line with our results, with lower probability of booster vaccine among individuals with the lowest level of education, lowest disposable household income and those born outside of Sweden as well as in the areas with a low socioeconomic standing. Differences to consider between the studies are that in Massachusetts, in March 2022, a vaccine equity plan was put in place in attempt to encourage and inform the public particularly younger people about booster doses. Whereas, in Wales, the time period of 6 months post second dose was reduced to 3 months to encourage faster booster vaccination. In relation to these similar studies, what we have been able to add is the combination of individual-level and area-level socioeconomic status (SES) factors and the comparison of not just joining the vaccination programme but staying in the programme for booster doses. Among individual-level factors, we report both household disposable income and education were associated with vaccine uptake in line with a study from Canada, which demonstrated a clear gradient in vaccine uptake in relation to disposable household incomeand from Denmark, the lowest level of disposable income was associated with the lower odds of vaccination. In the same study from Denmark, the lowest level of education was also associated with lower odds of vaccination. In a study from Russia, the probability of vaccination for a person with high education was 24 percentage points higher than for a person with only general secondary education. We report that compared with individuals with the lowest level of education (primary), individuals with the highest level of education (tertiary) had a six percentage point greater and eight percentage point greater probability of being vaccinated with at least two or three or more doses, respectively, suggesting that the education disparities regarding vaccine uptake are lower in Sweden compared with Russia. Education has further been shown to be an important predictor of vaccine uptake in a US population study, with increasing odds of vaccination with higher levels of education. Similarly, we report the importance of education for vaccine uptake in our study; however, disposable household income may be an even stronger predictor. This notion may contrast a study from Norway which suggests education as the strongest predictor of SES.

### Household catastrophic health expenditure: a multicountry analysis [^14a9f6d5]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

Health policy makers have long been concerned with protecting people from the possibility that ill health will lead to catastrophic financial payments and subsequent impoverishment. Yet catastrophic expenditure is not rare. We investigated the extent of catastrophic health expenditure as a first step to developing appropriate policy responses.

Methods

We used a cross-country analysis design. Data from household surveys in 59 countries were used to explore, by regression analysis, variables associated with catastrophic health expenditure. We defined expenditure as being catastrophic if a household's financial contributions to the health system exceed 40% of income remaining after subsistence needs have been met.

Findings

The proportion of households facing catastrophic payments from out-of-pocket health expenses varied widely between countries. Catastrophic spending rates were highest in some countries in transition, and in certain Latin American countries. Three key preconditions for catastrophic payments were identified: the availability of health services requiring payment, low capacity to pay, and the lack of prepayment or health insurance.

Interpretation

People, particularly in poor households, can be protected from catastrophic health expenditures by reducing a health system's reliance on out-of-pocket payments and providing more financial risk protection. Increase in the availability of health services is critical to improving health in poor countries, but this approach could raise the proportion of households facing catastrophic expenditure; risk protection policies would be especially important in this situation.

The page emphasizes that ensuring equitable access to guideline‑based asthma care across the life span is critical to reduce health disparities and calls for a concerted effort by local communities, public health officials, health care providers, insurers, and payors to improve access and quality of care, expand equitable access to medications (especially biologics), leverage telemedicine, develop networks for the underserved, and deliver home care to the needy elderly to help achieve equity of care.

### Estimating total spending by source of funding on routine and supplementary immunisation activities in low-income and middle-income countries, 2000–17: a financial modelling study [^38d4f81d]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Childhood immunisation is one of the most cost-effective health interventions. However, despite its known value, global access to vaccines remains far from complete. Although supply-side constraints lead to inadequate vaccine coverage in many health systems, there is no comprehensive analysis of the funding for immunisation. We aimed to fill this gap by generating estimates of funding for immunisation disaggregated by the source of funding and the type of activities in order to highlight the funding landscape for immunisation and inform policy making.

Methods

For this financial modelling study, we estimated annual spending on immunisations for 135 low-income and middle-income countries (as determined by the World Bank) from 2000 to 2017, with a focus on government, donor, and out-of-pocket spending, and disaggregated spending for vaccines and delivery costs, and routine schedules and supplementary campaigns. To generate these estimates, we extracted data from National Health Accounts, the WHO-UNICEF Joint Reporting Forms, comprehensive multi-year plans, databases from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's 2019 development assistance for health database. We estimated total spending on immunisation by aggregating the government, donor, prepaid private, and household spending estimates.

Findings

Between 2000 and 2017, funding for immunisation totalled US$112·4 billion (95% uncertainty interval 108·5–118·5). Aggregated across all low-income and middle-income countries, government spending consistently remained the largest source of funding, providing between 60·0% (57·7–61·9) and 79·3% (73·8–81·4) of total immunisation spending each year (corresponding to between $2·5 billion [2·3–2·8] and $6·4 billion [6·0–7·0] each year). Across income groups, immunisation spending per surviving infant was similar in low-income and lower-middle-income countries and territories, with average spending of $40 (38–42) in low-income countries and $42 (39–46) in lower-middle-income countries, in 2017. In low-income countries and territories, development assistance made up the largest share of total immunisation spending (69·4% [64·6–72·0]; $630·2 million) in 2017. Across the 135 countries, we observed higher vaccine coverage and increased government spending on immunisation over time, although in some countries, predominantly in Latin America and the Caribbean and in sub-Saharan Africa, vaccine coverage decreased over time, while spending increased.

Interpretation

These estimates highlight the progress over the past two decades in increasing spending on immunisation. However, many challenges still remain and will require dedication and commitment to ensure that the progress made in the previous decade is sustained and advanced in the next decade for the Immunization Agenda 2030.

### Banking for health: opportunities in cooperation between banking and health applying innovation from other sectors [^86f91362]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Figure 5
Features of new instruments in health financing.

The key challenge for incorporating health criteria is that products need to be created which link the potential financial benefits to those financing, or facilitating the financing, of the project. It is clear that benefits accrue to society as a whole or to reducing government health spending, depending on the structure of the health financing system in the country of investment. However, to increase private sector involvement we need to be innovative in creating opportunities for double bottom line returns from these investments and allowing profit to accrue to the providers of finance.

On the debt side, government or multilateral agency incentives could be envisaged in the form of guarantees to encourage private sector participation. On the investment fund side, fiscal incentives could be envisaged as we see in some countries, which offer lower tax rates for investors in innovation through venture capital or other collective investment instruments.

Climate change mitigation often goes hand in hand with energy saving measures, that is, direct cost saving potential, or was encouraged by the creation of the carbon trading scheme. Thus, investing in a green project brings direct economic benefits to the company that seeks investment. Such arguments might be harder to make for health more broadly where the health status of individuals depends significantly on social and environmental factors. It is also difficult to differentiate growth in the health industry — for example, increased use of certain medications — from its impact on population health.

However, this very impact on overall population health is an added benefit, a positive externality, of sustainable global health investment. This can be most easily seen today in focused areas such as vaccine development. Further research should focus on additional concrete investment opportunities that could be created from putting into practice the principles outlined in this paper.

Although physicians enjoy extensive educational backgrounds, financial planning typically is not a significant component of the curricula they have completed. As a result, many physicians could benefit from greater financial acumen, and their preparation for retirement might be lacking in light of their relatively high-income levels. This article by a private wealth advisor with 29 years of industry experience provides physicians with the basic building blocks to understand and manage their finances. It focuses on 3 pillars of financial planning: (1) protecting themselves, their families, and their assets; (2) reducing their taxes; and (3) growing their wealth.

### A cost-of-illness analysis of β-thalassaemia major in children in sri lanka-experience from a tertiary level teaching hospital [^17c266e3]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

The true economic impact of a disease must consider factors beyond health related expenditures, such as family coping strategies and impact on future livelihood. In severe poverty, where a household struggles to achieve minimum food or fuel levels, even a small change (e.g. the loss of 1 day's wage) may have substantial implications for the wellbeing of the whole household requiring drastic coping strategies. Family strategies often aim to maintain short-term economic sustainability for the household but the selling of assets or borrowing of money to help with treatment clearly generate future challenges and costs. The relatively low levels of household income in our study resulted in about 1 in 4 households experiencing catastrophic costs (> 10% of total income). Of the 5 families who took out a loan to help cover the costs of thalassaemia, 4 were from family or neighbours exemplifying the bonding / bridging forms of social capital, and the greater need for the poorest families to utilise family networks and assets compared to families with more resources. To further understand the complex dynamics of household expenditure on healthcare and the impact of lost schooling for individuals, longitudinal in-depth quantitative and qualitative research that assesses expenditure and future income implications is needed. A greater understanding of coping methods and how assets are mobilised is necessary to assess the impact on household livelihoods. We found out-of-pocket costs were not associated with household income (Pearson coefficient 0.21, p -value 0.20). Since the out-of-pocket payments contained mainly transport and food costs, the observed correlation was not unexpected. Our results indicate that there are discrepancies between household cost burden across income quartiles, despite the free medical care available in Sri Lanka. However, we were unable to adequately investigate spending patterns and no data were collected on household's ability to pay for basic needs after the cost of healthcare had been taken out. Studies that explore how households prioritise expenditure, how they perceive basic needs, and the factors which underpin inequality and financial protection would help generate a more complete picture.

### Financial arrangements for health systems in low-income countries: an overview of systematic reviews [^112b22bb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

We used the methods described below in all four overviews of health system arrangements and implementation strategies in low‐income countries (Ciapponi 2014; Herrera 2014; Pantoja 2014).

Criteria for considering reviews for inclusion

We included systematic reviews that:

had a Methods section with explicit selection criteria;
assessed the effects of financial arrangements (as defined in Background);
reported at least one of the following types of outcomes: patient outcomes (health and health behaviours), the quality or utilisation of healthcare services, resource use, healthcare provider outcomes (such as sick leave), or social outcomes (such as poverty, employment, or financial burden of patients, e.g. out‐of‐pocket payment, catastrophic disease expenditure);
were relevant to low‐income countries as classified by the World Bank (World Bank 2016);
were published after April 2005.

Judging relevance to low‐income countries is sometimes difficult, and we are aware that evidence from high‐income countries is not directly generalisable to low‐income countries. We based our judgments on an assessment of the likelihood that the financial arrangements considered in a review address a problem that is important in low‐income countries, would be feasible, and would be of interest to decision‐makers in low‐income countries, regardless of where the included studies took place. So, for example, we excluded arrangements requiring technology that is not widely available in low‐income countries. At least two of the overview authors made judgments about the relevance to low‐income countries and discussed with the other authors whenever there was uncertainty. We excluded reviews that only included studies from a single high‐income country due to concerns about the wider applicability of the findings of such reviews. However, we included reviews with studies from high‐income countries only if the interventions were relevant for low‐income countries.

We excluded reviews published before April 2005 as these were highly unlikely to be up‐to‐date. We also excluded reviews with methodological limitations important enough to compromise the reliability of the findings.

### Optimal allocation strategies for HPV vaccination introduction and expansion in China accommodated to different supply and dose schedule scenarios: a modelling study [^945e7234]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

A key barrier to cervical cancer elimination in China is low human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine uptake, which is limited by supply constraints, high prices, and restriction to two/three-dose schedule. We explored optimal vaccination strategies for maximizing health and economic benefits accommodated to different supply and dose schedules.

Methods

We evaluated different HPV vaccine strategies under 4 scenarios with different assumptions about vaccine availability and dose schedules. Each strategy involved different vaccine types, target ages, and modes of delivery. We used a previously validated transmission model to assess the health impact (cervical cancer cases averted), efficiency (number of doses needed to be given to prevent one case of cervical cancer [NND]), and value for money (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] and return on investment [ROI]) of different strategies in Chinese females over a 100-year time horizon. All costs are expressed in 2021 dollars. We adopted a societal perspective and discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs and benefits by 3% annually for cost-effectiveness analysis and ROI calculation.

Findings

In a supply-constrained and on-label use scenario, compared with no vaccination, two-dose routine vaccination of 14-year-olds would be the optimal, cost-saving strategy for a future national program (NNDs: 150–220, net cost saving: $15 164 million–$22 034 million, ROIs: 7–14, depending on vaccine type). If the one-dose schedule recommended by WHO is permitted in China, then reallocating the second dose from the routine cohorts to add a catch-up vaccination at 20-year-olds would be the most efficient strategy (NNDs: 73–107), and would be cost-saving compared with routine one-dose vaccination only (net cost saving: $4127 million–$6035 million, ROIs: 19–37). When supply constraints are lifted, scaling up vaccination in older females to 26 years could further expand the health benefits and still be cost-saving compared to maintaining the optimal vaccination strategy in the supply-constrained context.

Interpretation

Our study provides timely evidence for the current and future HPV vaccination strategy planning in China, and may also be of value to other countries with supply and dose restrictions.

### Using the demographic health survey wealth index to create family planning market segments based on absolute income levels [^866e3090]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Family planning market segmentation approaches typically include analysis by wealth, particularly when considering whether individuals can afford out-of-pocket expenses in the private sector. Most commonly, this is done using the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) wealth index, which uses a relative approach by summing household asset questions and categorising respondents into five groups from poorest to wealthiest within a country. In addition, the use of absolute measures, such as segmenting populations based on whether one lives below or above the International Poverty line, defined by the World Bank as US$1.90 per person per day, may provide further useful insights when designing strategies to ensure access to family planning. While such measures are not readily available in the DHS, a simple approach can be used to combine the wealth index and World Bank poverty lines to generate an absolute measure for an additional perspective when conducting family planning market segmentation. Family planning market size estimates were made for 24 low-income countries using wealth quintiles and World Bank poverty lines. The results show large variations in market size based on what measure is used, particularly for countries with a high density of poverty. Looking at both types of measures and understanding the reasons for the differences in market size estimates between the approaches can help lend a more nuanced understanding of the distribution of wealth and income in a country, leading to improved family planning market segmentation and ultimately to ensure more women have access to a method of their choice.

### Shift schedule with fewer short daily rest periods and sickness absence among health care workers: a cluster randomized clinical trial [^f0999dfd]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Sickness-related absence rates are high and increasing in the health care sector, leading to productivity loss and financial costs for both employers and society. The World Health Organization projects a shortage of 10 million health care workers by 2030, with global challenges in workforce availability, deployment, and retention. This projected shortage highlights the need for effective strategies to reduce sickness-related absence and safeguard the health of health care workers. Given the substantial financial burden that sickness-related absence places on hospital budgets as well as the broader societal costs, it is important to evaluate whether reducing short daily rest periods is cost-saving, in line with general recommendations for economic evaluations of organizational interventions.

The aim of this cluster-randomized clinical trial was to assess the effect of a work schedule designed to reduce the occurrence of short daily rest periods compared with a shift schedule that maintained the usual number of short daily rest periods, using objective sickness-related absence data as the primary outcome, and to calculate the potential cost-benefit of the intervention.

### Rethinking the cost of healthcare in low-resource settings: the value of time-driven activity-based costing [^9a493bf6]. BMJ Global Health (2016). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Traditional costing approaches in low-resource settings have been able to do little more than provide an average cost per patient. However, as health systems expand, understanding the cost of care for the individual patient's medical condition is essential for process improvement, standardisation, efficient care delivery and value-based payment systems. As governments and providers consider cost controls, fine-tuning the system to reduce inefficiencies and unwanted variation may prove more responsive than wide-scale reductions in staffing and medicine. Moreover, as low-income and middle-income countries strive towards universal health coverage, the ability to synthesise demographic and burden of disease information with robust cost analytics will enable financial planning and financing that is empirically justified.

### Socioeconomic status and metabolic syndrome in southwest iran: results from hoveyzeh cohort study (HCS) [^81879be7]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Studies on the association between socioeconomic status and diseases are prevalent. In this study, we examined four important indicators that determine economic status. Education is a good indicator of social position in epidemiological studies. It is often seen as the easier way of measuring present socioeconomic status because it precedes other indicators, such as income or occupational-based social position. The univariate results showed a significant inverse relationship between education level and MetS. The illiterate group had the highest prevalence, but this relationship was not significant after controlling the confounders in multivariable regression analysis. This finding is consistent with some results from other studies.

Household wealth includes income, savings, and all marketable assets because it captures all household members' personal and intergenerational capital and assets over time. Continuing material security associated with wealth can benefit health through a sense of protection, autonomy, and prestige. In our study, participants in higher wealth quintiles had more MetS than the poorest groups. However, the relationship between the wealth index and MetS was not statistically significant. Conversely, in a similar study, the relationship between the wealth index and MetS was statistically significant. They reported that the prevalence of MetS in the poorest group was higher than in the other groups.

After adjusting for confounder factors, our study results showed a statistically significant relationship between skill level and MetS. The results indicated that the odds of having MetS were lower in skill levels one and four. These can be due to higher physical activity and less obesity in participants with skill level one, namely manual workers, and greater awareness about risk factors and a more proper lifestyle in managers belonging to skill level four. In a similar study, the occupational subgroups, equipment, machine operation, and assembling workers group showed the highest prevalence of the MetS, the same as our finding. Still, unlike our results, "managers" had a high rate of MetS. Also, similar to our study, they demonstrated that manual workers were significantly less likely to have the MetS than non-manual workers.

In this study, the inverse relationship between the Townsend deprivation index and MetS was statistically significant in multiple logistic regression analyses. In contrast to our findings, Yanan Qiao showed that the Townsend deprivation index was strongly associated with a MetS so that in the residences of the most deprived area, the prevalence of MetS was higher in the most affluent area.

### Policy and planning for large epidemics and pandemics-challenges and lessons learned from COVID-19 [^3de35596]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Although such structural and political changes may be replicable globally, providing the required financial resources may be challenging, particularly in countries that currently spend less than the WHO benchmark of 5% of GDP on health, many of which also risk being saddled with debt from the pandemic response. Wealthy countries also generally have low-interest rates that make servicing debt more manageable.

It may be possible to increase domestic fiscal space for health in LMICs through increasing efficiency of collection of tax revenues and, to a lesser extent, reprioritizing public sector budgets and improving the technical efficiency of programs. Such measures will be essential to increase public sector investment in health, creating the conditions required for a more expansive whole-of-health approach to GHS. Countries must also develop the decision-making processes needed to channel additional financial impetus into areas that serve the multiple objectives of improving public health at local and regional levels, including universal health coverage, while strengthening broader GHS.

At the international level, COVID-19 has unmasked important gaps in global financing for pandemic preparedness, so much so that the G20 has now established a high-level independent panel on this issue. In addition to assuring sufficient magnitude, funds must not be overly 'earmarked' or funneled through fragmented bureaucratic systems that impede the required flexibility to address inherently unpredictable emerging diseases. At present, several overlapping financial mechanisms exist for pandemic preparedness, with funds variably contributed, often through intermediaries, from governments, charities, philanthropists, and the private sector. Perhaps the most well-known is the WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies, operating in parallel to, and to some extent competing with, other funds, such as the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund.

With an increase in global health investment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, financial flows may further increase in complexity. Mitigating the potential diseconomies of scale arising from overlapping and inefficient financing mechanisms will be key to maintaining sustainable political and financial commitment to pandemic preparedness. Strengthening coordination across agencies will be essential, such as the new COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund that brings UNICEF, WHO, and donors together into a single financial platform to serve a unified goal, with similar principles applying to the COVAX Facility. Lastly, significant questions remain regarding the optimal approach to harnessing private sector funds for the public good, including pandemic preparedness.

### Comparison of diabetes medications used by adults with commercial insurance vs Medicare advantage, 2016 to 2019 [^67e38f67]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

We hypothesize that some of the differences in the use of GLP-1RA, SGLT2i, and DPP-4i medications may be associated with affordability because all are costly brand-name medications. Patients with Medicare Advantage plans are ineligible for manufacturer savings cards and, at some point during the year, may face a "donut hole" with limited or no prescription drug coverage, both of which may make out-of-pocket cost-sharing expenses more unaffordable for them than for commercial insurance enrollees. A total of 40.2% of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries in the present cohort had an annual household income below $40 000 compared with 18.6% of commercial beneficiaries, and lower incomes were significantly associated with decreased the odds of initiating GLP-1RA and SGLT2i treatment. We did not observe a consistent association between income and initiation of DPP-4i treatment, however, potentially because DPP-4i medications are less costly than GLP-1RA and SGLT2i medications even if they are more expensive than generic alternatives. Lower income is associated with worse glycemic control and diabetes-related health outcomes compared with higher incomes, and financial barriers to optimal pharmacotherapy may contribute to these differences.

Limitations

This study has limitations. It relied on data from commercial insurance and Medicare Advantage plans offered by a single, large, national health insurance company, which allowed for direct comparisons between commercial insurance and Medicare Advantage plans, but results may not generalize to other private and public health plans. Our analyses focused on initiation of medication rather than adherence and persistence, and as such, our findings likely underestimate the association of cost-related barriers with evidence-based medication use. We were unable to capture medications obtained as samples or through manufacturer financial assistance programs, which may underestimate the use of costly medications, particularly among individuals in lower-income households. We were also unable to identify the clinical contexts (including hemoglobin A 1c level) and shared decision-making conversations between patients and their clinicians that may have affected medication choice and differed between commercial insurance plan and Medicare Advantage enrollees. Thus, these findings suggest the need for better understanding of factors contributing to treatment decisions and efforts to improve affordability and equity in the use of glucose-lowering therapies by all patients with diabetes.

### Optimal allocation strategies for HPV vaccination introduction and expansion in China accommodated to different supply and dose schedule scenarios: a modelling study [^35266b2e]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

A key barrier to cervical cancer elimination in China is low human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine uptake, which is limited by supply constraints, high prices, and restriction to two/three-dose schedule. We explored optimal vaccination strategies for maximizing health and economic benefits accommodated to different supply and dose schedules.

Methods

We evaluated different HPV vaccine strategies under 4 scenarios with different assumptions about vaccine availability and dose schedules. Each strategy involved different vaccine types, target ages, and modes of delivery. We used a previously validated transmission model to assess the health impact (cervical cancer cases averted), efficiency (number of doses needed to be given to prevent one case of cervical cancer [NND]), and value for money (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] and return on investment [ROI]) of different strategies in Chinese females over a 100-year time horizon. All costs are expressed in 2021 dollars. We adopted a societal perspective and discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs and benefits by 3% annually for cost-effectiveness analysis and ROI calculation.

Findings

In a supply-constrained and on-label use scenario, compared with no vaccination, two-dose routine vaccination of 14-year-olds would be the optimal, cost-saving strategy for a future national program (NNDs: 150–220, net cost saving: $15 164 million-$22 034 million, ROIs: 7–14, depending on vaccine type). If the one-dose schedule recommended by WHO is permitted in China, then reallocating the second dose from the routine cohorts to add a catch-up vaccination at 20-year-olds would be the most efficient strategy (NNDs: 73–107), and would be cost-saving compared with routine one-dose vaccination only (net cost saving: $4127 million-$6035 million, ROIs: 19–37). When supply constraints are lifted, scaling up vaccination in older females to 26 years could further expand the health benefits and still be cost-saving compared to maintaining the optimal vaccination strategy in the supply-constrained context.

Interpretation

Our study provides timely evidence for the current and future HPV vaccination strategy planning in China, and may also be of value to other countries with supply and dose restrictions.

### The cost of electrifying all households in 40 sub-saharan African countries by 2030 [^00ca3fd3]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Fig. 2
Electrification cost curves and cost-optimal approaches.

a Electrification LCOE curve for SSA by tier. b Electrification cost per person per day curve for SSA by tier. Dashed lines show maximum costs for Tier 2 and Tier 3. c Cost-optimal electrification approach for SSA by tier. X-axis show ventiles (5% increments) of the population to be electrified by 2030 in SSA. Each ventile represents ca. 47.6 million people with a total to-be electrified population of 952 million people. Note that this number is larger than the currently unelectrified population because it includes population growth.

While above we focused on Tier 3, we next compare the electricity cost curves considering all three electrification approaches for three demand levels (Tier 2 to 4) as the literature has already shown large differences across tiers. Figure 2 shows the LCOE (2a), the cost per person per day (2b) and the shares for each electrification option (2c) for each 5% increment of the unelectrified population in SSA. Generally, lower tier electrification results in higher LCOEs because the capital investment is high in relation to the electricity output over the lifetime of the asset. Put differently, the specific cost of higher consumption levels is lower due to economies of scale (see Fig. 2a). Maximum costs per person per day reach USD 5c pp/d for Tier 2, USD 16c pp/d for Tier 3 and USD 40c pp/d for Tier 4 (see Fig. 2b). Affordability remains a real challenge especially at higher tiers because 389 million people still live below the poverty line of USD 2.15 per day as defined by the World Bank. These people are, to a large extent, likely to be living without access to electricitywith a low ability or willingness to pay for electricity access. Total investment costs also increase substantially for higher tiers ($87bn for Tier 2, $203bn for Tier 3, and $408bn for Tier 4), and raising capital is still an issue in many SSA countries due to the difficult institutional environment. Finally, the shares of the different electrification approaches vary considerably depending on the demand level (see Fig. 2c). SAS account for larger shares the lower the tier because the sizing of SAS allows for a better utilisation compared to grid electrification. MG shares are low except for high-cost areas in Tier 4, where high demand and the benefits of shared infrastructure costs outweigh the negative impact of higher financing costs (see methods). These demand Tier variations can represent the variance in small-scale productive use (e.g. micro-businesses operating from homes), which would typically be situated between Tier 3 and Tier 4 (see examples in Supplementary Table S1). Beyond average demand levels, micro-businesses can also offer a benefit due to increased demand during the day, which has been shown for the case of MGs in Tanzania. However, such an effect could also be expected for larger SAS and its quantification and generalisation across SSA is a task for future research.

### National spending on health by source for 184 countries between 2013 and 2040 [^f4896a77]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

A general consensus exists that as a country develops economically, health spending per capita rises and the share of that spending that is prepaid through government or private mechanisms also rises. However, the speed and magnitude of these changes vary substantially across countries, even at similar levels of development. In this study, we use past trends and relationships to estimate future health spending, disaggregated by the source of those funds, to identify the financing trajectories that are likely to occur if current policies and trajectories evolve as expected.

Methods

We extracted data from WHO's Health Spending Observatory and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's Financing Global Health 2015 report. We converted these data to a common purchasing power-adjusted and inflation-adjusted currency. We used a series of ensemble models and observed empirical norms to estimate future government out-of-pocket private prepaid health spending and development assistance for health. We aggregated each country's estimates to generate total health spending from 2013 to 2040 for 184 countries. We compared these estimates with each other and internationally recognised benchmarks.

Findings

Global spending on health is expected to increase from US$7·83 trillion in 2013 to $18·28 (uncertainty interval 14·42–22·24) trillion in 2040 (in 2010 purchasing power parity-adjusted dollars). We expect per-capita health spending to increase annually by 2·7% (1·9–3·4) in high-income countries, 3·4% (2·4–4·2) in upper-middle-income countries, 3·0% (2·3–3·6) in lower-middle-income countries, and 2·4% (1·6–3·1) in low-income countries. Given the gaps in current health spending, these rates provide no evidence of increasing parity in health spending. In 1995 and 2015, low-income countries spent $0·03 for every dollar spent in high-income countries, even after adjusting for purchasing power, and the same is projected for 2040. Most importantly, health spending in many low-income countries is expected to remain low. Estimates suggest that, by 2040, only one (3%) of 34 low-income countries and 36 (37%) of 98 middle-income countries will reach the Chatham House goal of 5% of gross domestic product consisting of government health spending.

Interpretation

Despite remarkable health gains, past health financing trends and relationships suggest that many low-income and lower-middle-income countries will not meet internationally set health spending targets and that spending gaps between low-income and high-income countries are unlikely to narrow unless substantive policy interventions occur. Although gains in health system efficiency can be used to make progress, current trends suggest that meaningful increases in health system resources will require concerted action.

### Estimated plan enrollment outcomes after changes to US health insurance marketplace automatic renewal rules [^29e57ca1]. JAMA Health Forum (2021). High credibility.

Importance

The American Rescue Plan increases premium subsidies for health insurance marketplace enrollees, potentially leading to situations in which enrollees could switch to other health care plans with lower premiums and less cost sharing (ie, deductibles and copayments). Current policy defaults enrollees to their current health care plan if they automatically renew their coverage, which may cause them to stay in health care plans that, because of the American Rescue Plan, are now dominated in that they have higher premiums and cost sharing than other options.

Objective

To estimate the extent to which a smart default policy could reduce US health insurance marketplace enrollees' cost sharing and premiums.

Design Setting and Participants

Using 2018 individual enrollment data and 2021 premium data from California's marketplace and the American Rescue Plan premium tax credit subsidy schedule, this economic analysis estimated the characteristics of enrollees' default health care plans if they defaulted into 2021 health care plans under current and smart default policies. The analysis was conducted from March 20 to April 8, 2021.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Characteristics of enrollees' default health care plans under current and smart default policies, including net premiums, plan levels, and cost sharing.

Results

The analytic sample consisted of 748087 Covered California enrollees from 2018 (mean [SD] age, 44.80 [13.72] years; 408410 [54.6%] women). Under current policy with the enhanced subsidies implemented under the American Rescue Plan, 5.8% of sample enrollees would default into dominated health plans. Of these enrollees, 98.0% would have incomes below 250% of the federal poverty level. A smart default policy would lead to a mean $102.47 decrease in monthly premiums (95% CI,$103.84-$101.10), a mean $1960 reduction in individual annual medical deductibles (95% CI,$1991-$1928), and a $49.56 reduction in specialty prescription copays (95% CI,$49.77-$49.34).

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this economic analysis suggest that a smart default policy could avoid defaulting lower-income marketplace enrollees to objectively inferior health care insurance plans and may lead to large reductions in lower-income enrollees' deductibles, copayments, and maximum out-of-pocket amounts. Implementation of a smart default policy could enable marketplace administrators to reduce the prevalence of underinsurance among lower-income marketplace enrollees.

### Principles of child health care financing [^f4eafd5a]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Principles of child health care financing — cost sharing states that copays, deductibles, and coinsurance charges represent cost sharing by the member and that these payments should encourage wise use of appropriate care but not inhibit access to preventive or necessary care; public and private payers should establish cost-sharing policies that ensure affordability of health services for the entire range of family income, with annual out-of-pocket limits established at reasonable levels as a function of family income to protect families from significant medical debt; cost-sharing policies should not shift costs to health care providers and should neither deter appropriate comanagement of a child's care with specialists nor deter economically disadvantaged families from seeking appropriate and necessary care; care should be exercised in developing cost-sharing policies so that these policies primarily focus on discouraging excessive, inappropriate, or abusive use of medical services; primary care services delivered under the supervision of a medical home should be available without the imposition of cost sharing; access to drugs necessary and appropriate to treat pediatric conditions should not be jeopardized by the levy of higher copays and coinsurance; and health care providers should be protected from financial loss resulting from family payment issues, plan coverage limitations, or the plan's inability to accurately inform the provider of the patient's cost-sharing responsibility.
