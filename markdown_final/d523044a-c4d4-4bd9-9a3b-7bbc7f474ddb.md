## Question

Intolerance with statins

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage statin intolerance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining and confirming true statin intolerance. Then, I should evaluate symptom characterization and laboratory assessment, followed by identifying risk factors and excluding alternative etiologies. Next, I will outline a rechallenge algorithm with statin modification strategies, escalate to non-statin therapies if needed, set risk-based LDL-C goals, address special populations, and propose monitoring and follow-up, all while integrating guideline-concordant evidence and pragmatic clinical considerations.

> Let me first confirm the operational definition of true statin intolerance, because precision here dictates everything downstream. Clinically, I should document inability to tolerate at least two different statins, including one at the lowest approved dose and the other at any dose, with reproducible symptoms attributable to statins that resolve with discontinuation and recur with re-exposure; however, hold on, I should verify the nuance that many expert groups emphasize a pragmatic spectrum of partial to complete intolerance rather than an all-or-none label, which better reflects real-world care and supports a "maximally tolerated statin" approach rather than abandoning the class altogether [^115TKVoR] [^113MLR6t] [^111WESeU].

> I need to ensure I recognize the spectrum and the potential for a nocebo effect, because overcalling intolerance leads to preventable ASCVD events. Wait, let me verify the patient's symptom-experience with structured re-challenge or even blinded approaches when feasible, since modern data like SAMSON show that many "intolerant" patients report similar severity to placebo, underscoring expectation effects; still, most patients can ultimately remain on a statin after careful reintroduction and education, so I should not jump to conclusions after a single failed trial [^11175ntL] [^114EFKpq] [^115cWehc].

> Next, I will characterize symptoms methodically to anchor severity and urgency. I should confirm whether the presentation is myalgia without CK elevation, myositis with CK elevation, or true rhabdomyolysis with marked CK elevation and systemic compromise, and I should document timing relative to initiation or dose uptitration, symmetry, proximal predominance, and associated weakness, because this pattern recognition guides safe continuation versus interruption plans [^114cjLBh] [^111WJhXw].

> Hold on, I should verify the laboratory strategy. Baseline CK in high-risk patients and symptom-triggered CK checks help, but I need to avoid overreacting to minor CK bumps; generally, if CK is less than five times the upper limit of normal, continuation with close follow-up is reasonable, whereas CK greater than five times the upper limit of normal warrants stopping the statin and reassessing after resolution; I should also screen for hypothyroidism and vitamin D deficiency and review hepatic enzymes per guideline-consistent monitoring [^114nQ5Aa] [^1174ZSJh].

> I will now examine predisposing factors and interactions, because preventable contributors are common. Let me think about high-intensity dosing, older age, female sex, smaller body habitus, renal impairment, and especially pharmacokinetic interactions through CYP pathways and transporters, since azoles, macrolides, cyclosporine, and others can raise statin exposure and myopathy risk; simvastatin has a particularly interaction-prone profile with rare but serious adverse events in postmarketing reports, so I should confirm the specific statin and co-medications carefully [^1172LSQQ] [^111cjSTL].

> But wait, what if symptoms are due to something else entirely? I need to check for mimics and coexisting conditions such as hypothyroidism, inflammatory myopathies, polymyalgia rheumatica, vitamin D deficiency, fibromyalgia, neuropathy, deconditioning, and other drug-induced myopathies, and I should use cessation and reinitiation to strengthen causal inference before labeling someone truly intolerant [^111WESeU] [^111WJhXw].

> Let me outline the initial management once symptoms arise. I should confirm a short statin holiday of about 2–4 weeks to document symptom resolution and CK normalization if previously elevated, re-estimate ASCVD risk and net benefit, then proceed with a deliberate rechallenge, because guidelines prioritize achieving maximal LDL-C lowering via rechallenge or statin modification before declaring failure [^116jNGFc] [^113F3B3Y].

> Now, I will specify statin-modification tactics with the best balance of potency and tolerability. I should consider switching to lower myopathy-risk statins such as fluvastatin XL or pravastatin, starting at low doses and titrating slowly; let me double-check the evidence that fluvastatin XL 80 mg was tolerated in the vast majority of prior intolerance cases with meaningful LDL-C reductions, acknowledging that potency may be limited for very high-risk targets [^114cjLBh] [^116R3God].

> Next, I should review alternate dosing of long half-life statins to reduce continuous exposure while preserving efficacy. Once- to thrice-weekly low-dose rosuvastatin or alternate-day atorvastatin can be surprisingly effective, with small studies and real-world series indicating 20–35% LDL-C reductions and improved tolerability in many, though I must be transparent that outcomes data for non-daily regimens are limited and that daily dosing remains preferred when tolerated [^113uZSjS] [^115NXSs4] [^115cWehc].

> I need to ensure I optimize co-interventions to enhance tolerability. Let me verify and correct vitamin D deficiency and hypothyroidism, deprescribe or substitute interacting agents where feasible, pace exercise reconditioning, and discuss that evidence for coenzyme Q10 is mixed to negative in contemporary analyses, so I should not overpromise benefit from supplements while remaining open to low-risk trials in select patients [^notfound] [^116saeR9] [^111WJhXw].

> If symptoms recur with multiple reasonable statin strategies, I should document true intolerance and transition to non-statin therapy. First-line is ezetimibe 10 mg daily for its 15–25% LDL-C reduction and favorable tolerability; wait, I initially recalled older reviews stating no outcomes data, but I should correct myself because IMPROVE-IT demonstrated incremental event reduction when ezetimibe was added to statin therapy in ACS, which informs guideline endorsements in intolerance pathways even when used as monotherapy if statins truly cannot be used [^112aiaLE] [^113veZmo].

> Next, I should consider bempedoic acid for additional LDL-C lowering in statin-intolerant patients, especially after ezetimibe, because it is an ATP-citrate lyase inhibitor activated in liver but not skeletal muscle, thereby lowering myopathy risk; let me double-check that CLEAR Serenity showed significant LDL-C and hsCRP reductions with good tolerability, and that contemporary European guidance specifically recommends adding bempedoic acid for statin intolerance when goals are not met with ezetimibe [^113vuD8v] [^113gH52P] [^113PhTzK].

> For very high-risk patients who remain above threshold despite ezetimibe and bempedoic acid or who are completely statin-intolerant, I should consider PCSK9 inhibitors to achieve 50–60% additional LDL-C lowering, acknowledging access and cost constraints but aligning with guideline pathways for secondary prevention and familial hypercholesterolemia where net clinical benefit is substantial [^115TKVoR].

> If needed and suitable, I can still consider bile acid sequestrants or niacin, but I must counsel on gastrointestinal intolerance for resins and flushing and metabolic effects for niacin, using these as adjuncts when more effective or better-tolerated options are not available or contraindicated, and always reassessing adherence and patient preference [^111HEAPL].

> Now, I should set LDL-C goals based on risk category and feasibility in partial or full intolerance. Let me verify that ESC/EAS guidance targets < 55 mg/dL for very high risk and < 70 mg/dL for high risk, with an emphasis that "lower is better" and the proportional risk reduction tracks the absolute LDL-C drop, approximating a 20–22% relative event risk reduction per 1 mmol/L reduction, which supports aggressive yet tolerable combinations when full-intensity statins are not possible [^112ARRSE] [^113veZmo] [^111kefks].

> I will now examine special populations to ensure appropriate nuance. For women and smaller-bodied individuals, I should start lower and titrate given higher exposure per milligram and higher reported myalgia rates in observational literature; for patients with diabetes or at risk, I should confirm that the net cardiovascular benefit of statins generally outweighs the small diabetes risk and intensify glycemic management rather than stopping effective lipid therapy; for adults older than 75 in primary prevention, I need to discuss the USPSTF's insufficiency of evidence and individualize decisions; for patients with HIV, I should verify antiretroviral interactions and preferentially use pitavastatin, atorvastatin, or rosuvastatin at moderate doses per current HIV guidelines [^111z7uTr] [^114iDksg] [^115fSV7V] [^113usB2E].

> Next, I should review a pragmatic monitoring schedule. Let me confirm lipids approximately 6–12 weeks after any initiation or change, then every 3–6 months until stable and at least annually thereafter, with CK checked only if muscle symptoms recur, and with periodic assessment of liver enzymes and secondary causes such as TSH and vitamin D as clinically indicated, while maintaining tight linkage between test intervals and therapeutic adjustments to avoid inertia [^115TKVoR] [^113F3B3Y].

> Patient education and expectation management are critical, so I need to ensure a shared decision-making conversation that explicitly addresses the nocebo effect, personalized benefits of LDL-C lowering, and a written action plan for symptoms and when to pause or call; SAMSON-like insights can be used to normalize and contextualize symptoms, and reinforcing the magnitude of ASCVD risk reduction can improve persistence and outcomes [^11175ntL] [^111ofZfz] [^111kefks].

> I should double-check when to refer. If the patient remains above goal after reasonable combinations or requires advanced biologics, or if there is diagnostic uncertainty such as significant weakness with normal CK, referral to a lipid specialist can accelerate access to PCSK9 inhibitors, guide complex drug–drug interaction management, and reinforce adherence strategies through dedicated counseling [^115TKVoR] [^111ofZfz].

> Finally, I need to confirm that this approach aligns with guideline hierarchies and evolving evidence. Hold on, let me verify that the 2019 ACC/AHA cholesterol guideline emphasizes rechallenge and non-statin addition when appropriate, that ESC/EAS guidance anchors LDL targets and sequencing including ezetimibe and PCSK9 therapies, and that the 2024 ESC CCS update explicitly recommends bempedoic acid in statin intolerance; I should also remember the meta-analytic perspective that true complete intolerance is uncommon when objectively defined, which should embolden careful re-trials before declaring failure [^115TKVoR] [^113veZmo] [^113PhTzK] [^111TWK2g].

> In summary, I need to ensure that statin intolerance remains a diagnosis of exclusion confirmed by structured rechallenge, that most patients can stay on some statin through agent selection and dosing modifications, and that timely layering of ezetimibe, bempedoic acid, and PCSK9 inhibitors for those with persistent intolerance can safely achieve risk-based LDL-C goals while minimizing muscle symptoms and preserving the powerful cardiovascular protection associated with LDL-C lowering [^116jNGFc] [^113PhTzK] [^112ARRSE].

Statin intolerance is defined as the **inability to tolerate at least two different statins** (one at the lowest approved dose) due to adverse effects, most commonly muscle symptoms, that resolve with discontinuation and recur on rechallenge [^113MLR6t]. The **overall prevalence is about 9.1%**, with complete intolerance in 4.0% and partial intolerance in 5.1% [^111TWK2g]. Risk factors include older age, female sex [^114nQ5Aa], high-dose or lipophilic statins, drug interactions [^1172LSQQ], and comorbidities such as hypothyroidism or renal impairment. Management involves confirming symptoms with cessation and rechallenge [^111WESeU], switching to a different statin or lower dose [^116jNGFc], and using alternative therapies such as ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, or bempedoic acid [^113vuD8v] if needed [^113PhTzK] [^113veZmo]. Statin intolerance **increases cardiovascular risk** [^116uPHLm] due to suboptimal LDL-C control, so individualized strategies are essential to maintain lipid-lowering therapy [^115TKsQh].

## Definition and clinical presentation

Statin intolerance is the **inability to tolerate at least two different statins** (one at the lowest approved dose) due to adverse effects that resolve with discontinuation and recur on rechallenge [^113MLR6t]. The **most common presentation is muscle-related symptoms** [^114nQ5Aa], including myalgia (muscle pain or soreness without significant creatine kinase [CK] elevation) [^114cjLBh], myopathy (muscle weakness with elevated CK levels), and rhabdomyolysis (severe muscle breakdown with markedly elevated CK and potential renal impairment) [^112ToQMH]. Less common symptoms include gastrointestinal disturbances, cognitive impairment, and hepatic enzyme elevations [^111cjSTL].

---

## Prevalence and risk factors

The prevalence of statin intolerance varies by population and diagnostic criteria. A recent meta-analysis involving more than 4 million patients reported an **overall prevalence of 9.1%**, with complete intolerance at 4.0% and partial intolerance at 5.1% [^111TWK2g]. Risk factors include:

- **Demographic factors**: Older age, female sex [^114nQ5Aa], and Asian ancestry [^112mfjMx].

- **Clinical factors**: High-dose or lipophilic statins [^114nQ5Aa], drug interactions (e.g. CYP3A4 inhibitors) [^1172LSQQ], hypothyroidism, renal impairment, and genetic predisposition [^113F3B3Y].

- **Lifestyle factors**: Excessive alcohol consumption and vigorous physical activity [^112gGjnY].

---

## Mechanisms underlying statin intolerance

The exact mechanisms underlying statin intolerance remain unclear; proposed mechanisms include **mitochondrial dysfunction** leading to muscle symptoms [^1172LSQQ], genetic predisposition with variants such as SLCO1B1 and LILRB5 [^116578iF], and drug interactions that inhibit statin metabolism (e.g. CYP3A4 inhibitors) [^112ToQMH], which increase statin levels and the risk of adverse effects [^1172LSQQ].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnosis

The clinical evaluation of statin intolerance follows a **systematic approach**:

- **Detailed history**: Document symptoms, timing, and relationship to statin therapy [^116jNGFc].

- **Physical examination**: Assess for muscle tenderness, weakness, and other signs [^113F3B3Y].

- **Laboratory tests**: Measure CK, liver enzymes, and renal function [^1174ZSJh].

- **Statin rechallenge**: Discontinue statin, allow symptoms to resolve, then rechallenge with a different statin or lower dose [^113F3B3Y] to confirm intolerance [^111WESeU].

---

## Management strategies

Management of statin intolerance includes **several strategies**:

- **Switching statins**: Try a different statin, preferably hydrophilic (e.g. pravastatin, rosuvastatin) [^116R3God] or lower dose [^114nQ5Aa].

- **Alternative dosing regimens**: Intermittent dosing (e.g. every other day or once weekly) [^114nQ5Aa] may improve tolerability [^115cWehc].

- **Non-statin therapies**: Ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, and bempedoic acid [^114tcTBi] are effective alternatives for patients unable to tolerate statins [^113PhTzK] [^113veZmo].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Dietary changes, weight loss, and exercise can help manage cholesterol levels [^113F3B3Y].

---

## Impact on cardiovascular outcomes

Statin intolerance **adversely affects cardiovascular outcomes** [^116uPHLm] due to suboptimal lipid control. Patients with statin intolerance have **higher rates of recurrent myocardial infarction**, coronary heart disease events, and all-cause mortality compared with those who maintain high adherence to statin therapy [^115TKsQh]. Therefore, it is crucial to implement individualized management strategies to maintain lipid-lowering therapy and reduce cardiovascular risk.

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of **individualized management strategies** [^113F3B3Y] for statin intolerance. The **ACC/AHA guidelines** recommend maximizing tolerated statin therapy, considering alternative dosing regimens, and using non-statin therapies when necessary [^114iDksg] [^116jNGFc]. The **ESC/EAS guidelines** emphasize the use of ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, and bempedoic acid for patients with confirmed statin intolerance [^113PhTzK] [^113veZmo].

---

Statin intolerance is a clinically significant issue characterized by adverse effects that limit statin use. It requires a systematic approach to diagnosis and management, including switching statins, alternative dosing regimens, and non-statin therapies. Addressing statin intolerance is essential to maintain lipid-lowering therapy and **reduce cardiovascular risk** [^116uPHLm].

### Approach to the patient who is intolerant of statin therapy [^114nQ5Aa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Myopathy occurs in approximately 10% of statin-treated patients and is most commonly manifested by myalgias, with or without plasma creatine kinase (CK) elevations. Predisposition exists in patients treated with high doses of potent statins and those who are older, female, have a genetic predisposition, and when statins are coadministered with drugs that compete with or inhibit drug metabolism. In symptomatic patients, CK levels may assist in guiding management. If less than five times the upper limit of normal, the existing statin should be titrated to achieve cholesterol goals, and the CK should be repeated when symptoms appear or worsen.

In patients with moderate to severe symptoms and any patient with CK elevated to more than five-fold the upper limit of normal, the statin should be stopped. Once asymptomatic and CK is reduced (if elevated previously), cholesterol goals can be approached by:

- **Different statin**: For example, fluvastatin or pravastatin, starting with a low dose and titrating up.
- **Alternate daily or weekly more potent statin**: For instance, rosuvastatin or atorvastatin.
- **Combination therapy**: The lowest tolerated statin with a cholesterol absorption inhibitor (ezetimibe) and/or bile acid sequestrant.

Over-the-counter preparations, such as red yeast rice containing natural statin-like agents or plant sterols, can also lower cholesterol. These, however, have limited efficacy in achieving targeted cholesterol levels for most patients. In patients without CK elevations and symptoms, progress can be followed clinically. In patients who show CK elevations, CK should be monitored.

### Statin intolerance and risk of coronary heart events and all-cause mortality following myocardial infarction [^115TKsQh]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Many patients report adverse reactions to, and may not tolerate, statin therapy. These patients may be at increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) events and mortality.

- **Objectives**: This study evaluated the risk for re-myocardial infarction (MI), CHD events, and all-cause mortality in Medicare beneficiaries with statin intolerance and in those with high adherence to statin therapy.

- **Methods**: We studied 105,329 Medicare beneficiaries who began a moderate- or high-intensity statin dosage after hospitalization for MI between 2007 and 2013. Statin intolerance was defined as down-titrating statins and initiating ezetimibe therapy, switching from statins to ezetimibe monotherapy, having International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, diagnostic codes for rhabdomyolysis or an antihyperlipidemic adverse event, followed by statin down-titration or discontinuation, or switching between ≥ 3 types of statins within 1 year after initiation. High statin adherence over the year following hospital discharge was defined as a proportion of days covered ≥ 80%. Re-MI, CHD events (re-MI or a coronary revascularization procedure), and mortality were identified from 1 year after hospital discharge through December 2014.

- **Results**: Overall, 1,741 patients (1.65%) had statin intolerance, and 55,567 patients (52.8%) had high statin adherence. Over a median of 1.9 to 2.3 years of follow-up, there were 4,450 re-MIs, 6,250 CHD events, and 14,311 deaths. Compared to beneficiaries with high statin adherence, statin intolerance was associated with a 36% higher risk.

### Insights into statin intolerance [^113MLR6t]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

- **Definition of statin intolerance**: Dr. McKenney explains that according to the FDA, a patient must have been tried on one statin at any dose and exhibit symptoms, and on a second statin at the lowest dose, and also had symptoms. These criteria seem too onerous, however, and are not consistent with how healthcare providers think. It is difficult to find patients who meet these criteria because statins are simply not prescribed in this way. Anyone not taking as much statin as they should be taking is at least partially statin intolerant, and most patients may be, to some extent. Some would argue, consistent with the new ACC/AHA Guidelines, that a patient should be taking the maximum tolerated dose, and if they are not, they are at the very least partially statin intolerant.

- **Need for a clinical definition**: Many patients referred for statin intolerance have not been rigorously tried on a variety of statin therapies. There needs to be a clinical definition as opposed to a regulatory definition. Although statin intolerance is not evidence-based, it is the failure to reach evidence-based doses of statins as recommended by the ACC/AHA Guidelines that defines statin intolerance. Therefore, a pragmatic approach is needed. Evidence-based statin intolerance may be defined pragmatically as "the inability to achieve evidence-based doses of statin therapy". Reporting will be important to document that the patient is not on the evidence-based dose because the patient exhibits pragmatic statin intolerance.

Regarding medical management for coronary artery disease, specifically concerning lipid-lowering therapy, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend adding bempedoic acid for patients with statin intolerance who are not achieving their goals on ezetimibe.

### Prevalence of statin intolerance: a meta-analysis [^111TWK2g]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Based on data from more than 4 million patients, we demonstrated that the overall prevalence of statin intolerance (SI) is relatively low, especially when SI is objectively determined using recognized international definitions. These results support the concept that the prevalence of complete SI is often overestimated and highlights the need for a very careful assessment of patients with SI, to decrease the risk of unnecessary statin discontinuation and suboptimal lipid-lowering therapy. Clinicians should use these results to encourage adherence to statin therapy in their patients.

### 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias: Lipid modification to reduce cardiovascular risk [^113veZmo]. European Heart Journal (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to patients with ASCVD, acute coronary syndrome, EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of ezetimibe in patients with acute coronary syndrome and confirmed statin intolerance or contraindication.

### Intolerance to statins: Mechanisms and management [^1172LSQQ]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

The precise mechanisms underlying toxic statin myopathy are unknown, but several hypotheses have been suggested. These effects may be aggravated by conditions that increase statin blood levels, such as concomitant medications that interfere with statin metabolism via inhibition of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, glucuronidation, or other processes.

---

### Intolerance to statins: Mechanisms and management [^116R3God]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Statin-based approaches. Since statins are the only agents with a robust body of evidence proving reduction in clinical endpoints, every effort should be made to keep high-risk patients on a statin-based regimen. Switching statins may be efficacious. In one small study, 43% of 37 patients who received another statin after an episode of statin-associated myopathy tolerated other statins without symptoms. Considering the results of the PRIMO study, the use of statins associated with a lower risk of myopathy, such as fluvastatin or pravastatin, may be considered, although these statins may not be potent enough if a large reduction of LDL cholesterol is needed to reach target values. In one study, 80 mg fluvastatin XL daily (as a slow-release preparation) was tolerated in 97% of patients with prior statin intolerance owing to muscle-related symptoms, and LDL cholesterol was reduced by 32.8%.

Another approach evaluated in several studies involves the use of long-acting statins, mainly rosuvastatin, in low doses or at a reduced frequency (1–3 times a week). For example, in a retrospective analysis of 51 patients with a statin, alternate-day rosuvastatin at a mean dose of 5.6 mg was tolerated in 72.5% of patients, with an LDL cholesterol reduction of 34.5%.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^113usB2E]. ClinicalInfo (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for human immunodeficiency virus infection, specifically concerning statin therapy, the CDC/HIVMA/IDSA/NIH 2024 guidelines recommend initiating at least moderate-intensity statin therapy in patients with HIV infection and a 10-year ASCVD risk estimate of 5% to less than 20%. Options include:

- **Pitavastatin 4 mg** once daily
- **Atorvastatin 20 mg** once daily
- **Rosuvastatin 10 mg** once daily

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^111WJhXw]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Some of the muscle symptoms reported with statins may be due to a nocebo effect, suggested by the findings of N-of-1 statin trials and by the lack of a signal for SAMS in blinded trials. Furthermore, most patients who are intolerant to one statin can successfully be switched to another statin.

Management of SAMS starts with a conversation with the individual patient about the indication for statin treatment and the expected benefit of continued therapy. Preference for continued statin therapy over alternatives should be stressed. For those patients with SAMS and elevation in CK 5× ULN at initial assessment, options include rechallenge of the original statin at a lower dose, trial of a lower intensity statin (e.g. fluvastatin, pravastatin), or trial of a high-intensity statin with longer half-life (e.g. rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, pitavastatin) with a modified dosing regimen (e.g. alternate days, once, twice, or three times weekly). Of the available statins, simvastatin may be most associated with SAMS, and fluvastatin the least.

### Insights into statin intolerance [^111z7uTr]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

- **Is it safe to continue statins in the presence of any degree of intolerance**: There are multiple levels to consider. Some patients can take a statin at a reasonable dose, but it may not be enough to achieve the desired LDL-C level. These patients are not following the evidence-based recommendations.

	- There is a relatively small population that cannot tolerate any statin at any dose. Conversely, a large population of patients cannot tolerate a high-intensity statin regimen across the board. Some patients fear developing diabetes without warning, and statins are often discontinued when patients develop diabetes. However, this should generally not be a reason to stop statins; instead, efforts to treat diabetes should be intensified. Many of these patients are prediabetic and would likely develop diabetes regardless of statin use. The focus should be on the net clinical benefit of preventing cardiovascular events.

- **Examination of side effects**: Data suggests that side effects may not correlate with the dose but with the blood levels of the statin. This is particularly relevant for women, who are typically smaller than men. An 80-mg dose for a man is fundamentally different from the same dose for a woman. Due to the lower body size of most women, there may be a greater likelihood that they will not tolerate the recommended statin doses from the ACC/AHA guidelines.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for dyslipidemia, specifically in the context of monitoring for adverse effects of statins, the 2019 guidelines from AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA recommend considering the use of RCT-proven non-statin therapy. This approach is advised if it is likely to provide net clinical benefit in patients at increased ASCVD risk who experience severe statin-associated muscle symptoms or reoccurrence of symptoms despite appropriate statin rechallenge.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^115fSV7V]. JAMA (2022). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, specifically with respect to statin therapy, the 2022 USPSTF guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statins for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults aged 76 years and older.

### Efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolemia and statin intolerance [^113vuD8v]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The main finding of the CLEAR Serenity trial is that bempedoic acid significantly reduces both LDL‐C and hsCRP compared with placebo and is well tolerated in patients with statin intolerance. Similar to statins, bempedoic acid is an inhibitor of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. It targets an enzyme, ATP‐citrate lyase, upstream of β‐hydroxy β‐methylglutaryl‐coenzyme A reductase, the target for statins. However, unlike statins, bempedoic acid is a prodrug that is not activated in skeletal muscle. The results of the trial demonstrate the potential for bempedoic acid as a novel treatment option for the large number of individuals who have difficulty tolerating statin treatment due to muscle‐related side effects.

Patients with statin intolerance are at increased cardiovascular risk because of ongoing atherogenic lipid elevations. Nonstatin alternatives that are currently available, such as bile acid sequestrants, fibrates, and ezetimibe, reduce LDL‐C to a lesser extent than statins and may, therefore, be insufficient alone to adequately lower LDL‐C and mitigate cardiovascular event risk. However, although anti–proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 antibodies have demonstrated large reductions in LDL‐C and a good safety profile in clinical trials, these injectable agents are expensive, are not available everywhere, and their use in countries where they are available is most often restricted to patients with proven familial hypercholesterolemia or coronary artery disease, and thus have had limited uptake in clinical practice.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^117RMC9x]. JAMA (2022). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to statin therapy, the USPSTF 2022 guidelines recommend initiating statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases in adults aged 40–75 years who have one or more cardiovascular disease risk factors (such as dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and an estimated 10-year cardiovascular disease risk of 10% or greater.

### Insights into statin intolerance [^11161HeY]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

There are many who do not recognize the importance of statin intolerance, or even that it requires a well-designed, patient-centered approach. Statin intolerance is common, complicated, and requires a pragmatic approach. It requires persistence and represents a pool of patients at enhanced risk who have been under-represented in clinical trials. Moreover, it represents an opportunity for further evaluation of nonstatin therapeutics. Given the new ACC/AHA guidelines, statin intolerance may become even more prevalent because of more proactive recommendations to use moderate or intensive statin therapy and the greater number of primary-prevention patients that now qualify for, and may be considered for, statin therapy.

The ACC/AHA guidelines for the treatment of blood cholesterol provide an important foundation for understanding who might benefit from statin therapy and should form the basis of our treatment approach. It is also important to understand, however, that the ACC/AHA guidelines afford a clinician the freedom to make decisions in collaboration with their patients and to use clinical judgment based upon the available evidence. The aspects of clinician judgment, interaction with the patient, shared decision-making, and patient-centered care must all be emphasized within this context.

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) and European Association of Neurosurgical Societies (EANS) guideline on stroke due to spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage [^115jYGua]. European Stroke Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for intracerebral hemorrhage, specifically with respect to long-term medical therapy such as statin therapy, the EANS/ESO 2025 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of statin therapy in adult patients with a history of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) who have an indication for statin use. This is particularly advised for patients with high cardiovascular risk, both for primary and secondary prevention, after evaluating the individual risk-benefit profile.

### Pravastatin versus fluvastatin after statin intolerance: The PRUV-Intolerance study with propensity score matching [^113VhhJy]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Limited data are available on the relapse of statin intolerance after resumption of statins. We aimed to evaluate the relapse rates of statin intolerance in patients who subsequently received pravastatin or fluvastatin and to identify associated factors.

- **Methods**: This retrospective, propensity score-matched cohort study screened data obtained from a tertiary university hospital between 2006 and 2015. Of 8073 patients screened, 488 with statin intolerance who received pravastatin or fluvastatin with regular follow-up were enrolled. After propensity score matching of patients, 384 were finally analyzed. The primary outcome variables were relapse of statin intolerance and stopping (i.e. discontinuation or switching to other statins) rate for the two statins.

- **Results**: During the median follow-up period of 37 months, the rate of relapse of intolerance was 10.4% and 18.2% among users of pravastatin and fluvastatin, respectively (P = 0.04). However, the log-rank test showed no difference in the relapse-free rates between the two groups (P = 0.34). The stopping rates of the two statins were 36.5% and 42.2% (P = 0.30), respectively, for various reasons, including low efficacy of the drugs. After adjustment, chronic kidney disease (hazard ratio [HR] 1.83, P = 0.03) and previous creatine kinase elevation (HR 3.13, P = 0.001) were identified as independent determinants of relapse. Older age (HR 1.03, P = 0.057) and female sex (HR 1.70, P = 0.059) were associated, but not significantly, with relapse.

### Overcoming challenges with statin therapy [^112KF4LV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Persistence, putative adverse effects, health beliefs, and package inserts

If non-persistence were unavoidable — for example, if patients stopped statins for good reason or if physicians discontinued statins due to causally related adverse effects — there might be little reason to try to improve on it. However, many patients and physicians mistakenly stop these medications. There are probably only two important causally related adverse effects of statins — myopathy and impairment of insulin resistance. As discussed later, both are likely related to impaired mitochondrial function and are treatable or avoidable in most cases. Most patients stop statins for other reasons, as shown in Table 1, adapted from a study by Zhang et al. Most patients who stopped them due to adverse effects attributed to statins were able to continue them when rechallenged.

### A common missense variant of LILRB5 is associated with statin intolerance and myalgia [^116578iF]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Since the LILRB5 Asp247Gly variant was known to be associated with CK levels, a phenotype independent of CK elevations was created to determine if the association of the variant with statin intolerance was confounded by the variant's association with CK levels. The European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society joint recommendations on the management of dyslipidemias suggest cessation of statin treatment if the user presents with normal CK but persistent symptoms of intolerance. This intolerance definition was derived from the GAUSS-2 trial, the consensus definition based on recommendations by Banach et al, and recommendations of the National Lipid Association (NLA) in 2014.

- **Low dose intolerance (LDI)**: Cases of LDI had used two or more different statins, and at least one statin that was discontinued would have to be at the lowest approved daily starting dose before discontinuation, irrespective of their CK levels (n = 591).
- **Controls (statin tolerant individuals — ST2)**: These met all the criteria of the previous statin tolerant (ST1) group, except the definition was independent of the CK elevation criteria (n = 443). A higher proportion of controls had CK levels in the normal range, specifically, 354 of the 443 (80%) controls compared to 335 of 591 (57%) cases. Therefore, association tests for this phenotype were adjusted for (log-transformed) CK levels, in addition to other covariates.

Regarding the medical management of hypertriglyceridemia, particularly concerning general principles, the Endocrine Society's 2012 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of the following drug classes alone or in combination with statins as treatment options for patients with moderately to severely elevated triglyceride levels:

- **Fibrates**: Used to lower triglyceride levels.
- **Niacin**: Helps to decrease triglyceride levels.
- **N-3 fatty acids**: Also known as omega-3 fatty acids, beneficial for lowering triglyceride levels.

### Efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolemia and statin intolerance [^113gH52P]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

In the CLEAR Serenity study, bempedoic acid reduced LDL-C significantly more than placebo in patients with hypercholesterolemia and a history of statin intolerance without inducing side effects commonly attributed to statin treatment. Myalgia and muscular weakness were numerically less frequent with bempedoic acid compared with placebo. Lipid lowering was consistent across patient subgroups and was observed when bempedoic acid was administered as monotherapy or when added to stable background lipid-modifying therapy.

A difference in LDL-C reduction was observed among patients with a history of diabetes mellitus versus those with no history of diabetes mellitus. However, this was likely attributable to the play of chance in a subgroup analysis with a limited sample size, as LDL-C reduction with bempedoic acid was comparable in patients with and without diabetes mellitus in previous phase 3 clinical trials. Patients in the bempedoic acid treatment group also experienced significant reductions in non–HDL-C, total cholesterol, apoB, and hsCRP, which were maintained throughout the 24-week study.

CLEAR Serenity expands on the existing body of evidence supporting the effectiveness and favorable safety profile of bempedoic acid for atherogenic lipid reduction in patients with statin intolerance by providing longer-term data in a population meeting defined intolerance criteria and who were receiving treatment as monotherapy or on a background of lipid-modifying therapy for primary or secondary prevention indications.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to monitoring for adverse effects of statins, the 2019 guidelines from AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA recommend identifying potential predisposing factors for statin-associated side effects, including new-onset diabetes mellitus and statin-associated muscle symptoms in patients with an indication for statin therapy. It is advised to reassess and rechallenge to achieve maximal LDL-C lowering by using a modified dosing regimen, an alternate statin, or combining with non-statin therapy, in patients with statin-associated side effects that are not severe.

### Effects of once weekly rosuvastatin among patients with a prior statin intolerance [^113uZSjS]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Statins possess an excellent safety profile and are generally well tolerated when administered in the standard once-daily dosing regimen. However, a small percentage of patients discontinue therapy because of adverse events such as myalgias. The investigators describe eight patients with previous intolerance to daily statin dosing and examine their responses to once-weekly rosuvastatin therapy. In conclusion, once-weekly rosuvastatin may be a feasible and effective option for patients previously intolerant to once-daily statin dosing.

### Efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolemia and statin intolerance [^111i19Vu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The CLEAR Serenity trial enrolled patients with either a primary or secondary indication for lipid-lowering therapy, which, if not for demonstrated intolerance, would typically include a statin. The high baseline mean LDL-C, frequent absence of any lipid-lowering therapy at baseline, and marked prevalence of cardiometabolic comorbidities reflect both the high cardiovascular risk of this population and the paucity of treatment options for these patients. The CLEAR Serenity study is also notable for the large proportion of women, a group that is often underrepresented in clinical trials of pharmaceutical agents for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The greater percentage of women versus men in the study may be related to the observed increased risk for statin intolerance among women. Overall, the enrollment criteria of the study allowed for assessing bempedoic acid in the diversity of patients and background therapies that are encountered in clinical practice.

The efficacy and safety data presented herein must be interpreted with an understanding of the study's limitations, such as its comparatively short duration (24 weeks). The durability of effect and safety of extended bempedoic acid use is currently being evaluated in a long-term, open-label extension study, during which all patients will receive bempedoic acid for up to 78 weeks.

The results from the CLEAR Serenity study demonstrate that bempedoic acid significantly reduces LDL-C and hsCRP in patients with statin intolerance, regardless of baseline LDL-C or concomitant lipid-lowering therapy.

### Insights into statin intolerance [^113EVsy9]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

How will the new guidelines impact statin intolerance treatment?

Dr. McKenney emphasizes that these are the first American guidelines to fully recognize statin intolerance with appropriate documentation. The new ACC/AHA Guidelines present a comprehensive discussion on both the benefits and potential risks of therapy, emphasizing the importance of patient education regarding both aspects.

Statin use is a decision made collaboratively between the doctor and the patient, following a "risk discussion" on the pros and cons of starting statin therapy. Additionally, there should be a conversation about nonpharmacologic means to lower LDL-C and other cardiovascular risks.

How do the new guidelines impact the perception of statin intolerance as a diagnosis?

Dr. Koren notes that statin intolerance may be more prevalent than traditionally recognized, particularly with the insights from the new ACC/AHA Guidelines. As these guidelines gain understanding and adoption, recognizing and strategizing for patients at risk of statin intolerance becomes increasingly important.

Dr. Baum suggests that the introduction of the ACC/AHA Guidelines might increase the reported incidence of statin intolerance. To manage this, some physicians may start with lower doses to retain patients rather than losing them at the start. This approach aligns with the ACC/AHA Guidelines and a patient-centered approach.

The guidelines recommend that for individuals intolerant to the recommended intensity of statin therapy, the maximally tolerated intensity should be used.

### Quantitative evaluation of statin effectiveness versus intolerance and strategies for management of intolerance [^116uXdAw]. Atherosclerosis (2020). Low credibility.

There is disquiet about statin effectiveness and side effects in both the medical and lay media.

- **Methods**: We searched the literature for reports on the incidence of statin intolerance (SI) in which control rates of similar events were also recorded. The number of people who must receive treatment (NNT) to prevent one atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) event at 5–50% 10-year risk and LDL cholesterol 2–7 mmol/l was compared with the number of those who would experience harm attributable to statins (NNH). Using a similar method, the effectiveness of various strategies to overcome SI in preventing CVD was then compared.

- **Results**: Observational studies with non-randomized control groups report higher rates of statin adverse events than randomized trials. Overall, at least 75 patients must be treated for one to experience a side effect. In contrast, the NNT to prevent one ASCVD event with statins as monotherapy or in combination with other cholesterol-lowering medications to achieve at least 50% decrease in LDL cholesterol is 750 (< 0.1333%). When SI is encountered, the most effective management for most patients in terms of ASCVD reduction is to rechallenge with a low dose of a potent statin and then up-titrate until the cholesterol target has been achieved, with the addition of ezetimibe 10 mg daily if necessary.

- **Conclusions**: The most severe complication of SI is the discontinuation of effective cholesterol-lowering therapy.

### Narrative review: Statin-related myopathy [^114cjLBh]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Statin-related myopathy is a clinically important cause of statin intolerance and discontinuation. The spectrum of statin-related myopathy ranges from common but clinically benign myalgia to rare but life-threatening rhabdomyolysis. Observational studies suggest that myalgia can occur in up to 10% of persons prescribed statins, whereas rhabdomyolysis continues to be rare. The mechanisms of statin-related myopathy are unclear.

Options for managing statin myopathy include:

- **Statin switching**: Particularly to fluvastatin or low-dose rosuvastatin.
- **Nondaily dosing regimens**.
- **Nonstatin alternatives**: Such as ezetimibe and bile acid-binding resins.
- **Coenzyme Q10 supplementation**. Few of these strategies have high-quality evidence supporting them.

Because statin-related myopathy will probably become more common with greater numbers of persons starting high-dose statin therapy and the increasing stringency of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level targets, research to better identify patients at risk for statin myopathy and to evaluate management strategies for statin-related myopathy is warranted.

### Optimal statin type and dosage for vascular patients [^1137e5Su]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Statins are an essential component of managing patients suffering from vascular diseases. As there is neither a consensus nor guidelines on this issue, we aimed to define the optimal statin type and dosage for these patients. MEDLINE was searched for studies comparing different statin types and dosages for vascular patients. In the absence of adverse effects, rosuvastatin or atorvastatin ≥ 20 mg/d is the optimal statin type and dosage for these patients.

The management of statin-induced adverse events and options for statin-intolerant patients are also discussed. Routine statin treatment is associated with several beneficial effects in vascular patients, whether managed conservatively or undergoing open vascular surgery/endovascular interventions. If possible, statins should not be discontinued before open or endovascular procedures, and treatment should be resumed as soon as possible. Future studies should evaluate the effects of an increased statin loading dose prior to vascular procedures.

Regarding preventative measures for statin-induced myopathy, more specifically with respect to pretreatment assessment, ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend considering obtaining baseline measurement of CK levels in patients at increased risk for adverse muscle events because of a personal or family history of statin intolerance or muscle disease, clinical presentation, or concomitant drug therapy increasing the risk of myopathy.

### Statin intolerance: A review and update [^112gGjnY]. Endocrine Practice (2023). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to review the evidence of existing literature on the management of statin intolerance.

- **Methods**: We searched for literature pertaining to statin intolerance and treatments on PubMed, reviewing articles published between 2005 and 2022.

- **Results**: Statin-associated myalgia is the most common adverse effect of statin therapy and the most frequent reason for statin discontinuation. The risk factors for statin intolerance include unexplained muscle pain with other lipid-lowering therapies, unexplained cramps, a history of increased creatine kinase levels, and a family history of muscle symptoms both with and without lipid therapy. Vitamin D repletion and coenzyme Q supplementation may help alleviate the musculoskeletal effects of statins. Trials of different types of statins and varying dosing regimens are recommended to improve tolerability. While the use of statins in individuals who regularly exercise requires closer monitoring of muscular symptoms and creatine kinase levels, it does not preclude statin use.

- **Conclusion**: Effective management of the adverse effects of statin therapy and improving statin tolerability are key to achieving optimum cardiovascular benefits. Identifying statin-associated adverse effects and managing them appropriately can reduce unnecessary statin discontinuation, thereby providing longer cardiovascular protection.

### Statin intolerance [^1143qSam]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The term statin intolerance refers to an inability to use statins because of muscle symptoms or elevated creatine kinase, and the major diagnostic challenge is to unambiguously link these symptoms to statin use. Roughly 5% to 10% of statin users develop statin intolerance. Since statin use is expected to increase — especially after recent updated guidelines have expanded the statin benefit groups — adverse effects from statins will become a growing issue. Unfortunately, the pathophysiology, and even the terminology, of statin-related muscle injury lack clarity. Several risk factors have been identified, including advanced age, family history of myopathy, and statin dose. Many cases manifest only after patients are administered an interacting medication (e.g. azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin, erythromycin, and cyclosporine).

Diagnosing myopathy remains challenging, especially because some patients can have normal serum creatine kinase levels despite demonstrable weakness and muscle biopsy-proven statin-induced myopathy. A statin withdrawal and rechallenge help patients distinguish whether their myalgia symptoms are due to statins. However, in at least one clinical trial, even 5% of placebo-treated patients developed myalgias during a controlled withdrawal and rechallenge. No consensus exists for the management of patients with statin intolerance. Many patients can eventually tolerate a statin, but often at suboptimal doses. A subset of patients does well with non-daily regimens, such as every other day or once-weekly dosing. Some patients cannot tolerate statins at all.

### New insights into managing symptoms during statin therapy [^114EFKpq]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Symptoms during statin therapy are common and often attributed to statin intolerance. Recent data suggest that few patients are truly intolerant to statins. Muscle symptoms are similar in both statin and control groups during the blinded treatment periods of clinical trials. The "nocebo" effect may occur during open-label statin treatment, when previously asymptomatic study participants report symptoms attributed to statin therapy, or during placebo-controlled trials. Most patients reporting statin intolerance can tolerate blinded moderate-intensity statin therapy.

In clinical practice, the large majority of patients are willing to retry a statin, and of those who do, more than 80–90% successfully remain on statin therapy long-term. Emerging evidence from brain imaging studies and contemporary approaches to pain management suggests that building trust and managing patient expectations can minimize the "nocebo" effect in statin-treated patients.

### Intolerance to statins: Mechanisms and management [^111HEAPL]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

When no statin is tolerated or the maximal tolerable dose of statins fails to reduce LDL cholesterol to target levels, nonstatin therapies should be used.

- **Nonstatin medications**: The most commonly used drug is ezetimibe. Ezetimibe as monotherapy or added to 80 mg fluvastatin XL daily in patients with prior statin intolerance was well tolerated and produced a 15% reduction in LDL cholesterol. It should be noted that currently there are no studies that demonstrate ezetimibe's efficacy in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

- **Bile acid sequestrants (BAS)**: Another option to reduce cholesterol absorption is the use of bile acid sequestrants, which were proven to reduce cardiovascular events in the Lipid Research Clinics Study Coronary Primary Prevention Trial (LRC-CPPT). BAS can be combined with ezetimibe to produce a greater reduction in LDL cholesterol. The use of BAS is associated with a high rate of gastrointestinal side effects, leading to discontinuation rates as high as 40–60%. Colesevelam has a better side effect profile and may lead to better patient compliance.

- **Niacin**: Niacin at daily doses from 500 to 2,000 mg lowers LDL cholesterol by ~20%. Given as monotherapy in the Coronary Drug Project study, niacin reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Niacin can also be used in combination with BAS and ezetimibe in statin-intolerant patients requiring a large reduction in LDL cholesterol. The use of niacin is limited by its side effects, mainly flushing, which can lead to the drug being discontinued in up to 25% of patients.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115dRRXQ]. JAMA (2022). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to statin therapy, the USPSTF 2022 guidelines indicate that there is insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statins for primary prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults aged 76 years and older.

### Mipomersen, an apolipoprotein B synthesis inhibitor, lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in high-risk statin-intolerant patients: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115GYcGF]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to investigate the safety and efficacy of mipomersen, an apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB) synthesis inhibitor, in patients who are statin intolerant and at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Thirty-three subjects, not receiving statin therapy because of statin intolerance, received a weekly subcutaneous dose of 200 mg mipomersen or placebo (2:1 randomization) for 26 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percent change in LDL cholesterol (LDL-c) from baseline to Week 28. Other efficacy endpoints were percent change in apoB and lipoprotein a [Lp(a)]. Safety was determined using the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and clinical laboratory evaluations. After 26 weeks of mipomersen administration, LDL-c was reduced by 47 ± 18% (P < 0.001 vs. placebo). ApoB and Lp(a) were also significantly reduced by 46 and 27%, respectively (P < 0.001 vs. placebo). Four mipomersen (19%) and two placebo subjects (17%) discontinued dosing prematurely due to AEs. Persistent liver transaminase increases ≥ 3× the upper limit of normal were observed in seven (33%) subjects assigned to mipomersen. In selected subjects, liver fat content was assessed during and after treatment using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Liver fat content in these patients ranged from 0.8 to 47.3%. Liver needle biopsy was performed in two of these subjects, confirming hepatic steatosis with minimal inflammation or fibrosis.

The present data suggest that mipomersen is a potential therapeutic agent for lowering LDL cholesterol in statin-intolerant patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease.

### Life-saving medications: The urgent need for guideline adherence and patient acceptance [^111ofZfz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The authors of the 2018 multisociety cholesterol guideline avoided using the term statin intolerance and instead preferred "statin-associated side effects", since the vast majority of patients can tolerate rechallenge with a different statin or an alternative statin regimen such as reduced dose or frequency. When patients report possible statin-associated side effects, a thorough assessment of symptoms is recommended, particularly for muscle symptoms, and an evaluation for non-statin causes and predisposing factors. This is an important area for education for both clinicians and patients. Additionally, if a clinician does not have the time or knowledge to address statin-associated side effects, the patient can be referred to a lipidologist or clinical lipid specialist.

A recent study by Okunrintemi and colleagues highlighted the importance of patient–provider communication on clinical outcomes and resource utilization. A sample of 6,810 individuals with ASCVD answered questions from the Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Survey that assessed patient–provider communication. Results showed that patients who reported poor versus optimal communication with their providers were over two times more likely to report poor physical and mental health, were less likely to report taking a statin and aspirin, reported greater utilization of healthcare resources determined by emergency department visits and hospitalizations, and reported spending more on healthcare annually. An important limitation of this study is the possibility of recall bias from patient report.

### Sideeffect patterns in a crossover trial of statin, placebo, and no treatment [^11175ntL]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Were the participants really intolerant of statin tablets? Superficially, it may appear that the trial has failed to recruit participants with true intolerance. However, it should be remembered that they had self-reported intolerance based on experience solely with statin tablets, i.e. no access to blinded matched placebo. The trial confirmed clear (P < 0.0001) intolerance of statin tablets: the main surprise was an equally clear intolerance of placebo tablets (P < 0.0001) in a population who had been advised during the informed consent process that they would be receiving statin, placebo, and no-tablet periods.

The intolerance was severe: 26 of 60 had to stop a statin month early. However, 23 of 60 had to stop a placebo month early. It is clear that this cohort were indeed intolerant of statin tablets, but also that the source of the intolerance was primarily the tablet, not the statin.

- **The need for a planned schedule and symptom tracking**: Because SAMSON was an exercise in personalized medicine, each participant's full daily data are shown in the Supplemental Appendix, and they reveal several patterns. Figure 2 shows six exemplar patients whose symptom scores we will now cover in more detail. Some participants (e.g. participant 53) essentially experienced no side effects during the trial, despite intolerable side effects with statins previously. Others (e.g. participant 10) had intense symptoms throughout, regardless of whether they were taking tablets or not.

These two patterns represent situations where symptoms not caused by taking statins have been previously attributed.

### A current approach to statin intolerance [^116YGjzg]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Statins are the first-line pharmacotherapy for cholesterol reduction. Use of these drugs in large randomized clinical trials has consistently shown significant reductions in major vascular events, including death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularization. The updated guidelines for the treatment of high blood cholesterol from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) will lead to an increase in the number of patients taking statins. Hence, the number of cases of statin intolerance may subsequently increase, emphasizing the need to understand and treat this important problem.

### A common missense variant of LILRB5 is associated with statin intolerance and myalgia [^112Gfb82]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Results

- **Baseline characteristics of general statin intolerance and low dose intolerance**: Covariates associated with statin use or with the development of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were tested. Specifically, these included mean age at the start and end of statin therapy, sex, diagnosis of T2D, first and last statin used, starting and ending doses, use of interacting co-medications, statin use for the secondary prevention of CVD, CK levels, and LDL levels prior to statin use. The comparison of general statin intolerance (GSI) with statin tolerance (ST1), and of low dose intolerance (LDI) with statin tolerance (ST2), is presented.

- **Covariates associated with GSI**: Younger age at start and longer duration of therapy, female gender, lower incidence of simvastatin use at the start and end of therapy, lower starting and ending dose, the use of interacting co-medications and, by phenotype definition, CK levels at the time of diagnosis.

- **Covariates associated with LDI**: Included longer duration of statin therapy, lower frequency of simvastatin use at the start and end of therapy, lower starting and ending dose, the use of interacting co-medications, and CK levels. A concern with a phenotype that is dose dependent is that differences might arise from LDL cholesterol reduction required between tolerant and intolerant individuals; however, LDL levels prior to statin therapy were not significantly different across the groups.

### Bempedoic acid: The new kid on the block for the treatment of dyslipidemia and LDL cholesterol: A narrative review [^114tcTBi]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Diabetes is a major risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), in which dyslipidemia plays a crucial role. Statins are the first-line therapy for primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD; however, their adverse events include reversible musculoskeletal and liver side effects, in addition to a diabetogenic association. In this short review, we provide a succinct narrative of the future role and trial data of a novel first-in-class molecule, bempedoic acid.

The authors provide their expert insight with a focus on Phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of bempedoic acid. Bempedoic acid was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in February and March 2020, respectively. It is a novel molecule that inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis in the same mechanistic pathway as statins. It is a first-in-class small molecule, delivered as a prodrug and administered as an oral, once-daily dose that decreases low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Phase II and III RCTs have demonstrated efficacy with adequate safety data, both as mono- or combination therapy with statins and ezetimibe.

Bempedoic acid is hepatically converted to the active drug, with a lack of activation in skeletal muscle. Due to this novel mechanism, musculoskeletal-related adverse events exhibit a lower prevalence, providing an alternative pharmacotherapy for statin-intolerant patients. Bempedoic acid may be used as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy, or in statin-intolerant patients for the treatment of dyslipidemia.

### Statin toxicity [^112ToQMH]. Circulation Research (2019). Low credibility.

There is now overwhelming evidence to support lowering LDL-c (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Statins are a class of drugs frequently prescribed to lower cholesterol. However, in spite of their widespread use, discontinuation and nonadherence remain major gaps in both the primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

The major reason for statin discontinuation is the development of statin-associated muscle symptoms, but a range of other statin-induced side effects also exist. Although the mechanisms behind these side effects have not been fully elucidated, there is an urgent need to identify those at increased risk of developing side effects and to provide alternative treatment strategies.

In this article, we review the mechanisms and clinical importance of statin toxicity and focus on the evaluation and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for statin-induced myopathy, more specifically with respect to screening for adverse effects, the CCS 2016 guidelines recommend assessing all purported statin-associated symptoms systematically. This includes incorporating observation during cessation and reinitiation (same or different statin, same or lower potency, same or decreased frequency of dosing) to identify a tolerated, statin-based therapy for chronic use.

Regarding medical management for statin-induced myopathy, more specifically with respect to treatment modifications, the AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA 2019 guidelines recommend considering the addition of a non-statin drug, such as ezetimibe or a bile acid sequestrant, to moderate-intensity statin therapy. This is advisable for intermediate-risk adult patients who require more aggressive LDL-C reduction but are not tolerating high-intensity statin therapy.

### Treatment strategies in patients with statin intolerance: The Cleveland Clinic experience [^115cWehc]. American Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Statin therapy is a proven effective treatment for hyperlipidemia. However, a significant number of patients cannot tolerate statins. This study was conducted to review treatment strategies for patients intolerant to statin therapy, focusing on intermittent statin dosing.

- **Methods and results**: We performed a retrospective analysis of medical records of 1,605 patients referred to the Cleveland Clinic Preventive Cardiology Section for statin intolerance between January 1995 and March 2010, with at least a 6-month follow-up. The changes in lipid profile, achievement of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals, and statin tolerance rate were analyzed. Most (72.5%) of patients with prior statin intolerance were able to tolerate a statin for the median follow-up time of 31 months. Patients on intermittent statin dosing (n = 149) had significantly lower LDL-C reduction compared with the daily dosing group (n = 1,014; 21.3% ± 4.0% vs. 27.7% ± 1.4%, P < .04). However, compared with the statin discontinued group (n = 442), they had a significantly higher LDL-C reduction (21.3% ± 4.0% vs. 8.3% ± 2.2%, P < .001), and a significantly higher portion achieved their Adult Treatment Panel III goal of LDL-C (61% vs. 44%, P < .05). There was a trend toward a decrease in all-cause mortality at 8 years for patients on daily and intermittent statin dosing compared with those who discontinued statin (P = 0.08).

- **Conclusions**: Most patients with previous statin intolerance can tolerate a subsequent trial of statin. A strategy of intermittent statin dosing can be an effective therapeutic approach.

### Optimizing cholesterol treatment in patients with muscle complaints [^116uPHLm]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). High credibility.

Statins are highly effective for preventing cardiovascular events by reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). However, many patients taking statins report muscle-related symptoms that prevent the use of guideline-recommended doses. Patients with reported intolerance to statins have a high risk of cardiovascular events. Clinical strategies that optimize cardiovascular risk reduction through LDL-C lowering need to be applied in patients experiencing intolerable side effects that they attribute to statins. In this paper, the authors review definitions of statin intolerance, propose algorithms to better define statin intolerance, and describe approaches to optimize cardiovascular risk reduction among individuals reporting statin-associated muscle symptoms.

### Insights into statin intolerance [^112NwCoJ]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). High credibility.

It is important to understand that many patients are not taking their statins; physicians may think all of their patients are adherent, but often they are not. Many patients discontinue their statins due to side effects, but they do not have the time or inclination to report this to their health care provider.

Part of the challenge is to identify intolerance when there are vastly different ways patients do, or do not, present with symptoms. Patients are often misled by information they encounter online. When they initiate statin therapy, they often expect to experience symptoms, which can become a self‐fulfilling prophecy. This underscores the importance of conducting a baseline assessment of symptoms.

### Insights into statin intolerance [^111J5Jiv]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

- **Are patients willing to try another statin after experiencing intolerance with the first**: Patients must be better educated, particularly regarding the benefits of statin therapy for high-risk patients in relation to the risks of therapy. Both patients and clinicians should be aware that intolerance to a single statin is not a reason to abandon this strategy. It is important to be patient and persistent. In most instances, a reasonable approach to care will emerge, even if it departs from the ACC/AHA Guidelines recommendations or conventional approaches. It is important to emphasize that the patient is not immediately deemed intolerant; there is a next step. Many patients are willing to try another statin after failing the first. To encourage them to do so, the doctor and patient must engage in a considered and careful discussion regarding both interstatin variability and the benefits of statin therapy.

- **What do you tell a patient about a second statin**: There are variations in response to statins. It must be emphasized to patients that just because they have taken one statin and were intolerant, it does not mean they will be intolerant to another statin. The patient should talk to their health care provider for additional options. Physicians must be proactive in asking about symptoms, and the use of open-ended questions can be a valuable tool for this, either at the beginning or the conclusion of the session. An important question apart from "How are you doing?" is "What are you doing?" This type of question helps tease out information.

### Insights into statin intolerance [^112aiaLE]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

- **Statin intolerance and treatment goals**: Are patients with statin intolerance still able to achieve the treatment goals that have been set for them? In regard to the concept of LDL-C targets in relation to statin intolerance, a physician may face the conflict of achieving their desired goals in the face of intolerance. Unique challenges will frequently arise in this population. The ACC/AHA Guidelines are recommendations; they are not mandates and are not intended to replace clinical judgment.

- **Alternative treatments**: There are alternative drugs that can be prescribed to lower LDL-C, including niacin, bile acid sequestrants, and cholesterol absorption inhibitors (e.g. ezetimibe). The latter has been shown to provide added efficacy in terms of cardiovascular disease event reduction over simvastatin in acute coronary syndrome patients, as indicated in the recent Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial (IMPROVE-IT) clinical trial presented at the AHA in November 2014.

- **Diagnostic coding for statin intolerance**: What diagnostic code do you use for statin intolerance? Statin intolerance is a very broad clinical issue, but there is nothing in the electronic records to document this, making outcomes research difficult to quantify. The enormity of the problem is probably under-recognized, as there is no way to capture this either in the coding or in the billing. Electronic health records may have it in the problem list, but it is not captured with a specific code. It is not an allergy and is oftentimes misclassified as an allergy. It would be beneficial to have a diagnostic way to place these patients into a specific category.

### Statins and the neuromuscular system: A neurologist's perspective [^113sH8nA]. European Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Statin intolerance is primarily due to their side effects on the neuromuscular system, particularly affecting muscle. This has become an important issue due to the significant cardiovascular risk reduction associated with this class of drugs. However, the facts related to these side effects are sometimes under-recognized or controversial. A literature review of recent developments in the field is provided. The clinical definition of statin myopathy and its presentation is not suitable for the myology field. Management and prevention strategies have not been validated. More genetic risk factors need to be established. Neurologists should become more involved in evaluating and managing statin intolerance.

Regarding medical management for statin-induced myopathy, more specifically with respect to treatment modifications, AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining reassessment in patients with non-severe statin-associated side effects. They suggest offering a rechallenge to achieve a maximal LDL-C reduction through a modified dosing regimen, an alternate statin, or in combination with non-statin therapy.

### Once-a-week rosuvastatin (2.5 to 20 mg) in patients with a previous statin intolerance [^115NXSs4]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of rosuvastatin dosed once a week in patients with a previous statin adverse event. Rosuvastatin, once-a-week, was tolerated by 37 (74%) of the 50 study participants, with doses ranging from 2.5 mg to 20 mg a week (mean 10 ± 4 mg). Patients tolerating the once-a-week regimen experienced a 17% reduction in total cholesterol, 23% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 12% reduction in triglycerides, and a 5% increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (all p < 0.001) during a mean follow-up of 4 months ± 2.

Although this alternative dosing regimen has not been proven to reduce cardiovascular events, it may provide a therapeutic option for patients who may otherwise go without the proven benefits of statin therapy. In conclusion, this dosing strategy was well tolerated in patients with a history of an adverse event to one or more statins and led to significant lipoprotein changes.

Regarding medical management for statin-induced myopathy, more specifically with respect to treatment modifications, the 2019 guidelines recommend considering switching to non-statin therapy likely to provide a net clinical benefit in patients at increased ASCVD risk with severe statin-associated muscle symptoms or persistent statin-associated muscle symptoms despite an appropriate statin rechallenge.

### Insights into statin intolerance [^112uVZ1e]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

- **What are patients willing to tolerate with respect to muscle pain**: Stiffness in a pattern similar to that seen with arthritis does occur with statins, contradicting a broad general opinion that it does not occur. It may be detrimental to describe myalgia for patients with brochures and pamphlets, as it then becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Reporting biases emerge; when asked if they are experiencing aches and pains, most patients will respond affirmatively.

- **Should patients accept muscle pain from statin use**: Dr. Wong suggests considering niacin, for example; if a patient experiences flushing on niacin, it indicates the drug is working. The question then becomes: at what level should muscle pains be considered intolerable if the patient expects them to occur? It is important to differentiate between myalgia, myositis, and rhabdomyolysis. Even if a patient has myalgia without CK elevations, if they cannot tolerate the statin, it is considered statin intolerance.

- **If a patient is intolerant of one statin, is it appropriate to try another**: Often, many different statins must be tried before success is achieved, contrary to the opinion that 2 to 3 is the maximum that should be tried. The specific definition of intolerance is the inability to tolerate ≥ 2 statins, one at the highest prescribed daily dose, and the second at any daily dose. This is the regulatory and clinical-trial definition. It is a problematic definition because two iterations may not be enough, given the heterogeneity of response among individual patients.

### Overcoming challenges with statin therapy [^111kefks]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Adherence markedly affects outcomes in high-risk patients. In a recent study of guideline-based treatment in peripheral vascular disease, patients adhering to all four therapies had a nearly 40% reduction in major cardiovascular events and a 45% reduction in adverse limb events. Inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl–coenzyme A reductase (HMG‐CoA [statins]) markedly reduce cardiovascular risk, particularly in high-risk patients. In a large meta-analysis of clinical trials, each 1 mmol/L reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduced cardiovascular events by just over 20%; importantly, this benefit was independent of the baseline LDL cholesterol. The authors concluded that a reduction of LDL cholesterol by 2 to 3 mmol/L would reduce occlusive vascular events by about 40% to 50%.

Stopping a medication that reduces risk by half is equivalent to doubling risk. It is, therefore, an important problem that so many patients stop statins. Evidence now supports statin treatment in primary prevention, and recent revision of guidelines on the treatment of cholesterol will result in statin treatment of many more patients. Therefore, persistence with statin therapy is an issue that is increasing in importance.

In discussion with patients who believe they are experiencing adverse effects of statins, it is important to evaluate the likelihood that the symptoms are caused by statins or by some other cause. A history of probably causal adverse effects (myalgia, cramps, weakness), particularly with the repeat occurrence of adverse effects, should be considered.

### Statin intolerance: A literature review and management strategies [^116saeR9]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Statin intolerance is a commonly encountered clinical problem for which useful management strategies exist. Although many patients report statin-related muscle symptoms, studies indicate that most patients can tolerate a statin upon re-challenge. Alternative statin dosing strategies are an effective way to modify and reintroduce statin therapy for patients reporting adverse symptoms. Correction of vitamin D deficiency and hypothyroidism may improve statin tolerability in some patients.

CoQ10 supplementation has been found to be of no benefit for statin-related muscle symptoms in most recent clinical trials. PCSK9 inhibitors are a new therapeutic option that, if confirmed as safe and effective by outcomes trials, may be of substantial benefit to select patients at high ASCVD risk who are unable to achieve adequate low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering on maximally tolerated statin therapy. Other available medications to lower LDL-C in statin-intolerant patients include ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, niacin, and fibrates.

### Meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials on the prevalence of statin intolerance [^115p8FZB]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

The prevalence of intolerance varies widely. Stopping statin therapy is associated with worse outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease. Despite extensive studies, the benefits and risks of statins continue to be debated by clinicians and the lay public. We searched the PubMed, Medline, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases for all randomized controlled trials of statins compared with placebo. Studies were included if they had ≥ 1,000 participants, had patients who were followed up for ≥ 1 year, and reported rates of drug discontinuation. Studies were pooled as per the random effects model. A total of 22 studies (statins = 66,024, placebo = 63,656) met the inclusion criteria.

The pooled analysis showed that, over a mean follow-up of 4.1 years, the rates of discontinuation were 13.3% (8,872 patients) for statin-treated patients and 13.9% (8,898 patients) for placebo-treated patients. The random effects model showed no significant difference between the placebo and statin arms (odds ratio [OR] = 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.93 to 1.06). The results were similar for both primary prevention (OR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.92 to 1.05, p = 0.39) and secondary prevention (OR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.83 to 1.05, p = 0.43) studies. The pooled analysis suggested that the rates of myopathy were also similar between the statins and placebos (OR = 1.2, 95% CI = 0.88 to 1.62, p = 0.25). In conclusion, this meta-analysis of over 125,000 patients suggests that the rate of drug discontinuation and myopathy does not significantly differ between statin- and placebo-treated patients.

In regard to specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, particularly for patients with ASCVD and acute coronary syndrome, the EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend initiating or continuing high-dose statins as early as possible. This is advised for all patients with acute coronary syndrome who do not have any contraindications or a definite history of intolerance, regardless of their initial LDL-C levels.

### Insights into statin intolerance [^114LH1xa]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

- **Stringency in the definition of statin intolerance**: Statin intolerance is elusive and highly variable. In the emerging era of patient-centered medicine, statin intolerance should be redefined in this context, consistent with what is seen in the clinic. It is equally important to define what statin intolerance is not, as there are patients not receiving statins who could benefit from such therapy but are inaccurately branded as intolerant.

- **Nature of statin intolerance — absolute or spectrum**: Dr. Kopecky identifies three broad groups of statin-intolerant patients. The first group includes those who experience symptoms upon taking a statin. The symptoms disappear when the drug is discontinued, but they return when starting another statin. The second group experiences every ache and pain regardless of the drug prescribed. The third group includes patients unwilling to begin statin therapy due to fear of intolerance, constituting the largest group needing intervention. They are well-informed about potential side effects, so the focus should be on educating them about the benefits of statins.

- **Existence of a treatment algorithm**: The panel agrees that Figure 1, as recently published in the Journal of Clinical Lipidology, represents an appropriate algorithmic approach for evaluating statin-associated muscle injury.

### Simulation of the impact of statin intolerance on the need for ezetimibe and/or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor for meeting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals in a population with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^1148cP8J]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

In a population with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, previous research indicated that approximately 86% can achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of < 70 mg/dL with oral lipid-lowering therapies (LLT) only, whereas 14% would require a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor. We aim to estimate these values accounting for varying levels of statin intolerance.

A simulation model described previously was used to estimate the utilization of LLT needed to achieve LDL-C < 70 mg/dL via an intensification algorithm which maximized statins before adding ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor. The analysis took into account varying background rates of statin intolerance. We defined statin intolerance as either partial (inability to tolerate high-intensity statin) or full (inability to tolerate any statin).

With treatment intensification and 10% of patients having partial statin intolerance, the use of ezetimibe (± statin ± PCSK9 inhibitor) increased from 32.7% to 34.9%, and the need for a PCSK9 inhibitor (+ ezetimibe ± statin) increased from 14.0% to 15.5%. If, instead, 10% were fully statin intolerant, the use of ezetimibe (± statin ± PCSK9 inhibitor) increased from 32.7% to 38.5%, and the use of a PCSK9 inhibitor (+ ezetimibe ± statin) increased from 14.0% to 19.7%.

In conclusion, in our simulation-based study, partial statin intolerance increased the need for nonstatins only modestly (by an absolute 2.2%), whereas having 10% of patients with full statin intolerance increased the need for PCSK9 inhibitors from 14% overall to approximately 19.7%.

### Intolerance to statins: Mechanisms and management [^117ShN5b]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Statins are considered very effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients. However, although adherence to statins improves morbidity and mortality, it remains suboptimal. One of the most important causes of nonadherence is the so-called statin intolerance, mainly because of muscle-related symptoms. These symptoms most often consist of myalgia unaccompanied by significant creatine kinase (CK) elevations. Less often, myositis (elevated CK > 10 times the upper limit of normal) or rhabdomyolysis (CK level > 10,000 IU/L or accompanied by significant elevation in creatinine level) develops.

In randomized controlled trials, the incidence of statin myopathy is approximately 1.5–5.0%. However, this low incidence may be misleading for several reasons. First, in most studies, patients with a history of statin intolerance were excluded. Other studies had a single-blinded statin run-in phase, and patients experiencing muscle-related symptoms or CK elevations during this phase were excluded. Patients who tend to be at risk for developing muscle-related symptoms, such as women, elderly patients, and patients with significant comorbidity, who comprise a large proportion of statin-treated patients in real-life settings, are underrepresented in randomized controlled trials. Some studies have defined muscle-related effects by elevated CK levels only, disregarding myalgia. Last but not least, patients enrolled in studies might be motivated and thus minimize reporting of mild myalgias, leading to underestimation of the magnitude of the problem.

### Simvastatin [^111cjSTL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Postmarketing experience of simvastatin has revealed several adverse reactions during its post-approval use. Since these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, their frequency or causal relationship with drug exposure cannot always be reliably estimated.

- **Body as a whole**: Fever, chills, malaise, asthenia.

- **Blood and lymphatic system disorders**: Anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, positive ANA, ESR increase, eosinophilia.

- **Gastrointestinal disorders**: Pancreatitis, vomiting.

- **Hepatic and pancreatic disorders**: Hepatitis/jaundice, fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure.

- **Immune system disorders**: Hypersensitivity syndrome including anaphylaxis, angioedema, lupus erythematosus-like syndrome, dermatomyositis, vasculitis.

- **Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders**: Muscle cramps, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, polymyalgia rheumatica, arthritis.

- **Nervous system disorders**: Dizziness, depression, paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy. There are rare reports of cognitive impairment (e.g. memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) in association with statin use. Such cognitive impairment was generally non-serious and reversible upon discontinuation of statin, with a variable time to symptom onset (ranging from 1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). Rare reports include new-onset or exacerbation of myasthenia gravis, including ocular myasthenia, with recurrences reported when the same or different statin was administered.

- **Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders**: Pruritus.

### Overcoming challenges with statin therapy [^113aAyy4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Poor persistence with statin therapy is an important and common problem that can be mitigated. Many common reasons for stopping statins are invalid. Pharmacists need to provide better information to patients receiving statins, and physicians need to be better able to help their high-risk patients persist with therapy.

The main causally related adverse effect of statins is impaired insulin resistance, with a risk of diabetes and myopathy. Both of these problems are probably largely caused by impaired mitochondrial function from depletion of ubiquinone. Although new therapies to lower LDL cholesterol are in development, statins will still be needed for some time, and statin adverse effects can be minimized by several maneuvers.

Regarding preventative measures for statin-induced myopathy, specifically in relation to pretreatment assessment, the ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend recognizing that additional characteristics, such as a history of hemorrhagic stroke or Asian ancestry, can also modify the decision to use higher statin intensities.
