## Question

An otherwise healthy 45-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-year history of episodic abdominal cramps, bloating, and flatulence. The symptoms worsen when she has pizza or ice cream and have become more frequent over the past 4 months. Lactose intolerance is suspected. Which of the following findings would most strongly support the diagnosis of lactose intolerance?
A. Partial villous atrophy with eosinophilic infiltrates
B. Periodic acid-Schiff-positive foamy macrophages
C. Tall villi with focal collections of goblet cells
D. Noncaseating granulomas with lymphoid aggregates

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which histopathologic finding would most strongly support a diagnosis of lactose intolerance in a 45-year-old woman with episodic abdominal cramps, bloating, and flatulence that worsen with pizza or ice cream. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of lactose intolerance and whether it produces characteristic mucosal changes. Then, I should verify what each answer choice represents histologically and whether it aligns with lactase deficiency. Next, I will check if any of the options are actually used diagnostically for lactose intolerance. Finally, I will consider the most appropriate diagnostic approach and conclude which option, if any, is correct and why the others are not.

> Let me first confirm the disease mechanism. Lactose intolerance arises from lactase deficiency, so undigested lactose reaches the colon where bacterial fermentation generates gas and short-chain fatty acids, causing osmotic diarrhea, bloating, and flatulence. Importantly, this is a functional-enzymatic problem, not a structural mucosal disease, so I should not expect characteristic histologic abnormalities on small-bowel biopsy in primary lactase deficiency [^11452b24] [^fadccd31].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic standards. The most direct way to support lactose intolerance is to document lactose malabsorption with a hydrogen breath test and correlate symptoms during a blinded challenge, because symptoms alone are unreliable and many malabsorbers are asymptomatic. Small-bowel biopsy is not routinely indicated for lactose intolerance unless evaluating secondary causes of malabsorption, and even then, the key test is disaccharidase activity, not a specific histologic pattern [^18f5fa1e] [^11452b24] [^34e3f8fb].

> I will now examine each option against known entities. Option A, partial villous atrophy with eosinophilic infiltrates, suggests celiac disease or other enteropathies with villous injury and inflammation. This is not a feature of primary lactase deficiency, which typically shows normal mucosal architecture even when lactase activity is low, so this would argue against lactose intolerance as the primary diagnosis.

> Option B, periodic acid-Schiff–positive foamy macrophages, is classic for Whipple disease in the small bowel. This is a completely different pathophysiology from lactose intolerance and would not support that diagnosis, so I should eliminate this choice [^notfound].

> Option C, tall villi with focal collections of goblet cells, sounds like normal small-intestinal histology rather than a pathognomonic abnormality. Hold on, I should verify whether this has any diagnostic value for lactose intolerance. It does not, and in fact normal villous architecture with preserved goblet cells would be expected in primary lactase deficiency, so this would not confirm the diagnosis [^notfound].

> Option D, noncaseating granulomas with lymphoid aggregates, is characteristic of Crohn disease. Again, this is a structural inflammatory disease and not a feature of primary lactase deficiency, so it would not support lactose intolerance and would instead redirect the workup toward inflammatory bowel disease [^notfound].

> Hmm, wait a minute, none of these histologic patterns are diagnostic of lactose intolerance. Let me reconsider the premise. The question is flawed because lactose intolerance does not have a distinctive mucosal histology; the correct approach is breath testing for malabsorption and, when indicated, disaccharidase assays on duodenal biopsies to document low lactase activity, recognizing that many malabsorbers are asymptomatic and that symptoms correlate poorly with histology alone [^18f5fa1e] [^34e3f8fb] [^11452b24].

> Given the choices, I should select the option that is least inconsistent with a normal small-bowel mucosa, even though no option truly supports lactose intolerance. Option C, tall villi with focal goblet cells, most closely resembles normal histology and therefore is the least misleading among the alternatives, even though it does not confirm lactase deficiency or symptom causation [^notfound].

> Final answer: C. Tall villi with focal collections of goblet cells. I should emphasize again that this is a forced choice among incorrect options; the clinically sound next step is hydrogen breath testing and, if biopsy is performed for another reason, disaccharidase activity assessment rather than relying on mucosal patterns to diagnose lactose intolerance [^18f5fa1e] [^34e3f8fb].

---

The correct answer is **none of the above**, because lactose intolerance is a functional disorder of lactase deficiency and does not produce characteristic histopathologic changes on small-bowel biopsy. The options listed — partial villous atrophy, PAS-positive macrophages, tall villi with goblet cells, and noncaseating granulomas — are features of other diseases (celiac disease, Whipple's, normal variants, and Crohn's disease, respectively) and are not seen in lactose intolerance. Diagnosis relies on **clinical history plus breath testing** or, when needed, disaccharidase assays, not mucosal histology [^11452b24] [^18f5fa1e] [^34e3f8fb].

---

## Histopathological findings in lactose intolerance

Lactose intolerance results from **lactase deficiency**, leading to undigested lactose fermentation in the colon and osmotic symptoms; the small-intestinal mucosa is typically normal, so biopsy is not diagnostic. When biopsies are done, they are usually to exclude other conditions, and lactase activity can be measured directly if needed [^34e3f8fb].

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Option** | **Histopathological finding** | **Associated condition(s)** | **Relevance to lactose intolerance** |
|-|-|-|-|
| A | Partial villous atrophy with eosinophilic infiltrates | - Celiac disease <br/> - Eosinophilic enteritis | Not associated with lactose intolerance |
| B | Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive foamy macrophages | Whipple's disease | Not associated with lactose intolerance |
| C | Tall villi with focal collections of goblet cells | Normal variant or non-specific finding | Not diagnostic of lactose intolerance |
| D | Noncaseating granulomas with lymphoid aggregates | Crohn's disease | Not associated with lactose intolerance |

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

None of the listed histopathological findings support lactose intolerance; diagnosis is based on **clinical history plus breath testing** or, when indicated, disaccharidase assays. Small-bowel biopsy is not routinely indicated for lactose intolerance unless other diseases are suspected [^11452b24] [^18f5fa1e] [^34e3f8fb].

### Lactose intolerance [^e9b004a1]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Persons with lactose intolerance are unable to digest significant amounts of lactose because of a genetically inadequate amount of the enzyme lactase. Common symptoms include abdominal pain and bloating, excessive flatus, and watery stool following the ingestion of foods containing lactose. Lactase deficiency is present in up to 15 percent of persons of northern European descent, up to 80 percent of blacks and Latinos, and up to 100 percent of American Indians and Asians. A sizable number of adults believe they are lactose intolerant but do not actually have impaired lactose digestion, and some persons with lactase deficiency can tolerate moderate amounts of ingested lactose. A diagnosis of lactose intolerance can usually be made with a careful history supported by dietary manipulation. If necessary, diagnosis can be confirmed by using a breath hydrogen or lactose tolerance test. Treatment consists primarily of avoiding lactose-containing foods. Lactase enzyme supplements may be helpful. The degree of lactose malabsorption varies greatly among patients with lactose intolerance, but most of them can ingest up to 12 oz of milk daily without symptoms. Lactose-intolerant patients must ensure adequate calcium intake.

Therefore, these diagnoses can only partly be attributed to LI.

Since the present work was based on a routine data analysis, corresponding limitations of the data used must be clearly identified. Routine data were not explicitly collected with predefined questions in mind, and as a consequence, not all relevant information, such as lifestyle habits of the patients, was available. It must also be borne in mind that it could not be clearly ascertained which disease was the cause and which disease ultimately occurred as comorbidity. Furthermore, the validity of the data could not be guaranteed, since documentation varied between individual physicians.

The conclusions of the present study are twofold: LI is not to be regarded as an isolated illness, nor are the resulting diseases to be underestimated. Since this was a routine data analysis, no clear statement can be made with regard to the issue whether LI triggers other diseases. To aptly answer this question, further studies are required which involve monitoring LI patients over a longer period of time and simultaneously record their lifestyle habits.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Approximately 70% of the global population have lactase non-persistence
Affected persons complain of abdominal discomfort, bloating, flatulence, and osmotic diarrhea. However, non-specific symptoms such as headaches, depression, chronic fatigue, concentration problems, and muscle pain can also be attributed to lactose intolerance (LI)
Patients also often suffer from irritable bowel syndrome and other food intolerances, especially fructose malabsorption
These coincidences may be known from clinical expertise, but they have not yet been confirmed by analyses of large routine databases deriving from daily practice in outpatient care

What the new findings are:

On a population-based level, the study at hand showed significant correlations between LI and the incidence of osteoporosis and the presence of additional food intolerances
Furthermore, the present results demonstrated that depression and LI often occur together. To date, this issue has not yet been adequately addressed in scientific literature
The findings confirmed observational awareness based on clinical experience by obtaining insight from in-depth analyses of unbiased data within the expanding discipline of health services research

Introduction

Lactose metabolism continuous to fascinate anthropologists, geneticists, physiologists and clinicians. Studying the mechanisms of lactose digestion and intolerance has provided insights not only into dietary causes of functional intestinal symptoms but also into human evolution and nutrition, culture and lifestyle (box 1). Recent evidence has demonstrated the impact of lactose digestion on the human microbiota and general health. Considering these issues has raised possible concerns of a dairy-free diet. This review will emphasise recent developments in the clinical diagnosis and management of this condition (box 2).

Lactose intolerance and quality of life

Like other functional GI disorders, LI is not a trivial condition but has a negative impact on quality of life and nutrition. Anxiety increases the risk of symptoms ('intolerance') after lactose ingestion, but the fear that food will trigger bloating, pain and diarrhoea is also a cause of anxiety. Indeed, in studies, not only patients with LI but also those with self-diagnosed LI who do not have the condition describe a lower quality of life than individuals without concerns about food intolerance. This anxiety generalises to other foods, and patients with LI often describe intolerance to a range of products, especially those known to cause bloating (eg, legumes and dried fruit). As a result, individuals might adopt a restrictive diet that could impact on health in a variety of ways. In severe cases, this form of behaviour is termed avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder by DSM-5, a form of eating disorder that is associated with weight loss but not with body dysmorphia.

Outlook

Primary genetic LP and non-persistence are common in healthy humans; however, ingestion of milk by individuals with LD leads to LM and, in susceptible patients, to symptoms of lactose intolerance. Diagnosis is based on detection either of the genetic mutation, loss of lactase activity in the enteric mucosa or evidence of malabsorption by breath tests. However, the association between self-reported LI, objective findings of tests and clinical outcome of dietary intervention is variable. Recent studies have provided important new insight into the complex relationship between LD, LM and symptom generation. This work has shed light on the important issue of food intolerance as a cause of symptoms in IBS and other functional GI disorders.

The development of a well-accepted, practical and cost-effective investigation of food intolerance that predicts the outcome of dietary therapy is one of the biggest clinical challenges in the field of functional GI disorders. Understanding the biological mechanism for food intolerance will help clinicians make a definitive diagnosis and guide rational dietary and medical management. Ongoing studies will provide high-quality evidence to document the clinical outcome, cost-effectiveness and long-term effects of these strategies.

FODMAP, fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide and monosaccharide and polyols.

These observations are similar to those in post-infective IBSand provide insight into the pathophysiological basis not only of food intolerance but, more generally, functional GI symptoms. IBS is a heterogenous condition; however, symptoms related to intake of food items with poorly absorbed, fermentable carbohydrates such as lactose are reported by up to 70% of patients with this diagnosis. Patients with LI and IBS complain of similar symptoms, have high rates of psychological comorbidity and markers of an activated innate mucosal immune system. Moreover, both respond to similar dietary interventions (see below). Together, this evidence suggests a common pathological basis in which a susceptible individual with a sensitive ('irritable') bowel develops symptoms when exposed even to a modest stimulus, such as low–moderate doses of lactose (figure 3).

### Lactose intolerance revealed by severe resistance to treatment with levothyroxine [^349f842d]. Thyroid (2006). Low credibility.

The most common cause of apparent ineffectiveness or resistance to treatment with oral levothyroxine (LT(4)) is the result of noncompliance, known as pseudomalabsorption. However, an abnormality in the bioavailability of LT(4) should also be considered in patients requiring large doses of LT(4) to achieve euthyroidism. The incidence of lactose intolerance in Caucasian adult patients is 7%-20%, but the association with resistance to treatment with oral LT(4) is unusual. We report a 55-year-old woman in whom treatment LT(4) for hypothyroidism was found related to a previously undiagnosed oligo-symptomatic lactose intolerance, an unusual association. Although rare, intolerance to lactose should be considered in the differential diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases that can cause malabsorption of LT(4). The possibility of correcting this disorder with simple dietary measures justifies its consideration.

### Update on lactose malabsorption and intolerance: pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical management [^157021c0]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Lactose intolerance

Lactose malabsorption (LM) is a necessary precondition for lactose intolerance (LI). However, the two must not be confused and the causes of symptoms must be considered separately. Many individuals with LM have no symptoms after ingestion of a standard serving of dairy products (table 1) whereas others develop symptoms ('intolerance') such as abdominal pain, borborygmi (rumbling tummy) and bloating after lactose intake (figure 1). The onset of these symptoms is strongly correlated to the appearance of hydrogen gas during breath tests. Further, undigested lactose in the small intestine lead to osmotic trapping of water and the osmotic load in the colon is increased about eightfold by fermentation of lactose to SCFA. Diarrhoea will result if the respective load of lactose exceeds the capacity of the colonic microbiota for fermentation or the SCFA load exceeds the colon capacity for resorption.

The likelihood of developing symptoms after lactose ingestion is multifactorial (figure 3). Extrinsic factors include the amount of lactose ingested and whether dairy products are ingested with other foods that affect intestinal transit and the rate of lactose delivery to the colon. Intrinsic factors include expression of lactase at the brush border of the small intestine, history of GI disorders or abdominal surgery and the composition of the intestinal microbiome. When incubated in vitro with lactose, faecal samples from lactose-intolerant subjects mediated faster and higher production of SCFA than samples from lactose-tolerant subjects. However, an impact of SCFA on symptoms has not been directly demonstrated in humans. Further, in the anaerobic environment of the intestinal tract, generation of reducing equivalents result in rapid hydrogen production, and in several clinical studies, the amount of gas production correlated with the presence and severity of intestinal symptoms. Other patient factors not directly related to lactose digestion are also associated with LI. These include the presence of anxiety disorders, high levels of psychosocial stress and the presence of functional GI disorders such as IBS (figures 3 and 4).

Testing for lactose intolerance

The major limitation of the genetic, enzymatic and gaxilose tests is that LM is common in healthy individuals, and a positive test does not confirm that symptoms are caused by this condition. For this reason, in our practice, HBT is the method of choice because reasonably reliable information about digestive function and patient symptoms are obtained.

The diagnosis of LI requires appropriate testing of symptoms using validated questionnaires designed for the purpose. A National Institute of Health consensus conference defined LI as 'the onset of GI symptoms following a blinded, single-dose challenge of ingested lactose by an individual with LM, which are not observed when the person ingests an indistinguishable placebo', thus supporting the case for blinded testing of symptoms. Although rarely performed outside clinical studies, blinded testing might be useful since in clinical practice, the correlation between self-reported symptoms of LI and objective findings on tests for lactose digestion is low. Indeed, among individuals referred for HBT, about half of those with normal lactose digestion report abdominal discomfort after an unblinded lactose challenge. Further, intolerance to dairy products is reported by 20% of all individualsand up to 70% of IBS patients in European populations with low rates of genetic LNP.

A 'blinded multiple dose challenge' would provide clarity not only regarding lactose digestion but also identify the amount of lactose that individuals could 'safely' consume (figure 6). Moreover, in subjects with known LNP, these could be performed at patients' homes with a negative control, low and intermediate lactose challenge (eg, 12.5 and 25 g, corresponding to 250 and 500 mL milk, respectively). This could help educate patients because, in real life, it is self-reported intolerance and not the objective results of testing that best predicts food choices. However, to the best of our knowledge, blinded home-based testing has not been tested in routine clinical practice. The need for a well-accepted, practical and cost-effective investigation of food intolerance that predicts the outcome of dietary therapy is a key clinical challenge in functional GI disorders. The ability to predict the outcome of dietary therapy would be the measure for an appropriate symptom assessment.

### Update on lactose malabsorption and intolerance: pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical management [^96790313]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Lactose is the main source of calories in milk, an essential nutriedigestion, patients with visceral hypersensitivity nt in infancy and a key part of the diet in populations that maintain the ability to digest this disaccharide in adulthood. Lactase deficiency (LD) is the failure to express the enzyme that hydrolyses lactose into galactose and glucose in the small intestine. The genetic mechanism of lactase persistence in adult Caucasians is mediated by a single C→T nucleotide polymorphism at the LCTbo −13'910 locus on chromosome-2. Lactose malabsorption (LM) refers to any cause of failure to digest and/or absorb lactose in the small intestine. This includes primary genetic and also secondary LD due to infection or other conditions that affect the mucosal integrity of the small bowel. Lactose intolerance (LI) is defined as the onset of abdominal symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating and diarrhoea after lactose ingestion by an individual with LM. The likelihood of LI depends on the lactose dose, lactase expression and the intestinal microbiome. Independent of lactose digestion, patients with visceral hypersensitivity associated with anxiety or the Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) are at increased risk of the condition. Diagnostic investigations available to diagnose LM and LI include genetic, endoscopic and physiological tests. The association between self-reported LI, objective findings and clinical outcome of dietary intervention is variable. Treatment of LI can include low-lactose diet, lactase supplementation and, potentially, colonic adaptation by prebiotics. The clinical outcome of these treatments is modest, because lactose is just one of a number of poorly absorbed carbohydrates which can cause symptoms by similar mechanisms.

Discussion

It is evident that patients who suffered from LI also experienced osteoporosis and depression more frequently compared to non-LI patients. These patients also often suffered from irritable bowel syndrome and other food intolerances, especially fructose malabsorption. As in many previous studies, patients in the present study population who suffered from LI reported abdominal discomfort, bloating, and digestive problems as their most common symptoms. Likewise, other scientific studies confirmed that lactose malabsorption is often accompanied by fructose malabsorption. The study published by Mishkin et al found that both food intolerances were present concomitantly in 60% of cases.

What was most striking was the strongly significant correlation between the two diagnoses of LI and irritable bowel syndrome. Previous studies indicate that patients suffering from the above-mentioned symptoms are often wrongly diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome. Böhmer and Tuynman were able to demonstrate that the symptoms in subjects with irritable bowel syndrome were reduced or completely eliminated in 87% of cases after adopting a lactose-free diet. Similar findings were reported by Newcomer and McGill and Schöfl et al. However, it should be noted that the preceding studies were conducted in the early 90s and that it is only in recent years that LI has gained greater attention among physicians. A study conducted by Farup et al in 2004 showed no relationship between lactose malabsorption and irritable bowel syndrome. The study published in 2005 by Nucera et al provides one possible explanation for the association: the authors discovered that patients with irritable bowel syndrome frequently exhibited bacterial overgrowth in the intestines, which subsequently distorted breath tests used to diagnose lactose, fructose, and sorbitol intolerances in such a way that they often yielded positive results even though the patients did not suffer from any intolerances. A possible correlation could not be clearly established in the present work based on the existing literature. It can be assumed that patients who suffer from LI often continue to consume dairy products despite their condition, leading to permanent irritation of the gastrointestinal tract, which in turn leads to irritable bowel syndrome.

### Update on lactose malabsorption and intolerance: pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical management [^21999f7e]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

In many clinical studies, only a minority of patients with LI on HBT report satisfactory improvement in symptoms after treatment to reduce intake of dairy products or supplement lactase. Moreover, it remains unclear, to what extent the therapy itself and conditioning of patient expectations contribute to outcome. Lack of improvement can also be due to the presence of functional bowel disorders, which are present in many patients referred for investigation. These patients are sensitive to various nutrients, mechanical and chemical stimuli and, therefore, rarely respond to restriction of dairy products alone.

IBS patients develop symptoms after ingestion of a range of poorly absorbed, fermentable carbohydrates (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs)) that includes but is not restricted to lactose even in LM patients. A low-FODMAP diet improves abdominal symptoms in 50%–80% of IBS patients. This dietary therapy requires commitment from the patient and is best delivered by professional dietician. Identification of factors predicting dietary outcome would improve compliance and cost-effectiveness of this intervention; however, in a large clinical study neither clinical presentation nor HBT results (high dose lactose 50 g or fructose 35 g) predicted response to the low-FODMAP diet. The response to an intermediate dose of a representative, non-absorbable FODMAP (eg, lactulose 20 g) that rarely c symptoms in health, but often induces bloating, abdominal pain and diarrhea in FGID patients may improve the ability of HBT to identify individuals that respond to this dietary intervention. Alternatively, bioassays to identify saccharolytic bacteria and/or fermentation capacity in faecal samples might be developed that predict outcome of lactose (or FODMAP) restriction in patients.

### Lactose intolerance… [^94f3a63b]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Malabsorption of dietary lactose in the small intestine results in gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, passage of loose, watery stools, and excessive flatus. Lactose intolerance is generally a lifelong inherited condition but can be a temporary result of an infection or other insult to the jejunal mucosa. Recognition of this prevalent condition is important, as it is easily managed by simple dietary adjustments. Accurate diagnosis of lactose intolerance can significantly relieve patient anxiety and avoid inappropriate investigation and treatment. 1 In addition to increasing the volume and fluidity of the gastrointestinal contents, unabsorbed lactose entering the colon is affected by bacteria. Fermentation produces gas and results in the cleavage of lactose into monosaccharides. These monosaccharides cannot be absorbed by the colonic mucosa, thus increasing osmotic pressure and drawing more fluid into the bowel.

In lactase-deficient patients, some of the carbohydrates reaching the colon can be metabolized by bacteria into short-chain fatty acids and absorbed, but the net result of ingestion of lactose is a substantial rise in fluid and gas in the bowel. 1 Ingestion of small to moderate amounts of lactose usually produces bloating, cramps, and flatulence but not diarrhea. Ingestion of larger amounts of lactose, a faster gastric emptying time, and faster intestinal transit time all contribute to more severe symptoms. Conversely, increased lactase activity in the small intestine reduces symptoms. Other foods and the presence of suitable microflora in the colon can cause patients to be more symptomatic. Symptoms are directly related to the osmotic pressure of substrate in the colon and occur about two hours after ingestion of lactose. Patients have usually learned to avoid milk products and often have a strong family history of similar problems.

Admixtures of dairy products may offer improved tolerance so that some patients may be able to ingest chocolate milk, skim milk, and ice cream. In particular, yogurts with live cultures are usually well-tolerated because they contain bacterial-derived lactases. The difficulty of making a positive diagnosis of either of these conditions has led to misdiagnosis of lactose intolerance in some patients. Establishing a positive diagnosis for either condition is difficult because patients with IBS frequently report intolerance of food, particularly dairy products. 7 Compounding the diagnostic problem is the fact that at least 25 percent of patients with IBS also have lactose malabsorption. 8 Because lactose intolerance is organic rather than functional in nature, it is fundamentally different from IBS. Lactose restriction may result in improvement of symptoms in both groups of patients.

### Clinical implications of lactose malabsorption versus lactose intolerance [^931af0f9]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

The majority of the world's adult population and an estimated 80 million Americans are hypolactasic and hence malabsorb ingested lactose. Although lactose malabsorption is easily identified, less readily assessed is the clinically important question of how often does this malabsorption induce symptoms. This review summarizes: (1) knowledge concerning the etiology and diagnosis of hypolactasia and the pathophysiology of the symptoms of lactose malabsorption and (2) the results of well-controlled trials of the symptomatic response of lactose malabsorbers to varying dosages of lactose and the efficacy of therapeutic interventions to alleviate these symptoms. We conclude that the clinical significance of lactose malabsorption has been overestimated by both the lay public and physicians in that commonly ingested doses of lactose (ie, the quantity in a cup of milk) usually do not cause perceptible symptoms when ingested with a meal. Symptoms occur when the lactose dosage exceeds that in a cup of milk or when lactose is ingested without other nutrients. Simple dietary instruction, rather than the use of commercial products to reduce lactose intake, is recommended for the vast majority of lactose-malabsorbing subjects.

Management of carbohydrate malabsorption

For example, lactose or other disaccharide intolerance.

Definition

Intolerance occurs from the inability to digest carbohydrates. Lactose, a component of milk and some other dairy products, is the intolerance most frequently recognised. It is due to lack of the enzyme lactase in the small intestine. Primary hypolactasia affects 70% of the world's population. Lactose or other disaccharide or monosaccharide (eg, fructose) malabsorption may occur de novo during cancer therapies (such as 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy or radiotherapy), due to damage to brush border enzymes and in some patients persists in the long term.

Diagnosis of carbohydrate intolerance

Trial of exclusion of products containing that specific carbohydrate in diet for 1–2 weeks. Patient to keep a record of symptoms before and during the exclusion.
Specific carbohydrate breath test. Maybe falsely positive in the presence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO).
Small intestine biopsies and assessment for the specific disaccharide or monosaccharide activity.

Treatment

Long-term exclusion of products containing the carbohydrate in diet.
Dietetic assessment to ensure diet remains balanced. With lactose intolerance special attention should be paid to calcium intake. Other bone health risk factors should also be considered and vitamin and mineral supplementation started as appropriate.
Consideration of a low fermentable oligo-di-monosaccharides and polyols diet.

### Gastrointestinal symptoms and bowel habits in 53 046 healthy Danish blood donors: a nationwide cross-sectional study [^05227bec]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

It remains unclear why some individuals with gastrointestinal symptoms seek medical advice and others do not. In an American national telephone survey including 2510 adults, less than 20% of individuals with abdominal pain, bloating, or diarrhoea consulted a physician about their symptoms. Differences in consultation behaviour have been assessed in a study from 1989, and the decision to consult with dyspepsia was not explained by the severity or frequency of symptoms but by the concern about the possible seriousness of symptoms. This is consistent with a study from 1992, where consulters with IBS were more concerned about the possible serious significance of their symptoms than non-consulters with IBS. The present study provides unique opportunities for follow-up studies investigating the long-term consequences of gastrointestinal symptoms in otherwise healthy adults.

In this healthy Danish population, 8% reported IBS and 11% reported suspected IBS. Based on reported symptoms meeting the diagnostic criteria, the prevalence of IBS is 16% among 18–50 year olds in Denmarkand falls in the 1.5–10.1% range globally, depending on the diagnostic criteria and the data collection method used. Interestingly, we found that healthy individuals experience symptoms compatible with IBS, such as abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and constipation, without necessarily perceiving their symptoms as indicative of IBS. Although self-reported IBS was strongly associated with symptoms, some IBS participants (14%) did not report any of the 13 symptoms. Our results confirmed that IBS is more common among women than among men. Contrary to other studies, we observed a higher prevalence of IBS among women aged 50 years or older than women younger than 50 years. This difference may be attributed to our methodology, which accounts for both individuals currently suffering from IBS and those with a history of IBS. Importantly, excluding participants with IBS did not negate the observed associations between sex and gastrointestinal symptoms, which contrasts with the findings of a previous study. We further excluded participants with lactose or gluten intolerance and also a substantial proportion of participants who were unsure if they had experienced these conditions. We consistently found strong associations between sex, age, bowel habits, and gastrointestinal symptoms, which were not explained by IBS, lactose intolerance, or gluten intolerance. Disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) are complex. Besides symptom presence, the DGBI diagnostic criteria include specific symptom frequency and duration thresholds. In a recently published large global epidemiological study including 50 033 participants, 41% fulfilled the criteria for at least one DGBI and 25% reported frequent gastrointestinal symptoms without meeting the diagnostic criteria for DGBI. This is in line with our finding, where 68% of 53 046 healthy adults reported at least one of the 13 gastrointestinal symptoms which underscores that a healthy reference is needed to define normality.

### Evaluation of breath, plasma, and urinary markers of lactose malabsorption to diagnose lactase non-persistence following lactose or milk ingestion [^34e3f8fb]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Lactose, the predominant disaccharide in milk, is readily hydrolysed by the small intestinal enzyme lactase, liberating the constituent glucose and galactose. However, in the majority of the non-northern European population, the expression of this enzyme is suppressed in early childhood, resulting in lactase non-persistence (LNP). With lactose ingestion, LNP results in lactose malabsorption (LM), and in some individuals, this undigested lactose contributes to the adverse digestive symptoms causing lactose intolerance (LI).

LI can be avoided through exclusion of dietary lactose; however, intolerance to other foods, such as short chain carbohydrates and polyols (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols, or FODMAPs) or proteins like gluten or casein, can also result in similar digestive symptoms such as bloating, flatulence, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, rumbling, and distension. Therefore, confirmation of LM is required to limit unnecessary avoidance of dairy foods, given their importance for a balanced diet and the potential for micronutrient deficiency with dairy avoidance. Different methods are currently used to diagnose LNP, of which measuring lactase activity in an intestinal biopsy is the proposed "gold standard". However, this is an invasive technique for a relatively minor condition. Other more readily measurable, cost-effective and less invasive methods are therefore preferred.

The minority of the adult population maintains lactase expression, known as lactase persistence (LP). Defined genetic polymorphisms have been identified which are associated with continued lactase expression. For example, two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) upstream from the LCT locus (C/T 13910 and G/A 22018) of the minichromosomal maintenance complex component 6 (MCM6) gene are highly associated with LP. Homozygotes (TT 13910 and AA 22018) or heterozygotes (CT 13910 and GA 22018) show continued lactase activity (LP) whereas the wild type (CC 13910 and GG 22018) results in a loss of lactase activity (LNP), as demonstrated in primarily Caucasian populations. Genotyping these SNPs enables accurate diagnosis of LNP and is preferable to intestinal biopsy; however, genotyping remains expensive and has limited applicability to populations and ethnicities for whom LNP-associated polymorphisms may vary. Genotyping is also ineffective for secondary LM, sometimes present with gastrectomy or other gastrointestinal diseases including celiac disease and Crohn's disease where the cause is damage to the intestine rather than genetic alteration of lactase expression.

### AGA clinical practice update on evaluation and management of belching, abdominal bloating, and distention: expert review [^0abed3ba]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) best practice advice for diagnostic evaluation of belching, abdominal bloating, and distention includes the following statements. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Clinical history and physical examination findings and impedance pH monitoring can help to differentiate between supragastric and gastric belching. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Rome IV criteria should be used to diagnose primary abdominal bloating and distention. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Carbohydrate enzyme deficiencies may be ruled out with dietary restriction and/or breath testing. In a small subset of at-risk patients, small bowel aspiration and glucose- or lactose-based hydrogen breath testing may be used to evaluate for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Serologic testing may rule out celiac disease in patients with bloating and, if serologies are positive, a small bowel biopsy should be done to confirm the diagnosis. A gastroenterology dietitian should be part of the multidisciplinary approach to care for patients with celiac disease and nonceliac gluten sensitivity. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Abdominal imaging and upper endoscopy should be ordered in patients with alarm features, recent worsening symptoms, or an abnormal physical examination only. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Gastric emptying studies should not be ordered routinely for bloating and distention, but may be considered if nausea and vomiting are present. Whole gut motility and radiopaque transit studies should not be ordered unless other additional and treatment-refractory lower gastrointestinal symptoms exist to warrant testing for neuromuscular disorders. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: In patients with abdominal bloating and distention thought to be related to constipation or difficult evacuation, anorectal physiology testing is suggested to rule out a pelvic floor disorder.

### Effect of raw milk on lactose intolerance: a randomized controlled pilot study [^675f8dab]. Annals of Family Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

This pilot study aimed to determine whether raw milk reduces lactose malabsorption and/or lactose intolerance symptoms relative to pasteurized milk.

Methods

We performed a crossover trial involving 16 adults with self-reported lactose intolerance and lactose malabsorption confirmed by hydrogen (H2) breath testing. Participants underwent 3, 8-day milk phases (raw vs 2 controls: pasteurized, soy) in randomized order separated by 1-week washout periods. On days 1 and 8 of each phase, milk consumption was 473 mL (16 oz); on days 2 to 7, milk dosage increased daily by 118 mL (4 oz), beginning with 118 mL (4 oz) on day 2 and reaching 710 mL (24 oz) on day 7. Outcomes were area under the breath H2 curve (AUC H2) and self-reported symptom severity (visual analog scales: flatulence/gas, audible bowel sounds, abdominal cramping, diarrhea).

Results

AUC H2 (mean ± standard error of the mean) was higher for raw vs pasteurized on day 1 (113 ± 21 vs 71 ± 12 ppm·min·10(-2), respectively, P = 0.01) but not day 8 (72 ± 14 vs 74 ± 15 ppm·min·10(-2), respectively, P = 0.9). Symptom severities were not different for raw vs pasteurized on day 7 with the highest dosage (P > .7). AUC H2 and symptom severities were higher for both dairy milks compared with soy milk.

Conclusions

Raw milk failed to reduce lactose malabsorption or lactose intolerance symptoms compared with pasteurized milk among adults positive for lactose malabsorption. These results do not support widespread anecdotal claims that raw milk reduces the symptoms of lactose intolerance.

### Intestinal microbiota and diet in IBS: causes, consequences, or epiphenomena? [^72b9fec2]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Evolving from previous studies on lactose and fructose intolerance, a more generalized approach of intolerance to poorly absorbed and rapidly fermented carbohydrates has been introduced: FODMAPS, including fermentable oligo-, di- and monosaccharides and polyols. Both retrospective and prospective open studies have shown reduced symptoms after introduction of a low-FODMAP diet in IBS patients with suspected or proven fructose or lactose malabsorption. These findings are confirmed by randomized controlled trials, showing a significant improvement of overall symptoms, abdominal pain and bloating, in patients with bloating and/or diarrhea and in small (n = 15−30) unselected IBS patient groups. One study showed recurrence of symptoms on re-challenge with fructose and/or fructans. Involvement of gas production is supported by findings that IBS patients produced more hydrogen relative to healthy controls and lacked an increased methane production on a high vs. low-FODMAP diet. However, it should be noted that the long-term benefit of a low-FODMAP approach in large (unselected) patient groups is unclear, especially considering its invasiveness, which requires strict guidance by a dietician, and the potential risks of, for example, reduced fiber intake and changes in microbiota composition and activity. Furthermore, randomized controlled trials are needed to prove whether it is superior to other dietary interventions (e.g. lactose or fructose reduction) or general dietary advice (e.g. the NICE guidelines). Finally, the FODMAP levels vary between studies, countries, and products, which should be taken into account when interpreting study results and considering low-FODMAP diets.

5 CONCLUSION

This meta‐analysis is the first to confirm that subjective and objective LI are more common in IBS patients compared to the healthy population, but LM has the same prevalence. Based on these findings and literature data, IBS can be a contributing factor of LI among people with LM. Further studies are needed to determine whether a confirmed diagnosis of IBS is an etiological factor in determining whether LM patients present with LI.

### Update on lactose malabsorption and intolerance: pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical management [^30d4d9a4]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Lactose intolerance and IBS

The relationship of LI and IBS has been extensively studied in a South Chinese population with near 100% LNP on genetic testing. A double-blinded, randomised, cross-over comparison of lactose tolerance at 10, 20 and 40 g lactose was performed in IBS patients with diarrhoea (IBS-D) and healthy controls. There was a very strong correlation between the appearance of hydrogen gas in the breath and reports of bloating, pain and other symptoms in patients with lactose intolerance. However, the correlation between the amount of hydrogen gas in the breath and the severity of symptoms was much weaker. Consistent with preliminary findings in a European population, a key observation was that the risk of symptoms and the severity of symptoms were greatly increased in IBS patients, especially at the low to moderate doses found in the normal diet. It is well known that many patients with functional GI disorders have psychological comorbidity and are hypersensitive to dietary and physical stimuli that affect the digestive tract. Further work demonstrated that anxiety, visceral hypersensitivity (defined by rectal barostat) and high levels of gas production on breath tests all increased the severity of abdominal symptoms after ingestion of 20 g lactose. Moreover, mucosal biopsies from the ileum and colon showed increased numbers of mast cells and intraepithelial lymphocytes in lactose-sensitive patients and showed that the release of inflammatory cytokines (eg, tumour necrosis factor) after lactose intake was higher in this group than controls.

Box 2
Clinical relevance of lactose intolerance

Lactose intolerance is defined as symptoms on lactose exposure in individuals with lactose malabsorption.
Most individuals with lactose malabsorption tolerate a dose of at least 12 g lactose (corresponding to 250 mL of milk) without problems. Larger doses may be tolerated if consumed with food or spread over a whole day.
Symptoms of lactose intolerance depend on the strength of the stimulus (ie, lactose dose) and the presence of visceral hypersensitivity, as observed in many patients with IBS.
Treatment options for lactose intolerance include a low-lactose diet, oral lactase enzyme replacement, prebiotics that produce bacterial lactase in the colon and, potentially, prebiotics that adapt the colonic microbiota.
Intolerance of low–moderate lactose doses often indicates the presence of IBS. Such individuals are sensitive to a range of poorly absorbed, fermentable foods ('FODMAPs'). Effective dietary treatment in this group requires not a low-lactose but a low-FODMAP diet.

### Lactose intolerance but not lactose maldigestion is more frequent in patients with irritable bowel syndrome than in healthy controls: a meta-analysis [^bca0331e]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

More trials with standardized parameters are necessary in the future to provide the best quality of evidence regarding the correlation between IBS and LI. Only patients fulfilling the most recent diagnostic criteria for IBS (Rome IV) should be included in such studies. Outcomes should be reported for each IBS subtypes. Uniform outcome measures (eg VAS) regarding abdominal symptoms should be used to make the different studies scientifically comparable. More randomized controlled trials are needed to provide evidence about the role of lactose‐free or restricted diet in IBS compared to placebo or lactase replacement. In these studies, a more accurate IBS‐Symptom Severity Score (IBS‐SSS) should be used in each IBS subtype, which measures not only the severity of the main symptoms, but also the quality of life. Clinical trials with different lactose doses are also suggested to test the role of IBS in LI among lactose maldigesters. Yao et al. 59 discuss the crucial points and difficulties of designing clinical trials in dietary interventions in patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders.

### A 32-year-old woman with chronic abdominal pain [^19f31541]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Functional dyspepsia is a highly prevalent disorder that accounts for 5% of visits to primary care clinicians. It frequently coexists with other gastrointestinal tract disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Symptoms of functional dyspepsia, including epigastric pain, early satiety, and postprandial nausea, are nonspecific, making its diagnosis difficult. Functional dyspepsia is a heterogeneous disorder involving a number of different pathophysiologic processes, culminating in both gastrointestinal sensory and motor dysfunction. Although functional dyspepsia does not impart any increased risks to long-term health, it significantly affects both individuals and society. The economic burden of evaluating and treating functional dyspepsia is estimated to be at least $1 billion per year, and patients with functional dyspepsia experience a markedly reduced quality of life. Using the case of Ms C, we apply an evidence-based approach to highlight current knowledge in the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of functional dyspepsia.

### Comparison of the impact of bovine milk β-casein variants on digestive comfort in females self-reporting dairy intolerance: a randomized controlled trial [^a5040925]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Lactose malabsorption (LM) is a major cause of digestive discomfort from dairy products. Recently, a role for bovine β-casein A1 has been proposed.

Objectives

We examined whether there are distinct symptoms of digestive discomfort due to either lactose or differing bovine β-casein types.

Methods

Women (n = 40; age: 25.2 ± 0.5 y) with self-reported varying dairy tolerance underwent a 50-g lactose challenge. Based on postchallenge LM and digestive discomfort, participants were classified as either lactose intolerant (LI; n = 10, self-reported intolerant, diagnosed lactose intolerant), nonlactose dairy intolerant (NLDI; n = 20, self-reported intolerant, diagnosed lactose tolerant), or dairy tolerant (DT; n = 10, self-reported tolerant, diagnosed lactose tolerant). In a double-blinded randomized sequence, participants consumed 750 mL conventional milk (CON; containing A1 and A2 β-casein and lactose), a2 Milk (A2M; exclusively containing A2 β-casein with lactose), or lactose-free conventional milk (LF-CON; containing A1 and A2 β-casein without lactose). Subjective digestive symptoms and breath hydrogen (measuring LM) were recorded regularly over 3 h, and further ad hoc digestive symptoms over 12 h.

Results

LI subjects experienced prolonged digestive discomfort with CON milk. A2M reduced (P < 0.05) some symptoms (nausea: A2M 8 ± 3 mm compared with CON 15 ± 3mm; fecal urgency: A2M 4 ± 1 compared with CON 10 ± 3 mm), and attenuated the rise in breath hydrogen over 3 h, relative to CON milk (A2M 59 ± 23 compared with CON 98 ± 25 ppm at 150 min; P < 0.01). In contrast, NLDI subjects experienced rapid-onset, transient symptoms (abdominal distension, bloating, and flatulence) without increased breath hydrogen, irrespective of milk type.

Conclusions

In LI individuals, LM and digestive comfort with lactose-containing milks was improved with milk containing exclusively A2 β-casein. Furthermore, self-reported dairy intolerance without LM (NLDI) is characterized by early-onset digestive discomfort following milk ingestion, irrespective of lactose content or β-casein type. This trial was registered at www.anzctr.org.au as ACTRN12616001694404.

### Lactose malabsorption and intolerance and peak bone mass [^9d367779]. Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Lactose malabsorption per se is not associated with alterations of bone mineral density (BMD) or calcium intake, but when intolerance symptoms are present a lower calcium intake and reduction of BMD values are evident. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether lactose intolerance interferes with the achievement of an adequate peak bone mass in young adults.

Methods

Of 103 enrolled healthy subjects, 55 proved to be lactose malabsorbers with H(2) breath test after lactose administration, and 29 of them experienced intolerance symptoms (diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence). Lumbar and femoral BMD by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was measured, and calcium intake and biochemical indices of bone and mineral metabolism were evaluated.

Results

Lumbar and femoral BMD, calcium intake, and mineral metabolism did not differ between malabsorbers and absorbers, although among malabsorbers, intolerant subjects showed significant alterations of all these parameters in comparison with tolerant subjects. A strict correlation was evident between BMD values and both severity of symptoms and calcium intake and between calcium intake and severity of symptoms.

Conclusions

Lactose intolerance prevents the achievement of an adequate peak bone mass and may, therefore, predispose to severe osteoporosis.

### 'Gut health': a new objective in medicine? [^5b0f1ae8]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Table 1
Gut health and gastrointestinal health a

a GI, gastrointestinal; IBD, inflammatory bowel disease; IgA, immunoglobulin A.

The relevance of gut health is underlined by the fact that the list of intestinal complaints that prompts an individual to consult a doctor is long, and such complaints are very common in the general population. They include symptoms associated with functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and comprise flatulence, bloating, regurgitation, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhoea, food intolerance, incontinence, abdominal pain and cramps, loss of appetite, weight loss and blood in stools. In most cases, such symptoms reflect more or less harmless diseases that might affect quality of life but not mortality. Some of the symptoms, however, such as anorexia, unintended weight loss, dysphagia, continuing vomiting, severe abdominal pain or diarrhoea, melena and hematochezia, have to be interpreted as alarm signals requiring a detailed examination. This is particularly important if such symptoms occur in individuals with a family history of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) or other malignant diseases or in individuals older than 50 years of age with a lack of colonoscopy. In these individuals, malignant GI diseases have to be excluded by appropriate means. Moreover, other chronic GI diseases, such as GI infections, GI immune diseases, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, need to be excluded.

Underlying mechanisms

The GI tract contributes to health in many ways. Multiple data clearly indicate that the function of the gut is by far not restricted to food processing and subsequent nutrient and fluid uptake (Figure 1). Animal experiments and some human data have shown that the gut communicates with bacteria that support digestion by their enzymatic capacity, that the gut regulates major epithelial and immune functions of importance for gut health and health in general and that the gut reports to the brain via the N. vagus and hormones about energy uptake and other conditions that might affect mood and general well-being. The details of how the gut has an impact on health in general have been reviewed in detail elsewhere and are summarised in Figure 1. Of particular interest in this context is the recent finding in germ-free mice that the gut microbiota can directly influence not only GI functions but also the development of behaviour and corresponding neurochemical changes in the brain. The mechanisms of how the gut microbiota contributes to gut health, however, are less clear.

### A comparison of diagnostic tests for lactose malabsorption – which one is the best? [^626d1308]. BMC Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The population based prevalence of lactose malabsorption (LM) in Scandinavia is 2–8%. The prevalence of LM is in the same order in subjects with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) as in the general population, whereas perceived milk and lactose intolerance is reported by 30–67% of subjects with FGID. Dietary advice to subjects with FGID and to those with intolerance to milk and lactose relies on a valid and reliable diagnostic test for LM. Such a test is not available.

Lactose is an unabsorbable disaccharide hydrolysed by lactase (lactase-phlorizin hydrolase) in the intestinal brush border into galactose and glucose that are absorbed. LM is a failure to hydrolyse lactose. In adults the most common cause is a genetic defect with lack of intestinal lactase. The unabsorbed lactose is metabolised by colonic bacteria to produce gas (hydrogen (H2) and methane (CH4)) and short chain fatty acids. Clinical manifestations of LM are abdominal pain/discomfort, borborygmi, bloating, flatulence and diarrhoea. In subjects with LM, symptoms depend on the amount of lactose. Most people with LM can, due to colonic adaptation to regular lactose ingestion, ingest up to 6–12 g lactose (120–240 mL milk) without developing symptoms.

Commonly used tests for the diagnosis of LM are based on an exaggerated increase in H2 and/or CH4 in the expired air after intake of lactose, or an inappropriate increase in serum glucose (s-glucose). Other tests are assessment of lactase activity in jejunal biopsies, a test for genetic defects, and registration of symptoms after intake of lactose. Recently, the Rome Consensus Conference published a review of the methodology and indications of H2-breath testing in gastrointestinal diseases. No "gold standard" is available for the diagnosis of LM and breath tests with measurement of volatile compounds and other gases (mainly CH4) were encouraged. There are few comparisons between the tests and no agreement upon which one is the best.

The aims of this study were to assess the agreement between commonly used diagnostic methods for LM (breath test, s-glucose and symptoms), describe the diagnostic properties of the methods and establish the best method and cut-off levels for clinical use.

### Irritable bowel syndrome and other functional gastrointestinal disorders [^11ac3736]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome is one of several highly prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) displaying symptoms of gastrointestinal dysmotility and visceral hypersensitivity. Substantial overlap of symptoms and comorbidities occur not only between irritable bowel syndrome and other FGID but also with gastrointestinal disorders that are not related to motility (eg, celiac disease and lactose intolerance) and to somatic conditions (eg, fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome). Pathogenic mechanisms common among FGIDs may include alternations in intestinal and colonic microflora. Evidence is also emerging of an interplay between gut immune cells/activity and alternations in motility, secretion, and sensation. The role of cytokine activity and inflammation is important in this regard. As recommended by Rome III, diagnostic testing should be guided by the patient's age, primary symptom characteristics, and other clinical and laboratory features. The high prevalence of coexisting conditions suggests the need to routinely assess patients for related disorders. Treatment should be based on an individualized evaluation, explanation, and reassurance.

### Lactose digestion in humans: intestinal lactase appears to be constitutive whereas the colonic microbiome is adaptable [^f75e4d28]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Today, over 6 billion people regularly consume milk and dairy products, and the per-capita consumption has nearly doubled in developing countries since the 1960s. Nutritionally, milk and dairy products are an important source of energy, proteins, fats, and nutrients such as calcium and vitamin D. However, upon consuming these products, some lactase-deficient individuals may experience various gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, due to a condition called lactose intolerance. The primary solution to lactose intolerance is to avoid lactose-containing dairy products altogether or to replace them with lactose-free alternatives. The dairy industry has responded to this need by developing several lactose-free products which are now readily available to consumers. In addition, cultural changes, such as the increased popularity of veganism and the globalization of the food industry, have also led to the introduction of novel lactose- and dairy-free products. Although an obvious need for these products exists, their increased availability has perhaps fueled some misconceptions about lactase deficiency and lactose intolerance. Firstly, lactase deficiency itself does not indicate lactose intolerance; many lactose-malabsorbers can tolerate certain amounts of dietary lactose without any symptoms. Secondly, some individuals who claim to be lactose intolerant fail to distinguish lactose from placebo in controlled settings. These findings suggest that certain people attribute their GI symptoms erroneously to lactose and thus opt to consume lactose-free products. This has subsequently raised the question whether consuming lactose-free products reduces an individual's ability to absorb dietary lactose and if lactose-absorbers should thus avoid these products.

The aim of this review was to evaluate the current evidence regarding the acclimatization of lactose processing in humans. An extensive literature search was undertaken of the PubMed and Scopus databases for the terms "lactase/lactose adaptation", and the reference lists of relevant review articles were also examined. This review included human studies measuring lactose absorption after periods of lactose or lactose-free diet consumption.

### Diagnosis of lactose intolerance and the "nocebo" effect: the role of negative expectations [^d1f90149]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnosis of lactose intolerance is based on a "positive" H(2) breath test associated with abdominal symptoms. The present study established to what extent the occurrence of symptoms during a "negative" H(2) breath test may result from a "nocebo effect" instead of lack of sensitivity of the procedure.

Methods

Between 2005 and 2007, 636 outpatients performed a standard 4-h 25g lactose tolerance test. The test was positive in 254, negative in 325, and 57 patients were H(2) "non-producers". Twenty-seven patients reporting symptoms despite a negative H(2) breath test underwent a "sham" breath test following ingestion of 1g of glucose. Fifty-four patients presenting with documented lactose intolerance were used as controls.

Results

Twelve out of 27 patients (44.4%), and unexpectedly also 14 (25.9%) controls presented abdominal symptoms during the sham test. The difference between the two groups was not significant (P < 0.15) OR 2.28; C. I. 0.77–6.78.

Conclusion

In most instances, symptoms reported by patients during a negative lactose H(2)BT cannot be attributed to a false-negative test. Instead, a non-organic component, resulting from negative expectations ("nocebo effect") is likely implicated. Moreover, also in patients diagnosed as lactose intolerant, the need for restricting the primary source of dietary calcium should be critically reconsidered.

Schematic model of the pathogenesis of lactose intolerance symptoms. In a given population, a fraction of individuals will have digestive dysfunction resulting in lactose malabsorption. Within this population, individuals with anxiety disorders or GI disease that increase visceral sensitivity are more susceptible to the lactose challenge. In this model, the risk of developing symptoms increases with lactose dose, severity of digestive dysfunction (lactose malabsorption) and visceral sensitivity. This model of disease is not restricted to lactose but is likely to be shared by other FODMAPs, fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides and monosaccharides and polyols.

Figure 4
Mechanistic model of lactose digestion in patients with lactase persistence and lactase deficiency illustrating the relationship between lactose malabsorption, visceral sensitivity and symptoms.

Products of lactose fermentation may also trigger extra-intestinal symptoms. A recent review of results from > 2000 patients with a clinical diagnosis of functional GI disorders, reported a high frequency of neurological symptoms such as tiredness and headache after lactose or fructose ingestion. However, it is uncertain whether the occurrence of neurological symptoms was caused by LM, because these patients have a high prevalence of nonspecific somatic complaints, there was no placebo control, no statistical relationship between H 2 production and symptoms was present and no mechanistic explanation was provided.

### Systematic review: effective management strategies for lactose intolerance [^96a9408e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Lactose intolerance resulting in gastrointestinal symptoms is a common health concern. Diagnosis and management of this condition remain unclear.

Purpose

To assess the maximum tolerable dose of lactose and interventions for reducing symptoms of lactose intolerance among persons with lactose intolerance and malabsorption.

Data Sources

Multiple electronic databases, including MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library, for trials published in English from 1967 through November 2009.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials of individuals with lactose intolerance or malabsorption.

Data Extraction

Three investigators independently reviewed articles, extracted data, and assessed study quality.

Data Synthesis

36 unique randomized studies (26 on lactase- or lactose-hydrolyzed milk supplements, lactose-reduced milk, or tolerable doses of lactose; 7 on probiotics; 2 on incremental lactose administration for colonic adaptation; and 1 on another agent) met inclusion criteria. Moderate-quality evidence indicated that 12 to 15 g of lactose (approximately 1 cup of milk) is well tolerated by most adults. Evidence was insufficient that lactose-reduced solution or milk with a lactose content of 0 to 2 g, compared with greater than 12 g, is effective in reducing symptoms of lactose intolerance. Evidence for probiotics, colonic adaptation, and other agents was also insufficient.

Limitations

Most studies evaluated persons with lactose malabsorption rather than lactose intolerance. Variation in enrollment criteria, outcome reporting, and the composition and dosing of studied agents precluded pooling of results and limited interpretation.

Conclusion

Most individuals with presumed lactose intolerance or malabsorption can tolerate 12 to 15 g of lactose. Additional studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of lactose intolerance treatment.

### Subjective perception of lactose intolerance does not always indicate lactose malabsorption [^166291f1]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Symptomatic lactose intolerance is common; however, abdominal symptoms that patients experience after ingestion of lactose-containing foods can have causes beyond lactose malabsorption. We aimed to determine whether symptoms that patients usually attribute to lactose intolerance are comparable to symptoms provoked by a controlled lactose challenge and whether these symptoms are related to lactose absorption capacity.

Methods

We performed an observational, prospective, transverse study of 353 patients referred for a lactose hydrogen breath test (HBT). Patients completed a validated questionnaire about symptoms associated with consumption of dairy products at home (home symptoms). After a 50-g lactose breath test, they completed the same questionnaire again (lactose challenge symptoms). Patients were assigned to groups of absorbers or malabsorbers according to HBT results and tolerants or intolerants according to the results of the questionnaire.

Results

The total symptom score was significantly higher for home symptoms than for the lactose challenge (16 vs 8, P < .01). Symptoms perceived at home were reported to be more intense than those that followed the lactose challenge for lactose absorbers compared with malabsorbers (16 vs 4, P < .01) and lactose tolerants compared with intolerants (12 vs 2, P < .05). Overperception of lactose intolerance at home was similar in men and women.

Conclusions

Daily life symptoms that patients associate with lactose intolerance are often unrelated to lactose malabsorption. Even among true lactose malabsorbers, symptom recall tends to be amplified by the patient. Thus, conventional anamnesis is a highly unreliable tool to establish symptomatic lactose malabsorption.

### Do patients with lactose intolerance exhibit more frequent comorbidities than patients without lactose intolerance? An analysis of routine data from German medical practices [^6ce856a7]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The increase in food intolerances poses a burgeoning problem in our society. Food intolerances not only lead to physical impairment of the individual patient but also result in a high socio-economic burden due to factors such as the treatment required as well as absenteeism. The present study aimed to explore whether lactose intolerant (LI) patients exhibit more frequent comorbidities than non-LI patients.

Methods

The study was conducted on a case-control basis and the results were determined using routine data analysis. Routine data from the IMS Disease Analyzer database were used for this purpose. A total of 6,758 data records were processed and analyzed.

Results

There were significant correlations between LI and the incidence of osteoporosis, changes in mental status, and the presence of additional food intolerances. Comparing 3,379 LI vs. 3,379 non-LI patients, 34.5% vs. 17.7% (P < 0.0001) suffered from abdominal pain; 30.6% vs. 17.2% (P < 0.0001) from gastrointestinal infections; and 20.9% vs. 16.0% (P = 0.0053) from depression. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) were the highest for fructose intolerance (n = 229 LI vs. n = 7 non-LI; OR 31.06; P < 0.0001), irritable bowel syndrome (n = 247 LI vs. n = 44 non-LI; OR 5.23; P < 0.0001), and bloating (n = 351 LI vs. n = 68 non-LI; OR 4.94; P < 0.0001).

Conclusion

The study confirms that LI should not be regarded as an isolated illness but considered a possible trigger for further diseases. Additional research is necessary to assert more precise statements.

Lactase deficiency and lactose malabsorption

The terms relating to lactose metabolism are often mixed-up which may cause confusion (table 2). Lactase deficiency (LD) is the failure to express lactase at the brush border of the small intestine. Lactose malabsorption (LM) refers to any cause of failure to digest and/or absorb lactose in the small intestine. Lactose intolerance (LI) is the occurrence of symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating or diarrhoea in LM patients after ingestion of lactose.

Table 2
Glossary with definitions related to lactase deficiency, lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance

Congenital lactase deficiency is a very rare paediatric condition that causes severe symptoms and failure to thrive in infants. The most common cause of LM in adolescents and adults is primary (genetic) lactase non-persistence (LNP). The activity of lactase in the small intestine reaches a peak at the time of birth but is reduced in most populations during childhood, a process which is thought to facilitate weaning. However, in some individuals, high activity of lactase persists, enabling consumption of large amounts of lactose also in adulthood. It should be emphasised that, worldwide, most individuals have LNP with phenotypic LD and LM (figure 2). Thus, LNP, LD and LM are not diseases but normal variants of human metabolism. Other causes of LM include secondary (acquired) LD, rapid small intestinal transit and small bowel bacterial overgrowth.

Figure 2
Worldwide prevalence of lactose malabsorption. Online supplement 1 breaks down the the evidence base in terms of the investigative modality used to acquire the epidemiological information (eg, genetic test and breath test). Online supplement 2 provides the complete reference list.

In case of LM (primary or secondary), undigested lactose comes into contact with the intestinal microbiota. Bacterial fermentation of lactose results in production of gasses including hydrogen (H 2), carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4) and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) that have effects on GI function (figure 1).

### Using breath tests wisely in a gastroenterology practice: an evidence-based review of indications and pitfalls in interpretation [^1d820794]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Breath tests are a simple and safe alternative to more invasive investigation strategies for many gastroenterological conditions. Both the hydrogen breath tests and the new 13C stable radioisotope breath tests are nonradioactive and safe in children and pregnancy. The range of diseases that can be identified include Helicobacter pylori infection, lactose and fructose intolerance, bacterial overgrowth, bile salt wastage, pancreatic insufficiency, liver dysfunction, and abnormal small bowel transit. In this review, the physiology supporting these tests and the principles of normal gas dynamics in the gut are briefly reviewed and then related to the test preparation and interpretation in two parts: 1) detection of H. pylori and 2) small bowel, pancreatic, and hepatobiliary disorders. A MEDLINE search reviewing all English language abstracts from 1966 to March, 2001 was performed, with an additional review of abstracts from major national meetings from 1997 to 2001. Using the information from this review, the performance characteristics of the various tests were detailed, and an attempt is made to provide some literature-based guidance regarding their indications and limitations. The interpretation of "flat" breath tests and the selective use of methane collection and colonic alkalinization are discussed. Breath tests are valuable tools that are, in general, underutilized in evaluating dyspepsia and functional bloating and diarrhea, as well as suspected malabsorption, including lactose intolerance.

### Demystifying carbohydrate maldigestion: a clinical review [^30699634]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Carbohydrate intolerance is a poorly understood and potentially overlooked cause of unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly among patients with disorders of gut-brain interaction. Symptoms related to carbohydrate intolerance arise from bacterial fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrates leading to increased gases and osmotic load within the gastrointestinal tract. This mechanism is shared across various carbohydrates, including lactose, sucrose, maltose, fructose, and fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols. Primary forms of carbohydrate maldigestion typically affect one specific type of carbohydrate and result from inherited defects in specific brush-border enzymes or transport mechanisms, whereas secondary, or acquired, forms of carbohydrate maldigestion can arise from conditions that affect the structural integrity or function of the pancreas and small intestine. Although confirmation of a disaccharidase deficiency does not imply clinical relevance, obtaining a careful patient history with appropriate use of breath testing, duodenal disaccharidase assay, and response to dietary modification can help identify patients whose symptoms are associated with carbohydrate maldigestion and who may benefit from treatment. Dietary modification remains the cornerstone of therapy for patients with carbohydrate intolerance and should focus on determining the most liberal diet for patients that allows symptom control. Given the complexity and time-consuming nature of this process, clinicians are encouraged to engage the help of dietitians with expertise in the treatment of disorders of gut-brain interaction where available. Enzyme replacement therapy can also be an important adjunct to dietary management, with sacrosidase improving symptoms in sucrase-isomaltase deficiency and helping patients to liberalize their diet.

Therapeutic options

Therapy of lactose intolerance aims to improve patient symptoms and to avoid risk for undernutrition or malnutrition in the long term (figure 8). A diet low in lactose is typically recommended and this is supported by common sense and clinical evidence. However, in contrast to the management of sprue or food allergies, a strict lactose-free diet is not required since patients with LI often tolerate up to 250 mL milk (12 g lactose) without symptoms and more when consumed with food.

Figure 8
Management of lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance. FODMAPs, fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides and monosaccharides and polyols.

Improved lactose tolerance by manipulating the colonic microbiota could also be achieved by ingestion of prebiotics. A randomised placebo-controlled study in 85 LI patients reported that regular ingestion of short-chain galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS, RP-G28) tended to reduce H 2 production and improve abdominal pain during lactose HBT. After 1 month, 30% of GOS-treated patients versus 6% of placebo-treated patients considered themselves lactose tolerant. Microbiological workup revealed a transient increase in lactose fermenting Bifidobacterium spp. on GOS treatment and a negative correlation between Bifidobacterium levels and abdominal pain, and re-introduction of milk prompted a further shift in bacterial composition, including an increase in the genus Roseburia.

Lactose-free dairy products in which lactase is added to milk are widely available and considered safe, although allergic reactions have been reported. Lactase treatment of milk products also reduces crystallisation of lactose, increasing sweetness and fermentation for production of yoghurt. However, residual side proteolytic activity of lactase can degenerate casein and impair taste, especially after long storage.

Lactase supplementation by tablets improves both lactose digestion (reduced H 2 production) and symptomsalthough the effects are modest (eg, 18% with overall reduction of symptoms). An alternative approach is to ingest probiotics such as Lactobacillus spp. Bifidobacterium longum or Bifidobacterium animalis that produce lactase in the gut. A recent systematic review of this treatment option confirmed an overall positive effect; however, the effect size was not consistently better than lactase supplementation and study quality was poor.

### Mechanisms underlying food-triggered symptoms in disorders of gut-brain interactions [^6088f989]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Defective processing

Most of the available evidence suggests no alteration in digestion or absorption of nutrients in patients with DGBIs compared to the general population. However, well-known and widely available maldigestion/malabsorption syndromes may more easily lead to symptoms in subjects with DGBIs, presumably related to abnormal sensorimotor function in the GI tract and abnormal gut-brain interactions.

Lactose malabsorption is a well established and common entity that might lead to symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating and diarrhea after lactose ingestion, i.e. lactose intolerance. The disaccharide lactose cannot be absorbed, but has to be cleaved by the small intestinal brush border enzyme lactase-phlorizin into the monosaccharides glucose and galactose which are then actively transported into the enterocytes by the sodium (+)/glucose (galactose) cotransporter (SGLT1). Inability to digest lactose properly because of lactase non-persistence, leading to lactose malabsorption, is prevalent and found in 68% of subjects worldwide with large differences across the world with the lowest prevalence in Nordic countries (< 5% in Denmark) and close to 100% prevalence in Korean and Han Chinese populations. Even though lactose malabsorption due to lactase non-persistence does not appear to be more common in patients with DGBIs, lactose intolerance may be more common in IBS and related to visceral hypersensitivity, immune alterations in the gut and psychological factors, which point towards the relevance of gut-brain interactions.

### Lactose digestion in humans: intestinal lactase appears to be constitutive whereas the colonic microbiome is adaptable [^de730771]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Colonic Adaptation to Dietary Lactose

Although endogenous lactase activities remain unchanged during lactose feeding, lactose-malabsorbers frequently report experiencing fewer and less severe GI symptoms as feeding progresses. This would suggest that some adaptive mechanisms relating to lactose processing occur during prolonged intake of lactose. In one of the first studies to demonstrate adaptation to lactose feeding, Johnson et al. fed gradually increasing amounts of lactose to 22 lactose-intolerant subjects and observed that 17 of them could tolerate > 12 g of lactose daily without symptoms. In addition, when challenged with the maximum tolerated dose of lactose, 4 of these subjects exhibited no increase in breath H 2 concentration. Subsequent investigations have produced similar findings: lactose-malabsorbing individuals show decreased breath H 2 concentrations after a lactose challenge following a lactose-feeding period (Table 2). Although these reports have reported none or only minor improvements in GI symptoms, the findings imply that colonic microbes adapt to the presence of lactose in the colonic lumen. Indeed, fecal analyses have revealed that lactose feeding increases fecal β-galactosidase activity and the proportions of Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria. Interestingly, these bacterial taxa do not produce H 2 during carbohydrate fermentation, which likely explains the observed reduction in breath H 2 concentrations after lactose feeding. These results suggest that when dietary lactose reaches the colon, it stimulates the growth of lactose-fermenting bacteria, but whether this reduces intolerance symptoms to lactose is still a matter of debate. Studies have shown decreased flatulence during a lactose challenge following a lactose-feeding period, possibly because of microbial changes leading to reduced colonic gas production. Colonic adaptation is also supported by a study showing that supplementing lactose-intolerant individuals with a prebiotic increases the proportion of lactose-fermenting bacteria, which leads to decreased abdominal pain when lactose is reintroduced in the diet. Taken together, however, these studies mainly report only minor improvements in 1 intolerance symptom with no changes in other GI symptoms. Moreover, Briet et al. did not observe any improvements in intolerance symptoms despite microbial adaptations to lactose intake, supporting the idea that at least part of the observed symptom improvements could be explained by the placebo effect. Another explanation could be individual differences in the composition of microbiota that contribute to GI symptom development after lactose intake. Although fecal β-galactosidase activity does not seem to differ between lactose-tolerant and lactose-intolerant lactose-malabsorbers, intolerant individuals produce lactose fermentation end products, such as lactate and SCFAs, faster than tolerant lactose-malabsorbers. These findings imply that colonic adaptation to lactose intake should probably extend beyond β-galactosidase–producing bacteria to achieve clear alleviation of intolerance symptoms. Nevertheless, these studies show that lactose feeding increases the proportion of intestinal bacteria capable of hydrolyzing lactose and decreases colonic H 2 production, trends that might lead to some alleviation of intolerance symptoms in lactose-malabsorbers. This colonic adaptation to lactose feeding appears to be reversible, i.e. when lactose is excluded from diet, colonic adaptation also disappears, which in turn might lead to intolerance symptoms when lactose is reintroduced in the diet. However, despite colonic adaptation, the nutritional benefit of lactose for these individuals would still remain low compared with lactase-persistent individuals.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: the North American Consensus [^915ea6b8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Performance of breath tests

We suggest that the correct dose of lactulose for breath testing is 10 g with or followed by one cup of water.
We suggest that the correct dose of glucose for breath testing is 75 g mixed with or followed by one cup of water.
We suggest that the correct dose of lactose for breath testing is 25 g mixed with or followed by one cup of water.
We suggest that the correct dose of fructose for breath testing is 25 g mixed with or followed by one cup of water.
We suggest that fructose and lactose breath testing should be performed for at least 3 h.
We suggest that the presence of bacterial overgrowth should be ruled out before performing lactose or fructose breath testing.
We recommend that hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide should all be measured simultaneously during breath testing.

When performing lactulose breath tests for the determination of SIBO, the majority of studies have used a dose of 10 g. Higher doses incur the risk of speeding intestinal transit time, which could affect test data.

With regards to the glucose breath testing, variable doses of 50 g and 75–100 g have been used. Comparative studies using 50 g, 75 g or 100 g have not been performed. A 75 g dose is used for oral glucose testing in diabetics, as recommended by the World Health Organization; hence, from the practical standpoint stocking 75 g doses is less-expensive, easier to obtain for breath test centers and could provide an adequate amount of carbohydrate substrate.

In subjects with lactose and fructose intolerance, unabsorbed substrate is fermented by the colonic bacteria leading to symptoms such as gas, bloating and abdominal pain. Symptoms of lactose malabsorption generally occur after ingestion of 6–12 g lactose (120–240 mL of milk). Although high doses of lactose (≥ 50 g) have been used for lactose breath test, 25 g (equivalent of 500 mL of milk) is within the normal range of consumption and is the recommended dose.

### Diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome [^0ccb1849]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Because there are no reliable biological or laboratory markers associated with the condition, the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome(IBS) is based on patient descriptions of common symptoms such as abdominal pain accompanied by changes in stool form or frequency and associated symptoms such as bloating and distension. With the development and refinement of symptom-based criteria for the diagnosis of IBS, the traditional need for a negative diagnostic evaluation has been questioned. This article evaluates the diagnostic characteristics of various symptom-based criteria in routine clinical practice and reviews the data regarding the yield of the multiple commonly used diagnostic tests in patients with suspected IBS.

### Masquerading in the midgut: a rare diagnosis in a patient with recurrent abdominal pain [^77a36cf2]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

A 38-year-old woman who had been previously diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome was seen in the outpatient clinic with a 2-year history of intermittent cramp-like abdominal pain which was often followed by watery diarrhoea. She had presented several times previously to the emergency department with episodes of severe pain and collapse although on arrival examination findings were mostly unremarkable other than some mild lower abdominal tenderness. On each occasion, the symptoms resolved spontaneously with conservative management. She had been extensively investigated by her general practitioner to establish the cause of her symptoms but all laboratory findings, cross-sectional imaging, ultrasound and oesophagogastroduodenoscopy to date were unremarkable. After being seen in gastroenterology outpatients' clinic, a colonoscopy was performed and was described as being macroscopically normal but microscopic evaluation of colonic biopsies suggested a possible 'resolving infection'. She was treated symptomatically, but within 6 months she represented to hospital with progressively worsening symptoms of severe abdominal pain, now associated with vomiting, followed by watery diarrhoea and then resolution of the symptoms. An abdominal CT scan was performed which showed a small intraluminal-filling defect in the mid-terminal ileum. A wireless capsule endoscopy was organised to further characterise the lesion although this was reported as showing no abnormality. Prior to any further outpatient investigations, she represented as an emergency to hospital in small bowel obstruction, underwent further cross-sectional imaging followed by surgical resection of the lesion. Histological characterisation revealed a small bowel inflammatory fibroid polyp.

### Fructose intolerance: an under-recognized problem [^4d0e4239]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

Although the role of lactose intolerance in the pathogenesis of abdominal symptoms is well known, the role of fructose intolerance is unclear. Our aims were 1) to examine the prevalence of fructose intolerance in patients with unexplained abdominal symptoms, and 2) to explore whether fructose concentration influences fructose breath test.

Methods

Over 2 yr, patients with unexplained symptoms answered questionnaires and underwent fructose breath tests. Patients received 50 g fructose in 150 mL water (33% solution). Breath samples were collected for hydrogen and methane. In a second study, breath test was performed after giving either 10%, 20%, or 33% fructose solution. Data were analyzed retrospectively.

Results

A total of 183 patients (50 male, 133 female) had breath tests, of whom 134 (73%) were positive. Among these, 119 (89%) had elevated H(2), and 15 (11%) had elevated CH(4) or both gases. Questionnaires showed that flatus (83%), pain (80%), bloating (78%), belching (70%), and altered bowel habit (65%) were the most common symptoms. Breath test reproduced symptoms in 101 patients (75%). In the second study, 14/36 (39%) tested positive with a 10% solution, 23/33 (70%) with a 20% solution, and 16/20 (80%) with a 33% solution (10% versus 20% or 33%, p < 0.01).

Conclusions

Fructose intolerance may cause unexplained GI symptoms. The higher yield of positive tests in our initial study may be due to referral bias or testing conditions; lower test dose produced a lower yield. Nonetheless, recognition and treatment of fructose intolerance may help many patients.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: the North American Consensus [^57923464]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Breath tests are also used in the diagnosis of a variety of carbohydrate maldigestion syndromes. The lactose breath test is performed to diagnose lactose maldigestion/intolerance, which may result from lactase deficiency. Lactose, which is exclusively found in dairy products, is a disaccharide composed of galactose and glucose, and the brush border enzyme lactase phlorizin hydrolase is required for its digestion. Lactase deficiency can be primary or secondary (i.e. acquired lactase deficiency due to damage to, or absence, of the brush border). There is no gold standard test to diagnose lactose maldigestion and large scale data are lacking to compare the degree of agreement of the currently available tests. Jejunal biopsies followed by a lactase activity assay is invasive and unreliable due to patchy lactase distribution in the brush border. Genetic testing only detects primary lactase deficiency, and tests of blood glucose levels following lactose ingestion depend on glucose metabolism and are not reliable. One other limitation of the lactose breath test is false negative results in individuals with fixed hydrogen and non-methane production; however, these only constitute 3.4% of breath tests. As mentioned above, false positive results can also occur.

Interpretation of breath testing results

We suggest that a rise of ≥ 20 p.p.m. from baseline in hydrogen during the test should be considered positive for fructose and lactose breath testing.
We suggest that until better data are available, for clinical and research purposes, a rise of ≥ 20 p.p.m. from baseline in hydrogen by 90 min should be considered a positive test for SIBO.
We suggest that two peaks on breath test are not required for the diagnosis of SIBO.
Until further data is available, we suggest that a level of ≥ 10 p.p.m. be considered positive for methane on a breath test.

Similar to the European consensus statements and based on the current evidence, we suggest using a cutoff value of ≥ 20 p.p.m. rise above baseline as positive for the lactose breath test. The test should be performed for at least 3 h to ensure the presence of colonic fermentation. We suggest the same criteria for interpretation of fructose breath testing based on the results of the study by Rao et al. which showed that rise of hydrogen always occurs within 3 h of testing. The value of development of symptoms during fructose breath testing is unclear and needs further evaluation.

### Intestinal microbiota and diet in IBS: causes, consequences, or epiphenomena? [^d85b3ad7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Although placebo and possibly nocebo effects have to be considered in IBS, possible physiological mechanisms of (perceived) food intolerance include an exaggerated sensory and motor response and/or incomplete absorption, which may lead to symptoms in a susceptible host. High fat intake, for example, is associated with an exaggerated colonic motor response to eating and increased visceral sensitivity in IBS patients, whereas duodenal lipid infusions delay small intestinal transit. Randomized controlled trials adjusting fat intake are, however, limited. Poorly absorbed carbohydrates, like lactose, fructose, and galacto- or fructo-oligosaccharides (fructans), can result in luminal distension by osmotic effects and increased gas production due to microbial fermentation. Although this is a normal physiological phenomenon, it can result in symptoms in subjects with an altered microbiota, increased visceral sensitivity, and/or abnormal gas handling. A recent study by Yang et al. found increased mucosal mast cell numbers, serum tumor necrosis factor-α, rectal sensitivity, and anxiety in lactose intolerant IBS-D patients, supporting that neuro-immune modulation of visceral function is a potential underlying mechanism. Perceived intolerance to lactose, fructose, and fructans is frequently reported and uncontrolled studies point to symptom improvement after removal of milk containing products or wheat from the diet. However, these studies should be interpreted with caution because of a large placebo and nocebo response in IBS. The overall evidence for an increased incidence of lactose intolerance in IBS patients was found to be weak and to be moderate — weak for the benefit of low lactose intake in these subjects.

### A comparison of diagnostic tests for lactose malabsorption – which one is the best? [^808d4b18]. BMC Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

S-glucose is an alternative to breath test. The agreement with the breath test was modest and clinically unsatisfactory, but the diagnostic properties (sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and LR) were identical with that of H2 (table 5). The poor agreement and identical diagnostic properties are the result of different diagnostic classification into health and disease of the two methods. Since no gold standard is at hand it is impossible to judge between them, but because of the low specificity of s-glucose and lower area under the ROC-curve we conclude in accordance with other publications that it is inferior to breath test with measurement of H2 or H2 + CH4x2 (tables 3 and 5).

Registration of symptoms after intake of lactose has been used as a simple test for LM. Evaluation of the onset, severity and duration of symptoms for 8 hours has been recommended. This study shows in accordance with previous reports, that symptoms in general are highly unreliable and unfit for clinical use. Symptoms questionnaires and symptom based criteria such as "Early and Long Lasting (ELL)-symptoms" have better diagnostic properties. In this study ELL-symptoms were superior to unspecified symptoms after intake of lactose. These findings are in agreement with the Rome Consensus Conference that symptoms should be evaluated during and for some hours after the test, and that onset and duration are of importance. But even ELL-symptoms showed unacceptable diagnostic properties and poor agreement with any of the other test (table 4 and 5). This fits with the clinical observation that the prevalence of perceived lactose intolerance, which is also related to visceral hypersensitivity, is significantly higher than that of LM, and that subjects with LM can consume a variable but limited amount of lactose without developing symptoms.

### The patient with irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms: when to investigate and how? [^287c2eb9]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a very common disorder whose clinical presentation varies considerably between patients as well as within the same individual over time. Many of its symptoms, such as pain, diarrhea, constipation and bloating, may be manifestations of a host of other gastrointestinal diseases; some accompanied by increased mortality. This presents the clinician with a real dilemma: how to sensibly investigate the patient in which one suspects IBS but there is a nagging doubt that 'it could be something else'? Could one miss 'something serious'? This short review attempts to provide both an evidence-based response to these vexing questions and a practical guide to detecting alternative diagnoses in the subject with IBS-type symptoms.

Recent Findings

Clinical features, patient demographics and the clinical context can help to significantly narrow the differential diagnosis of the individual with IBS-type symptoms and may permit a positive diagnosis of IBS. The advent of noninvasive serological and stool tests has greatly facilitated differentiation from celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease, respectively. In the older, female diarrhea sufferer microscopic colitis should be considered. The role of bile acid diarrhea in the individual with diarrhea-predominant IBS is emphasized; the status of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in IBS remain uncertain.

Summary

Attention to detail in the clinical evaluation of the individual with IBS-like symptoms will facilitate a selective and targeted approach to investigation. Wherever indicated, widely available serological and fecal tests will serve to bolster the diagnosis by excluding other options. Proceeding to more invasive testing should be dictated by clinical presentation and scenario with the threshold for intervention being generally lower among those with prominent diarrhea.

### Value of fecal calprotectin in the evaluation of patients with abdominal discomfort: an observational study [^d75a19d0]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

The diagnostic precision was uniformly high, both in younger patients (age < 50 years) with a low pretest probability, and older patients at higher risk for organic intestinal disease. We also cannot confirm that fecal calprotectin values increase with age in patients with normal findings on endoscopy, as suggested from data in healthy volunteers.

All together, those results support the concept that fecal calprotectin is a useful marker in the evaluation of patients with abdominal discomfort and that a biomarker-guided strategy might have additional value to a strategy using clinical decision, including guidelines of appropriateness, to decide on endoscopy. It is important to recognize that these results apply only to symptomatic patients with abdominal discomfort. Especially screening endoscopies such as colonoscopy should be performed irrespective of calprotectin values. Fecal calprotectin has not been established as screening tool for colorectal cancer in asymptomatic patients.

Several limitations of the study merit consideration. First, our prospectively defined endpoint was the presence of a clinically significant finding. Indeed, classification of findings in clinical practice is challenging and endoscopic findings might not always be congruent with abdominal discomfort presented by the patient. Second, in several important gastrointestinal disorders, such as small bowel bacterial overgrowth, celiac disease, or food lactose intolerance, fecal calprotectin levels will be normal. Third, we did not systematically assess the presence of mucosal lesions in the small-bowel. We acknowledge, that this is a limitation of our study as increased fecal calprotectin has been shown in small-bowel enteropathy. In the 15 patients who had small bowel capsule endoscopy no significant lesion were found. Fourth, there have been reports of elevated calprotectin values in expectorations of patients with acute and chronic pulmonary disease. This might have influenced fecal measurement of calprotectin.

### Circadian profiling reveals higher histamine plasma levels and lower diamine oxidase serum activities in 24% of patients with suspected histamine intolerance compared to food allergy and controls [^f8bb1e2d]. Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

A study including 439 patients with unclear abdominal discomfort identified fructose (5.2%) and primarily lactose (11.8%) intolerance as a frequent concomitant in histamine intolerance. 32 In conformity with this study, we also demonstrated that carbohydrate intolerances are frequently associated with histamine intolerance. Interestingly, there was a frequent co‐occurrence of histamine and sorbitol intolerance (25%).

A histamine‐free diet is the method of choice in the explorative diagnosis and therapy of histamine intolerance. 10, 22, 23 In addition, a new diet low on FODMAPs has gained increasing popularity in recent years. The acronym FODMAP — Fermentable Oligo‐, Di‐, Monosaccharides And Polyols — refers to the carbohydrates fructose, lactose, fructans and galactans as well as sugar alcohols, such as sorbitol and mannitol, which are ingredients of numerous foodstuffs. 33, 34 They are thought to trigger gastrointestinal disorders, in particular diarrhoea and flatulence, due to the induction of luminal distension and increased intestinal permeability. 33, 34 Thus, a low FODMAP diet is considered highly effective in the treatment of functional gut symptoms and IBS, respectively. 33, 34 In our study, the 25 patients without serological indication of histamine intolerance had multiple proven food intolerances against fructose, lactose or sorbitol and possibly other, yet unknown, food hypersensitivities. According to the Rome III criteria, most of them matched the subtype IBS with diarrhoea. These patients would possibly benefit more from a low FODMAP diet.

The mere presence of gastrointestinal complaints does not allow conclusions about the genesis of the disease, although the diagnosis of an IBS is very frequently. 2, 7, 30 The prevalence of IBS is significantly higher in women than in men. 35 There was also a high rate of symptomatic young and middle‐aged (18‐65 years) women in our study population (83.3%) who were assigned to the IBS category according to the Rome III criteria. 25, 26 Evidence suggests associations between a histamine‐rich diet and IBS. 2 That is why symptom relief under histamine‐poor diet is not highly specific for histamine intolerance, but may also occur in IBS. One of our food‐hypersensitive patients showed increased tryptase activity, hinting towards that other, for example mast cell‐activated diseases, could be present in this patient. 36 In clinical practice, frequent and known differential diagnoses for histamine intolerance should be investigated at an early stage.

### Self-reported lactose intolerance in clinic patients with functional gastrointestinal symptoms: prevalence, risk factors, and impact on food choices [^44ef2181]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Many patients complain of abdominal symptoms with dairy products; however, clinical and psychosocial factors associated with self-reported lactose intolerance (SLI) have not been assessed in large studies. In particular, data are lacking from lactase deficient populations. This prospective cohort study assessed the prevalence of, and risk factors for, SLI in Chinese patients attending a gastroenterology clinic.

Methods

Consecutive patients completed questionnaires to assess digestive health (Rome III), psychological state (HADS), life event stress (LES), food intake, and quality-of-life (SF-8). A representative sample completed genetic studies and hydrogen breath testing (HBT) at the clinically relevant dose of 20 g lactose.

Key Results

SLI was present in 411/910 (45%) clinic patients with functional abdominal symptoms. The genotype in all subjects was C/C-13910. A small number of novel SNPs in lactase promoter region were identified, including C/T-13908 which appeared to confer lactase persistence. Over half of the patients (54%) completed the 20 g lactose HBT with 58% (285/492) reporting typical symptoms. Positive and negative predictive values of SLI for abdominal symptoms during HBT were 60% and 44%, respectively. Psychological state and stress were not associated with SLI in clinic patients. SLI impacted on physical quality-of-life and was associated with reduced ingestion of dairy products, legumes, and dried fruit (p ≤ 0.05).

Conclusions & Inferences

In a lactase deficient population, approximately half of patients attending clinic with functional gastrointestinal symptoms reported intolerance to dairy products; however, SLI did not predict findings on 20 g lactose HBT. Independent of psychosocial factors, SLI impacted on quality-of-life and impacted on food choices with restrictions not limited to dairy products.

### Lactose intolerance but not lactose maldigestion is more frequent in patients with irritable bowel syndrome than in healthy controls: a meta-analysis [^df63895f]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

Lactose intolerance (LI) is a condition characterized by clinical symptoms after ingestion of lactose‐containing products, caused by lactose maldigestion (LM). 20 The most common cause of LM is primary (adult‐type) hypolactasia. 3 LI affects 25% of the Caucasian population. Males and females are equally affected. 21, 22 Because of lactase deficiency, lactose can reach the large intestine where it is fermented by colonic bacteria. Short‐chain fatty acids, gases (H 2, CO 2 and CH 4) and other products will be produced by the fermentation which can cause luminal distension and lead to different gastrointestinal symptoms. The most common complaints are abdominal pain and discomfort, bloating, flatulence, and diarrhea, similarly as in IBS. 20, 23, 24, 25 Due to the potential pathogenetic factors of IBS (altered gastrointestinal motility, changes of gut microbiome, visceral hypersensitivity, anxiety, etc), food intolerances, such as LI, are more frequent in this disease, however, the prevalence of LM does not differ compared with the healthy population. More IBS patients have symptoms at lower lactose doses and their symptoms are more severe. Moreover, many IBS patients think that their abdominal symptoms are related to lactose intake, even though no objective tests of LM were carried out. 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 The available diagnostic methods for diagnosing LM or LI are based on several approaches, including lactose breath test (LBT), lactose tolerance test (LTT), genetic test and assessment of lactase activity in jejunal biopsy specimens. 3 The restriction of lactose intake or the replacement of the lactase enzyme can alleviate these symptoms. 3, 21

There are numerous clinical trials investigating the connection between IBS, LM, and LI, but to our best knowledge no meta‐analyses have been performed up to this day.

Given the uncertain connection between IBS and lactose consumption‐related disorders, we performed a systematic literature search and meta‐analysis in this important topic with the aim to assess the prevalence of LM, objective and subjective LI in IBS patients compared to healthy controls (HC).

### Is carbohydrate intolerance associated with carbohydrate malabsorption in disorders of gut-brain interaction? [^e441f501]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

We aimed to explore the prevalence of carbohydrate (lactose and fructose) intolerance in patients with disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) and to characterize those patients regarding gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal symptoms.

Methods

Patients with DGBI who were referred to the physiology unit of our hospital between May 2022 and December 2023 for lactose (25 g) and fructose (25 g) breath tests were prospectively included. Patients were required to have a negative glucose breath test, before lactose and fructose breath tests, and to have completed the adult carbohydrate perception questionnaire during each breath test. Intolerance was defined as an increase of ≥ 20 mm in the Visual Analog Scale score from baseline in at least 1 of the 5 symptoms (pain, nausea, bloating, flatulence, and diarrhea) assessed with the adult Carbohydrate Perception Questionnaire.

Results

Among the 301 patients with DGBI included in our analysis, 178 (59.1%) had carbohydrate intolerance. Carbohydrate-intolerant patients were significantly more likely to be female (P value < 0.001), to have 2 or more DGBI (P value = 0.001), to have lactose maldigestion (P value < 0.001) and fructose malabsorption (P value = 0.023), higher irritable bowel syndrome and somatic symptom severity, and lower quality of life (P value < 0.001) compared with patients without carbohydrate intolerance. The binary logistic regression showed that lactose maldigestion (P value = 0.001), as well as somatic symptoms (P value = 0.025), were independently associated with carbohydrate intolerance (Nagelkerke R Square = 0.206).

Discussion

Carbohydrate intolerance affects a substantial group of patients with DGBI, affecting their quality of life and symptom severity. Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms in patients who do not have carbohydrate malabsorption/maldigestion.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^6042d5fc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Follow-up evaluations after laboratory-confirmed pathogen-specific diarrhea — Follow-up testing is not recommended in most people for case management following resolution of diarrhea (strong, moderate), although serial stool specimens using culture-dependent methods for Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Paratyphi, STEC, Shigella, nontyphoidal Salmonella, and other bacterial pathogens are recommended in certain situations by local health authorities following cessation of diarrhea to enable return to child care, employment, or group social activities (strong, moderate), and practitioners should collaborate with local public health authorities to adhere to return policies (strong, high). A clinical and laboratory reevaluation may be indicated in people who do not respond to an initial course of therapy and should include consideration of noninfectious conditions including lactose intolerance (weak, low). Noninfectious conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), should be considered in people with symptoms lasting 14 or more days and unidentified sources (strong, moderate). Reassessment of fluid and electrolyte balance, nutritional status, and optimal dose and duration of antimicrobial therapy is recommended in people with persistent symptoms (strong, high).

### The effect of a lactose-restricted diet in patients with a positive lactose tolerance test, earlier diagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome: a 5-year follow-up study [^6342f342]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Design and Methods

Prospectively, the effect of a lactose-restricted diet was evaluated among irritable bowel syndrome patients with lactose malabsorption. Lactose malabsorption was defined by a positive hydrogen breath test and a positive blood-glucose test. An analysis of symptoms was completed before, during, 6 weeks after and 5 years after starting the diet. In addition, the number of visits made by the patients to the outpatient clinic was scored during 6 years.

Results

In 17 out of 70 irritable bowel syndrome patients (24.3%), lactose malabsorption was detected. There was no difference in the symptom score between patients with a positive lactose tolerance test and patients with a negative lactose tolerance test. After 6 weeks of the lactose-restricted diet, symptoms were markedly improved in lactose malabsorption-positive patients (P < 0.001). After 5 years, one patient was lost for follow-up, and 14 out of the remaining 16 lactose malabsorption patients (87.5%) still had no complaints during the lactose-restricted diet. Two patients chose not to follow the diet continuously and accepted the discomfort caused by lactose intake. Only two out of 16 patients (12.5%) no longer experienced any benefit from lactose restriction. In the 5 years before their diagnosis of lactose malabsorption, these 16 patients visited the outpatient clinic a total of 192 times (mean 2.4 visits per year per person; range 1–7 visits). In the 5 years after diagnosis, they visited the outpatient clinic a total of 45 times (mean 0.6 visits per year per person; range 0–6 visits; P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

In a large majority of irritable bowel syndrome patients with lactose malabsorption, which was previously clinically unrecognized, a lactose-restricted diet improved symptoms markedly both in the short term and the long term. Furthermore, visits by all patients to the outpatient clinic were reduced by 75%. We conclude that diet therapy is extremely cost- and time-saving. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that lactose malabsorption, which is easily treatable, is excluded before diagnosing irritable bowel syndrome.

Persistent diarrhea — management focuses on treating identified enteropathogens and underlying gastrointestinal (GI) disease: specific treatment of identified enteropathogens is usually indicated and appropriate management of underlying GI disease is warranted; if bacterial infection is suspected or determined by culture-independent testing, stool culture can determine antimicrobial susceptibility; dietary modifications might help patients with malabsorption or lactose intolerance; symptomatic treatment or the use of nonabsorbable antibiotics offers potential benefit if small intestinal bacterial overgrowth accompanies the symptom complex.

### Early hydrogen excretion peaks during breath tests. small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or accelerated transit? [^8dcf750b]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) has been reported with varying prevalence, depending upon the criteria used for diagnosis. Lactulose and glucose breath tests are the most used in clinical settings. Early rises of hydrogen excretion during a lactose breath test suggest SIBO, but the finding could result from accelerated mouth-to-caecum transit time.

Aims

Defining the prevalence of early hydrogen peaks during lactose breath tests and assessing the proportion of patients affected by SIBO.

Methods

An early (≤ 60') hydrogen excretion peak was observed in 120/663 patients with positive lactose hydrogen breath test. Eighty-one of them underwent a 50 g-9sample-glucose hydrogen breath test to diagnose SIBO.

Results

The glucose breath test proved positive in 11/81 (13.6%) patients. The positivity rate was 18.2% (2/11) in those with the first peak detected at 30' and 12.8% (9/70) in those with the peak occurring at 60'.

Conclusions

Early hydrogen excretion peaks are rarely associated with SIBO. The low positive predictive value indicates that the finding does not help identifying patients at high risk for this condition. Indirectly, the present data support the opinion that the prevalence of SIBO diagnosed by standard lactulose breath tests is much lower than reported, and the reliability of the test is low.

### Update on lactose malabsorption and intolerance: pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical management [^759c02be]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Epidemiology

A recent meta-analysis estimated the prevalence of LM worldwide at 68% with higher rates reported for genetic tests than hydrogen breath tests (HBTs).LM is lowest in Nordic countries (< 5% in Denmark) and highest in Korean and Han Chinese populations (approaches 100%). Large variations in LM are seen on a regional level (figure 2), reflecting the underlying genetic heritage and prevalence of primary LD in these populations. Testing for LI is more complex and would require standardised hydrogen breath testing in large, carefully selected populations and, for this reason, the prevalence of LI is unknown.

### Mast cell deposition and activation may be a new explanation for epiploic appendagitis [^1c98c19e]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 40-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of migraines, gastro-oesophageal reflux, nausea, IBS–diarrhoea and many other idiopathic syndromes suffered with constant abdominal pain with episodic attacks of severe abdominal pain over the past year. The pain had peaks of labour-like contractions lasting 5 min. This pain was sharp and migratory but most often was located in the right lower quadrant. It was worse with pressure, palpation and movement. Over the same time period, she had worsening headaches, fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. This pain was clearly differentiated by the patient from her 8-year history of IBS which was characterised by postprandial crampy pain, bloating, foul gas and diarrhoea which responded to periodic 2-week courses of the antibiotic rifaximin. Over the course of the year, rifaximin was prescribed but did not help this pain.

The patient presented for evaluation in the GI clinic after 4 days of extremely severe, sharp right lower abdominal pain that awoke her from sleep and was associated with a 100 o F temperature. The right lower quadrant was markedly tender with guarding. The white blood count was normal. The CT was abnormal (figure 1). Despite administration of acetaminophen and ibuprofen, the pain worsened and after 7 days of unremitting pain, laparoscopic surgery was performed. Gross findings included an enlarged area of fat near the normal appendix that had a small amount of superficial focal fat necrosis. After surgical resection of the appendage, the right lower pain immediately abated and she was discharged. Standard H&E stain showed adipose tissue with patchy areas of fat necrosis with repair. The appendectomy specimen was normal.

### Update on lactose malabsorption and intolerance: pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical management [^391a36f9]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Figure 6
Symptoms in individuals with lactose malabsorption depend on lactose dose and visceral hypersensitivity. A population of Chinese individuals (100% primary lactase non-persistence) including HV with no history of abdominal symptoms and individuals with IBS-D was tested three times with different lactose dosages (10, 20 and 40 g) in a blinded fashion. The likelihood of a clinically positive HBT was higher in individuals with IBS-D for the low and the intermediate lactose dose. HBT, hydrogen breath test; HV, healthy volunteers; IBS-D, diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. (Source: Adapted from Yang et al.)

Figure 7
Results of a hydrogen breath test of an individual with lactose intolerance with simultaneous assessment symptoms and H 2 levels, indicating lactose fermentation by the microbiota. An H 2 increase by ≥ 20 ppm over baseline indicates lactose malabsorption. When 13 C-labelled lactose is administered, 13 CO 2 levels indicate absorption and metabolisation of 13 C-labelled lactose by the subject. Patient reports of abdominal symptoms subsequent to increases in these markers is diagnostic of lactose intolerance.

The lactose tolerance test measures glucose in plasma at different times (e.g. 0, 30, 60, 120 min) after ingestion of 50 g lactose. Although the test does not require complex or expensive equipment, its invasive nature (multiple blood samples) limits its utility. Use of capillary blood measurements with portable glucose metres makes the test less invasive but does not offer the same diagnostic accuracy as measurements in venous blood.

The gaxilose test involves the administration of the lactase substrate gaxilose (4-galactosylxylose) with measurement of D-xylose in urine or blood. Conceptually, gaxilose measurements are ideal for assessment of intestinal lactase since activity over the entire small intestine is measured. In a manufacturer-sponsored trial, the diagnostic accuracy of gaxilose tests (0.93) was higher than HBT (0.85) or lactose tolerance tests (0.79) in comparison to duodenal biopsies. However, this was not confirmed in an independent study when the genetic test (LCT-13'910:C/T) was used as reference.

### Significance of hydrogen breath tests in children with suspected carbohydrate malabsorption [^eb38ea7d]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Although the retrospective nature of our analyses is a clear limitation, our results support hydrogen breath tests as noninvasive and sensitive measures of carbohydrate malabsorption that can be helpful in the evaluation of children with gastrointestinal symptoms including functional intestinal disorders. A thorough history taking can guide the evaluation of single or multiple sugars to be tested. If applied for a variety of carbohydrates but only where indicated, around two-third of all children have positive results. The therapeutic consequences are successfully relieving symptoms in the vast majority of patients. The adherence to the physician's advice is excellent, as the patients and families are very content.

### Comparable exogenous carbohydrate oxidation from lactose or sucrose during exercise [^df6a21e7]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2020). Medium credibility.

Given the importance of gut comfort for exercise performance and the presence of lactose intolerance in some individuals, investigation of GIS was particularly important. Upper, lower, and other GIS were predominantly mild, with no differences between conditions. However, two subjects experienced noteworthy symptoms with lactose ingestion. One experienced severe lactose intolerance symptoms during exercise (flatulence, urge to vomit, and diarrhea) and was excluded from the study. The other participant experienced similar but milder symptoms in the hours after exercise. This participant demonstrated a discrepancy in mean exogenous CHO oxidation rates between lactose (0.34 g·min −1) and sucrose (0.61 g·min −1). Both subjects reported regular dairy and lactose ingestion. In another participant, a marked disparity in mean exogenous CHO oxidation between lactose (0.15 g·min −1) and sucrose (0.73 g·min −1) was observed alongside large increases in breath H 2 (17–208 ppm) with lactose, yet GIS were mild and comparable in both conditions. Collectively, these preliminary observations are interpreted to mean that GIS with the moderate dose lactose feeding protocol used herein are unlikely to be problematic for most individuals, although caution should be taken as some apparently lactose-tolerant individuals may experience symptoms.

### Update on lactose malabsorption and intolerance: pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical management [^bd416cef]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Lactose malabsorption and the microbiota

The human body harbours approximately 40 trillion bacteria with approximately 99% of the microbiome contained within in the human colon. Fermentation of lactose by saccharolytic ('sugar digesting') bacteria in individuals with LM can cause abdominal symptoms (figures 1 and 4). However, this process also has benefits. SCFA and other products of fermentation are required for colonic health and liberate additional calories from otherwise indigestible carbohydrates. Moreover, the intestinal microbiota adapts to facilitate intake of dairy products. As a result, although lactase expression is not upregulated by lactose ingestion, regular consumption of lactose appears to reduce breath hydrogen excretion and reduced lactose intolerant symptoms. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate increases in Bifidobacteria and/or Lactobacilli that are considered to be healthy components of the microbiome. In a large study of healthy Japanese, the abundance of Bifidobacteria correlated positively with dietary dairy intake. As this population is 90%–100% LNP, this could reflect the effect of regular lactose intake on the microbiota; however, the reverse cannot be excluded.

Box 1
Pathophysiology of lactose malabsorption

Lactose malabsorption is typically caused by lactase downregulation after infancy due to lactase non-persistence which in Caucasians is mediated by the LCT −13'910:C/C genotype.
Lactase non-persistence is the genetic wildtype and not a disease. Both lactase persistence and non-persistence are common phenotypes in healthy humans.
The lactase genetic region is among the genetic regions strongest shaped by human evolution within the last 10 000 years, with lactase persistence providing a selective advantage of up to 4%–5% per generation.
The LCT −13'910 is the region within the human genome with the strongest interaction with the intestinal microbiota. The LCT −13'910:C/C genotype is associated with higher Bifidobacteria levels on lactose consumption (bifidogenic effect).
Genetic and physiological studies suggest higher bone mineral density and larger height in individuals with lactase persistence.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of refractory celiac disease: expert review [^e77055be]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Nonresponsive celiac disease — Best Practice Advice 3: For patients with nonresponsive celiac disease, after exclusion of gluten ingestion, perform a systematic evaluation for other potential causes of symptoms, including functional bowel disorders, microscopic colitis, pancreatic insufficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, lactose or fructose intolerance, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Colonoscopy is indicated in patients with celiac disease and persistent or recurrent diarrhea because of the increased risk of microscopic colitis and inflammatory bowel disease, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth can be detected by means of breath testing. The low FODMAP diet is not indicated in all patients with nonresponsive celiac disease, and pancreatic insufficiency is common in this setting and can be treated with gluten-free pancreatic enzyme supplements. Refractory celiac disease should be strongly considered in patients with persistent or recurrent symptoms or signs of malabsorption after exclusion of other more common causes and malignancy.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of irritable bowel syndrome [^d8bee3d1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) — colonoscopy use is addressed with a conditional recommendation stating, "We recommend against routine colonoscopy in patients with IBS symptoms younger than 45 years without warning signs" and "Conditional recommendation; low quality of evidence". Alarm features guiding decisions are listed as "hematochezia, melena, unintentional weight loss, older age of onset of symptoms, family history of IBD, colon cancer, or other significant GI disease". Supporting data note that "polyps were found in only 7.7% of patients with IBS compared with 26.1% in non-IBS patients (P < 0.0001)", and in a study "of 559 subjects who met Rome III IBS criteria" even "among the 136 subjects with no alarm features, Crohn's disease was found in 7.4% of subjects and celiac in 2.9%". The guideline summarizes that "in the absence of alarm features, there seems to be no justification for routine colonoscopy in subjects with IBS younger than 45 years", and further that "in patients older than 45 years, a recent negative colonoscopy for colon cancer screening or for other investigative purposes should mitigate the need for another colonoscopy for IBS symptoms in the absence of new alarm features" and that "the colonoscopy should be based on the age of the person and considered independent of IBS symptoms". For suspected microscopic colitis, colonoscopy "may be a special case among women older than 60 years" and "in patients considered to be at high risk of microscopic colitis (older age (> 60), female gender, and more intense diarrhea), there may be mounting evidence to support the use of colonoscopy".

### A retrospective study on the association of gastrointestinal symptoms in children with low lactase activity and low activity of other disaccharidases [^204fe20f]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Because disaccharidases are brush border enzymes predominantly present throughout the small intestine, direct measurements of disaccharidase activities are performed by small intestinal biopsy. In patients who undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsy, disaccharidase assays can be done along with histology analysis for comprehensive evaluation as causes of clinical gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as abdominal pain, are often multifactorial so multiple tests tend to be combined in the hopes of revealing the underlining etiology for the GI symptoms.

Lactase deficiency is a common and well-studied condition. The global prevalence of lactose intolerance is estimated to be 68% (95% CI = 64–72). Lactose intolerance is known to be more prevalent in non-White races/ethnicities such as Blacks and Asians and to increase with age. Depending on the degrees of the deficiency, the condition may result in symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, flatulence, and/or bloating after consumption of lactose. The epidemiology of sucrase, maltase, and palatinase deficiency is less well-known partially due to them being relatively uncommon. Low activity of disaccharidases has been reported in pediatric patients with persistent GI symptoms with normal small intestinal histology. However, a recent study by Chumpitazi et al. on low disaccharidase activity in pediatric patients with functional dyspepsia was unable to find any significant association between specific GI symptoms and low disaccharidase activity beyond low lactase. We believed that the study may have had too small of a sample size to a find statistical significance. Thus, the objective of our study was to explore the association of low activity of disaccharidase and combinations of low disaccharidases with general GI symptom presentations in a larger sample size of children and young adults.

### Effects of dietary education, followed by a tailored fructose-restricted diet in adults with fructose malabsorption [^95d8b492]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Fructose is absorbed by GLUT transporters in the small intestine. If this process is inadequate, abdominal symptoms because of fructose intolerance may arise. The effect of a tailored fructose-restricted diet on gastrointestinal complaints was assessed in patients with fructose intolerance.

Materials and Methods

Following an abnormal fructose breath test (50 g), 107 patients (64 also with lactose intolerance) entered three study periods: weeks 0–32 (free diet), weeks 32–36 (progressive increasing amount of fructose up to quantity inducing symptoms, 'trigger dose'), and weeks 36–48 (tailored fructose-restricted diet according to the 'trigger dose'). A subgroup of 15 patients underwent additional fructose breath tests (35, 25 g) to compare three different doses.

Results

At baseline, the most frequent symptoms were bloating and abdominal pain, and were more severe with combined fructose and lactose intolerance. During the free diet, patients reported eliminating (48%) or reducing (52%) fructose-containing foods, with a significant improvement in symptoms (abdominal pain from 79.7 ± 1.3 to 19.3 ± 1.8 mm; bloating from 83.1 ± 1.3 to 19.4 ± 1.8 mm; number of evacuations/day from 3.9 ± 0.16 to 1.1 ± 0.04; Bristol score from 5.1 ± 0.14 to 3.8 ± 0.1, P < 0.00001). During the tailored fructose-restricted diet, the consistent improvement in symptoms persisted and was similar to the improvement on free diet (abdominal pain 23.6 ± 1.9 mm; bloating 19.4 ± 1.8 mm; number of evacuations/day 1.7 ± 0.07; Bristol score 3.5 ± 0.06, P < 0.00001 vs. baseline). A dose-dependent effect of fructose was observed on symptoms during the fructose breath test.

Conclusion

In our setting, individuals with fructose intolerance show an inappropriate dietary self-management. By contrast, a tailored fructose-restricted diet improves gastrointestinal symptoms without senseless food deprivation.

### NIH panel tackles lactose intolerance… [^6e28545b]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

The latest prescription for patients with lactose intolerance may seem counterintuitive. But a panel of experts recently reported that a glass of milk, especially if taken with other foods, may do more good than harm for many patients who avoid dairy products because they fear troubling gastrointestinal symptoms. The National Institutes of Health consensus development conference panel met in late February to evaluate the current state of knowledge about lactose intolerance and offer guidance so that patients do not needlessly miss out on important nutrients in milk and other dairy products. Symptoms of lactose intolerance — severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, and flatulence — occur in some, but not all, individuals who have insufficient levels of lactase, the enzyme in the small intestine that digests lactose in milk and other dairy products.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines update: diagnosis and management of celiac disease [^740a6567]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Celiac disease — indications for testing (Recommendations 7A and 7B) specify that patients with symptoms, signs, or laboratory evidence suggestive of malabsorption, such as chronic diarrhea with weight loss, steatorrhea, abdominal pain, and bloating, should be tested for CD. Patients with symptoms, signs, or laboratory evidence for which CD is a treatable cause should be considered for testing for CD. Patients with a first-degree family member who has a confirmed diagnosis of CD should be tested if they show possible signs, symptoms or laboratory evidence of CD. Consider testing of asymptomatic relatives with a first-degree family member who has a confirmed diagnosis of CD.

### Clinical approach to lactose intolerance… [^11452b24]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Micic D, Rao VL, Rubin DT. Clinical Approach to Lactose Intolerance. JAMA. 2019; 322: 1600–1601. doi: 10.1001/jama.2019.14740 Lactose intolerance refers to the clinical syndrome in which symptoms of bloating, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea arise following the consumption of lactose-containing foods. Lactose malabsorption results from congenital lactase deficiency, secondary lactose intolerance, and, most commonly, from acquired primary lactase deficiency, a highly prevalent condition affecting 65% to 74% of the worldwide population, with wide regional and ethnic variations. 1, 2 Symptoms arising from lactose malabsorption result from fluid shifts into the intestinal lumen driven by an osmotic gradient and subsequent fermentation of lactose by bacteria residing in the gastrointestinal tract. In this article we review the development of clinical lactose intolerance, diagnostic testing, and treatment of individuals presenting with symptoms of lactose intolerance.

### Breath testing for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth: maximizing test accuracy [^c40cacaf]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) has increased considerably owing to a growing recognition of its association with common bowel symptoms including chronic diarrhea, bloating, abdominal distention, and the irritable bowel syndrome. Ideally, an accurate and objective diagnosis of SIBO should be established before initiating antibiotic treatment. Unfortunately, no perfect test exists for the diagnosis of SIBO. The current gold standard, small-bowel aspiration and quantitative culture, is limited by its high cost, invasive nature, lack of standardization, sampling error, and need for dedicated infrastructure. Although not without shortcomings, hydrogen breath testing provides the simplest noninvasive and widely available diagnostic modality for suspected SIBO. Carbohydrates such as lactulose and glucose are the most widely used substrates in hydrogen breath testing, with glucose arguably providing greater testing accuracy. Lactose, fructose, and sorbitol should not be used as substrates in the assessment of suspected SIBO. The measurement of methane in addition to hydrogen can increase the sensitivity of breath testing for SIBO. Diagnostic accuracy of hydrogen breath testing in SIBO can be maximized by careful patient selection for testing, proper test preparation, and standardization of test performance as well as test interpretation.

DIETARY INTERVENTIONS

Low FODMAP diet

Restricting the intake of poorly absorbed or undigested short-chain carbohydrates called FODMAP was shown to alleviate abdominal symptoms in IBS. In FD, a small number of recently published studies have investigated the therapeutic efficacy of this diet (Table 1 and Figure 1). A beneficial effect of a low FODMAP diet compared with standard dietary advice was reported in a cohort of 59 patients with FD, but with 81% having coexisting IBS. Goyal et al. compared the effect of a 4-week low FODMAP diet to traditional dietary advice in a group of 105 patients with Rome IV FD where those with overlapping IBS and other dietary-related conditions (e.g. a history of lactose/fructose intolerance and patients already on restricted diet) were excluded. Symptoms improved in 67% after a low FODMAP diet compared with 57% after traditional dietary advice, mainly in the PDS subgroup and without significant difference between diets. Furthermore, durable benefit at 12 weeks was present in 46% and 41%, respectively. In a pilot study, the effect of a low FODMAP and gluten-free diet was explored in 11 patients with FD, of whom only 9 completed the elimination phase. A low FODMAP diet was associated with a nonsignificant trend toward overall symptom improvement. A preliminary report on 25 patients with FD showed a clinically significant symptom improvement in 62% after 6 weeks of a low FODMAP diet. Improvement occurred both in overall and individual symptom scores of postprandial fullness, early satiation, and upper abdominal bloating. After 6 weeks, patients entered a blinded reintroduction phase where individual FODMAP were reintroduced for 1 week in the form of powders, with 2 days recovery in between and glucose as a control. The blinded reintroduction phase of the study showed that a wide variety of FODMAP induced symptom recurrence, which occurred in an individualized pattern. Mannitol and galacto-oligosaccharides were the FODMAP that most commonly triggered FD symptom recurrence (both 29%), followed by fructans (21%), sorbitol (14%), fructose (14%), and lactose (12%).

### New insights into irritable bowel syndrome: from pathophysiology to treatment [^2783417c]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Treatment

The treatment for IBS is usually based on the predominant symptoms. However, treating the pathophysiological causative agent responsible for the symptoms is an emerging approach. An acceptable initial therapy, especially for patients with mild disease, is lifestyle modification and education. This starts with removing gas-producing foods and by following a low-FODMAP diet (Table 6). If this is helpful, then reintroduction of foods, one at a time, is encouraged. Otherwise, these specific foods should be avoided in the long term. A low-FODMAP diet has been shown to help patients in relieving abdominal pain, bloating, and stool consistency. Lactose avoidance is also an option in some patients, both those with and without lactose intolerance, since it is possible that an ingredient in milk other than lactose triggers symptoms. Likewise, it was reported that a gluten diet also causes IBS symptoms in non-celiac disease patients, but this may be because of fructans, also found in wheat, and not gluten. Nevertheless, in the latest guidelines for IBS from the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG), a gluten-free diet is not recommended, because the studies suggesting it have not shown statistically significant results.

Examples of diet with high and low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs)

Treatment for IBS-C should be targeted to alleviate constipation (Table 7). Increased fiber consumption is recommended, and soluble fibers such as psyllium are preferred to insoluble fibers such as bran as a first step. An initial first pharmacological treatment could include osmotic laxatives, such as polyethylene glycol, but it may not help with pain. Thus, in their latest guidelines the ACG no longer recommends it, since the evidence to support its use is not statistically significant. Therefore, linaclotide or lubiprostone can be used instead, since they improve colonic transit time and abdominal pain. Moreover, plecanatide, used for chronic idiopathic constipation, is a recent promising option for IBS-C that has been shown to improve IBS symptoms in general. Last but not least, lactulose, also an osmotic laxative, should be avoided because it produces a lot of gas and results in bloating.
