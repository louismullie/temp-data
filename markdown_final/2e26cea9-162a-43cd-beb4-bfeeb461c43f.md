## Question

ppt on hyponatrmia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for information about hyponatremia, likely in the form of a presentation (ppt). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definition, epidemiology, and why hyponatremia matters clinically. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and brain adaptation that drive symptoms and correction risks. Next, I will classify hyponatremia by tonicity, duration, and volume status, and confirm the diagnostic workup. After that, I need to stratify severity and urgency, outline treatment principles by scenario, and detail emergency hypertonic saline protocols. Finally, I should address special populations, monitoring and safety, and summarize a practical algorithm with key takeaways, ensuring each step is supported by appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the definition and epidemiology so I don't gloss over basics. Hyponatremia is typically defined as serum sodium less than 135 mEq/L, affects roughly 5% of adults and up to 35% of hospitalized patients, and is associated with increased mortality and length of stay even when mild, which underscores why we should not dismiss it as trivial [^111fLWER] [^1169CfKA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanisms without anchoring in physiology. Hypotonic hyponatremia reflects excess free water relative to solute, driven by impaired water excretion from non-osmotic vasopressin release or by excessive intake, and the brain adapts by extruding solutes over time, which explains why acute hyponatremia causes cerebral edema while chronic hyponatremia risks osmotic demyelination if corrected too fast [^112q1gbT] [^111fLWER].

> I need to check the classification framework because management hinges on it. First, confirm hypotonicity with measured serum osmolality less than 275 mOsm/kg, then classify by duration as acute less than 48 hours versus chronic 48 hours or more, and finally categorize by volume status into hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic, since this triage directs therapy and predicts response to interventions [^114RsQLR] [^114hmeK4] [^114Mg1Pm].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic workup steps so I don't miss a reversible cause. Start with serum and urine osmolality, urine sodium, and a careful clinical assessment of volume status. Urine sodium less than 30 mmol/L suggests hypovolemia, whereas greater than 30 mmol/L with concentrated urine supports SIADH, and I should remember to review medications, endocrine causes, and organ failure that can masquerade as SIADH before labeling it as such [^111B44kt] [^115Bfw9m] [^114hmeK4].

> I should double-check symptom severity stratification because it drives urgency. Severe symptoms include seizures, coma, or cardiorespiratory distress and mandate immediate hypertonic therapy; moderate symptoms include confusion, vomiting, or headache; mild symptoms include nausea, fatigue, and cognitive slowing, and importantly, even mild chronic hyponatremia correlates with gait instability, falls, and fractures, so I need to keep functional risk in mind [^114hmeK4] [^1169CfKA].

> Let me think about overarching treatment principles before diving into specifics. Treat the underlying cause whenever possible, correct sodium cautiously to avoid osmotic demyelination, and tailor therapy to volume status and symptom severity, recognizing that guidelines converge on hypertonic saline for severe symptomatic cases but differ in correction limits and second-line options, which means I should document targets and monitor closely [^114hmeK4] [^115evmgn] [^111bC6Vc].

> For hypovolemic hyponatremia, I should confirm that isotonic saline is first-line to restore effective arterial volume and suppress vasopressin, typically at 0.5 to 1.0 mL/kg/hour, while prioritizing hemodynamic stabilization over sodium correction speed in unstable patients and avoiding overly rapid rises that can unmask demyelination risk once volume is restored [^1144sLbT] [^112NDPcb] [^112G6LGL].

> For euvolemic hyponatremia, especially SIADH, I need to ensure fluid restriction is first-line and quantify it appropriately. If ineffective, consider increasing solute intake with urea or combining a loop diuretic with oral sodium chloride, and reserve vasopressin receptor antagonists for selected cases given risks of overly rapid correction and thirst, while remembering to stop offending drugs and treat the precipitating cause [^113PdLtM] [^112MGZPb] [^114hmeK4].

> For hypervolemic hyponatremia, hold on, I should verify that fluid and sodium restriction are foundational, alongside optimization of therapy for heart failure or cirrhosis. In cirrhosis specifically, fluid restriction to about 1,000 mL/day is reasonable, and hypertonic saline is generally avoided except in life-threatening scenarios or as a bridge to transplant, with albumin or vasoconstrictors considered in select inpatient contexts [^116GwdrP] [^116aRe3m] [^111MkbVR].

> Now, the emergency protocol for severely symptomatic hyponatremia needs precision. I should administer 100 mL of 3% hypertonic saline as a bolus over about 10 minutes and repeat up to two additional times if symptoms persist, targeting a 4 to 6 mEq/L early rise to reverse encephalopathy, while planning not to exceed about 8 to 10 mEq/L in the first 24 hours to mitigate osmotic demyelination risk, and I must check sodium frequently during this window [^114hmeK4] [^1114ke7i] [^111czwib].

> But wait, what if I overcorrect. I should confirm that if the sodium rise exceeds the planned trajectory, I can relower sodium by administering electrolyte-free water, such as 10 mL/kg of D5W over about an hour, ideally with desmopressin to halt further correction, and I should involve nephrology early for complex cases or if renal replacement therapy is contemplated [^113PyTGH].

> I will now examine special populations, starting with exercise-associated hyponatremia. Prevention hinges on drinking to thirst rather than fixed schedules, field and hospital management of symptomatic EAH favors 100 mL 3% saline boluses repeated up to three times, avoidance of hypotonic and often isotonic fluids early on, and observation for at least 60 minutes post-exercise given delayed deterioration risk [^117RWnJQ] [^111Qzmkn] [^1153EeJU].

> Next, I should review neurosurgical and critical care patients. Traumatic brain injury and subarachnoid hemorrhage can produce cerebral salt wasting or SIADH, so I need to distinguish them because CSW requires volume repletion whereas SIADH requires fluid restriction, and in the ICU, frequent sodium checks and careful titration of hypertonic therapy are essential to balance cerebral edema control against demyelination risk [^115amGD4] [^114hmeK4].

> For cirrhosis, let me reconsider the prognostic implications. Hyponatremia below 130 mmol/L signals advanced disease and worse outcomes, so beyond fluid restriction and diuretic optimization, I should coordinate liver transplant evaluation and consider TIPS in refractory cases, reserving hypertonic saline for life-threatening encephalopathy or as a bridge to transplant with slow correction thereafter [^114NVLhP] [^114MKzPC] [^116aRe3m].

> I need to ensure outpatient chronic hyponatremia is not undertreated. Even mild chronic hyponatremia is linked to falls, cognitive impairment, and osteoporosis, so I should reassess medications, reinforce fluid restriction, consider urea or salt tablets in appropriate cases, and avoid chasing a normal sodium if the patient is asymptomatic and risks outweigh benefits, documenting shared decision-making [^114hmeK4] [^115rvcWm] [^117F2NEf].

> Monitoring and safety are non-negotiable, so I should double-check cadence. During active correction, measure sodium every 2 to 4 hours initially, then every 6 hours in the first 24 hours, and after each hypertonic bolus. Use calculators to estimate expected sodium changes but never substitute them for serial labs, and maintain a low threshold to involve nephrology or use desmopressin if the trajectory accelerates unintentionally [^111czwib] [^117DP8jL].

> Let me summarize the practical algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Confirm hypotonicity and classify by duration and volume status. If severe symptoms are present, give 3% saline boluses to raise sodium by about 4 to 6 mEq/L rapidly while planning not to exceed 8 to 10 mEq/L in 24 hours. If hypovolemic, use isotonic saline. If euvolemic, restrict fluids and treat the cause. If hypervolemic, restrict fluids and sodium and optimize disease-specific therapy. Throughout, monitor sodium closely, anticipate overcorrection, and adjust proactively [^114hmeK4] [^114Mg1Pm] [^114RsQLR].

> Finally, I should confirm the key takeaways so the plan is actionable. Never delay treating severe symptomatic hyponatremia while waiting for tests, but do classify promptly to guide definitive therapy. Prioritize treating the underlying cause. Correct sodium cautiously with explicit targets and frequent monitoring. And individualize decisions in special populations such as athletes, neurosurgical patients, and those with cirrhosis, aligning choices with patient goals and safety [^114hmeK4] [^111fLWER] [^115evmgn].

Hyponatremia is defined as serum sodium < 135 mmol/L [^114hmeK4] and is the most common electrolyte disorder in hospitalized patients [^114hmeK4]. It is classified by serum sodium (mild 130–134, moderate 125–129, severe < 125), duration (acute < 48 h, chronic > 48 h) [^114RsQLR], and volume status (hypovolemic, euvolemic, hypervolemic) [^114Mg1Pm]. Diagnosis requires serum/urine osmolality and urine sodium to distinguish hypotonic from non-hypotonic causes and to guide therapy [^115evmgn]. Acute severe symptomatic hyponatremia is a **medical emergency** [^114hmeK4] treated with **3% hypertonic saline boluses** (100 mL, repeat up to three times) [^114hmeK4] to raise sodium by 4–6 mmol/L rapidly, with strict monitoring to avoid **osmotic demyelination** [^114hmeK4]. Chronic or mild cases are managed by treating the cause, fluid restriction, and cautious correction within guideline limits [^114hmeK4] [^116F8M1C].

## Definition and classification

Hyponatremia is defined as serum sodium < 135 mmol/L [^114hmeK4] and is classified by severity, duration, and volume status:

| **Category** | **Classification** |
|-|-|
| Severity | - Mild: 130–134 mmol/L <br/> - Moderate: 125–129 mmol/L <br/> - Severe: < 125 mmol/L [^111WyraN] |
| Duration | - Acute: < 48 hours <br/> - Chronic: ≥ 48 hours [^114RsQLR] |
| Volume status | - Hypovolemic <br/> - Euvolemic <br/> - Hypervolemic [^114Mg1Pm] |

---

## Pathophysiology

Hyponatremia reflects relative water excess from impaired free-water excretion or excessive intake [^112q1gbT]. Key mechanisms include increased ADH (SIADH, hypovolemia, heart failure, cirrhosis), reduced effective arterial blood volume, and high water intake (polydipsia, IV hypotonic fluids) [^111fLWER].

---

## Clinical manifestations

Symptoms correlate with the rate and magnitude of sodium decline [^114hmeK4]:

- **Mild**: nausea, headache, confusion, fatigue [^111WyraN].
- **Severe**: seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, death [^114hmeK4].
- **Chronic**: gait instability, cognitive impairment, osteoporosis, falls [^114hmeK4].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A structured approach is essential [^116F8M1C]:

- **Confirm hypotonicity**: serum osmolality < 275 mOsm/kg [^116Zh6gJ].
- **Assess volume status**: exam, urine sodium, urine osmolality [^116Zh6gJ].
- **Identify cause**: history, medications, endocrine tests (TSH, cortisol) [^1167NKvm].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on severity, duration, symptoms, and volume status [^115bV1Sk]:

---

### Acute severe symptomatic hyponatremia

- **Hypertonic saline**: 100 mL 3% bolus, repeat up to three times [^111Qzmkn].
- **Target**: raise sodium by 4–6 mmol/L rapidly [^114hmeK4].
- **Limit**: ≤ 8–10 mmol/L in 24 h to avoid osmotic demyelination [^114hmeK4].

---

### Chronic or mild hyponatremia

- **Treat underlying cause**: SIADH, hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency [^114hmeK4].
- **Fluid restriction**: 800–1,200 mL/day [^notfound].
- **Second-line**: urea, vaptans, loop diuretics with salt [^112MGZPb].

---

### Special considerations

In cirrhosis, fluid restriction and albumin are used, and **hypertonic saline** is reserved for severe cases [^116GwdrP] [^116aRe3m]. In heart failure, manage volume and restrict fluids, and consider **vaptans** cautiously [^114hmeK4]. In exercise-associated hyponatremia, treat with hypertonic saline and **avoid hypotonic fluids** [^111Qzmkn].

---

## Complications

Complications include osmotic demyelination syndrome from rapid correction [^111V9Y4A], cerebral edema in acute hyponatremia [^111WX8Kf], and increased mortality, especially in chronic or severe cases [^115bV1Sk].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on severity, chronicity, and comorbidities [^115bV1Sk]. Chronic hyponatremia is linked to falls, cognitive decline, and higher mortality [^114hmeK4]; acute severe hyponatremia has high morbidity and mortality if untreated [^111V9Y4A].

---

Hyponatremia is common and potentially serious; management must balance rapid correction in acute symptomatic cases with cautious, cause-directed therapy in chronic disease to prevent osmotic demyelination and other complications [^114hmeK4].

Severity

Hyponatremia is considered as severe if [Na] is < 115 or 110 mmol/L. In addition, all cases of hyponatremia treated with hypertonic or isotonic saline infusion, including hypovolemia with hyponatremia and absence of overt neurological manifestations, should be considered as severe because of the risks from saline infusion. Saline infusion for hypovolemic hyponatremia carries arguably the highest risk of inadvertently rapid rise in[Na].

Target Serum Sodium Concentration

The targeted rise in [Na] depends on the perceived urgency of treatment. In patients with pronounced hyponatremic symptoms, regardless of chronicity, a rapid rise of 4 to 6 mEq/L is recommended. Further rises may be required if symptoms persist after the initial rise in [Na]. For chronic hyponatremia, previous recommendations set a maximal rate of rise in [Na] at 12 mEq/L in the first 24 hours and a maximal final [Na] of 125 to 130 mEq/L. Because osmotic myelinolysis was observed in patients achieving the desired rate of rise in [Na], the current target rise in [Na] is set at 6 to 8 mEq/L in 24 hours, 12 to 14 mEq/L in 48 hours, and 14 to 16 mEq/L in 72 hours. Prevention of hypernatremia during treatment of hyponatremia is imperative.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) prehospital assessment — point-of-care testing and clinical evaluation: Devices and cartridges require a narrow ambient temperature range of 16 to 30°C (61 to 86°F) to ensure functionality. When testing is unavailable, correct field diagnosis is mostly predicated on obtaining an accurate history of total fluid intake, and supportive features include the absence of major signs and symptoms common to symptomatic hypovolemia, weight gain, and that urine output may be an unreliable differentiator. The guideline states, "When available, point-of-care testing should be done on at-risk, symptomatic patients. If unavailable, integrate all available clinical and historical information into an assessment of the patient's hydration status (history of fluid intake, food intake, preexisting signs and symptoms, body weight if available, and urine output). Recommendation grade: 1C".

Conclusions

Improving both the accuracy of diagnosis and the appropriate management of hyponatraemia are important goals given the morbidity and mortality associated with this common electrolyte disorder. A greater consistency in future clinical practice guidelines would represent a significant educational achievement and, crucially, would help clinicians to pick the best options for patients with hyponatraemia.

Purpose Of Review

Recent studies have consistently demonstrated the common prevalence of hyponatremia in the hospital and intensive care settings, and how it correlates with untoward outcomes. This review discusses the classification, diagnosis, and pathophysiology of hyponatremia and how these agents may influence its management, and also examines the available treatment options and their weaknesses and strengths.

Recent Findings

This review is timely and relevant, as mild degrees of serum sodium lowering may be associated with adverse neurologic and musculoskeletal effects. These findings have the potential to transform our approach to managing hyponatremia. A major advance in our ability to treat hyponatremia was the introduction and approval of aquaretics (vaptans). Emerging data on vaptans and their potential role to treat hyponatremia in the settings of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, congestive heart failure, and liver cirrhosis are presented.

Summary

Vaptans will likely play an important role in treating hyponatremia, given their clinical effectiveness and tolerability. Cost remains a hindrance for vaptans, and more studies are needed to further define their best utilization in hyponatremic patients.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) prevention and hydration guidance — Preventing EAH is the key factor in protecting participants in endurance events and other wilderness recreation activities. Currently, there is no single hydration recommendation that fits all individuals for fluid and salt consumption during all exercise scenarios. We recommend for the majority of participants a hydration strategy that relies on their innate thirst mechanism. Thirst is triggered by changes in serum osmolality and should prevent severe dehydration while minimizing the risk for overhydration and hyponatremia (especially if ADH is present). We recognize that there are situations in which body fluid losses may be excessive and rapid; in these circumstances, thirst may not keep up with body fluid losses, and other hydration strategies may be needed, and in these situations, participants should consider increasing their fluid intake to account for these excessive losses. The typical field response is to encourage oral hypotonic fluid intake or administer rapid isotonic IV fluids to endurance activity participants with the suspicion that they are dehydrated; however, such universal treatment may result in increased morbidity and mortality in the EAH patient.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^114CwAdv]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypotonic hyponatraemia (serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L with low osmolality) is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalised adult patients. The diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia may be complex, costly, and controversial. Hyponatraemia has diverse aetiologies and is additionally defined clinically by its duration, "acute" (< 48 hours) versus "chronic" (> 48 hours), and by the presence or absence of symptoms. Management can be challenging particularly in the emergency setting where different treatment options may help or indeed harm individual patients. It is perhaps surprising that management of this electrolyte disorder has a limited evidence base in part due to the paucity of high quality randomised controlled trials. Multiple clinical practice and consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia have been published by local, national, and international organisations. These guidelines represent genuine efforts to address the diagnostic challenges and controversies in its management, particularly in relation to the rate of correction for the serum sodium concentration. The systematic review by Nagler et al. reviewing the quality of recent published guidelines and consensus statements for diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia, has highlighted important variations in both their development and recommendations.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia [^111V9Y4A]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with severe (serum sodium ≤ 120 mEq/L), symptomatic hyponatremia can develop life-threatening or fatal complications from cerebral edema if treatment is inadequate and permanent neurologic disability from osmotic demyelination if treatment is excessive. Unfortunately, as is true of all electrolyte disturbances, there are no randomized trials to guide the treatment of this challenging disorder. Rather, therapeutic decisions rest on physiologic principles, animal models, observational studies, and single-patient reports. European guidelines and recommendations of an American Expert panel have come to similar conclusions on how much correction of hyponatremia is enough and how much is too much, but there are important differences. We review the evidence supporting these recommendations, identifying areas that rest on relatively solid ground and highlighting areas in greatest need of additional data.

Guidelines of hyponatraemia treatment

Hypotonic hyponatraemia is a clinical state where there is a relative excess of water to sodium content in the extracellular fluid. Acute hyponatraemia is clinically important as it can cause significant morbidity and mortality associated with rapid development of symptomatic cerebral oedema. Prompt treatment to raise the serum sodium concentration in this setting is life-saving. Chronic hyponatraemia, even if asymptomatic, is associated with many adverse outcomes including prolonged hospitalisation, gait instability, falls, fractures, and increased bone loss. Diverse strategies to correct chronic hyponatraemia have been recommended and success of such treatment is dependent on the underlying aetiology for hyponatraemia. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatraemia may trigger an osmotic demyelination syndrome resulting in serious neurological deficits and death.

The methodological quality of guideline development and consensus statements can be assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) process. This tool is used to systematically evaluate six guideline domains including scope, stakeholder involvement, editorial independence, rigour of development, clarity, and applicability. Nagler et al. identified five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements after a comprehensive search of English and non-English publications, guideline databases, and professional society websites. Their recommendations differed with respect to classification of hyponatraemia, diagnostic tests, doses of saline to use for correction, limits for the rise in serum sodium concentration, and the most appropriate second line therapies for management. The overall quality of these publications (measured by the AGREE tool) was mixed.

Should we be surprised that individual hyponatraemia guidelines "failed" this test of quality? Arguably, the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia cannot be subjected to this sort of rigorous analysis because of the low level of evidence available to help various expert panels and guideline groups write internationally consistent advice. For example, hyponatraemia occurring within 48 hours is an arbitrary cut-off for determining the presence of acute hyponatraemia, the desired rate of correction for hyponatraemia in most settings is not universally agreed, availability of certain recommended therapies is country dependent and impacted by differing regulatory indications for drugs, and even the biochemical threshold for defining hyponatraemia varies widely in the literature. Furthermore, many of the clinical algorithms require initial assessment of the extracellular fluid volume to determine if a hyponatraemic patient is hypovolaemic, euvolaemic, or hypervolaemic. In practice, this physical examination of fluid balance can be subject to misinterpretation if the clinical signs are subtle.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^1141Futk]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Six groups included healthcare professionals from different specialties. Multidisciplinary contribution serves to broaden the approach to health-care problems, increase the completeness of evidence-finding strategies, and help to identify hurdles to implementation. When reflecting on approaches to hyponatremia, bringing together several disciplines mirrors the clinical reality of multiple specialty areas dealing with the same problem but looking at it from a different angle. Only one of the development groups reported considering patients' views and experiences, but even then did so to a limited extent. Decisions on clinical care should factor in patient values and preferences. Interventions for chronic hyponatremia, such as fluid restriction, may affect quality of life and patient preference should influence the ultimate recommendations.

Low scores for applicability mostly reflect the absence of describing barriers to guideline implementation and failure to provide tools for putting the recommendations into practice. In part, guidelines are designed to deal with the challenges of increasing knowledge and time-pressure. They are designed to help make decisions at the point of care. However, being often lengthy publications without layered presentation of information, it is likely that the majority of the guidance documents may not reach their target audience or stimulate implementation. Four guidance documents provided algorithms for diagnosis or treatment; although these are likely to increase the utility of a guideline, it is unclear to what extent they truly improve implementation of the recommendations. How to best communicate evidence-based recommendations to the relevant stakeholders is a recent but active area of research lead by the DECIDE consortium. With results of their research expected, guideline developers will have additional targets for improving the applicability in the future.

Wilderness Medical Society exercise-associated hyponatremia definitions — This table standardizes key terms and thresholds relevant to exercise and heat illness. Exercise-associated hyponatremia is defined as "A serum, plasma, or blood sodium concentration below the normal reference range of 135 mmol·L-1 that occurs during or up to 24 h after prolonged physical activity", while the severe variant with encephalopathy is "A severe form of exercise-associated hyponatremia associated with neurologic changes resulting from cerebral edema". Exercise-associated hypernatremia is "A serum, plasma, or blood sodium concentration > 145 mmol·L-1 that occurs during or up to 24 h after prolonged physical activity". Heat stroke is "A core temperature above 40°C (104°F) with altered mental status and generally divided into 2 categories: classic heat stroke… and exertional heat stroke". Hypohydration during exercise is described as "hypohydration during exercise with > 2% of body mass can occur from sweat loss during exercise and high environmental temperatures and is usually characterized as hyperosmotic hypovolemia". Hypertonic saline is "Any crystalloid solution containing more than 0.9% sodium chloride (ie, 3% sodium chloride)". Overhydration is "Excessive oral intake of hypotonic fluids (eg, water and sport electrolyte drinks) resulting in the amount of salt and other electrolytes in the body becoming diluted (ie, hyponatremia)", and hyponatremic encephalopathy occurs when "serum sodium rapidly decreases (eg, exercise-associated hyponatremia), there is an osmotic shift of fluid into the intracellular spaces, resulting in cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure".

Vasopressin-2 receptor antagonists, collectively known as the 'vaptans', provide a new approach to the treatment of hyponatremia; therefore, an updated Review of the pathophysiology of hyponatremia is particularly timely. After briefly defining hyponatremia and introducing its clinical aspects and complications, we present an approach to the diagnosis and evaluation of hyponatremia that is based primarily on the often-underused concept of free water clearance and, more specifically, the electrolyte-free water clearance. Then we review the use of vasopressin receptor antagonists in the management of hyponatremia from the standpoint of their pharmacology, their mechanism of action, and available efficacy data from clinical trials.

### Mild chronic hyponatremia in the ambulatory setting: significance and management [^115rvcWm]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Mild chronic hyponatremia, as defined by a persistent (> 72 hours) plasma sodium concentration between 125 and 135 mEq/L without apparent symptoms, is common in ambulatory patients and generally perceived as being inconsequential. The association between increased mortality and hyponatremia in hospitalized patients in various settings and etiologies is widely recognized. This review analyzes the significance of mild chronic hyponatremia in ambulatory subjects and its effects on mortality and morbidity. It addresses whether this disorder should even be treated and if so, which patients are likely to benefit from treatment. The available approaches to correct hyponatremia in such patients in the context of recently published panel-generated recommendations and guidelines are described.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^111bC6Vc]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Approaches to treatment for hyponatremia

Table 3 shows the recommendations for the medical management of hyponatremia. Guidance documents distinguished treatment scenarios based on whether patients had severe symptoms or whether the hyponatremia was acute (48 h) or chronic. All but one discussed treatment in the setting of severe symptoms and recommended infusion of hypertonic saline, usually specified as having a concentration of 3%. One suggested using a formula to guide the infusion speed of a continuous infusion, five others recommended giving a fixed dose, or a dose adjusted to body weight with repeated serum sodium concentration measurements to check progression.

Table 3
Summary of recommendations for approaches to treatments for hyponatremia by included guidance documents

NIV, Nederlandse Internisten Vereniging; NHS, National Health Service; GAIN, Guidelines and Audit Implementation Network; AEEH, La Asociación Española para el Estudio del Hígado; EHN, European Hyponatremia Network; ERBP, European Renal Best Practice; ESE, European Society of Endocrinology; ESICM, European Society of Intensive Care Medicine; UF, University of Florida; HEP, Hyponatremia Expert Panel; RCH Melbourne, the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne; EAH-ICD, International Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia Consensus Development Conference.

Patients without symptoms of hyponatremia were assumed to have chronic onset hyponatremia, and treatment suggestions were mostly dependent on the classification hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Only three guidance documents specifically advised treating the underlying condition. Seven suggested 0.9% saline in hypovolemia, with infusion speeds calculated with Adrogué-Madias, until restoration of blood pressure or until nasogastric rehydration could start.

For euvolemic asymptomatic hyponatremia, the majority recommended fluid restriction as the first-line treatment. Five guidance documents proposed a number of other interventions as second-line treatments including loop diuretics, demeclocycline, urea, vasopressin receptor antagonists, or lithium. One guideline specifically recommended against vasopressin receptor antagonists in case of a serum sodium concentration < 125 mmol/L.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^1174Gy8M]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia is a common electrolyte disorder associated with significant complications and controversies regarding its optimal management. Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements have attempted to provide clinicians with evidence-based diagnostic and treatment strategies for hyponatraemia. Recently published guidance documents differ in their methods employed to review the quality of available evidence. Nagler et al. used the Appraisal of Guideline for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument in a systematic review of guidelines and consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia. Nagler and colleagues highlighted the variability in methodological rigour applied to guideline development and inconsistencies between publications in relation to management of hyponatraemia (including the recommended rate of correction of a low serum sodium concentration). These differences could cause confusion for practising physicians managing patients with hyponatraemia. Please see related article: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/12/231.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: compilation of the guidelines [^116F8M1C]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common water balance disorder that often poses a diagnostic or therapeutic challenge. Therefore, guidelines were developed by professional organizations, one from within the United States (2013) and one from within Europe (2014). This review discusses the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, comparing the two guidelines and highlighting recent developments. Diagnostically, the initial step is to differentiate hypotonic from nonhypotonic hyponatremia. Hypotonic hyponatremia is further differentiated on the basis of urine osmolality, urine sodium level, and volume status. Recently identified parameters, including fractional uric acid excretion and plasma copeptin concentration, may further improve the diagnostic approach. The treatment for hyponatremia is chosen on the basis of duration and symptoms. For acute or severely symptomatic hyponatremia, both guidelines adopted the approach of giving a bolus of hypertonic saline. Although fluid restriction remains the first-line treatment for most forms of chronic hyponatremia, therapy to increase renal free water excretion is often necessary. Vasopressin receptor antagonists, urea, and loop diuretics serve this purpose, but received different recommendations in the two guidelines. Such discrepancies may relate to different interpretations of the limited evidence or differences in guideline methodology. Nevertheless, the development of guidelines has been important in advancing this evolving field.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) management principles and heat illness definition — For this guideline, heat illness is defined "as any total body water deficit (> 2% of body weight) that can occur from sweat loss during physical activity in high environmental temperatures". When EAH is confirmed or strongly suspected, "empiric treatment of symptomatic EAH is an acceptable option", and "treatment options should be predicated on the presence (or absence) of neurologic impairment to differentiate mild EAH from severe EAH and guide resuscitative choices". The page notes this algorithmic empiric approach "can be lifesaving and is unlikely (but unconfirmed) to induce harm", and emphasizes that "individuals can rapidly progress from mild to severe EAH", so "initial resuscitation and symptomatic care to minimize morbidity and progression of disease are of paramount importance".

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review… [^1169CfKA]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and it affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality. Observations Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia range from mild and nonspecific to severe and life-threatening. Symptom severity depends on the rapidity of development, duration, and severity of hyponatremia. Mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and increased rates of falls and fractures. In a prospective study, patients with hyponatremia more frequently reported a history of falling compared with people with normal serum sodium levels and had a higher rate of new fractures over a mean follow-up of 7. 4 years. Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status. For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4. 5% to 28% of people. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death. Conclusions and Relevance Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized. Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia.

Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

### Hyponatremia demystified: integrating physiology to shape clinical practice [^112q1gbT]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is one of the most common problems encountered in clinical practice and one of the least-understood because accurate diagnosis and management require some familiarity with water homeostasis physiology, making the topic seemingly complex. The prevalence of hyponatremia depends on the nature of the population studied and the criteria used to define it. Hyponatremia is associated with poor outcomes including increased mortality and morbidity. The pathogenesis of hypotonic hyponatremia involves the accumulation of electrolyte-free water caused by either increased intake and/or decrease in kidney excretion. Plasma osmolality, urine osmolality, and urine sodium can help to differentiate among the different etiologies. Brain adaptation to plasma hypotonicity consisting of solute extrusion to mitigate further water influx into brain cells best explains the clinical manifestations of hyponatremia. Acute hyponatremia has an onset within 48 hours, commonly resulting in severe symptoms, while chronic hyponatremia develops over 48 hours and usually is pauci-symptomatic. However, the latter increases the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome if hyponatremia is corrected rapidly; therefore, extreme caution must be exercised when correcting plasma sodium. Management strategies depend on the presence of symptoms and the cause of hyponatremia and are discussed in this review.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: expert panel recommendations [^111WX8Kf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious, but often overlooked, electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema, and excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death as a result of osmotic demyelination. The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder. In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations that defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the 6 years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients. Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary and a panel of hyponatremia experts (which included all of the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal current management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia that are based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent published data in this field.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^111WyraN]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are electrolyte disorders that can be associated with poor outcomes. Hyponatremia is considered mild when the sodium concentration is 130 to 134 mEq per L, moderate when 125 to 129 mEq per L, and severe when less than 125 mEq per L. Mild symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache, and mild neurocognitive deficits. Severe symptoms of hyponatremia include delirium, confusion, impaired consciousness, ataxia, seizures, and, rarely, brain herniation and death. Patients with a sodium concentration of less than 125 mEq per L and severe symptoms require emergency infusions with 3% hypertonic saline. Using calculators to guide fluid replacement helps avoid overly rapid correction of sodium concentration, which can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome. Physicians should identify the cause of a patient's hyponatremia, if possible; however, treatment should not be delayed while a diagnosis is pursued. Common causes include certain medications, excessive alcohol consumption, very low-salt diets, and excessive free water intake during exercise. Management to correct sodium concentration is based on whether the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is treated with normal saline infusions. Treating euvolemic hyponatremia includes restricting free water consumption or using salt tablets or intravenous vaptans. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is treated primarily by managing the underlying cause (e.g., heart failure, cirrhosis) and free water restriction. Hypernatremia is less common than hyponatremia. Mild hypernatremia is often caused by dehydration resulting from an impaired thirst mechanism or lack of access to water; however, other causes, such as diabetes insipidus, are possible. Treatment starts with addressing the underlying etiology and correcting the fluid deficit. When sodium is severely elevated, patients are symptomatic, or intravenous fluids are required, hypotonic fluid replacement is necessary.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — acute in-hospital treatment recommendations — Oral and IV hypotonic or isotonic hydration should be avoided early in the management of EAH, although it may be appropriate in certain clinical contexts once sodium correction has been initiated or hypovolemia is confirmed. Recommendation grade: 1C. With suspected EAH, and particularly in those with altered mental status, sodium estimation should be obtained as rapidly as possible after hospital arrival. Recommendation grade: 1A. A rapid assessment for signs and symptoms of cerebral edema or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema should be done in all patients with possible EAH. Recommendation grade: 1A. Severe EAH biochemically confirmed or symptomatic EAH should be treated with a 100-mL bolus of IV HTS, which can be repeated twice at 10-min intervals (3 doses in total) or until improvement of neurologic symptoms, with the aim of acutely increasing serum sodium concentration by about 4 to 5 mmol·L−1 and reversing cerebral edema. Recommendation grade: 1A.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^113ho7wX]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia, defined as a serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L, is the most common disorder of body fluid and electrolyte balance encountered in clinical practice. Hyponatraemia is present in 15–20% of emergency admissions to hospital and occurs in up to 20% of critically ill patients. Symptomatology may vary from subtle to severe or even life threatening. Despite this, the management of patients remains problematic. Against this background, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, the European Society of Endocrinology and the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association, represented by European Renal Best Practice have developed a Clinical Practice Guideline on the diagnostic approach and treatment of hyponatraemia as a joint venture of three societies representing specialists with a natural interest in hyponatraemia.

### Management of chronic hyponatremia in the outpatient setting [^117F2NEf]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

The diagnostic evaluation and management of chronic hyponatremia in outpatients can be challenging for several reasons. First, chronic hyponatremia is often mild, leading to uncertainty about whether it is clinically significant and warrants further diagnostic evaluation and treatment. Second, if the initial diagnostic workup does not identify a clear cause, it becomes uncertain how much further investigation is required. Third, when no clear cause is found or the underlying condition cannot be treated, physicians may struggle to choose the most appropriate treatment approach. This review offers practical guidance to navigate these challenges in managing chronic hyponatremia in the outpatient setting.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^114bTxzD]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

International guidelines designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia have been widely accepted for a decade. On the basis of the results of a recent large retrospective study of patients hospitalized with hyponatremia, it has been suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of rise of the serum sodium concentration; the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration has been questioned. These assertions are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. After reviewing the history of that controversy, the evidence supporting the guidelines, and the validity of data challenging them, we conclude that current safeguards should not be abandoned. To do so would be akin to discarding your umbrella because you remained dry in a rainstorm. The authors of this review, who represent 20 medical centers in nine countries, have all contributed significantly to the literature on the subject. We urge clinicians to continue to treat severe hyponatremia cautiously and to wait for better evidence before adopting less stringent therapeutic limits.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^111fLWER]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyponatremia:

- **Definition**: Hyponatremia an electrolyte disorder characterized by low serum sodium concentration, and is typically defined as a serum sodium of < 135 mEq/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: Causes of hyponatremia include increased water intake (psychogenic polydipsia), low dietary solute intake (tea and toast diet), decreased water excretion secondary to elevated plasma ADH levels (volume depletion, SIADH, severe hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency), and expansion of plasma volume in the context of edematous states.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyponatremia in the general population of the US is 1.72%.
- **Disease course**: Treatment of hyponatremia requires careful attention to avoid overly rapid correction of serum sodium, which can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome, permanent neurological impairment, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 40% of patients with osmotic demyelination syndrome recover fully, whereas 25% have persistent neurological deficits. Mortality associated with osmotic demyelination syndrome is approximately 6%.

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^116yEj9k]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

This review will address the management of hyponatremia caused by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) in hospitalized patients. To do so requires an understanding of the pathogenesis and diagnosis of SIADH, as well as currently available treatment options. The review will be structured as responses to a series of questions, followed by a presentation of an algorithm for determining the most appropriate treatments for individual patients with SIADH based on their presenting symptoms.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to management of hyponatremia, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to limit the use of hypertonic saline in the management of hypervolemic hyponatremia to the rare cases presenting with life-threatening complications. Consider administering hypertonic saline in patients with severe hyponatremia expected to get liver transplantation within a few days. Correct the serum sodium concentration slowly (≤ 8 mmol/L per day), once an attenuation of symptoms has been obtained, to avoid irreversible neurological sequelae, such as osmotic demyelination.

Hyponatraemia is the most common electrolyte abnormality encountered in clinical practice; despite this, the work-up and management of hyponatraemia remain suboptimal and varies among different specialist groups. The majority of data comparing hyponatraemia treatments have been observational, up until recently. The past two years have seen the publication of several randomised control trials investigating hyponatraemia treatments, both for chronic and acute hyponatraemia. In this article, we aim to provide a background to the physiology, cause and impact of hyponatraemia and summarise the most recent data on treatments for acute and chronic hyponatraemia, highlighting their efficacy, tolerability and adverse effects.

### Hyponatremia in the neurosurgical patient: epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management [^115amGD4]. Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Hyponatremia is an important and common electrolyte disorder in critically ill neurosurgical patients that has been reported in association with a number of different primary diagnoses. The correct diagnosis of the pathophysiological cause is vital because it dramatically alters the treatment approach.

Methods

We review the epidemiology and presentation of patients with hyponatremia, the pathophysiology of the disorder with respect to sodium and fluid balance, and the diagnostic procedures for determining the correct cause.

Results

We then present the various treatment options, including discussion of one of the newest groups of agents, the arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists, currently under study for the treatment of hyponatremia in neurosurgical patients.

Conclusion

Hyponatremia is a serious comorbidity in neurosurgical patients that requires particular attention as its treatment varies by cause and its consequences can affect neurological outcome.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^112tk11f]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

However, it is also possible that discrepancies between guidance documents may in part be explained by differences in underlying methods of development. Quality, as assessed by AGREE II, was suboptimal at best, with only two documents obtaining a score > 50% for each of the six quality domains. The findings suggest that several aspects related to methodological rigor of development, stakeholder involvement, applicability, and editorial independence could be improved, possibly improving consistency in provided guidance. This is in line with the findings of a recent overview of 42 appraisal studies including a total of 626 clinical practice guidelines across several clinical disciplines. For guidelines to be trustworthy, they must be i) founded on high quality systematic reviews, ii) include the relevant stakeholders, and iii) be applicable in clinical practice.

Only half of the guidance groups stated they had conducted a systematic review of the evidence. Save one, the reviews would not have met the Institute of Medicine's criteria for reporting high-quality systematic reviews, because key methods for finding and assessing individual studies as well as synthesizing the body of evidence were not described. Conducting high-quality systematic reviews requires specific methodological expertise and support which may not be available to most groups. One solution might be to harmonize effort across organizations, thus focusing resources, allowing higher quality reviews and reducing duplication and possibly inconsistency between guidelines.

### Approach to the patient: hyponatremia and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^115bV1Sk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disturbance seen in clinical practice, affecting up to 30% of acute hospital admissions, and is associated with significant adverse clinical outcomes. Acute or severe symptomatic hyponatremia carries a high risk of neurological morbidity and mortality. In contrast, chronic hyponatremia is associated with significant morbidity including increased risk of falls, osteoporosis, fractures, gait instability, and cognitive decline; prolonged hospital admissions; and etiology-specific increase in mortality. In this Approach to the Patient, we review and compare the current recommendations, guidelines, and literature for diagnosis and treatment options for both acute and chronic hyponatremia, illustrated by 2 case studies. Particular focus is concentrated on the diagnosis and management of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis. An understanding of the pathophysiology of hyponatremia, along with a synthesis of the duration of hyponatremia, biochemical severity, symptomatology, and blood volume status, forms the structure to guide the appropriate and timely management of hyponatremia. We present 2 illustrative cases that represent common presentations with hyponatremia and discuss the approach to management of these and other causes of hyponatremia.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^116fNs9z]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In the "real world", the non-expert doctor who initially recognises and responds to severe hyponatraemia (serum sodium concentration < 120 mmol/L) in a critically ill patient will often be a junior trainee working "out of routine office hours". In this emergency setting, the doctor may have limited immediate access to important additional diagnostic tests, e.g. serum and urine osmolality and urine electrolytes. Urgent treatment decisions may need to be taken to manage symptoms such as confusion and seizures, with incomplete patient history and diagnostic information. There is a general consensus that hypertonic saline is effective in the immediate management of acute symptomatic hyponatraemia but available guidelines differ on the volumes and rates of saline infusion. Ultimately, it is clinical judgement rather than adherence to a particular guideline that will determine an individual patient's treatment. Intuitive clinical algorithms, with proven efficacy, would help to encourage "best practice" in the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^114EsrDx]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Criteria for selection of studies

We included evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements on the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia. We defined clinical practice guidelines as statements that included recommendations intended to optimize patient care informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options. We defined consensus statements as documents containing clinically relevant suggestions or recommendations based on the collective opinion of an expert panel. We included all publications independent of language. We excluded guidelines related to the prevention of hyponatremia as well as guidelines relevant to conditions associated with hyponatremia if they were not specifically designed to address hyponatremia. Hence, we excluded guidelines targeting treatment of heart failure, cirrhosis, and cancer unless they were developed with a focus on hyponatremia as a complication. Finally, we also excluded draft unpublished guidelines, conference or discussion papers, personal opinions, and obsolete guidelines replaced by updated recommendations from the same organization.

Search methods for guidelines and consensus statements

We searched MEDLINE (1946 to September Week 1, 2014) and EMBASE (1980 to September 2014), combining vocabulary terms and text words for hyponatremia with terms related to clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements. We also searched guideline databases and websites of organizations as well as of selected professional specialist societies in nephrology, endocrinology, and intensive care medicine. A list of the databases and websites along with the full search strategies are outlined in Additional file 1. EN and JV independently screened the titles and abstracts and discarded those that did not meet the inclusion criteria. Full texts for potentially relevant guidelines or consensus statements were retrieved and examined for eligibility. Both the initial screening and subsequent full-paper assessment stage were completed using Early Review Organizing Software.

Data collection process and data items

We developed a draft data extraction form which was piloted and modified as necessary. The extracted data included document characteristics (e.g. year of publication, country/region, development team, funding organization), recommendations related to the diagnosis and assessment of hyponatremia, and recommendations related to the treatment of hyponatremia. EN and JV extracted all data using the standardized data extraction form (Additional file 2) and resolved discrepancies by consensus.

### Euvolemic hyponatremia in cancer patients. report of the hyponatremia registry: an observational multicenter international study [^112nQieF]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The Hyponatremia Registry is the largest observational hyponatremia study to date. The current analysis focuses on the subgroup of cancer-related SIADH, which accounts for approximately one third of all cases of SIADH. With 358 patients, this analysis represents the largest group of cancer patients with SIADH ever studied.

Of note, 39% of all cancer patients initially enrolled as euvolemic hyponatremia had to be excluded, mostly because of clear signs of hypo- or hypervolemia. Thorough assessment of volume status, however, is key for determining the cause of hyponatremia. Although SIADH is a diagnosis of exclusion, clinicians apparently readily interpret hyponatremia in cancer patients as SIADH without excluding alternative causes. In addition, a minimal set of lab results is mandatory for a diagnosis of SIADH, but was performed in only 46% and a hyponatremia expert was consulted in only 43% of patients. In line with these findings, sub-optimal management of hyponatremia in general is widespread, as has been reported repeatedly. However, in contrast to what we have previously demonstrated in the overall SIADH population, proper work-up of hyponatremia was not associated with superior treatment effectiveness in the cancer-related SIADH subgroup.

Although hyponatremia is a common, usually mild, and relatively asymptomatic disorder of electrolytes, acute severe hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with concomitant disease. In addition, overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic deficits and death, and optimal treatment strategies for such cases are not established. An expert panel assessed the potential contributions of aquaretic nonpeptide small-molecule arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR) antagonists to hyponatremia therapies. This review presents their conclusions, including identification of appropriate treatment populations and possible future indications for aquaretic AVPR antagonists.

Approaches to diagnostic strategies for hyponatremia

Seven guidance documents covered diagnosis and differential diagnosis of hyponatremia. Table 2 shows the key recommendations. The key areas addressed included the threshold for initiating diagnostic workup, confirmation and classification of hypotonic hyponatremia, and identification of the underlying disorder.

Table 2
Summary of recommendations for approaches to diagnosis of hyponatremia by included guidance documents

Guidance documents differed somewhat in their recommended threshold for starting diagnostic assessment. Six recommended starting diagnostic assessment when the serum sodium concentration dropped below 135 mmol/L and to confirm hypotonicity through a measured serum or plasma osmolality < 275 to 285 mOsm/kg. Two others set lower thresholds of serum sodium concentration at < 131 mmol/L and < 130 mmol/L. Six guidance documents advised classifying hypotonic hyponatremia into categories of hypovolemia, euvolemia, and hypervolemia to aid differential diagnosis and guide treatment. Most guidance documents recommended a clinical assessment of hydration status and a urinary sodium concentration as well as a urinary osmolality measurement, although specific criteria, thresholds, and algorithms differed.

Most guidance documents proposed additional laboratory tests that could be of value to identify the underlying disorder, but they varied substantially regarding which tests to use in what situation and which reference values to use. Only two explicitly recommended taking a history of drug intake and symptoms as part of the assessment. Four presented an algorithm to guide differential diagnosis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^115evmgn]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder. Multiple organizations have published guidance documents to assist clinicians in managing hyponatremia. We aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of these documents.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and websites of guideline organizations and professional societies to September 2014 without language restriction for Clinical Practice Guidelines (defined as any document providing guidance informed by systematic literature review) and Consensus Statements (any other guidance document) developed specifically to guide differential diagnosis or treatment of hyponatremia. Four reviewers appraised guideline quality using the 23-item AGREE II instrument, which rates reporting of the guidance development process across six domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. Total scores were calculated as standardized averages by domain.

Results

We found ten guidance documents; five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements. Overall, quality was mixed: two clinical practice guidelines attained an average score of > 50% for all of the domains, three rated the evidence in a systematic way and two graded strength of the recommendations. All five consensus statements received AGREE scores below 60% for each of the specific domains. The guidance documents varied widely in scope. All dealt with therapy and seven included recommendations on diagnosis, using serum osmolality to confirm hypotonic hyponatremia, and volume status, urinary sodium concentration, and urinary osmolality for further classification of the hyponatremia. They differed, however, in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Eight guidance documents advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset (< 48 h) hyponatremia. In chronic (> 48 h) or asymptomatic cases, recommended treatments were NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. Eight guidance documents recommended limits for speed of increase of sodium concentration, but these varied between 8 and 12 mmol/L per 24 h. Inconsistencies also existed in the recommended dose of NaCl, its initial infusion speed, and which second line interventions to consider.

Conclusions

Current guidance documents on the assessment and treatment of hyponatremia vary in methodological rigor and recommendations are not always consistent.

### Management of hyponatremia… [^1153WXiP]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia generally is defined as a plasma sodium level of less than 135 mEq per L. Total body sodium is primarily extracellular, and any increase results in increased tonicity, which stimulates the thirst center and arginine vasopressin secretion. Arginine vasopressin then acts on the V2 receptors in the renal tubules, causing increased water reabsorption. The opposite occurs with decreased extracellular sodium: a decrease inhibits the thirst center and arginine vasopressin secretion, resulting in diuresis. In most cases, hyponatremia results when the elimination of total body water decreases. The pathophysiology of hyponatremia will be discussed later in this article. HYPERVOLEMIC HYPONATREMIA Hyponatremia in the presence of edema indicates increased total body sodium and water. This increase in total body water is greater than the total body sodium level, resulting in edema.

The three main causes of hypervolemic hyponatremia are congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and renal diseases such as renal failure and nephrotic syndrome. These disorders usually are obvious from the clinical history and physical examination alone. EUVOLEMIC AND HYPOVOLEMIC HYPONATREMIA Hyponatremia in a volume-depleted patient is caused by a deficit in total body sodium and total body water, with a disproportionately greater sodium loss, whereas in euvolemic hyponatremia, the total body sodium level is normal or near normal. Differentiating between hypovolemia and euvolemia may be clinically difficult, especially if the classic features of volume depletion such as postural hypotension and tachycardia are absent. Treatment The treatment of hyponatremia can be divided into two steps. First, the physician must decide whether immediate treatment is required.

This decision is based on the presence of symptoms, the degree of hyponatremia, whether the condition is acute or chronic, and the presence of any degree of hypotension. The second step is to determine the most appropriate method of correcting the hyponatremia. Shock resulting from volume depletion should be treated with intravenous isotonic saline.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^111PapxU]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements provide recommendations to help evidence-based practice by suggesting the most appropriate diagnostic tests and the most appropriate treatments. Over the years, multiple organizations have developed recommendations to assist clinicians in the management of hyponatremia. To be reliable, these recommendations must be based on a systematic review of the evidence, and have a transparent and multidisciplinary development process. Inconsistencies between recommendations may arise from failing to meet development standards and can only add to unwarranted variability in management. In this study, we aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of the existing guidance documents on the diagnosis and management of hyponatremia in adults and children.

Wilderness Medical Society EAH guidelines — methods of the 2019 update — report that the expert panel was convened in May 2018, selected members based on prehospital EAH treatment experience, clinical expertise, or research experience, and identified relevant articles through searches of MEDLINE, the US National Library of Medicine, and the National Institutes of Health using terms including hyponatremia, EAH, arginine vasopressin, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, hyponatremic encephalopathy, and hypertonic saline (HTS). Articles published between 2014 and 2018 were the focus; abstract-only studies were not included, and conclusions from review articles were not used to formulate recommendations. When no relevant studies were identified, recommendations were based on risk versus benefit perceptions derived from patient-care experience; the panel used a consensus approach, and recommendations were graded on the basis of clinical strength as outlined by the American College of Chest Physicians.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^114hmeK4]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and it affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality.

Observations

Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia range from mild and nonspecific (such as weakness or nausea) to severe and life-threatening (such as seizures or coma). Symptom severity depends on the rapidity of development, duration, and severity of hyponatremia. Mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and increased rates of falls and fractures. In a prospective study, patients with hyponatremia more frequently reported a history of falling compared with people with normal serum sodium levels (23.8% vs 16.4%, respectively; P < .01) and had a higher rate of new fractures over a mean follow-up of 7.4 years (23.3% vs 17.3%; P < .004). Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status (hypovolemic hyponatremia, euvolemic hyponatremia, or hypervolemic hyponatremia). For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. Urea and vaptans can be effective treatments for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure, but have adverse effects (eg, poor palatability and gastric intolerance with urea; and overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and increased thirst with vaptans). Severely symptomatic hyponatremia (with signs of somnolence, obtundation, coma, seizures, or cardiorespiratory distress) is a medical emergency. US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L (correction limit) within the first 24 hours. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4.5% to 28% of people. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized. Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia. Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116Dh6zX]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in clinical medicine; it represents an excess of water relative to total body solute. Hyponatremia usually results from the intake and subsequent retention of electrolyte-free water in response to true hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal solute loss or malnutrition; decreased effective circulating volume due to heart failure or liver cirrhosis; or non-osmotic vasopressin activity due to malignancies, infections, medications, pain, or stress. When defined as a serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/L, hyponatremia occurs in up to 8% of the general population and in up to 60% of hospitalized patients. Acute profound hyponatremia can cause brain edema, but also chronic mild hyponatremia is associated with poor health outcomes. Even when comorbid conditions are taken into account, people with a mildly decreased serum sodium concentration have a 30% higher risk of death and are hospitalized 14% longer relative to those without hyponatremia.

Despite the frequency and severity of some of the associated complications, research suggests hyponatremia is often neglected by clinicians. If acquired in hospital, it may take days before the electrolyte disorder is investigated, potentially allowing a further decrease in serum sodium concentration and exposing patients to the dangers of profound hyponatremia. When efforts are made to explore the underlying cause, clinicians use widely different strategies for differential diagnosis, testing is often inadequate and misclassification of the hyponatremia frequently occurs.

Hyponatremia may be managed clinically by different specialists, such as endocrinologists, nephrologists, geriatricians, or intensivists, and, accordingly, management strategies often vary. Although probably related to variation in awareness, differences in expert opinion on whom and how to treat only add to the confusion over optimal management. For instance, although experts agree that acute symptomatic hyponatremia should be treated with hypertonic saline, the optimal concentrations and methods for determining initial infusion speeds are debated. In addition, the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome after rapid correction of hyponatremia has fuelled intense debate among experts on whether complications of untreated hyponatremia or complications of treatment pose the greatest risk. As different specialist physicians deal with hyponatremia, consultation of different information and guidance sources may add to the variability in treatment seen in clinical practice today.

Discussion

We found five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements covering the diagnostic approach to and treatment of hyponatremia. Although most used serum osmolality, volume status, urinary sodium, and urinary osmolality to guide differential diagnosis, they differed in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Most advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset hyponatremia and NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. However, they somewhat differed in the limits for speed of increase in serum sodium concentration and which specific medications to use. The reasons for offering different recommendations are undoubtedly multifactorial. They may in part be explained by the fact that recommendations were issued by organizations differing in context and scope. It is also very likely that some variability in guidance arose through limitations in the evidence available for guideline developers to base their recommendations on. In the most recent guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, 98% of the graded recommendations were based on very low and low level of evidence, while none were based on a high level of evidence. The lack of high quality evidence may have increased the part opinion had to play in framing the recommendations. In addition, the evidence that was available may have been interpreted differently dependent on the importance for decision making given to certain outcomes (e.g. serum sodium concentration). Finally, differences in personal experience due to differing availability of medications may partly explain possible differences in perception of uncertainties around drug safety.

Hyponatremia's effects can be insidious, particularly in patients with heart failure, cirrhosis, and pneumonia. Appreciating its prevalence in hospitalized patients, recognizing its symptoms, characterizing its etiology, and employing appropriate management promptly will help reduce morbidity and mortality among hyponatremic patients.
