## Question

In greater trochanteric bursitis and iliotibial band syndrome, where do patients most commonly report pain?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking where patients most commonly report pain in greater trochanteric bursitis (greater trochanteric pain syndrome, GTPS) versus iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the classic anatomic pain generators and their hallmark locations. Then, I should verify typical radiation patterns and provocative features. Next, I will check for areas of overlap or coexistence that could blur the clinical picture. Finally, I will synthesize the most likely pain locations for each to answer succinctly and clinically. I should confirm that lateral hip pain is the hallmark of GTPS and lateral knee pain is the hallmark of ITBS before proceeding.

> Let me first confirm the GTPS pain pattern. GTPS classically presents with focal tenderness directly over the greater trochanter and pain on the lateral aspect of the hip, often radiating down the lateral thigh toward the knee, and occasionally to the buttock or below the knee, which can mislead clinicians if the point of maximal tenderness at the posterolateral greater trochanter is not sought on exam [^116pY7t9] [^1166oqRx]. I should double-check that patients frequently report lateral thigh pain worsened by prolonged sitting or stair climbing, again localizing the maximal tenderness to the trochanter, which reinforces the lateral hip origin rather than the knee [^112tkwMb] [^113bw672].

> Next, I will examine the ITBS pain pattern. Wait, let me verify where ITBS most often hurts: the dominant description is lateral knee pain centered at the lateral femoral epicondyle due to repetitive friction or compression of the distal iliotibial band with flexion-extension activities, especially in runners and cyclists [^1146hGrC] [^117Pohtr]. Hold on, I should also note that some patients describe distal lateral thigh pain radiating to the knee, which fits the same distal friction zone and can mimic other causes of lateral thigh or even radicular pain, but the classic epicenter remains the lateral knee region [^111Dhx7q] [^1146hGrC].

> But wait, what if both conditions are present or symptoms overlap along the IT band's course. I need to check for shared biomechanics: relative hip abductor weakness and altered lower-limb mechanics predispose to both GTPS and ITBS, so co-existence is plausible and documented, which explains why some patients report a broader lateral thigh distribution despite distinct primary pain generators at the hip versus the knee [^111Dhx7q]. I should confirm that lateral hip pain syndromes often include IT band friction phenomena at the peritrochanteric level, reinforcing the anatomic continuum yet preserving the typical localization differences in most presentations [^113bw672].

> Hmm, wait a minute, at first glance I almost overgeneralized that ITBS can cause pain anywhere along the band; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. The classic, most common pain site for ITBS is the lateral knee at the lateral femoral epicondyle, whereas when the maximal pain is at the lateral hip with point tenderness over the greater trochanter and reproduction in side-lying, that pattern strongly favors GTPS even if pain radiates distally along the thigh, so my initial broad assumption needs to be narrowed back to these hallmark locations [^1146hGrC] [^116pY7t9].

> Putting this together, I should ensure the final clinical synthesis is clear: in GTPS, patients most commonly report lateral hip pain localized over the greater trochanter with frequent radiation down the lateral thigh toward the knee; in ITBS, patients most commonly report lateral knee pain at or just proximal to the lateral femoral epicondyle, though a subset will describe distal lateral thigh pain radiating to the knee, and both conditions can coexist due to shared biomechanics, which explains occasional overlap in distribution descriptions [^116pY7t9] [^113bw672] [^1146hGrC] [^111Dhx7q].

Patients with greater trochanteric bursitis (GTPS) typically report **lateral hip pain** [^113bw672] over the greater trochanter, often radiating down the lateral thigh [^116pY7t9] and aggravated by lying on the affected side, prolonged standing, walking, or stair climbing [^116XLWPL]. By contrast, iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) causes **lateral knee pain** [^1146hGrC] over the lateral femoral epicondyle, worsened by repetitive knee flexion–extension (e.g. running or cycling) [^117Pohtr], and may radiate proximally along the lateral thigh. Thus, GTPS pain centers on the lateral hip [^113bw672], whereas ITBS centers on the lateral knee [^1146hGrC].

## Anatomical overview

### Greater trochanteric bursitis (GTPS)

In GTPS, the **location** is inflammation of the bursae over the greater trochanter [^112VJfaV], causing lateral hip pain [^113bw672]. The **structures involved** include the gluteus medius/minimus tendons, iliotibial band, and bursae [^112BsxHK] [^114DVbgd].

---

### Iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS)

In ITBS, the **location** is inflammation of the distal IT band over the lateral femoral epicondyle, causing lateral knee pain [^1146hGrC]. The **structures involved** include the IT band, lateral femoral epicondyle, and the underlying bursa [^116VjxvJ] [^117Pohtr].

### Evaluation and management of iliotibial band syndrome [^1146hGrC]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

Iliotibial band syndrome is a common overuse injury typically seen in runners, cyclists, and military recruits. Affected patients report lateral knee pain associated with repetitive motion activities. The diagnosis is usually made based on a characteristic history and physical examination, with imaging studies reserved for cases of recalcitrant disease to rule out other pathologic entities.

Several etiologies have been proposed for iliotibial band syndrome, including friction of the iliotibial band against the lateral femoral epicondyle, compression of the fat and connective tissue deep to the iliotibial band, and chronic inflammation of the iliotibial band bursa. The mainstay of treatment is nonsurgical; however, in persistent or chronic cases, surgical management is indicated.

### Hip pain in adults: Evaluation and differential diagnosis [^113bw672]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Adults commonly present to their family physicians with hip pain, and diagnosing the cause is important for prescribing effective therapy. Hip pain is usually located anteriorly, laterally, or posteriorly.

- **Anterior hip pain**: Includes referred pain from intra-abdominal or intrapelvic causes; extra-articular etiologies such as hip flexor injuries; and intra-articular etiologies. Intra-articular pain is often caused by a labral tear or femoroacetabular impingement in younger adults or osteoarthritis in older adults.

- **Lateral hip pain**: Most commonly caused by greater trochanteric pain syndrome, which includes gluteus medius tendinopathy or tear, bursitis, and iliotibial band friction.

- **Posterior hip pain**: Includes referred pain such as lumbar spinal pathology, deep gluteal syndrome with sciatic nerve entrapment, ischiofemoral impingement, and hamstring tendinopathy.

In addition to the history and physical examination, radiography, ultrasonography, or magnetic resonance imaging may be needed for a definitive diagnosis. Radiography of the hip and pelvis should be the initial imaging test. Ultrasound-guided anesthetic injections can aid in the diagnosis of an intra-articular cause of pain. Because femoroacetabular impingement, labral tears, and gluteus medius tendon tears typically have good surgical outcomes, advanced imaging and/or early referral may improve patient outcomes.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. Part VIII: Lateral hip and thigh pain [^111Dhx7q]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) usually presents as distal lateral thigh pain, caused by friction from the iliotibial band (ITB), which rubs repeatedly over the lateral femoral epicondyle. The condition most commonly occurs in people who perform repetitive unidirectional activities such as running and cycling, have recently increased their training intensity, and who have relative hip abductor weakness. The gluteus medius muscle is the primary stabilizer of the ITB during foot-strike; therefore, weakness of the muscle can result in compensation and overuse of the tensor fascia latae. This, in turn, can lead to a shortened ITB and ITBS. Since similar suboptimal biomechanics predispose to both ITBS and greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), the two conditions can co-exist.

As a result of the location of the origin and insertion of the ITB, ITBS can also mimic lumbar radicular pain by presenting as lateral thigh pain radiating to the knee. Despite the increasing age of runners, it is important to note that ITBS more commonly occurs in younger runners, and the syndrome is not commonly described in older adults. Older runners tend to be more limited by calf, Achilles, and hamstring injuries rather than knee injuries.

Ultrasound examination is often useful to aid diagnosis when snapping is not elicitable in clinic, as it visualizes the TFL gliding over the GT. This method is operator-dependent for identifying the pathology. Several authors have reported that dynamic ultrasound is beneficial in making a definitive diagnosis by confirming an audible or palpable snap, or pain reported by the patient during the provocative maneuver of the hip. MRI scans can also be useful when a clinical confirmation of ESHS is difficult. Indicators suggestive of ESHS include thickening and hyperintensity of the proximal iliotibial tract, or hypertrophy of the gluteus maximus tendon insertion to the TFL on the T2 sequence. Additionally, a hyperintense greater trochanteric bursa or a fluid collection visualized on T2 may suggest ESHS.

In an MRI-based study evaluating 55 patients with ESHS, classifications were as follows: grade I in 25.5%, grade II in 40%, and grade III in 34.6%. They observed differences in ESHS pathology depending on the abnormality location, with the iliotibial band being tensed and the gluteus maximus hypertrophied. Overall, dynamic ultrasound conducted by an experienced operator, along with MRI scans, is effective in confirming the diagnosis and aiding the management plan for ESHS.

### Greater trochanteric pain syndrome: A review of anatomy, diagnosis and treatment [^116pY7t9]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2009). Low credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is a term used to describe chronic pain overlying the lateral aspect of the hip. This regional pain syndrome, once described as trochanteric bursitis, often mimics pain generated from other sources, including, but not limited to, myofascial pain, degenerative joint disease, and spinal pathology. The incidence of greater trochanteric pain is reported to be approximately 1.8 patients per 1000 per year, with the prevalence being higher in women, and patients with coexisting low back pain, osteoarthritis, iliotibial band tenderness, and obesity.

Symptoms of GTPS consist of persistent pain in the lateral hip radiating along the lateral aspect of the thigh to the knee and occasionally below the knee and/or buttock. Physical examination reveals point tenderness in the posterolateral area of the greater trochanter.

Most cases of GTPS are self-limited, with conservative measures such as physical therapy, weight loss, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and behavior modification providing resolution of symptoms. Other treatment modalities include bursa or lateral hip injections performed with corticosteroid and local anesthetic. More invasive surgical interventions have anecdotally been reported to provide pain relief when conservative treatment modalities fail.

### Greater trochanteric pain syndrome: Epidemiology and associated factors [^111tXpwN]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

To describe the prevalence of greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) and determine its association with iliotibial band (ITB) tenderness, knee osteoarthritis (OA), body mass index (BMI), or low back pain (LBP), and to assess whether GTPS is associated with reduced hip internal rotation, physical activity, and mobility.

- **Design**: Cross-sectional, population-based study.
- **Setting**: Multicenter observational study.
- **Participants**: Community-dwelling adults (N = 3026) ages 50 to 79 years.
- **Interventions**: Not applicable.
- **Main outcome measures**: Greater trochanteric tenderness to palpation in subjects with complaints of hip pain and no signs of hip OA or generalized myofascial tenderness.

The prevalence of unilateral and bilateral GTPS was 15.0% and 8.5% in women and 6.6% and 1.9% in men. Odds ratio (OR) for women was 3.37 (95% confidence interval, 2.67–4.25), but age and race were not significantly associated with GTPS. In a multivariate model, adjusting for age, sex, ITB tenderness, ipsilateral and contralateral knee OA, BMI, and LBP, ITB tenderness (OR = 1.72; 95% CI, 1.34–2.19), knee OA ipsilaterally (OR = 3.47; 95% CI, 2.72–4.42) and contralaterally (OR = 1.74; 95% CI, 1.32–2.28), and LBP (OR = 2.79; 95% CI, 2.22–3.50) were positively related to GTPS. In this complete model, BMI was not associated with GTPS (OR = 1.10; 95% CI, 0.80–1.52 when comparing ≥ 30 with < 25 kg/m²). Hip internal rotation range of motion did not differ based on GTPS status. After multivariate adjustment, GTPS did not alter physical activity score, but bilateral GTPS was significantly associated with reduced mobility.

### Pathogenesis and contemporary diagnoses for lateral hip pain: A scoping review [^116CBQeA]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

There are several pathologies that can affect the abductor muscle complex in the peritrochanteric space. These can be broadly classified into:

- **Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS)**: GTPS is thought to be a degenerative condition affecting the abductor tendons and the bursae around them. It has a female preponderance of 4:1, with the majority of patients between the fourth and sixth decades of life. A varus femoral neck and females with increased gynoid adipose tissue are at a higher risk of developing GTPS. Spontaneous onset of lateral hip pain with point tenderness over the greater trochanter is suggestive of GTPS. Clinical tests that assist in diagnosing GTPS include the inability to complete a single-leg stance for 30 seconds and inability to perform a resisted external derotation of the hip in the supine position with the hip flexed to 90° and in the prone position with the hip extended. The resisted external derotation test is conducted with the hip flexed to 90°, the hip being placed in full internal rotation, and then asking the patient to bring the leg to a neutral position against resistance. A positive test is indicated by pain or weakness. The sensitivity and specificity for the single-leg stance were 100% and 97.3%, while those for resisted external derotation of the hip in the supine position were 88% and 97.3%, respectively, as corroborated by the MRI study by Lequesne et al.

### Great trochanter bursitis vs sciatica, a diagnostic-anatomic trap: Differential diagnosis and brief review of the literature [^111LMBS5]. European Spine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to highlight the difficulty of differentiating great trochanter bursitis (GTB) from sciatica and to estimate the prevalence of GTB in patients initially diagnosed incorrectly with sciatica during their first visit to a general practitioner, before being referred to a spine infirmary.

The diagnosis of GTB was made based on history and physical examination and was confirmed by ultrasonography and/or response to an anesthetic plus corticosteroid injection to the trochanteric bursa. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the study group were evaluated, and statistical analysis was conducted using the SPSS PC package (version 24.0).

In a total of 657 referrals for sciatica, 72 patients (10.95%) were incorrectly diagnosed as suffering from sciatica, whereas, in fact, they were suffering from GTB. Additionally, 18 patients (2.74%) were diagnosed as having persistent sciatica with coexisting GTB. More women than men had GTB, with a gender distribution of 79 women to 11 men. The mean age for patients diagnosed with sciatica but suffering from GTB was 60 years, while the mean age for patients with both sciatica and GTB was 61 years.

GTB is a common clinical entity in middle-aged women, which can be overlooked by physicians if there is an incomplete medical history and clinical examination. This oversight can lead to unnecessary imaging tests and treatments, burdening both the patient and the healthcare system. Early diagnosis of GTB may dramatically reduce costs, prevent unwanted imaging exams and treatments, and alleviate symptoms immediately for the patient.

### Cooled radiofrequency ablation of the trochanteric branch of the nervus femoralis to treat greater trochanteric pain syndrome [^1115pPPf]. Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome is a common cause of lateral hip pain. Corticosteroid injections are commonly utilized as nonsurgical interventions; however, they are not effective for all patients. This technical case report describes a method for treating greater trochanteric pain syndrome by utilizing cooled radiofrequency ablation.

- **Methods**: The trochanteric branch of the nervus femoralis is identified as providing sensory innervation to the greater trochanter and its surrounding structures. We have identified fluoroscopic targets to block the nerve and perform cooled radiofrequency ablation. We present two patient cases which demonstrated significant pain relief of greater trochanteric pain syndrome with this treatment.

- **Conclusions**: Cooled radiofrequency ablation of the trochanteric branch of the nervus femoralis is a potential treatment for greater trochanteric pain syndrome. This procedure provides a potential steroid-sparing interventional treatment based on reproducible fluoroscopic landmarks.

### Comparison of fluoroscopically guided and blind corticosteroid injections for greater trochanteric pain syndrome: Multicentre randomised controlled trial [^113g11u7]. BMJ (2009). High credibility.

Rapid advancements in elucidating the mechanisms of disease, preventive and diagnostic capabilities, and therapeutic interventions have not necessarily been reflected in better treatment outcomes. Nowhere is this incongruity more evident than in the management of pain. Although the field of pain management has seen a dramatic surge in recognition, research interest, resource allocation, and treatment options, the rates of pain-related disability continue to soar. This disparity has led some experts to question the relations between scientific advancements, expenditures, and the quality of health care.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome, also known as trochanteric bursitis, is a common medical condition with a lifetime prevalence exceeding 20%; it occurs more frequently in women, older people, and people with low back pain. Corticosteroid injections can provide considerable relief in most patients who fail to respond to conservative treatment. One epidemiological study in a primary care setting found that patients who received a corticosteroid injection had a 2.7-fold greater chance of long-term recovery compared with patients who had not had an injection.

Despite the prevalence of greater trochanteric pain syndrome, only a few studies evaluating the efficacy of corticosteroid injections have been published, none of which was controlled or used fluoroscopy or other imaging techniques (such as ultrasonography). The average success rate in these studies ranged between 50% and 70%, with follow-up ranging between two weeks and two years.

### Comparison of fluoroscopically guided and blind corticosteroid injections for greater trochanteric pain syndrome: multicentre randomised controlled trial [^1138dTJW]. BMJ (2009). High credibility.

Scores for each of the SF-36 scales, stratified by injection method, show that the only statistically significant difference was in the mental health scale at the one-month follow-up. Patients who received a blind injection reported slightly better scores. Other differences tended to favor the blind injection group, with the exception of emotional roles at baseline, physical roles and bodily pain at one month, and physical functioning at three months.

- **SF-36 scale scores by injection method**: Values are mean (SD, range) unless stated otherwise. SF-36 normative data for the US general population in 1998 is available.

When outcomes were examined by success at three months, the clinical and demographic characteristics of the study participants were found to be similar. Despite the lack of statistical significance, unsuccessful treatment at three months was more common among men, obese individuals, patients with shorter duration of pain, and those with greater disability on the Oswestry Disability Index.

- **Clinical and demographic characteristics stratified by success at three months (n = 64)**: Values are numbers (percentages) unless stated otherwise.

Outcomes were also examined by injection method, number of injections, and whether the injection was intra-bursal or extra-bursal. For the primary outcome measure, the numerical rating scale score at one month, the mean hip pain score at rest declined from 5.1 to 2.7 (P = 0.0001) in the fluoroscopically guided injection group and from 4.6 to 2.2 (P = 0.0001) in the blind injection group.

### Greater trochanteric pain syndrome: Defining the clinical syndrome [^116xceRo]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Effective treatment of hip pain improves population health and quality of life. Accurate differential diagnosis is fundamental to effective treatment. The diagnostic criteria for one common hip problem, greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), have not been well defined.

- **Purpose**: To define the clinical presentation of GTPS.

- **Methods**: Forty-one people with GTPS, 20 with hip osteoarthritis (OA), and 23 age-matched and sex-matched asymptomatic participants (ASC) were recruited. Inclusion and exclusion criteria ensured mutually exclusive groups.

- **Assessment**: The Harris hip score (HHS), a battery of clinical tests, and single leg stance (SLS) were used. Participants identified the site of reproduced pain.

- **Analysis**: Fisher's exact test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) informed recursive partitioning to develop two classification trees.

- **Results**: Maximum walking distance and the ability to manipulate shoes and socks were the only HHS domains to differentiate GTPS from OA (ANOVA: p = 0.010 and < 0.001); odds ratios (95% CI) of 3.47 (1.09 to 10.93) and 0.06 (0.00 to 0.26), respectively. The lateral hip pain (LHP) classification tree (dichotomous LHP associated with a flexion abduction external rotation (FABER) test) had a mean (SE) sensitivity and specificity of 0.81 (0.019) and 0.82 (0.044), respectively. A non-specific hip pain classification tree had a mean (SE) sensitivity and specificity of 0.78 (0.058) and 0.28 (0.080).

- **Conclusions**: Patients with LHP in the absence of difficulty with manipulating shoes and socks, together with pain on palpation of the greater trochanter and LHP with a.

### Dry needling versus cortisone injection in the treatment of greater trochanteric pain syndrome: A noninferiority randomized clinical trial [^113y5qwj]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

The study design was prospective, randomized, and partially blinded. Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is the terminology for what was once called greater trochanteric or subgluteal bursitis. Cortisone (corticosteroid) injection into the lateral hip has traditionally been the accepted treatment for this condition. However, the effectiveness of injecting the bursa with steroids is increasingly being questioned. An equally effective treatment with fewer adverse side effects would be beneficial.

The objective of the study was to investigate whether administration of dry needling (DN) is noninferior to cortisone injection in reducing lateral hip pain and improving function in patients with GTPS. Forty-three participants (50 hips observed), all with GTPS, were randomly assigned to a group receiving cortisone injection or DN. Treatments were administered over six weeks, and clinical outcomes were collected at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 weeks.

- **Primary outcome measures**: The numeric pain-rating scale (0–10).
- **Secondary outcome measures**: The Patient-Specific Functional Scale (0–10).
- **Tertiary outcome measures**: Medication intake for pain.

Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. A noninferiority test for a repeated-measures design for pain and averaged function scores at six weeks (with a noninferiority margin of 1.5 for both outcomes) indicated noninferiority of DN compared to cortisone injection (both, P < .01). Medication usage (P = 0.74) was not different between groups at the same time point. No adverse side effects were reported.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^117Pohtr]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Although the diagnosis is clinical and imaging is rarely required, plain radiographs may be useful to evaluate for other conditions such as hip osteoarthritis. Ultrasound can be used to identify inflammation of the bursae around the greater trochanter if the diagnosis is in doubt, and MRI can be used to confirm the diagnosis or to aid with surgical planning in cases refractory to non-surgical management. While physiotherapy is a mainstay of treatment and should focus on individualized rehabilitation of the contributing factors, such as hip abductor weakness, a peri-trochanteric corticosteroid injection can be highly efficacious for treating pain from greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), suggesting that a lack of response should lead the clinician to strongly consider alternative diagnoses.

- **Iliotibial band syndrome**: Iliotibial (IT) band syndrome is characterized by lateral knee pain in individuals who engage in physically strenuous activity, such as running or cycling. A leading pathoanatomic explanation is that the IT band rubs over the lateral femoral condyle during repetitive knee flexion and extension. The IT band is a complex fibrous structure that arises out of the fascia of the tensor fascia lata muscle at the lateral hip, extends down the lateral thigh, and inserts at Gerdy's tubercle on the lateral tibia. Together with the tensor fascia lata muscle, the IT band's primary function is to stabilize the hip and knee in stance phase and assist in hip extension, abduction, and external rotation; at the knee, the IT band also provides lateral stability and resists torsional movements.

### Management of greater trochanteric pain syndrome after total hip arthroplasty: Practice patterns and surgeon attitudes [^115wpFdJ]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), or trochanteric bursitis, is described as pain on the lateral side of the hip that does not involve the hip joint and can be elicited clinically by palpation over the greater trochanter. At the time of writing, there remains no consensus on clinical guidelines for either the diagnosis or management of GTPS.

- **Methods**: To understand the practice patterns, beliefs, and attitudes relating to the management of GTPS after total hip arthroplasty, a survey was developed and completed by Canadian arthroplasty surgeons. The final survey consisted of 23 questions divided into three sections: 1) screening questions; 2) demographic information; and 3) practice patterns, attitudes, and beliefs.

- **Results**: Most surgeons use physical examination alone for diagnosis. A detailed analysis indicates that surgeons primarily treat GTPS with oral anti-inflammatories (57.1%), structured physiotherapy (52.4%), and steroid injections (45.2%). Management options are typically nonsurgical and comprise a combination of either unstructured or targeted physiotherapy, corticosteroid injections, or platelet-rich plasma.

- **Discussion**: There remains an absence of clinical consensus for the diagnosis and management of GTPS after total hip arthroplasty. Physical examination is most often relied on, regardless of the availability of imaging aids. While common treatments of GTPS were identified, up to one-third of patients fail initial therapy.

### Hip pain in adults: Evaluation and differential diagnosis [^114zZkPK]. American Family Physician (2021). High credibility.

Among other possible causes, hip pain can result from various conditions, including gluteal tendinitis, hip osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and atypical femoral fracture. Additional causes are trochanteric bursitis, lumbar radiculopathy, septic arthritis of the hip, hip osteomyelitis, and hip fracture. Furthermore, osteochondritis dissecans, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, acetabular dysplasia, and slipped upper femoral epiphysis are potential contributors. Other conditions like Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease, rheumatoid arthritis, osteonecrosis, and hip osteonecrosis may also be involved.

Additional possible causes include axial spondyloarthritis, hip labral tear, iliopsoas bursitis, avascular necrosis of the femoral head, and sacroiliac joint dysfunction. The list extends to piriformis syndrome, snapping hip syndrome, Paget's disease, femoroacetabular impingement syndrome, gout, synovial chondromatosis, hip dislocation, chondrosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and bone metastasis.

### Treatment of recalcitrant iliotibial band friction syndrome with open iliotibial band bursectomy: Indications, technique, and clinical outcomes [^116VjxvJ]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Iliotibial band friction syndrome (ITBFS) is an overuse injury causing lateral knee pain. There is evidence that the pathological lesion is, in fact, an inflamed bursa underlying the iliotibial band (ITB) rather than an inflamed ITB itself. The hypothesis is that resection of the bursa underlying the ITB in ITBFS patients will relieve their pain and allow them to return to their preinjury activity level.

This study design is a case series with a level of evidence of 4. The methods describe the technique of ITB bursectomy, reporting a minimum 20-month follow-up for patients who had ITB bursectomies performed by a single surgeon. The patients completed a survey detailing their preoperative and postoperative symptoms and activities.

In the results, the senior author performed 12 consecutive ITB bursectomies on 12 patients. One was excluded from the study due to a previous microfracture. The average age at surgery was 32 years (standard deviation, 5; range, 24–41). There were 7 men and 4 women. Postoperatively, patients were able to return to their preinjury Tegner activity levels, and the visual analog pain scores decreased by an average of 6 points (P < .001). Six patients were completely satisfied with the surgical outcome, 3 were mostly satisfied, 2 were somewhat satisfied, and none were dissatisfied. Nine of 11 patients indicated they would have the surgery performed again for the same problem.

In conclusion, iliotibial band bursectomy successfully reduces knee pain in patients with ITBFS and allows them to return to their preinjury level of activity.

### Does ultrasound correlate with surgical or histologic findings in greater trochanteric pain syndrome? A pilot study [^115LULfH]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2010). Low credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome can be severely debilitating. Ideal imaging modalities are not established, treatments are not reliably evaluated, and the underlying pathology is not well understood.

- **Questions/purposes**: Using surgical and histopathology findings as a gold standard, we therefore determined the positive predictive value of preoperative ultrasound assessment for greater trochanteric pain syndrome recalcitrant to nonoperative management. In addition, we report the outcomes of gluteal tendon reconstructive surgery using validated clinical and functional outcome tools and evaluate the contribution of the tendon and bursa to greater trochanteric pain syndrome.

- **Patients and methods**: We reviewed 24 patients who had combined gluteal tendon reconstruction and bursectomy. Preoperative ultrasound imaging was compared with surgical findings. In the absence of a greater trochanteric pain syndrome–specific outcome tool, surgical outcomes for pain and function were assessed via a 100-mm visual analog scale, the modified Harris hip score, and the Oswestry Disability Index. Strength was also measured. The tendon and bursa tissue collected at surgery was histopathologically reviewed.

- **Results**: In our small study, ultrasound had a high positive predictive value for gluteal tendon tears (positive predictive value = 1.0). Patients reported high levels of pain relief and function after surgery; tendon and bursa showed pathologic changes.

- **Conclusions**: Ultrasound appears to be clinically useful in greater trochanteric pain syndrome; reconstructive surgery seems to provide significant relief and improved function.

### Snapping popliteus tendon in a 21-year-old female [^111WYvSN]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Determining the cause of painful snapping on the lateral aspect of the knee can be a challenge. The differential diagnosis includes iliotibial band friction syndrome, lateral meniscus tear, intra-articular loose body, discoid lateral meniscus, snapping biceps femoris tendon, degenerative joint disease, proximal tibiofibular joint instability, and snapping popliteus tendon.

A 21-year-old female presented with a 7-year history of painful snapping on the lateral aspect of her left knee. She reported that the snapping occurred with all activities involving knee flexion and extension, including running and walking. With a diagnosis of snapping iliotibial band, she had received a variety of physical therapy interventions, including various lower extremity stretching and strengthening exercises. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications were also prescribed by her physician. Conservative and pharmacological interventions were unsuccessful in improving her symptoms. Similarly, our attempt with conservative treatment consisting of ice, taping, and a short period of immobilization was not successful.

The patient underwent a surgical procedure consisting of the removal of a prominent tubercle on the lateral femoral condyle and tenodesis of the popliteus tendon to the proximal aspect of the fibular (lateral) collateral ligament, followed by a postoperative program of physical therapy including range-of-motion and progressive strengthening exercises. At 6 weeks following surgery, the patient had returned to all activities.

### Beyond the greater trochanter: A pictorial review of the pelvic bursae [^112VJfaV]. Clinical Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to review the MRI appearance of different bursae located throughout the pelvis, including the pertinent osseous and musculotendinous anatomy.

- **Materials and methods**: Bursae are potential spaces that reduce friction between opposed moving components, which can become inflamed, clinically mimicking internal derangement.

- **Results**: This series illustrates the most common, as well as lesser-known, pelvic bursae. Common causes of bursitis, including overuse, trauma, and infection, are presented.

- **Conclusion**: Multiple bursae are located throughout the pelvis. It is important for radiologists to recognize bursitis as a potential etiology of pain and be familiar with their anatomical locations in order to guide appropriate management.

### Management of greater trochanteric pain syndrome after total hip arthroplasty: Practice patterns and surgeon attitudes [^113XoH6d]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

The complexity in both treatment and diagnosis of GTPS reflects the multiplicity of attitudes and perceptions toward this condition. In a recent systematic review of GTPS after THA, more than 10 different diagnostic criteria for trochanteric pain have been reported, but only a single tool has reported its sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis. The lack of consensus in the treatment approach is evident through the multiple treatments used, including PRP, steroids, a variety of physiotherapy protocols, peripheral nerve stimulation, and local anesthetic injections. Five studies reported on the utility of corticosteroid injections either alone (one study) or in combination with home physiotherapy treatment protocols. Four studies reported on the treatment of trochanteric bursitis resistant to nonsurgical management using either gluteal bursectomy or iliotibial band lengthening. No studies reported on outcomes with a follow-up of longer than one year, limiting the reliability of outcome assessments.

In our study, the surgical approach was not associated with a notable difference in the surgeon-perceived rates of post-THA GTPS. While it is important to consider that this is based on surgeon estimates and not real data, it is still interesting to compare these estimates across approaches. Although a lack of notable difference among the various approaches is consistent with previous clinical literature, lower rates of GTPS are sometimes touted as a potential benefit of certain approaches. Among the myriad of potential causes of GTPS, gluteus medius/minimus tears (i.e. "bald trochant…

### Greater trochanteric pain syndrome [^1176CjXJ]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2016). Low credibility.

Patients experiencing lateral hip pain have traditionally been diagnosed with trochanteric bursitis and treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, corticosteroid injections, and physical therapy. While this approach is effective for most, a significant number of patients continue to suffer from pain and functional limitations.

Over the past decade, there has been a dramatic increase in our understanding of disorders occurring in the peritrochanteric space. Greater trochanteric pain syndrome encompasses trochanteric bursitis, external coxa saltans (snapping hip), and abductor tendinopathy. A comprehensive understanding of the anatomy, examination findings, and imaging characteristics is essential for clinicians treating these patients. When nonsurgical treatment is unsuccessful, both open and endoscopic treatment options are available.

### Differential diagnosis of pain around the hip joint [^117HR4ca]. Arthroscopy (2008). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of hip pain is broad and includes intra-articular pathology, extra-articular pathology, and mimickers, including the joints of the pelvic ring. With advancements in hip arthroscopy, more patients are being evaluated for hip pain. In recent years, our understanding of the functional anatomy around the hip has improved. In addition, advancements in magnetic resonance imaging have enhanced the diagnosis of soft tissue causes of hip pain. All of these advances have broadened the differential diagnosis of pain around the hip joint and improved the treatment of these problems.

In this review, we discuss the causes of intra-articular hip pain that can be addressed arthroscopically: labral tears, loose bodies, femoroacetabular impingement, capsular laxity, tears of the ligamentum teres, and chondral damage. Extra-articular diagnoses that can be managed arthroscopically are also discussed, including iliopsoas tendonitis, "internal" snapping hip, "external" snapping hip, iliotibial band, greater trochanteric bursitis, and gluteal tendon injury.

Finally, we discuss extra-articular causes of hip pain that are often managed nonoperatively or in an open fashion: femoral neck stress fracture, adductor strain, piriformis syndrome, sacroiliac joint pain, athletic pubalgia, "sports hernia", "Gilmore's groin", and osteitis pubis.

### Arthroscopic anatomy and surgical techniques for peritrochanteric space disorders in the hip [^11554DR2]. Arthroscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Disorders of the lateral or peritrochanteric space, often grouped into the greater trochanteric pain syndrome, such as recalcitrant trochanteric bursitis, external snapping iliotibial band, and gluteus medius and minimus tears, are now being treated endoscopically. We outline the endoscopic anatomy of the peritrochanteric space of the hip and describe surgical techniques for the treatment of these entities.

Proper portal placement is key to understanding the peritrochanteric space and should be first oriented at the gluteus maximus insertion into the linea aspera, as well as the vastus lateralis. When tears of the gluteus medius and minimus are encountered, suture anchors can be placed into the footprint of the abductor tendons in a standard arthroscopic fashion. Our initial experience indicates that recalcitrant trochanteric bursitis, external coxa saltans, and focal, isolated tears of the gluteus medius and minimus tendon may be successfully treated with arthroscopic bursectomy, iliotibial band release, decompression of the peritrochanteric space, and suture anchor tendon repair to the greater trochanter, respectively.

### Greater trochanteric pain syndrome negatively affects work, physical activity and quality of life: a case control study [^113CoYNK]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2014). Low credibility.

Musculoskeletal injury causes pain and, when chronic, can affect mental health, employment, and quality of life. This study examined work participation, function, and quality of life in people with greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS, n = 42), severe hip osteoarthritis (OA, n = 20), and an asymptomatic group (ASC, n = 23). No differences were found between the symptomatic groups on key measures; both were more affected than the ASC group. They had lower quality of life scores (p < 0.001), Harris Hip Scores (p < 0.001), and higher Oswestry Disability Index scores (p < 0.001). Participants with GTPS were the least likely to be in full-time work (prob. GTPS = 0.29; OA = 0.52; and ASC = 0.68). GTPS appears to confer levels of disability and quality of life similar to levels associated with end-stage hip OA.

### Arthroscopic management of greater trochanter pain syndrome and abductor tears has demonstrated promising results in terms of improvement in pain scores and functional outcomes: a scoping review [^116E3CPH]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) refers to the constellation of signs and symptoms related to pain in the trochanteric region and has recently replaced the previously ubiquitous term of 'greater trochanteric bursitis'. GTPS is common, particularly in women aged 50–79 years. The understanding and management of GTPS have expanded considerably in recent years to include management with arthroscopic and endoscopic techniques in recalcitrant cases. This scoping literature review aims to summarize the evidence on arthroscopic management of GTPS, including sources of evidence, key concepts, and gaps in the literature.

A thorough electronic database search was conducted, including studies published from 2009 to June 14, 2020. A total of 52 peer-reviewed articles were identified within the literature on arthroscopic or endoscopic management of GTPS.

- **Results**: Of the 52 identified papers, 12 were technique descriptions, 10 were review articles, and 30 were original clinical papers. Of the 30 clinical papers, 24 (80%) were of level IV evidence, 5 (17%) were of level III evidence, and 1 (3%) was level II evidence. The studies included 988 patients, with 761 (77%) being female. Indications for surgical management included a failed trial of conservative management in all 30 studies, typically following a period of 3–6 months. Surgical management consisted of arthroscopic/endoscopic abductor tendon repair in 16 (53%) studies, arthroscopic/endoscopic bursectomy, and iliotibial band release in 12 (40%) studies.

### Management of greater trochanteric pain syndrome after total hip arthroplasty: Practice patterns and surgeon attitudes [^112xiEwE]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Global Research & Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

THA surgeons in Canada often use physical examination alone to diagnose GTPS after THA. Surgeons treat with oral anti-inflammatories, physiotherapy, or corticosteroid injections, with up to one-third of patients failing initial therapy. Although few surgeons use PRP, there is substantial interest in its potential efficacy for treating GTPS. Additional research is needed to evaluate the use of PRP, along with standardized physiotherapy and steroid injection protocols in the management of GTPS, a common and often debilitating condition.

This report presents an unusual case of atypical iliopsoas bursitis in an 81-year-old female patient who sought medical advice for chronic left hip and lower abdominal pain, which had no specific characteristics. A physical examination revealed a palpable, left-sided pelvic mass. An ultrasound examination showed a purely cystic mass, initially presumed to be an ovarian cystic malignancy. The patient was subsequently referred for an MRI examination, which revealed a cystic lesion extending from the left iliac crest to the anterior aspect of the ipsilateral hip joint. This lesion, with a maximum diameter of 18 cm, was coursing below the iliopsoas tendon, indicating an extremely distended iliopsoas bursa.

### Pertrochanteric calcifications in patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome: Description, prevalence, and correlation with intraoperatively diagnosed hip abductor tendon injuries [^112eErwb]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Pertrochanteric calcifications can be found in patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS). A systematic description of the types and prevalence of these calcifications has not been undertaken. Furthermore, there is conflicting evidence regarding their association with abductor tendon injuries.

- **Purpose**: (1) To describe the various types and prevalence of pertrochanteric calcifications in patients presenting for the surgical management of recalcitrant GTPS. (2) To evaluate the association of the various calcifications with intraoperatively diagnosed hip abductor tendon injuries, including tendinosis, partial-thickness tears, and full-thickness tears.

- **Study design**: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.

- **Methods**: Patients undergoing surgical management for GTPS, in isolation or as an ancillary procedure during hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement, between April 2008 and February 2020 were included. Of these, 85 procedures were isolated treatment of GTPS and the remaining 628 were ancillary to hip arthroscopy. Radiographs were scrutinized for the presence of pertrochanteric calcifications. The hip abductor tendon status was intraoperatively classified as intact, partial-thickness tear, or full-thickness tear. The prevalence and correlation of the various radiographic findings in relation to the intraoperatively classified tendon condition were analyzed via the odds ratio (OR).

- **Results**: Surgery was performed on 713 hips with recalcitrant GTPS. No tear was found in 340 hips (47.7%), 289 hips (40.5%) had a partial-thickness tear, and 8…

### Deep gluteal pain in orthopaedics: A challenging diagnosis [^115yEaX5]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2021). Low credibility.

Identifying the specific source of gluteal pain can elude the most seasoned orthopaedic diagnosticians. Patients will often present with a protracted course of symptoms, and failure to successfully identify and treat the underlying etiology leads to frustration for both patient and clinician. Pain deep in the buttocks can arise from compression, inflammation, or injury of one or more of the structures in this anatomically dense area. Although sacroiliitis, hip arthritis, and trochanteric bursitis may also masquerade as gluteal pain, sciatic nerve irritation in its various presentations causes a substantial percentage of cases. Deep gluteal syndrome, hamstring syndrome, and ischiofemoral impingement can have overlapping presentations but can be differentiated by clinical examination and judiciously placed diagnostic corticosteroid injections. Although nonsurgical management, including physical therapy, relative rest, and injections represent the mainstay of treatment, open and endoscopic surgical approaches have yielded encouraging success rates in refractory cases.

### Arthroscopic bursectomy with concomitant iliotibial band release for the treatment of recalcitrant trochanteric bursitis [^115A99B4]. Arthroscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Trochanteric bursitis with lateral hip pain is a commonly encountered orthopedic condition. Although most patients respond to corticosteroid injections, rest, physical therapy (PT), stretching, and anti-inflammatory medications, those with recalcitrant symptoms may require operative intervention. Studies have explored the use of the arthroscope in the treatment of these patients; however, these reports have not addressed the underlying pathology in this chronic condition. We believe that the iliotibial band must be addressed as it is the main cause of pain, inflammation, and trochanteric impingement, leading to the development of bursitis.

We report a new technique for arthroscopic trochanteric bursectomy with iliotibial band release.

- **Technique overview**: Our technique involves two incisions — one 4 cm proximal to the greater trochanter along the anterior border of the iliotibial band, and the other 4 cm distal and along the posterior border. The 30-degree arthroscope is introduced through the inferior portal, and a cannula is introduced through the superior portal. A 5.5-mm arthroscopic shaver is inserted through the superior cannula to clear off the surface of the iliotibial band, so that it may be adequately visualized. A hooked electrocautery probe is then used to longitudinally incise the iliotibial band until it no longer rubs, causing impingement over the greater trochanter.

### Gluteal tendinopathy: Integrating pathomechanics and clinical features in its management [^117JMBH1]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Gluteal tendinopathy is now believed to be the primary local source of lateral hip pain, or greater trochanteric pain syndrome, previously referred to as trochanteric bursitis. This condition is prevalent, particularly among postmenopausal women, and has a considerable negative influence on quality of life. Improved prognosis and outcomes in the future for those with gluteal tendinopathy will be underpinned by advances in diagnostic testing, a clearer understanding of risk factors and comorbidities, and evidence-based management programs. High-quality studies that meet these requirements are still lacking. This clinical commentary provides direction to assist the clinician with assessment and management of the patient with gluteal tendinopathy, based on currently limited available evidence on this condition and the wider tendon literature and on the combined clinical experience of the authors.

The summary of the methodologic qualities of the studies included reveals the following: Supplementary Table 2, available on the Arthritis Care & Research website, shows the results of the methodologic quality assessment of the included studies. The mean (range) scores were 48% for cohort studies, 41% for cross-sectional studies, and 50% for case-control studies. A total of 31 studies were considered high quality, while 25 were rated as low quality. Notably, six studies did not explain the statistical test used, and nine studies did not define pathology.

The GRADE quality of evidence for the relationship between all imaging features and symptom outcomes was rated very low due to study limitations such as risk of bias, observational study design, quality, inconsistency, and indirectness.

### The effectiveness of extracorporeal shockwave therapy in common lower limb conditions: A systematic review including quantification of patient-rated pain reduction [^113BsuFG]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

To evaluate extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) in treating Achilles tendinopathy (AT), greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS), patellar tendinopathy (PT), and proximal hamstring tendinopathy (PHT), a systematic review was conducted.

- **Eligibility criteria**: Randomized and non-randomized studies assessing ESWT in patients with AT, GTPS, MTSS, PT, and PHT were included. Risk of bias and quality of studies were evaluated.

- **Results**:
	- **Moderate-level evidence suggests**:
		1. No difference between focused ESWT and placebo ESWT at short and mid-term in PT.
		2. Radial ESWT is superior to conservative treatment at short, mid and long term in PHT.
	- **Low-level evidence suggests**:
		1. ESWT is comparable to eccentric training, but superior to a wait-and-see policy at 4 months in mid-portion AT.
		2. ESWT is superior to eccentric training at 4 months in insertional AT.
		3. Less effective than corticosteroid injection at short term, but ESWT produced superior results at mid and long term in GTPS.
		4. Produced comparable results to control treatment at long term in GTPS.
		5. Is superior to control conservative treatment at long term in PT.

Regarding the rest of the results, there was only very low or no level of evidence. Thirteen studies showed high risk of bias largely due to methodology, blinding, and reporting.

The conclusion shows low level of evidence suggesting that ESWT may be effective for some lower limb conditions in all phases of rehabilitation.

### Non-surgical treatment as the first step to manage peritrochanteric space disorders [^116zi645]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

Greater trochanter pain syndrome (GTPS) or lateral hip pain terms include external snapping hip, trochanteric bursitis, and gluteus medius or minimus pathology. The aim of this review is to update the most recent knowledge about non-surgical management of peritrochanteric disorders.

- **Methods**: A literature review was performed including the most relevant articles in recent years that focused on non-surgical treatment of peritrochanteric disorders.

- **Results**: Conservative treatment still has a place and includes activity modification, NSAIDs, analgesics, physiotherapy, home training, local corticosteroid injection (CSI), and shock wave therapy (SWT). These non-surgical alternatives have demonstrated good clinical results with a low rate of complications.

- **Conclusion**: Most patients tend to resolve GTPS or lateral hip pain with non-surgical management in the mid-term. However, when non-surgical options fail, surgical alternatives should be evaluated. The next frontier that will be a game-changer is to determine an individualized treatment plan based on the exact pathology.

### Editorial commentary: Treatment of concomitant intra-articular pathology in patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome is indicated by provocative impingement or instability physical examination and ultrasound-guided analgesic injection testing [^116gfRWM]. Arthroscopy (2023). Low credibility.

Endoscopic surgery can be used to address peritrochanteric pathology in patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome. During management of these patients, surgeons must decide whether adjunctive hip arthroscopy to treat concomitant intra-articular pathology (such as labral tears or chondral lesions) is required because the prevalence of intra-articular findings may be greater than the clinical significance. A thorough history and physical examination can help distinguish whether the symptoms are arising from a peritrochanteric issue (e.g. gluteal tendinopathy, trochanteric bursitis, external coxa saltans) versus an intra-articular pain generator. Increased symptoms with provocative impingement or instability testing indicate adjunctive hip arthroscopy to address intra-articular abnormalities. In addition, an ultrasound-guided analgesic injection into the hip joint or peritrochanteric region may aid in diagnosis. A patient with partial symptomatic relief from separate injections into both areas is a classic presentation and consistent with a mixed picture of peritrochanteric and intra-articular pathology, which may be addressed with a combined endoscopic and arthroscopic approach.

### An arthroscopic technique to treat the iliotibial band syndrome [^113DN21L]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2009). Low credibility.

Iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) is an overuse injury mainly affecting runners. The initial treatment is conservative, but only in recalcitrant cases is surgery indicated. Several open techniques have been described. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the results of a standardized arthroscopic technique for the treatment of resistant ITBS.

Thirty-six athletes with resistant ITBS were treated with a standardized arthroscopic technique limited to the resection of the lateral synovial recess. Thirty-three patients were available for follow-up (mean 2 years and 4 months). Thirty-two patients (34 knees) had good or excellent results. All patients returned to sports after 3 months. In two patients, a meniscal lesion was found, which required treatment. One patient with only a fair result had associated cartilage lesions of the femoral condyle.

Our results show that arthroscopic treatment of resistant ITBS is a valid option with a consistently good outcome. Additionally, this arthroscopic approach allows for the exclusion or treatment of other intra-articular pathologies.

### Hip gluteus medius and minimus endoscopic treatment results in patient satisfaction [^112BsxHK]. Arthroscopy (2020). High credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome encompasses a spectrum of hip pathologies, including trochanteric bursitis, gluteus medius or minimus tendinosis, partial abductor tear, full-thickness tear, and full-thickness tear plus retraction, with or without fatty atrophy. Physical diagnosis involves palpation for tenderness at the greater trochanter and evaluation for strength loss, including observation of gait. Women are significantly more likely to experience a tear of the hip abductors than men. Endoscopic treatment results in patient satisfaction, improved strength and gait, and few complications. However, fatty degeneration of the abductor muscles or associated scoliosis negatively affects the outcome of gluteus medius repair.

### Demystifying the clinical diagnosis of greater trochanteric pain syndrome in women [^113Wj3BB]. Journal of Women's Health (2017). Low credibility.

To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 10 clinical tests that can be used in the diagnosis of greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) in women, and to compare these clinical tests to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, a study was conducted involving twenty-eight participants with GTPS (49.5 ± 22.0 years) and 18 asymptomatic participants (mean age ± standard deviation [SD], 52.5 ± 22.8 years).

A blinded physiotherapist performed 10 pain provocation tests potentially diagnostic for GTPS: palpation of the greater trochanter, resisted external derotation test, modified resisted external derotation test, standard and modified Ober's tests, Patrick's or FABER test, resisted hip abduction, single-leg stance test, and the resisted hip internal rotation test. A sample of 16 symptomatic and 17 asymptomatic women underwent a hip MRI scan. Gluteal tendons were evaluated and categorized as no pathology, mild tendinosis, moderate tendinosis/partial tear, or full-thickness tear.

Clinical test analyses showed high specificity, high positive predictive value, and low to moderate sensitivity and negative predictive value for most clinical tests. All symptomatic and 88% of asymptomatic participants had pathological gluteal tendon changes on MRI, ranging from mild tendinosis to full-thickness tear.

The study found the Patrick's or FABER test, palpation of the greater trochanter, resisted hip abduction, and the resisted external derotation test to have the highest diagnostic test accuracy for GTPS. Tendon pathology on MRI was seen in both symptomatic and asymptomatic participants.

### Iliotibial-band and gluteus medius percutaneous ultrasound tenotomy for refractory trochanteric pain syndrome: A longitudinal observational study with one-year durability results [^112tkwMb]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is a common cause of lateral hip pain that affects patients' quality of life and functioning. The condition is often associated with tightness of the iliotibial band (ITB) and tendinopathy of the gluteus medius (GMed) tendon, which are subjected to excessive stress and inflammation. A traditional treatment for GTPS is conservative medical management (CMM), which includes but is not limited to physiotherapy, oral anti-inflammatory medication, and/or local steroid injections. Surgery is performed when these treatments fail, indicating that some treatments classified as CMM may not be feasible for some patients.

- **Objectives**: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined GMed and ITB injections for a cohort of CMM-refractory GTPS patients.

- **Study design**: A retrospective chart review.

- **Setting**: Single-center, academic hospital.

- **Methods**: Between January 1, 2022, and December 31, 2022, a retrospective analysis of 68 hips that underwent combination GMed-ITB percutaneous ultrasound tenotomy (PUT) was performed. The primary outcome measure was a numeric rating scale (NRS) for hip pain, and the secondary outcome measures were VISA-G (Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Gluteal Tendinopathy) scores, sitting-to-standing and walking tolerance, and side-lying tolerance.

- **Results**: The patients' NRS scores decreased, and the VISA-G scores and all functional measures increased one year after the procedure, indicating significant improvement in pain and functioning (P < 0.001).

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. Part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^1166oqRx]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Because GTPS is a clinical syndrome, the diagnosis can be confirmed with physical examination. Table 3 describes an efficient method to perform several exam maneuvers to assess for GTPS and other common lumbopelvic and hip conditions.

To localize the GT, palpate the proximal lateral thigh of the limb being tested while the patient is standing on both feet and pivoting the leg being tested into hip internal and external rotation. The bony protuberance that is most prominent to the examiner's touch is the GT. Focal tenderness over this bony protuberance is the definition of GTPS.

Another common finding in GTPS is a positive Trendelenburg sign because hip abductor weakness is often the leading biomechanical cause of GTPS. If the patient is able, a positive Trendelenburg can be determined by asking the patient to stand on one leg. If the pelvis contralateral to the stance leg drops, there is weakness of the stance leg hip abductor muscles. This is a positive Trendelenburg sign. If the patient intentionally shifts his/her trunk over the stance leg (thereby elevating the contralateral pelvis) in order to perform the task, this is considered a positive compensated Trendelenburg sign. This finding also corroborates hip abductor weakness of the stance leg.

The presence of a Trendelenburg or compensated Trendelenburg sign can help a provider identify biomechanical issues to help direct treatment. However, a Trendelenburg sign is positive in 54% of all people with CLBP.

### Comparison of fluoroscopically guided and blind corticosteroid injections for greater trochanteric pain syndrome: Multicentre randomised controlled trial [^115PWvv2]. BMJ (2009). High credibility.

An examination of the relative strengths and weaknesses of this study is needed to put the results in context. Firstly, this is the only controlled study that has evaluated trochanteric bursa injections. The absence of controlled studies is somewhat surprising, considering that a recent audit found that the number of procedures billed to Medicare, the largest health insurance supplier in the United States, under the procedural terminology code pertaining to "major joint or bursa injection", which includes trochanteric bursa injections, far exceeds that of any other pain management intervention. Secondly, our outcomes are less positive than several others reported for trochanteric bursa injections. However, all previous studies evaluating trochanteric bursa injections were unblinded and uncontrolled, which tends to accentuate expectation bias. Nevertheless, larger, placebo-controlled studies are needed to better ascertain the efficacy of trochanteric bursa corticosteroid injections.

- **Concerns about study data**: Another concern about this study stems from the fact that only 39 of the 65 participants had outcome data recorded at three months. This was justified on the basis of ethical concerns stemming from pilot data showing that less than 10% of patients with "negative" outcomes at one month would experience a "positive" outcome three months post-injection with no intervening treatment. However, not carrying over one month treatment failures limits the long-term conclusions on efficacy and differences between treatment groups that can be reached from these results.

### Competitive female runners with a history of iliotibial band syndrome demonstrate atypical hip and knee kinematics [^113MGVUL]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

This study employed a cross-sectional experimental laboratory design. The objective was to examine differences in running mechanics between runners who had previously sustained iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) and those with no knee-related running injuries.

ITBS is the second leading cause of knee pain in runners and the most common cause of lateral knee pain. Despite its prevalence, few biomechanical studies have been conducted to better understand its etiology. Because the iliotibial band has both femoral and tibial attachments, it is possible that atypical hip and foot mechanics could result in the development of ITBS.

The methods involved comparing the running mechanics of 35 females who had previously sustained ITBS with 35 healthy, age-matched, and running distance-matched females. Comparisons of hip, knee, and ankle 3-dimensional kinematics and internal moments during the stance phase of running gait were measured.

The results showed that the ITBS group exhibited significantly greater peak rearfoot invertor moment, peak knee internal rotation angle, and peak hip adduction angle compared to controls. No significant differences in peak rearfoot eversion angle, peak knee flexion angle, peak knee external rotator moment, or peak hip abductor moments were observed between groups.

The conclusion drawn was that females with a previous history of ITBS demonstrate a kinematic profile that suggests increased stress on the iliotibial band. These results were generally similar to those reported for a prospective study conducted within the same laboratory environment.

### Diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests for assessing greater trochanteric pain syndrome: A systematic review with meta-analysis [^114XA41G]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). Low credibility.

We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of clinical tests that are used to diagnose greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) in clinical practice. The study utilized a diagnostic test accuracy systematic review with meta-analysis.

- **Literature search**: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, and SPORTDiscus were searched using keywords mapped to diagnostic test accuracy for GTPS.

- **Study selection criteria**: Studies with published or derivable diagnostic accuracy data were included.

- **Data synthesis**: Risk of bias was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool, and certainty of evidence was evaluated via the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) framework. MetaDTA "R" random-effects models were used to summarize individual and pooled data, including sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, and pretest/posttest probabilities.

From a database yield of 858 studies, 23 full texts were assessed. We included six studies for review, involving 15 tests and 272 participants (314 hips). The overall certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Meta-analysis of six tests revealed sequenced test clusters able to significantly shift pretest-posttest probability for, or against a GTPS diagnosis.

In people reporting lateral hip pain, a negative gluteal tendon (GT) palpation test followed by a negative resisted hip abduction test significantly reduced the posttest probability of GTPS from 59% to 14%. In those with a positive GT palpation test followed by a positive resisted hip abduction test, the posttest probability of GTPS significantly shifted from 59% to 96%.

### Pathogenesis and contemporary diagnoses for lateral hip pain: a scoping review [^1168VpS9]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

Recent advances in diagnostic imaging techniques and soft tissue endoscopy now allow for precise diagnosis and management of extra-articular hip pathology. The aim of this scoping review is to present an evidence-based update of the relevant literature focusing only on the pathoanatomy, clinical assessment, and diagnosis of pathology in the peritrochanteric space.

- **Methods**: A literature search was performed on PubMed to include articles which reported on the anatomy and diagnosis of greater trochanteric pain syndrome, trochanteric bursitis, gluteus medius tears, and external snapping hip syndrome.

- **Results**: A total of 542 studies were identified, of which 49 articles were included for full text analysis for the scoping review. Peritrochanteric space pathology can be broadly classified into (1) greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), (2) abductor tears, and (3) external snapping hip syndrome. Anatomically, the gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and tensor fascia lata work in conjunction to abduct and internally rotate the hip. The anterolateral part of the gluteus medius tendon is more prone to tears due to a thin tendinous portion. Increased acetabular anteversion has also been shown to be associated with gluteal and trochanteric bursitis. In terms of clinical examination, tests found to be most useful for assisting in the diagnosis of lateral hip pain were the single-leg stance, resisted external derotation of the hip, hip lag sign, and the Trendelenburg's test. Dynamic ultrasound along with guided injections and MRI scans assist in differentiating the pathologies.

### Pathogenesis and contemporary diagnoses for lateral hip pain: A scoping review [^1151Yrr2]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

A literature search was performed on PubMed to include articles from inception to June 30, 2020, using various combinations of keywords. Studies reporting on the anatomy and diagnosis of greater trochanteric pain syndrome, trochanteric bursitis, gluteus medius tears, and external snapping hip syndrome (ESHS) were included for analysis. Additionally, studies focusing solely on the anatomy and diagnosis of lateral hip pain were included. However, narrative reviews, case reports, and studies focusing on treatment or outcomes were excluded from the analysis.

### Editorial commentary: It is imperative to fix symptomatic hip gluteus medius tears at time of femoroacetabular impingement: Why ignore this pain in the butt [^111vuBGV]. Arthroscopy (2022). Low credibility.

The hip can have a multitude of different pathologies leading to various symptoms. Greater trochanteric pain syndrome, historically attributed to bursitis, has been largely associated with lesions of the gluteus medius and minimus tendons. The prevalence of gluteus medius pathology in patients with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is as high as one-third of the FAI population. If a patient is found to have significant clinical symptoms of both FAI and a gluteus medius tear, it is imperative to address both pathologies. The most important diagnostic predictor in hip arthroscopy is not magnetic resonance imaging but a well-executed history and physical exam.

- **Quadrant approach**: We use a quadrant approach:
	- The medial quadrant accounts for adductor bursitis, adductor tears, pudendal neuralgia, or sports hernias.
	- The posterior quadrant may account for a hamstring tear, lumbar radiculopathy, ischiofemoral impingement, or in rare cases piriformis syndrome.
	- The anterior quadrant accounts for more intraarticular pathologies including FAI, labral tears, osteoarthritis, avascular necrosis, or iliopsoas bursitis.
	- The lateral quadrant would include greater trochanteric pain syndrome, gluteus medius and minimus tears, external snapping hip syndrome, and iliotibial band syndrome.

By using this systematic approach and utilizing magnetic resonance imaging to confirm the diagnosis, we may accurately determine patients' hip pathologies.

### Editorial commentary: An optimal classification system to guide prognosis and treatment in greater trochanteric pain syndrome: Now we're speaking the same language [^1159z36o]. Arthroscopy (2021). High credibility.

The optimal classification system in arthroscopic and related surgery research and clinical practice should be clinically relevant, descriptive, reproducible, simple, inexpensive, safe, and widely applicable. For the hip, classification systems that characterize intra-articular disorders like femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome, dysplasia, labral tears, and articular cartilage disease predominate the literature. Recently, awareness of peritrochanteric and other extra-articular disorders has increasingly led to greater recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of what has been historically known as "just bursitis". These disorders are far more complex and include greater trochanteric pain syndrome, the spectrum of gluteal tendon pathology, greater trochanteric bursitis, snapping iliotibial band (external coxa saltans), and greater trochanteric-ischial impingement.

The utility of an intraoperative greater trochanteric pain syndrome classification system has now been proven using prospectively collected data, assimilating a decade-long eligibility period following open or endoscopic treatment of peritrochanteric disorders with a minimum two-year follow-up using validated patient-reported outcome scores. This classification guides prognosis and treatment, exactly as an optimal orthopedic classification system should do.

### Soft-tissue sources of extra-articular pain following total hip arthroplasty: A comprehensive review [^116XLWPL]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

- **Trochanteric bursitis**: Trochanteric bursitis (TB), or inflammation of one or more of the peri-trochanteric bursae, has historically been considered a primary source of lateral hip pain, with an approximate prevalence of 4.4% to 29% in patients post-THA. A proposed cause is repetitive friction between the greater trochanter (GT) and the iliotibial band, commonly associated with overuse, trauma, and altered gait patterns. Teng et al. investigated the effect of performing a bursectomy during primary THA. In this study, 550 patients underwent routine bursectomy, while 400 did not. At an 11-year follow-up, the incidence of TB was unaffected by whether a bursectomy was performed. Furthermore, White et al. recently conducted a risk factor analysis for the development of TB, evaluating 1,094 patients, of whom 103 (9.4%) developed TB. The incidence varied slightly by surgical approach: 8.7% for the posterior approach, 10.8% for the direct anterior approach, and 4.2% for the direct lateral approach. However, the surgical approach was not identified as a notable risk factor. Among the variables analyzed, only sex was markedly associated with increased risk; women had a 1.79 times higher risk of developing TB. Notably, changes in acetabular offset, femoral offset, total offset, and leg length between preoperative and postoperative radiographs were not associated with an increased risk of TB in either univariate or multivariate model.

- **Clinical presentation**: Patients usually complain of lateral thigh pain, often aggravated by prolonged sitting or stair climbing, with a tender area on the GT.

### 'Bald trochanter' spontaneous rupture of the conjoined tendons of the gluteus medius and minimus presenting as a trochanteric bursitis [^115Ga36R]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

A 66-year-old white woman presented with progressive complaints of right lateral hip and thigh pain, associated with a disabling limp and without an antecedent history of trauma. Physical examination revealed localized pain over the right greater trochanter upon palpation. A full, pain-free range of motion of the right hip was observed, although it was associated with weakness in the hip abductors. The patient ambulated with a compensated right Trendelenburg gait.

Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a trochanteric bursitis and effusion of the hip, as well as a full-thickness tear of the gluteus medius muscle. This included both a disruption and retraction of the tendon of an atretic gluteus minimus muscle. Conjoined tendon pathology of both the gluteus medius and minimus, as revealed by magnetic resonance examination, is probably more frequent than commonly recognized. In patients presenting with "intractable" complaints of trochanteric bursitis and an ambulatory limp due to weakness in the hip abductors, imaging studies that call attention to a possible tendon rupture may be diagnostic.

### Editorial commentary: The indication and technique of iliotibial band release for external snapping hip during hip arthroscopy in patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome [^116ZbAZs]. Arthroscopy (2022). Low credibility.

Patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) often have extra-articular disorders, such as external snapping hip (ESH). We recommend that obvious ESH be addressed by endoscopic transversal iliotibial band (ITB) release during hip arthroscopy for FAIS because the residual serious snapping caused by ESH negatively affects the outcome of hip arthroscopy. However, for mild ESH without indications for severe trochanteric bursitis on magnetic resonance imaging, we still propose that physical therapy, extracorporeal shock wave therapy, or local injection be performed for pain relief.

Surgical interventions for ESH, including the Z-plasty technique and the modified Z-plasty technique for lengthening the ITB, as well as endoscopic cruciate or transversal incision in the ITB for release, have been reported with good results. Every technique has advantages and disadvantages, and we believe that surgeons should perform ITB release for ESH at the time of hip arthroscopy for FAIS based on their personal experience and inclination. In any case, excessive release of the ITB should be avoided.

Finally, we propose that more attention should be paid to the peri-greater trochanter (GT) space, an anatomic space between the ITB and the GT, which is similar to the subacromial space in the shoulder joint. Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), related to the peri-GT space, is a spectrum of disorders, including trochanteric bursitis, abductor tendon pathology, and ESH. Precise diagnosis and proper procedures for conditions related to GTPS during surgery may improve the outcome of arthroscopy.
