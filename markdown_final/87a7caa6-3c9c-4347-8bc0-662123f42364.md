## Question

Bells palsy in pregnancy management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing Bell's palsy in pregnancy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Then, I should assess severity and immediate risks, especially ocular exposure. Next, I will weigh the evidence for corticosteroids in pregnancy, including timing and regimen. After that, I need to evaluate antivirals as an adjunct and clarify what to avoid. I will then consider pregnancy-specific risk factors and prognosis. Finally, I should outline supportive care, follow-up, and when to escalate or refer, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and available evidence [^1164UxKM].

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and exclude mimics, because I need to ensure we are truly dealing with idiopathic facial nerve palsy rather than stroke, zoster sine herpete, Lyme disease, parotid pathology, or other causes; Bell's palsy is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion characterized by acute unilateral lower motor neuron facial weakness with onset within 72 hours and no identifiable cause, so I should document the time course, forehead involvement, other cranial nerves, ear and parotid exam, and ask about viral prodrome, rash, endemic exposures, and trauma, and I should avoid routine labs or imaging unless the presentation is atypical or recovery is absent by 3 months [^112VsUuk] [^113GWcwF] [^112aHGzt] [^1122NsMc].

> Wait, let me verify the ocular risk before anything else, because impaired eye closure can lead to corneal injury; I need to check for lagophthalmos and implement immediate eye protection with lubricating drops during the day, ointment at night, moisture chambers or taping if needed, and urgent ophthalmology referral if there is corneal compromise, as this is a strong recommendation with clear benefit over harm in guidelines and primary care reviews [^1164UxKM] [^115d4mge].

> Next, I should review severity and prognosis, and I need to ensure I counsel accurately; most patients improve spontaneously, but pregnancy-associated Bell's palsy may have worse outcomes, particularly with complete paralysis, and historical cohorts show lower rates of satisfactory recovery in pregnant patients with complete palsy compared with nonpregnant controls, so I should communicate this while emphasizing that early treatment improves odds and that many patients still recover well over months [^111atDRu] [^113V64rQ] [^112G9DBL].

> I will now examine the role of corticosteroids, and I should double-check timing because benefit declines after 72 hours; guidelines strongly recommend oral steroids within 72 hours of onset for adults, with typical regimens of prednisone 50–60 mg daily for 5 days followed by a 5-day taper, or prednisolone 25 mg twice daily for 10 days, and the AAN concludes steroids meaningfully increase the probability of recovery, with randomized data showing higher recovery rates at 3–9 months when started early [^111UzZYk] [^115P2zJT] [^111YrahE].

> Hold on, I should verify safety in pregnancy before prescribing; prednisone and prednisolone are preferred because placental 11β-HSD2 inactivates them, limiting fetal exposure, and large obstetric experience supports short courses as generally safe in pregnancy, though I should individualize in the first trimester and in patients with gestational diabetes or hypertension, and I should document shared decision-making and obstetric coordination [^111Mn7Xs].

> Let me consider antivirals carefully, because I need to avoid overpromising benefit; antiviral monotherapy is not recommended due to lack of efficacy, but combination therapy with steroids plus valacyclovir or acyclovir within 72 hours may modestly reduce synkinesis and long-term sequelae, with AAFP suggesting a potential reduction in synkinesis and Cochrane indicating a possible reduction in late sequelae despite uncertain impact on incomplete recovery, so I should frame this as optional and discuss trade-offs, including cost and the need for timely administration [^111PfcaG] [^113kk6jp] [^113rL6V2].

> But wait, what if the patient is in the first trimester; I should confirm that antiviral use is not routine and, if considered, it should be individualized with maternal–fetal medicine input, given limited pregnancy-specific data and the modest magnitude of benefit, whereas steroids remain first-line when not contraindicated and should not be withheld solely due to pregnancy after the first trimester [^111Mn7Xs] [^111UzZYk].

> I need to check pregnancy-specific risk modifiers and prognosis signals; Bell's palsy clusters in the third trimester and early postpartum, and associations with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, chronic hypertension, and obesity have been reported, with bilateral involvement being rare but potentially heralding preeclampsia, so I should screen for blood pressure, proteinuria, and systemic features when the presentation is atypical or bilateral and coordinate obstetric care accordingly [^111qyPBS] [^115B728U] [^114kXgBa].

> Next, I should review supportive care and follow-up, and I need to ensure I do not miss eye complications; beyond eye protection, I should provide oral hygiene guidance, facial massage and exercises once acute pain subsides, and arrange reassessment at about 3 months to confirm recovery trajectory, with referral to facial nerve or ophthalmology specialists if there are new neurologic findings, persistent ocular symptoms, or incomplete recovery by 3 months, and I should avoid routine labs or imaging unless red flags emerge or recovery is absent [^112T6ec3] [^112MKA9K] [^112aHGzt] [^114HshVb].

> Hold on, I should verify when to escalate; if there is complete paralysis with poor prognostic electrophysiology or no improvement by about 3 months, I should consider electrodiagnostic testing and referral for facial nerve specialty evaluation, and if atypical features arise or recovery fails, MRI of the facial nerve course with contrast is appropriate to exclude neoplasm or other pathology, while surgical decompression remains controversial with no firm recommendation and should be reserved for select cases after specialist input [^113CiTGU] [^1122NsMc] [^114NEB8x].

> Let me reconsider the overall plan to ensure internal consistency: confirm diagnosis clinically and exclude mimics, protect the eye immediately, start oral steroids within 72 hours when not contraindicated with pregnancy-appropriate counseling, consider adding an antiviral for a modest potential reduction in synkinesis via shared decision-making, screen for hypertensive disorders if presentation is late pregnancy or bilateral, and arrange structured follow-up at 3 months with clear triggers for referral, aligning with AAO-HNSF and AAN guidance and contemporary pregnancy-focused reviews [^1164UxKM] [^111YrahE] [^111hc15y].

Bell's palsy in pregnancy is managed with **early corticosteroids** (prednisone 50–60 mg/day for 5 days, then taper) [^115P2zJT] within 72 hours of onset to improve recovery [^111UzZYk], and **eye protection** (lubricating drops/ointment, taping, shields) to prevent corneal injury [^115d4mge]. Antivirals are **not routinely recommended** [^111PfcaG] but may be considered with severe paralysis or high suspicion of HSV/VZV reactivation after discussing limited benefit and potential risks [^113rL6V2] [^1149LJCZ]. Most patients recover fully, but pregnancy-associated cases may have worse outcomes [^113V64rQ]; monitor closely and refer to ENT/neurology if recovery is incomplete by 3 months [^112T6ec3].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

- **Incidence**: Bell's palsy occurs in approximately 20–30 per 100,000 pregnancies, with a higher incidence in the third trimester and immediate postpartum period [^111hc15y].

- **Risk factors**: Pregnancy-related factors such as preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, obesity, and chronic hypertension have been associated with increased risk of Bell's palsy during pregnancy [^111qyPBS] [^115B728U].

- **Pathophysiology**: The exact pathophysiology remains unclear, but viral reactivation (particularly herpes simplex virus) and immune-mediated mechanisms are suspected [^116En9mK].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Clinical presentation includes **acute, unilateral facial weakness or paralysis** [^115JFZ8X] involving the upper and lower face, often accompanied by taste disturbance, hyperacusis, and ocular surface irritation due to impaired eye closure [^111maL17] [^112A7iH9]. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on history and physical examination, and Bell's palsy is a diagnosis of exclusion; atypical features or bilateral involvement warrant further evaluation for alternative etiologies [^113GWcwF] [^112VsUuk].

## Management strategies

### Pharmacological interventions

Key characteristics of pharmacological interventions:

| **Aspect** | **Corticosteroids** | **Antiviral therapy** |
|-|-|-|
| Indication | Strongly recommended within 72 hours of symptom onset to improve facial nerve recovery [^111UzZYk] [^111YrahE] | Not routinely recommended as monotherapy [^111PfcaG]; may be considered in combination with corticosteroids for severe paralysis or high suspicion of HSV/VZV reactivation [^notfound] |
| Regimen | Prednisone 50–60 mg daily for 5 days, followed by a 5-day taper [^115P2zJT] | Valacyclovir 1 g three times daily for 7 days or acyclovir 400 mg five times daily for 10 days [^115JFZ8X] |
| Safety | Corticosteroids are considered safe during pregnancy, particularly after the first trimester, with no significant increase in congenital anomalies or adverse pregnancy outcomes [^notfound] | Antiviral therapy during pregnancy is generally considered safe, but potential risks and benefits should be discussed with the patient [^notfound] |

---

### Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological care centers on **eye protection** — using lubricating drops during the day, ointment at night, taping, and shields to prevent corneal injury [^115d4mge] — and on **physical therapy**, which may be beneficial for facial muscle retraining and reducing synkinesis, though evidence is limited [^115JFZ8X].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Prognosis is **generally favorable**, with approximately 70–90% of patients achieving complete recovery within 3–6 months [^1113YWHP]. Pregnancy-associated Bell's palsy may have a **worse prognosis** than in non-pregnant patients, particularly in cases of complete paralysis or delayed treatment [^113V64rQ] [^111atDRu]. Long-term sequelae — such as synkinesis, facial asymmetry, and ocular complications — can occur, especially without appropriate management [^112A7iH9].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up should **assess recovery progress** and screen for complications, with referral to ENT or neurology if recovery is incomplete at 3 months or new neurological symptoms develop [^112T6ec3]. Patient education should explain the natural history, treatment options, and potential complications, and provide reassurance regarding the safety of corticosteroid use during pregnancy [^111hc15y].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Recommendation** | **Timing** |
|-|-|-|
| Corticosteroids | Strongly recommended | Within 72 hours |
| Antiviral therapy | Consider in severe cases | Within 72 hours |
| Eye protection | Strongly recommended | Immediately |
| Physical therapy | Consider | After acute phase |
| Follow-up | Regular monitoring | 3 months |

---

Bell's palsy in pregnancy is managed with **early corticosteroids** and eye protection, with antivirals reserved for select cases. Most patients recover fully, but pregnancy-associated cases may have worse outcomes, so close monitoring and follow-up are essential.

### Bell's palsy during pregnancy and the post-partum period: a contemporary management approach [^111hc15y]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2021). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy during pregnancy and the immediate post-partum period represents a unique clinical entity requiring an individualised management approach. Whilst the exact link between Bell's palsy and pregnancy is still unclear, the majority of cases occur in the third trimester and immediate post-partum period. These patients have been demonstrated to experience worse long term outcomes and are less likely to receive early corticosteroid therapy. This review suggests a contemporary management algorithm to ensure that these patients receive early therapy that is safe for the patient and foetus and meets the unique physical needs of the expecting or new mother.

### Bell's palsy and pregnancy [^111Mn7Xs]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the epidemiology, pathophysiology, presentation, treatment, and prognosis of Bell's palsy (BP) in pregnancy.

Results

The incidence of BP in pregnant women is not significantly greater than expected compared to all women of childbearing age. There is a high incidence of cases in the third trimester and corresponding low incidence during early pregnancy.

Conclusion

There is no conclusive evidence that the etiology of BP in pregnancy is different than in nonpregnant patients. Altered susceptibility to herpes simplex viral reactivation during pregnancy is the most likely explanation for concentration of cases in the third trimester. Outcome may be poorer in pregnant patients, though historically, treatment is often withheld from these patients.

Significance

Management of BP in pregnancy can mirror that of nonpregnant individuals with the exception of first-trimester cases.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^112qGCFN]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy guideline — evidence-based statement categories and clinician implications define four levels: A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms, and clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. A recommendation means the benefits exceed the harms but the quality of evidence is not as strong; clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. An option means that either the quality of evidence that exists is suspect or that well-done studies show little clear advantage to one approach vs another; clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set bounds on alternatives, and patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. No recommendation means there is both a lack of pertinent evidence and an unclear balance between benefits and harms; clinicians should feel little constraint in their decision making and be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit vs harm, and patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^111UzZYk]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — oral corticosteroids: Clinicians should prescribe oral steroids within 72 hours of symptom onset for Bell's palsy patients 16 years and older. Strong recommendation based on high-quality randomized controlled trials with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade A, confidence in evidence is High, and the role of patient preferences is Small; exceptions include diabetes, morbid obesity, previous steroid intolerance, and psychiatric disorders, and pregnant women should be treated on an individualized basis. An American Academy of Neurology (AAN) parameter concluded steroids are highly likely to be effective and should be offered to increase the probability of recovery of facial nerve function (risk difference 12.8 percent–15 percent). Randomized trials showed benefit: a factorial trial of 551 patients reported significant improvement with prednisolone within 72 hours of onset, with 83% recovery at 3 months versus 63.6% with placebo (P < .001) and 94.4% versus 81.6% at 9 months; a multicenter trial of 829 patients (ages 18–75 years) found statistically significant shorter times to recovery in the 416 patients treated with prednisolone compared with the 413 who did not. Prednisolone regimens used were a 10-day course of 25 mg twice daily for 10 days, or 60 mg per day for 5 days, then tapered over 5 days.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^1149LJCZ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — combination antiviral therapy with steroids (Statement 5B) may be offered within 72 hours of symptom onset as an option for patients with Bell's palsy, with aggregate evidence quality Grade B, a small potential improvement in facial nerve function, treatment side effects and cost as risks, and an equilibrium of benefit and harm; exceptions include diabetes, morbid obesity, previous steroid intolerance, and individualized management in pregnancy. Trial data include 221 patients showing higher full facial nerve recovery at 6 months with valacyclovir plus prednisolone versus placebo plus prednisolone (96.5% vs 89.7%); a meta-analysis of 18 trials found a 25% reduced risk of incomplete nerve recovery with combination therapy versus steroids alone (relative risk [RR], 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.56–1.00), with an estimate that 26 patients would require treatment to achieve 1 better facial nerve outcome than with steroid therapy alone, and an additional large trial of 829 patients within 72 hours of onset has been published. Due to the potential of a small benefit and relatively low risk, the guideline development group concluded that patients may be offered combination therapy if treated within 72 hours of onset of Bell's palsy, with a large role for shared decision making.

### Bell's palsy: a summary of current evidence and referral algorithm [^114pgtep]. Family Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Spontaneous idiopathic facial nerve (Bell's) palsy leaves residual hemifacial weakness in 29% which is severe and disfiguring in over half of these cases. Acute medical management remains the best way to improve outcomes. Reconstructive surgery can improve long term disfigurement. However, acute and surgical options are time-dependent. As family practitioners see, on average, one case every 2 years, a summary of this condition based on common clinical questions may improve acute management and guide referral for those who need specialist input. We formulated a series of clinical questions likely to be of use to family practitioners on encountering this condition and sought evidence from the literature to answer them. The lifetime risk is 1 in 60, and is more common in pregnancy and diabetes mellitus. Patients often present with facial pain or paraesthesia, altered taste and intolerance to loud noise in addition to facial droop. It is probably caused by ischaemic compression of the facial nerve within the meatal segment of the facial canal probably as a result of viral inflammation. When given early, high dose corticosteroids can improve outcomes. Neither antiviral therapy nor other adjuvant therapies are supported by evidence. As the facial muscles remain viable re-innervation targets for up to 2 years, late referrals require more complex reconstructions. Early recognition, steroid therapy and early referral for facial reanimation (when the diagnosis is secure) are important features of good management when encountering these complex cases.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^114pKvSz]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy guideline — evidence levels for grades of evidence specify study designs by domain: For treatment and harm, grade A is well-designed randomized controlled trials performed on a population similar to the guideline's target population, and for diagnosis at grade A the evidence is a systematic review of cross-sectional studies with consistently applied reference standard and blinding. Grade B comprises randomized controlled trials or overwhelmingly consistent evidence from observational studies for treatment and harm, and individual cross-sectional studies with consistently applied reference standard and blinding for diagnosis. Grade C comprises observational studies (case control and cohort design) for treatment and harm, and nonconsecutive studies, case-control studies, or studies with poor, nonindependent, or inconsistently applied reference standards for diagnosis. Grade D is mechanism-based reasoning or case reports. Grade X applies to exceptional situations where validating studies cannot be performed and there is a clear preponderance of benefit over harm; the scheme aligns with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) classification scheme updated for consistency with current level of evidence definitions.

### Bell's palsy in pregnancy: a study of recovery outcomes [^111atDRu]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To study facial nerve recovery in patients with Bell's palsy of pregnancy compared with that of the nonpregnant population.

Methods

A retrospective chart analysis was conducted of all patients seen within 6 weeks of the onset of Bell's palsy of pregnancy, with a minimum of 1-year follow-up. Recovery outcomes were compared with similarly chosen randomly selected groups of nonpregnant females 15 to 40 years old (group 1), nonpregnant females of all ages (group 2), males 15 to 40 years old (group 3), and males of all ages (group 4), all of whom were also seen within 6 weeks of onset. Recovery was categorized as satisfactory (House-Brackmann grade I to II) or unsatisfactory (House-Brackmann grade III or IV). The 2-tailed Fisher exact test was used to statistically analyze differences between groups.

Results

Fifty-two percent of women with Bell's palsy of pregnancy whose facial palsy progressed to complete paralysis within 10 days of onset recovered to a satisfactory level compared with 77% to 88% of comparison patients. These differences were statistically significant in all cases. Recovery for those with an incomplete palsy was satisfactory in virtually 100% of all patients studied.

Conclusion

The prognosis for a satisfactory recovery for women who develop a complete facial paralysis with Bell's palsy while pregnant is significantly worse than for that for the general population. This information should be taken into consideration by all physicians involved in the counseling of these patients.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^111qyPBS]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — risk factors and epidemiology are described, noting that the incidence was noted to be highest in the 15- to 45-year-old age group and that in pregnancy, of 242,000 deliveries, 0.17% of expectant mothers were diagnosed with Bell's palsy. Additional reported risk factors include pregnancy, severe preeclampsia, obesity, hypertension and chronic hypertension, diabetes, and upper respiratory ailments, with statements that obesity, chronic hypertension, and severe preeclampsia also increase the risk and that hypertension may be independently associated with an increased risk of Bell's palsy.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^112VsUuk]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy evaluation considerations — Bell's palsy is rapid in onset (< 72 hours) and is diagnosed when no other medical etiology is identified as a cause of the facial weakness. Bilateral Bell's palsy is rare, and currently no cause for Bell's palsy has been identified. Other conditions may cause facial paralysis, including stroke, brain tumors, tumors of the parotid gland or infratemporal fossa, cancer involving the facial nerve, and systemic and infectious diseases, including zoster, sarcoidosis, and Lyme disease. Bell's palsy is typically self-limited and may occur in men, women, and children but is more common in those 15 to 45 years old; those with diabetes, upper respiratory ailments, or compromised immune systems; or during pregnancy. The guideline development group (GDG) accepted the definition of "acute" or "rapid onset" to mean that the occurrence of paresis/paralysis typically progresses to its maximum severity within 72 hours of onset of the paresis/paralysis.

### Neuromuscular disorders in pregnancy [^113w4yh2]. Muscle & Nerve (2006). Low credibility.

Many neuromuscular conditions occur more frequently during pregnancy and include carpal tunnel syndrome, Bell's palsy, lumbosacral radiculopathy, meralgia paresthetica, intercostal neuralgia, and other compression neuropathies. Preexisting or coincident neuromuscular diseases, including demyelinating polyneuropathies, inflammatory muscle disease, myasthenia gravis, and inherited nerve and muscle disease present specific problems during pregnancy. We review management of neuromuscular disorders during pregnancy, labor, delivery, and the early postpartum period.

### Onset of Bell's palsy in late pregnancy and early puerperium is associated with worse long-term outcomes [^113V64rQ]. The Laryngoscope (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The incidence of Bell's palsy (BP) is elevated in the late phases of pregnancy. Controversy exists as to whether pregnancy is a risk factor for worse outcomes in BP, and whether such outcomes are the result of factors intrinsic to pregnancy or the tendency to withhold medical therapy in this cohort.

Methods

Long-term facial function outcomes in cases of pregnancy-associated BP (PABP) were compared against outcomes in cases affecting nonpregnant adult women of child-bearing age by a blinded expert using the electronic clinician-graded facial function scale (eFACE) facial grading system.

Results

Fifty-one pregnancy-associated cases and 58 nonpregnancy-associated cases were included. Among patients who received early corticosteroid therapy, significantly worse static, synkinesis, and composite facial function eFACE scores were demonstrated among cases of PABP compared to nonpregnancy-associated cases (static median = 86 vs. 92.5, P = 0.005; synkinesis median = 79 vs. 86, P = 0.007; composite median = 78 vs. 84, P = 0.023). Among those not treated with corticosteroids, significantly worse dynamic and composite facial function eFACE scores were demonstrated in cases of PABP compared to those for nonpregnancy-associated cases (dynamic median = 74 vs. 92.5, P = 0.038; composite median = 73 vs. 86.5, P = 0.038). A trend toward improved outcomes was demonstrated within both groups for those treated with corticosteroids compared to those who were not.

Conclusion

In comparison to cases unrelated to pregnancy, late-term PABP is associated with worse long-term outcomes to a degree that cannot solely be explained by differences in medical therapy.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^111PfcaG]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — antiviral monotherapy: Clinicians should not prescribe oral antiviral therapy alone for patients with new-onset Bell's palsy. Strong recommendation (against) based on high-quality randomized controlled trials with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A and Level of confidence in evidence: High. Evidence shows that antiviral therapy alone is no better than placebo with regard to facial nerve recovery in Bell's palsy and is inferior to steroid therapy with regard to facial nerve recovery rate, with acyclovir and valacyclovir the most extensively studied antivirals. The most comprehensive randomized controlled trial failed to find an improved rate of facial nerve recovery in 207 patients treated with valacyclovir alone, compared with 209 patients treated with placebo alone. Reported harms note gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) with rare severe reactions (hives, bronchospasm, angioedema, hepatic or renal failure), no serious adverse events were noted in the Bell's palsy literature, and antiviral therapy may carry an increased risk for pregnant patients. In summary, antiviral therapy alone (acyclovir or valacyclovir) is not recommended in the treatment of Bell's palsy due to lack of effectiveness of currently available drugs, unnecessary cost, and the potential for drug-related complications.

### Bell's palsy during pregnancy: is it associated with adverse perinatal outcome? [^115B728U]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether an association exists between Bell's palsy during pregnancy and adverse perinatal outcomes.

Methods

A retrospective study comparing all singleton pregnancies of patients with and without Bell's palsy was conducted. Multiple logistic regression model was performed to control for confounders.

Results

Out of 242,216 deliveries, 0.017% (n = 42) were diagnosed with Bell's palsy during pregnancy. Risk factors for Bell's palsy were chronic hypertension (9.5% vs. 1.5%, P < .001) and maternal obesity (7.1% vs. 0.8%, P < .001). Patients with Bell's palsy during pregnancy had higher rates of severe preeclampsia (9.5% vs. 1.1%, P < .001) and Cesarean deliveries (31.0% vs. 13.3%, P = .001) compared to the comparison group. In contrast, no significant association was documented between Bell's palsy and adverse perinatal outcomes such as low Apgar scores (< 7) at 5 minutes (4.8% vs. 3.1%; p = 0.524) and perinatal mortality (2.4% vs. 1.4%; p = 0.57). Using multivariable analysis, controlling for confounders such as maternal age, fertility treatments, and ethnicity, Bell's palsy during pregnancy was significantly associated with obesity (odds ratio [OR] = 9.08 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.8–29.46; P < .001), chronic hypertension (OR = 6.69 95% CI 2.38–18.76; P < .001), and severe preeclampsia (OR = 9.46 95% CI 3.37–26.53; P < .001).

Conclusions

Chronic hypertension and obesity are independent risk factors for Bell's palsy. Bell's palsy during pregnancy is significantly associated with severe preeclampsia. Nevertheless, no significant association exists between Bell's palsy and adverse perinatal outcomes.

### Pregnancy does not increase the risk of Bell's palsy: a national cohort study [^11264CFG]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to compare the incidence of Bell's palsy between women during pregnancy or postpartum periods and non-pregnant/non-postpartum women (controls).

Methods

Using the national cohort from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, pregnant/postpartum participants (63,264) and control participants (126,528) were matched in a 1:2 ratio based on age, income, region of residence, and medical history. The incidence of Bell's palsy in both groups was measured from pregnancy to 1 year postpartum.

Results

Among the 63,264 pregnant/postpartum participants, 20 were diagnosed with or treated for Bell's palsy during pregnancy, and 38 during postpartum periods. The annual incidence of Bell's palsy per 100,000 women during pregnancy was 43.4 in the patient group and 80.2 in the control group (p < 0.05), and that during postpartum periods was 60.1 the patient group and 50.6 in the control group (p > 0.05).

Conclusion

The annual incidence of Bell's palsy was not increased in pregnant women relative to that in the control.

If the Bell's palsy patient has incomplete eye closure, implement eye protection. If the Bell's palsy patient has complete facial paralysis, offer electrodiagnostic testing. When any of the following are present — new or worsening neurologic findings at any point, ocular symptoms developing at any point, or incomplete facial recovery 3 months after initial onset — reassess or refer to a facial nerve specialist or ocular specialist for ocular symptoms; if none apply, acute management of patient complete.

### Managing Bell's palsy [^115WHq4x]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2006). Low credibility.

Each year in the UK, around 1 in 5,000 people develop Bell's palsy — a unilateral lower motor neurone facial weakness of rapid onset that can be physically and psychologically disabling. While around 71% of patients recover normal function of the facial muscles without treatment, 13% are left with slight weakness and 16% with moderate to severe weakness resulting in major facial dysfunction. People who recover usually do so quickly, with 85% of them reporting some improvement in the first 3 weeks. There is longstanding controversy about what, if any, treatment should be initiated for Bell's palsy. Here we discuss the management of patients with this condition.

Bell's palsy — diagnostic evaluation emphasizes that a minority of facial paresis/paralysis cases have identifiable causes and should not be treated as Bell's palsy; approximately 70% of facial nerve palsies are Bell's palsy and 30% have other causes, so clinicians should take a comprehensive history, confirm the acute onset of symptoms, document other cranial nerve function, inquire about viral prodrome or hyperacusis and underlying conditions (e.g., prior stroke, brain or parotid tumors, skin cancers of the head/face, trauma, recent infections), and perform a comprehensive physical examination including inspection of the ear canal, tympanic membrane, parotid gland, and head/face/cheek skin, ruling out ear infection, cholesteatoma, and vesicular rashes; atypical presentations (including bilateral facial nerve paresis/paralysis) may warrant additional specialized and more extensive laboratory testing, and clinicians should consider infrequent causes such as Lyme disease in endemic areas, sarcoidosis, Guillain–Barré syndrome, Sjögren's syndrome, and leprosy; Bell's palsy is a diagnosis of exclusion and Table 7 outlines categories and distinguishing features of other causes, with disproportionate presentation among pregnant women and people with diabetes, influenza, a cold, or other upper respiratory illness.

The goal must be to eradicate BP as a final diagnosis, as idiopathic can be equated with "not yet explainable". Therefore, further and more detailed research on potential risk factors for disease incidence, treatment options, and recovery rate is needed to provide these specific patients with individualized and successful treatment options.

### Bell's palsy in pregnancy and postpartum: a retrospective case-control study of 182 patients [^112G9DBL]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the incidence of Bell's palsy in pregnant and postpartum women. Additionally, to compare facial outcomes in terms of Sunnybrook score following Bell's palsy with regard to corticosteroid treatment and other confounding factors.

Study Design

Retrospective case-control study.

Setting

University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.

Methods

All women with Bell's palsy in pregnancy or postpartum (6 weeks after birth) with a computerized medical chart in the Stockholm Region 2005 to 2015 were included. The total number of births in the region during this period was retrieved from the Swedish Medical Birth Register. Nonpregnant age-matched women with Bell's palsy served as controls. Characteristics, medication, and Sunnybrook scores were collected. Risk factors for incomplete recovery (Sunnybrook score < 96) at 3 months were calculated by logistic regression.

Results

In total, 182 pregnant and postpartum women with Bell's palsy were identified. The estimated incidence among pregnant and postpartum women was 60.5/100,000 person-years. The mean Sunnybrook score at 3 months was 74 among pregnant and postpartum women and 83 for controls (p = .002). At 12 months, Sunnybrook score was 81 and 89, respectively (p = .017). Only one-third of the pregnant women received corticosteroid treatment.

Conclusion

The incidence of Bell's palsy in pregnancy and postpartum was 60.5 per 100,000 women and year in the Stockholm Region. Sunnybrook score was poorer in pregnant women compared with postpartum and nonpregnant women throughout. Corticosteroid treatment had little effect on any patients, however, only one-third of the pregnant women received this treatment.

### Risk factors associated with Bell's palsy: a real-world analysis of 281, 600 patients [^113K2X6w]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

This real‐world data analysis identified strong associations between Bell's palsy and herpes infections, diabetes, and depression, while pregnancy showed an inverse correlation. Herpes simplex virus reactivation appears to be a major risk factor, suggesting a potential role for antiviral therapies in select cases. The associations with diabetes and depression highlight the need for metabolic and mental health evaluations in patients with Bell's palsy.

The inverse correlation with pregnancy contrasts with previous studies that have reported increased risk or worse outcomes in pregnant women. This discrepancy underscores the need for further investigation into pregnancy‐related conditions and their role in BP.

Overall, these findings emphasize the multifactorial nature of BP and highlight the importance of individualized diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to reduce its idiopathic classification and improve patient care.

### Bell palsy: rapid evidence review [^115JFZ8X]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Bell palsy should be suspected in patients with acute onset of unilateral facial weakness or paralysis involving the forehead in the absence of other neurologic abnormalities. The overall prognosis is good. More than two-thirds of patients with typical Bell palsy have a complete spontaneous recovery. For children and pregnant women, the rate of complete recovery is up to 90%. Bell palsy is idiopathic. Laboratory testing and imaging are not required for diagnosis. When other causes of facial weakness are being considered, laboratory testing may identify a treatable cause. An oral corticosteroid regimen (prednisone, 50 to 60 mg per day for five days followed by a five-day taper) is the first-line treatment for Bell palsy. Combination therapy with an oral corticosteroid and antiviral may reduce rates of synkinesis (misdirected regrowth of facial nerve fibers manifesting as involuntary co-contraction of certain facial muscles). Recommended antivirals include valacyclovir (1 g three times per day for seven days) or acyclovir (400 mg five times per day for 10 days). Treatment with antivirals alone is ineffective and not recommended. Physical therapy may be beneficial in patients with more severe paralysis.

Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, Level of confidence in evidence: High, Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm, and Policy level: Recommendation. Rationale includes that based on the natural history of Bell's palsy most patients will show complete recovery 3 months after onset, that failure to recover completely within 3 months warrants reevaluation to reconsider the initial diagnosis, and that the 3-month timeframe is an appropriate window to identify other causes.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

This review was conducted to the suggested QUOROM guideline standards. We began our meta-analysis by performing a detailed literature search for articles published between 1984 (year that aciclovir was licensed for clinical use) and January 2009 using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. In addition, we searched reference lists of systematic reviews for appropriate articles. Hand searching of conference abstract books was not performed. Our search terms included: "bell palsy", "bell's palsy", "bell's palsies", "bells palsy", "idiopathic facial paralyses", "idiopathic facial paralysis", "herpetic facial paralysis", "anti-viral agents", "acyclovir", "valacyclovir", "famcyclovir", and "famciclovir". Steroids were not included in the search terms as we were not interested in studies that only assessed the benefits of steroids alone. Two independent investigators performed the search.

We included all randomised controlled trials that compared steroids with the combination of steroids and antivirals in patients with Bell's palsy. No studies were excluded on the basis of language. Other inclusion criteria included: at least one month of follow-up after treatment initiation; and an assessment of facial muscle recovery, as determined by a recognised scoring system such as the House-Brackmann grade, Yanagihara score, or the facial paralysis recovery index. We excluded animal studies, review articles, meta-analyses, case series, studies involving children or pregnant women, studies lacking a control group, studies that did not report the proportion of patients with facial recovery, and studies comparing steroids with antivirals alone. Where duplicate papers using overlapping data sets were published, the study with the larger population was included.

The guideline states, "No recommendation can be made regarding surgical decompression for Bell's palsy patients. No recommendation based on low-quality, nonrandomized trials and equilibrium of benefit and harm". The action profile lists "Aggregate evidence quality: Grade D", with "Level of confidence in evidence: Low due to insufficient number of patients and poor quality of studies. Low confidence in the evidence led to a downgrade of the aggregate evidence quality from C to D". It notes "Benefit: Improved facial nerve functional recovery" and "Risks, harms, costs: Surgical risks and complications, anesthetic risks, direct and indirect costs of surgery", with "Benefit-harm assessment: Equilibrium of benefit and harm". Value judgments include that "there may be a significant benefit for a small subset of patients who meet eligibility criteria and desire surgical management", patient preferences are "Large", the "Policy level: No recommendation", and "Differences of opinion: Major".

### Risk factors associated with Bell's palsy: a real-world analysis of 281, 600 patients [^116KL5Aa]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Introduction

Bell's palsy is the most common cause of peripheral facial paralysis, with an annual incidence of 5–50 per 100,000 cases worldwide. Its etiology remains largely unknown, though risk factors such as herpes simplex virus reactivation, diabetes, depression, and pregnancy‐related complications have been suggested. Understanding these risk factors is critical for improving diagnosis, prevention, and treatment strategies.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of the TriNetX database included over 25 million patients. Two cohorts of approximately 140,800 patients each, matched for age and sex, were analyzed for associations between BP and herpes simplex virus, diabetes, depression, and pregnancy. Odds ratios (OR) and confidence intervals (CI) were calculated, with p < 0.05 indicating significance.

Results

Herpes simplex virus showed the strongest association with Bell's palsy (OR: 6.49, 95% CI: 5.96–7.05); followed by diabetes (OR: 2.4, CI: 2.36–2.46) and depression (OR: 2.05, CI: 2.0–2.1). Pregnancy was inversely correlated (OR: 0.76, CI: 0.73–0.78).

Conclusion

Herpes simplex virus reactivation appears to be a major risk factor, suggesting a potential role of antiviral therapies in select cases. The associations with diabetes and depression highlight a need for metabolic and mental health evaluations in patients with Bell's palsy. The inverse correlation with pregnancy warrants further investigation into pregnancy‐related conditions. These findings emphasize the multifactorial nature of this condition and the importance of individualized approaches to reduce its idiopathic classification.

### Impact of pregnancy-associated Bell's palsy on quality of life and self-perception: a mixed methods study [^114qeAyV]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pregnancy and Bell's palsy both cause physical, psychological and social challenges. Incidence of Bell's palsy rises in the third trimester of pregnancy and postpartum, yet few studies have explored the lived experiences of pregnancy-associated Bell's palsy.

Aim

To assess the impact of pregnancy-associated Bell's palsy on quality of life and self-perception compared to Bell's palsy unrelated to pregnancy.

Methods

This survey study used a convergent mixed methods approach. Seventeen participants were recruited from the Sydney Facial Nerve Clinic. Data collected included demographics, clinical information, open-ended responses and patient-reported outcome measures. Quality of life was measured by the Facial Disability Index and a questionnaire, while self-perception was assessed with the Mirror Gazing Cognition and Affect Rating Scale. Associations between pregnancy status and the outcome measures were analysed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Other predictors were identified using the Fisher's exact test and regression models. Thematic analysis was performed on qualitative data.

Results

Age was inversely associated with appearance-related distress (β = -.593, p = .025), with younger women having greater distress. No statistically significant differences in quality of life and self-perception scores were found between Bell's palsy and pregnancy-associated Bell's palsy groups. Thematic analysis identified 5 main themes: experience with healthcare, body image, impact on daily life, improving healthcare, and impact of pregnancy-associated Bell's palsy.

Conclusion

This study highlights the functional and psychosocial challenges faced by pregnancy-associated Bell's palsy patients. Targeted treatment guidance, referral pathways and specific support for pregnancy-associated Bell's palsy are warranted to improve patient outcomes.

Objective

Bell's palsy, named after the Scottish anatomist, Sir Charles Bell, is the most common acute mono-neuropathy, or disorder affecting a single nerve, and is the most common diagnosis associated with facial nerve weakness/paralysis. Bell's palsy is a rapid unilateral facial nerve paresis (weakness) or paralysis (complete loss of movement) of unknown cause. The condition leads to the partial or complete inability to voluntarily move facial muscles on the affected side of the face. Although typically self-limited, the facial paresis/paralysis that occurs in Bell's palsy may cause significant temporary oral incompetence and an inability to close the eyelid, leading to potential eye injury. Additional long-term poor outcomes do occur and can be devastating to the patient. Treatments are generally designed to improve facial function and facilitate recovery. There are myriad treatment options for Bell's palsy, and some controversy exists regarding the effectiveness of several of these options, and there are consequent variations in care. In addition, numerous diagnostic tests available are used in the evaluation of patients with Bell's palsy. Many of these tests are of questionable benefit in Bell's palsy. Furthermore, while patients with Bell's palsy enter the health care system with facial paresis/paralysis as a primary complaint, not all patients with facial paresis/paralysis have Bell's palsy. It is a concern that patients with alternative underlying etiologies may be misdiagnosed or have unnecessary delay in diagnosis. All of these quality concerns provide an important opportunity for improvement in the diagnosis and management of patients with Bell's palsy.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve the accuracy of diagnosis for Bell's palsy, to improve the quality of care and outcomes for patients with Bell's palsy, and to decrease harmful variations in the evaluation and management of Bell's palsy. This guideline addresses these needs by encouraging accurate and efficient diagnosis and treatment and, when applicable, facilitating patient follow-up to address the management of long-term sequelae or evaluation of new or worsening symptoms not indicative of Bell's palsy. The guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with Bell's palsy. The target population is inclusive of both adults and children presenting with Bell's palsy. ACTION STATEMENTS: The development group made a strong recommendation that (a) clinicians should assess the patient using history and physical examination to exclude identifiable causes of facial paresis or paralysis in patients presenting with acute-onset unilateral facial paresis or paralysis, (b) clinicians should prescribe oral steroids within 72 hours of symptom onset for Bell's palsy patients 16 years and older, (c) clinicians should not prescribe oral antiviral therapy alone for patients with new-onset Bell's palsy, and (d) clinicians should implement eye protection for Bell's palsy patients with impaired eye closure. The panel made recommendations that (a) clinicians should not obtain routine laboratory testing in patients with new-onset Bell's palsy, (b) clinicians should not routinely perform diagnostic imaging for patients with new-onset Bell's palsy, (c) clinicians should not perform electrodiagnostic testing in Bell's palsy patients with incomplete facial paralysis, and (d) clinicians should reassess or refer to a facial nerve specialist those Bell's palsy patients with (1) new or worsening neurologic findings at any point, (2) ocular symptoms developing at any point, or (3) incomplete facial recovery 3 months after initial symptom onset. The development group provided the following options: (a) clinicians may offer oral antiviral therapy in addition to oral steroids within 72 hours of symptom onset for patients with Bell's palsy, and (b) clinicians may offer electrodiagnostic testing to Bell's palsy patients with complete facial paralysis. The development group offered the following no recommendations: (a) no recommendation can be made regarding surgical decompression for patients with Bell's palsy, (b) no recommendation can be made regarding the effect of acupuncture in patients with Bell's palsy, and (c) no recommendation can be made regarding the effect of physical therapy in patients with Bell's palsy.

Data management

All study data will be captured on study specific case report forms recorded from the participants medical notes (source data) or parental/participant questionnaires (source data) and will be entered into and stored in a single password protected online REDCap database with data entry conducted at each site. Hard copy participant data at each site will be stored in locked cabinets. REDCap is hosted by MCRI. Information will be stored and retained according to local and government regulations.

Data monitoring

The Chief Principal Investigator (PI) or designee will conduct site visits in order to review a selection of the database against source data, verify adherence to the protocol and confirm that research governance principles are being upheld. Data management of entered patients will be undertaken by the central data management team and reviewed for completion.

Safety

Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient enrolled into this study regardless of its causal relationship to study treatment will be recorded. Conditions that are present at screening and do not deteriorate will not be considered adverse events (AEs). The parent/guardian/participant will be asked to report AE when contacted at 14 days and at the 1 month follow up visit. In addition, AEs noted during the visit or noted from any other documentation (e.g. hospital unit record and correspondence) will be documented on the CRF by the investigator team.

The site PI is responsible for recording and reporting all serious adverse events (SAEs) for the period from the first dose until the 1 month visit. Any SAE occurring in a study participant will be reported to the approving Human Research and Ethics Committee (HREC) in accordance with the safety reporting policy of the HREC (this timeframe is usually between 24 and 72 hours). A suspected unexpected serious adverse event will in addition be reported to the national government regulatory body (Australia or New Zealand) within the required timelines.

### Bell's palsy [^116itkA1]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bell's palsy is characterised by an acute, unilateral, partial or complete paralysis of the face, which may occur with mild pain, numbness, increased sensitivity to sound, and altered taste. Bell's palsy remains idiopathic, but a proportion may be caused by reactivation of herpes viruses from cranial nerve ganglia. Bell's palsy is most common in people aged 15–40 years, affecting 1 in 60 in their lifetime. Most make a spontaneous recovery within 1 month, but up to 30% have delayed or incomplete recovery.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments in adults and children? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to February 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found eight systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antiviral treatment, corticosteroids (alone or plus antiviral treatment), facial nerve decompression surgery, and mime therapy.

### Risk factors associated with Bell's palsy: a real-world analysis of 281, 600 patients [^111Ake6U]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Other factors are hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, pregnancy, immunogenic dysregulation, genetics, as well as sociodemographic factors such as age, gender, consanguineous parents. The abundance of potential influencing factors suggests a multifactorial genesis. This is underscored by the variability in incidence rates across different regions and populations.

Consequently, this may explain the inconsistency in existing studies regarding the relevance of pregnancy, age, and gender, requiring large sample sizes to reduce the risk of overfitting and allow the identification of actual risk factors rather than random noise.

Therefore, this study aimed to challenge the previous reports and to uncover new risks or protective factors for BP using a real‐world approach.

### Evidence-based guideline update: steroids and antivirals for Bell palsy: report of the guideline development subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^112m58i6]. Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Bell palsy — recommendations for future research: It is unlikely that additional research regarding the efficacy of steroids will change the current estimate of its effect, and large randomized trials comparing outcomes in patients with Bell palsy receiving steroids with or without antivirals would help in determining whether the addition of antivirals to steroid treatment results in a modest benefit. Such trials should be powered to allow pre-specified subgroup analyses, and further research efforts should be directed toward determining the optimal dose and timing of steroids, the effect of other therapeutic modalities, and the identification of the effect of steroids in specific populations, such as in children.

Sequelae and eye care — there are both short- and long-term sequelae of Bell's palsy, including an inability to close the eye, drying and corneal ulceration of the eye, and vision loss, and these can be prevented with appropriate eye care; short-term sequelae such as inability to close the eye and drying of the eye warrant careful management with potentially favorable results, whereas long-term disfigurement due to incomplete recovery can have devastating effects on psychological well-being and quality of life.

### Risk factors associated with Bell's palsy: a real-world analysis of 281, 600 patients [^112i8KvZ]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Although the overall prevalence of BP is similar in men and women, BP has repeatedly been associated with pregnancy. Recent publications highlight the limitation of data and therefore the evidence available addressing this topic, while some emphasize that pregnancy was associated with worse prognosis. This is mostly based on the findings by Phillips et al. and Gillman et al. who demonstrated that pregnant women had worse long‐term facial function outcomes in the eFACE and were more likely to develop complete facial paralysis, respectively. According to these authors, the cautious prescription of pharmacological treatments such as glucosteroids in pregnant women might be accountable. This assumption was challenged by Gaudin et al. who found that even with steroid treatment, pregnant women had worse outcomes compared to nonpregnant controls. Another publication mentions recovery rates of 93% in pregnant women, though these findings are limited by a 30% dropout rate. In any case, it is striking that conditions coinciding with pregnancy, such as hypertension and diabetes, are significantly associated with BP in nonpregnant cohorts as well. This might explain why especially the third trimester, which is associated with the highest prevalence of these risk factors, seems to bear a higher risk for the development of BP. Our data therefore suggest that pregnancy may not be an independent risk factor. However, certain consequences, side effects, or complications during pregnancy might be the reason for the inconsistent data found in the literature. Considering that aside from hormonal and metabolic changes, pregnancy is associated with a special immunological situation manifesting as periodontal disease. As discussed previously in the context of depressive disorder, immunologic imbalance might be a potential factor in the development of BP.

Consequently, pregnancy‐associated diseases and risk factors need clinical and scientific consideration.

This study has several limitations. First, the use of a large patient database such as TriNetX may introduce unexpected associations and selection bias. Second, the temporal relationship between diagnoses could not be fully resolved, limiting the ability to distinguish cause from effect. It is also crucial to emphasize that the associations identified in this study should not be interpreted as evidence of causation. Additionally, the TriNetX database lacks information on the time interval between injury and treatment, which may introduce an unaccounted confounding variable. Finally, due to the retrospective design, only inpatients were included, possibly excluding milder outpatient cases and thereby introducing severity‐related selection bias. Despite these limitations, this study provides valuable real‐world data and supports the need for further prospective studies investigating specific risk factors, therapeutic approaches, and long‐term outcomes in Bell's palsy.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^115kyzeQ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — acupuncture use is supported by small randomized controlled trials but the guideline development group (GDG) could make no recommendation due to study quality and uncertain benefit-harm balance; a systematic review included 6 RCTs with a total of 537 participants, and meta-analyses reported a 7% higher recovery rate for acupuncture alone versus medical therapy and an 11% higher recovery rate for acupuncture plus medical therapy versus medical therapy alone, yet the GDG notes methodological flaws and states these trials do not permit reliable conclusions, and as a result the GDG was unable to determine the ratio of benefit to harm and therefore could make no recommendation regarding the use of acupuncture. In the Chen review, four RCTs compared acupuncture with medication, while 2 compared acupuncture with manipulation and physical therapy, and identified risks, harms, and costs include cost of acupuncture therapy, time required for therapy, therapy side effects, and delay in instituting steroid therapy. Safety data indicate that prospective European studies estimate mild acupuncture-related adverse events at 6.7% to 15%, while 2 observational studies estimate serious adverse events between 0.024% and 2.2%. Preference-sensitive decision-making is emphasized as the role of patient preferences is Large, and differences of opinion were Major with the GDG divided regarding whether to recommend against acupuncture or to make no recommendation.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy executive summary [^114oshwv]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) has published a supplement to this issue featuring the new Clinical Practice Guideline: Bell's Palsy. To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 11 recommendations developed encourage accurate and efficient diagnosis and treatment and, when applicable, facilitate patient follow-up to address the management of long-term sequelae or evaluation of new or worsening symptoms not indicative of Bell's palsy. There are myriad treatment options for Bell's palsy; some controversy exists regarding the effectiveness of several of these options, and there are consequent variations in care. In addition, there are numerous diagnostic tests available that are used in the evaluation of patients with Bell's palsy. Many of these tests are of questionable benefit in Bell's palsy. Furthermore, while patients with Bell's palsy enter the health care system with facial paresis/paralysis as a primary complaint, not all patients with facial paresis/paralysis have Bell's palsy. It is a concern that patients with alternative underlying etiologies may be misdiagnosed or have an unnecessary delay in diagnosis. All of these quality concerns provide an important opportunity for improvement in the diagnosis and management of patients with Bell's palsy.

### Surgical interventions for the early management of Bell's palsy [^1169YnD6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Bell's palsy is an acute paralysis of one side of the face of unknown aetiology. Bell's palsy should only be used as a diagnosis in the absence of all other pathology. As the proposed pathophysiology is swelling and entrapment of the nerve, some surgeons suggest surgical decompression of the nerve as a possible management option.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of surgery in the management of Bell's palsy and to compare this to outcomes of medical management.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (23 November 2010). We also searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (23 November in The Cochrane Library, Issue 4 2010). We adapted this strategy to search MEDLINE (January 1966 to November 2010) and EMBASE (January 1980 to November 2010).

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials involving any surgical intervention for Bell's palsy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed whether trials identified from the search strategy were eligible for inclusion. Two review authors assessed trial quality and extracted data independently.

Main Results

Two trials with a total of 69 participants met the inclusion criteria. The first study considered the treatment of 403 patients but only included 44 in their surgical study. These were randomised into a surgical and non surgical group. The second study had 25 participants which they randomly allocated into surgical or control groups. The nerves of all the surgical group participants in both studies were decompressed using a retroauricular approach. The primary outcome was recovery of facial palsy at 12 months. The first study showed that both the operated and non operated groups had comparable facial nerve recovery at nine months. This study did not statistically compare the groups but the scores and size of the groups suggested that statistically significant differences are unlikely. The second study reported no statistically significant differences between their operated and control groups. One operated patient in the first study had 20 dB sensorineural hearing loss and persistent vertigo.

Authors' Conclusions

There is only very low quality evidence from randomised controlled trials and this is insufficient to decide whether surgical intervention is beneficial or harmful in the management of Bell's palsy. Further research into the role of surgical intervention is unlikely to be performed because spontaneous recovery occurs in most cases.

### Antiviral treatment for Bell's palsy (idiopathic facial paralysis) [^113rL6V2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids are widely used in the treatment of idiopathic facial paralysis (Bell's palsy), but the effectiveness of additional treatment with an antiviral agent is uncertain. This review was first published in 2001 and most recently updated in 2015. Since a significant benefit of corticosteroids for the early management of Bell's palsy has been demonstrated, the main focus of this update, as in the previous version, was to determine the effect of adding antivirals to corticosteroid treatment. We undertook this update to integrate additional evidence and to better assess the robustness of findings, taking risk of bias fully into account.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antiviral treatments alone or in combination with any other therapy for Bell's palsy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS in July 2019. We reviewed the bibliographies of the identified trials and contacted trial authors to identify additional published or unpublished data. We searched clinical trials registries for ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of antivirals with and without corticosteroids versus control therapies for the treatment of Bell's palsy. We excluded trials that followed-up participants for less than three months.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently assessed trials for relevance, eligibility, and risk of bias, using standard Cochrane procedures. We performed sensitivity analyses excluding trials at high or unclear risk of bias in at least five domains, and reported these data as the primary analyses.

Main Results

Fourteen trials, including 2488 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Most were small, and most were at high or unclear risk of bias in multiple domains. We included four new studies at this update. Incomplete recoveryA combination of antivirals and corticosteroids may have little or no effect on rates of incomplete recovery in people with Bell's palsy compared to corticosteroids alone (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.74; 3 trials, N = 766; random-effects; low-certainty evidence). We excluded 10 trials that were at high or unclear risk of bias in several domains from this analysis and limited all analyses to studies at lower risk of bias. Recovery rates were better in participants receiving corticosteroids alone than antivirals alone (RR 2.69, 95% CI 0.73 to 10.01; 2 trials, N = 667; random-effects), but the result was imprecise and allowed for the possibility of no effect. The rate of incomplete recovery was lower with antivirals plus corticosteroids than with placebo or no treatment (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.76; 2 trials, N = 658; random-effects). Antivirals alone had no clear effect on incomplete recovery rates compared with placebo, but the result was imprecise (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.40; 2 trials, N = 658; fixed-effect). For people with severe Bell's palsy (House-Brackmann score of 5 and 6, or equivalent on other scales), we found that the combination of antivirals and corticosteroids had no clear effect on incomplete recovery at month six compared to corticosteroids alone, although the result was again imprecise (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.17; 2 trials, N = 98; random-effects). Motor synkinesis or crocodile tearsAntivirals plus corticosteroids reduced the proportion of participants who experienced these long-term sequelae from Bell's palsy compared to placebo plus corticosteroids (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87; 2 trials, N = 469; fixed-effect; moderate-certainty evidence). Antivirals plus corticosteroids reduced long-term sequelae compared to placebo but there was no clear difference in this outcome with antivirals alone compared to placebo. Adverse events Adverse event data were available in four studies providing data on 1592 participants. None of the four comparisons showed clear differences in adverse events between treatment and comparison arms (very low-certainty evidence); for the comparison of antivirals plus corticosteroids and corticosteroids alone in studies at lower risk of bias, the RR was 1.17 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.69; 2 trials, N = 656; fixed-effect; very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The combination of antivirals and corticosteroids may have little or no effect on rates of incomplete recovery in comparison to corticosteroids alone in Bell's palsy of various degrees of severity, or in people with severe Bell's palsy, but the results were very imprecise. Corticosteroids alone were probably more effective than antivirals alone and antivirals plus corticosteroids were more effective than placebo or no treatment. There was no clear benefit from antivirals alone over placebo. The combination of antivirals and corticosteroids probably reduced the late sequelae of Bell's palsy compared with corticosteroids alone. Studies also showed fewer episodes of long-term sequelae in corticosteroid-treated participants than antiviral-treated participants. We found no clear difference in adverse events from the use of antivirals compared with either placebo or corticosteroids, but the evidence is too uncertain for us to draw conclusions. An adequately powered RCT in people with Bell's palsy that compares different antiviral agents may be indicated.

### Antivirals for Bell's palsy? [^1142AdT7]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2013). Low credibility.

Each year in the UK around 1 in 5,000 people develop Bell's palsy-idiopathic unilateral lower motor neurone facial weakness of rapid onset. Although about 70% recover spontaneously, the remaining 30% are at risk of complications;(1) 13% have residual slight weakness and about 16% have persistent moderate to severe weakness if not treated.(2) As we have discussed in two previous articles there has been longstanding controversy about the best form of treatment.(2,3) In 2006 we concluded that published trials on the efficacy of drug treatments have been poor and no firm conclusions can be drawn about the benefit of any single drug;(2) in 2008 we noted that evidence suggests oral prednisolone started within 72 hours of symptom onset makes recovery more likely and that there was little good evidence that an antiviral drug helps.(3) The place of antivirals in the management of Bell's palsy remains a controversial issue. In this article we review the evidence for antiviral therapy alone or in conjunction with corticosteroid treatment.

Bell's palsy — research needs and trial priorities include the following: Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) recommendations should be followed in all randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with evaluation of patients before, during, immediately after, and months later and collection of quality-of-life data; the timing and outcomes for patients with and without surgical facial nerve decompression need to be compared, including surgical approach (ie, middle fossa), age (young vs old), and time to improvement compared with traditional medical management groups (ie, steroids and/or antivirals); future clinical trials should compare eye care tactics; the benefits and risks of steroid use in children with Bell's palsy need to be better elucidated; further study is needed to compare concurrent combined steroids and antiviral therapy with designs allowing subgroup analysis; more rigorous randomized controlled trials are needed to address the effectiveness of acupuncture; and the efficacy of different physical therapy modalities on asymmetry, symmetry of voluntary movement, and synkinesis needs to be elucidated.

### Bilateral Bell palsy as a presenting sign of preeclampsia [^114kXgBa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Bell palsy is a facial nerve neuropathy that is a rare disorder but occurs at higher frequency in pregnancy. Almost 30% of cases are associated with preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. Bilateral Bell palsy occurs in only 0.3%-2.0% of cases of facial paralysis, has a poorer prognosis for recovery, and may be associated with a systemic disorder.

Case

We describe a case of a 24-year-old primigravid woman with a twin gestation at 35 weeks diagnosed initially with bilateral facial palsy and subsequently with preeclampsia. She then developed partial hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome, prompting the diagnosis of severe preeclampsia, and was delivered.

Conclusion

Bilateral facial palsy is a rare entity in pregnancy that may be the first sign of preeclampsia and suggests increased severity of disease, warranting close monitoring.

Bell's palsy — physical therapy: No recommendation can be made regarding the effect of physical therapy in Bell's palsy patients, and Policy level: No recommendation. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade D, Level of confidence in evidence: Low, due to significant flaws in existing trials, and Benefit-harm assessment: Equilibrium of benefit and harm. Supporting text notes there was no significant difference in clinical outcomes between rehabilitation techniques; a Cochrane review concluded that no treatment produced significantly more improvement than untreated controls; risks were not identified; there is no evidence to support benefit or harm of physical therapy as a treatment; and the lack of standardized therapy modalities and protocols hampers the ability to make a recommendation.

Bell's palsy in children — use of steroids: Information is limited because children were excluded from most treatment trials of new-onset Bell's palsy, and several studies indicate that prognosis of untreated Bell's palsy in children is better than adults; therefore, the potential benefit of corticosteroid treatment is inconclusive. Compelling data are lacking for steroid use in children, and the need for steroid treatment is unclear. The GDG identified 2 systematic reviews/meta-analyses addressing oral corticosteroid use in children; one systematic review found no controlled trials and concluded the evidence for steroid use in children is inconclusive, and another review including patients younger than 16 years concluded there was no firm evidence for the routine use of steroids in children with new-onset Bell's palsy.

### Towards evidence-based emergency medicine: best BETs from the manchester royal infirmary. BET 2: treatment of Bell's palsy: should antiviral agents be added to prednisolone? [^113XTwfo]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

A short-cut review was carried out to establish whether Bell's palsy is best treated with a combination of prednisolone and an antiviral agent or prednisolone alone. Four systematic reviews and two small studies were directly relevant to the question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of these papers are tabulated. The clinical bottom line is that there is insufficient evidence to recommend an antiviral agent in addition to prednisolone in the treatment of Bell's palsy.

### Incomplete Bell's palsy following influenza vaccination in a 7-month-old [^112icRBt]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment/Management

There is no known preventative or curative treatment for Bell's palsy. The use of antiherpetic antivirals has fallen out of favor as previous studies have not demonstrated conclusive benefit. Several recent studies have supported the continued use of corticosteroids for improved recovery rates of facial nerve function in adults. Data from pediatric studies have been less conclusive with several demonstrating no clear difference in recovery rates for children treated with corticosteroids compared with no treatment. Fortunately, the prognosis for children with Bell's palsy is excellent; multiple studies report greater than 95% of affected individuals will achieve complete facial nerve function recovery within 3 months. The recurrence risk is commonly reported to be between 5% and 10%.

Bell's palsy — clinical overview from the abstract describes that Bell's palsy is the most common acute mono-neuropathy and the most common diagnosis associated with facial nerve weakness/paralysis; it is a rapid unilateral facial nerve paresis (weakness) or paralysis (complete loss of movement) of unknown cause that leads to partial or complete inability to voluntarily move facial muscles on the affected side; although typically self-limited, it may cause significant temporary oral incompetence and inability to close the eye with potential eye injury; many available diagnostic tests are of questionable benefit, and misdiagnosis or unnecessary delay in diagnosis are concerns.

Bell palsy — treatment recommendations: For patients with new-onset Bell palsy, oral steroids should be offered to increase the probability of recovery of facial nerve function (Level A). For patients with new-onset Bell palsy, antivirals (in addition to steroids) might be offered to increase the probability of recovery of facial function (Level C). Patients offered antivirals should be counseled that a benefit from antivirals has not been established, and, if there is a benefit, it is likely that it is modest at best (RD < 7%).

### Bell's palsy syndrome: mimics and chameleons [^116SeRq3]. Practical Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

In this article we will explore the mimics and chameleons of Bell's palsy and in addition argue that we should use the term 'Bell's palsy syndrome' to help guide clinical reasoning when thinking about patients with facial weakness. The diagnosis of Bell's palsy can usually be made on clinical grounds without the need for further investigations. This is because the diagnosis is not one of exclusion (despite this being commonly how it is described), a lower motor neurone facial weakness where all alternative causes have been eliminated, but rather a positive recognition of a clinical syndrome, with a number of exclusions, which are described below. This perhaps would be more accurately referred to a 'Bell's palsy syndrome'. Treatment with corticosteroids improves outcome; adding an antiviral probably reduces the rates of long-term complications.

Bell palsy — overall effect of antivirals: For patients with acute-onset Bell palsy, it is highly likely that antivirals do not moderately (RD > 7%) increase the likelihood of improved facial functional recovery (2 Class I studies). The pooled results of studies with a low risk of bias lack the statistical precision to exclude a modest benefit (RD favoring antivirals ≤ 7%) or modest harm (RD favoring steroids alone ≤ 8%).

### Should children with Bell's palsy be treated with corticosteroids? A systematic review [^112nLceM]. Journal of Child Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of corticosteroids in the treatment of pediatric Bell's palsy. A systematic review of trials that included pediatric (< 16 years old) cases with Bell's palsy and involved the use of steroids was conducted. Eight trials were identified, five of which were randomized, and prednisone was used in six trials, whereas corticotropin was used in the other two. The methods of randomization and allocation concealment of the treatments used were rarely reported. Only one trial was done exclusively in children; none of the other seven trials analyzed the pediatric cases separately. Four trials reported some benefit from steroids. The pediatric trial did not provide evidence for benefit from corticosteroids. There was substantial heterogeneity in the population and interventions used; hence a meta-analysis was not done. Based on this systematic review, we do not recommend the routine use of steroids in children with Bell's palsy.

Table 1 definitions — key terminology for Bell's palsy is standardized as follows: Acute is defined as occurring in less than 72 hours. Bell's palsy is acute unilateral facial nerve paresis or paralysis with onset in less than 72 hours and without identifiable cause. Electromyography (EMG) testing is a needle electrode study that records spontaneous depolarizations and responses to voluntary muscle contraction. Electroneuronography (ENoG) testing is a surface electrode study to examine facial nerve integrity by recording electrical depolarization of facial muscles following electrical stimulation of the facial nerve. Facial paralysis is complete inability to move the face, whereas facial paresis is incomplete ability to move the face. Idiopathic denotes without identifiable cause.

Bell palsy guideline analytic process and outcome definitions — Studies were included if they assessed facial functional outcomes after at least 3 months of follow-up in at least 20 patients with new-onset Bell palsy in controlled trials comparing steroids or antiviral agents with no such medications. Outcomes used the House–Brackmann grading, defining good recovery as grade I or II and complete recovery as grade I. Effect size was the risk difference (RD) with 95% confidence intervals, and an RD ≥ 10% was considered clinically meaningful. The search spanned Medline and the Cochrane databases from June 2000 through January 2012 and yielded 340 citations; 38 full texts were reviewed and 9 articles met inclusion criteria.

### Clinical practice guidelines in idiopathic facial paralysis: systematic review using the appraisal of guidelines for research and evaluation (AGREE II) instrument [^113ZxCoa]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy, or idiopathic facial paralysis, is a peripheral facial palsy of unknown cause that presents as sudden, unilateral weakness of the muscles of the face. Prompt treatment of Bell's palsy is critical in order for patients to achieve complete recovery of facial function. Delays in diagnosis and management can result in permanent facial defects. A number of clinical practice guidelines (CPG) exist to guide clinical decision-making in patients presenting with idiopathic facial paralysis. However, to date, there has been no comprehensive review of the methodological rigor and quality of these CPGs. Thus, the objective of the authors is to appraise the existing CPGs to ensure safe and effective practices. A total of eight guidelines met the inclusion criteria and were appraised. Only two CPGs achieved an overall rating of 'High', having five or more quality domains scoring > 60%. Across the CPGs, the domains of rigor of development, stakeholder involvement, and applicability has the lowest overall scores with 48.1%, 43.9%, and 43.1%, respectively. Based on the AGREE II instrument, the methodological rigor and quality of CPGs for Bell's palsy is low to average. In particular, future guidelines for Bell's palsy should look to the quality domains of rigor of development, stakeholder involvement, and applicability as the greatest opportunities for improvement.

### The etiology of Bell's palsy: a review [^116En9mK]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy is the most common condition involving a rapid and unilateral onset of peripheral paresis/paralysis of the seventh cranial nerve. It affects 11.5–53.3 per 100,000 individuals a year across different populations. Bell's palsy is a health issue causing concern and has an extremely negative effect on both patients and their families. Therefore, diagnosis and prompt cause determination are key for early treatment. However, the etiology of Bell's palsy is unclear, and this affects its treatment. Thus, it is critical to determine the causes of Bell's palsy so that targeted treatment approaches can be developed and employed. This article reviews the literature on the diagnosis of Bell's palsy and examines possible etiologies of the disorder. It also suggests that the diagnosis of idiopathic facial palsy is based on exclusion and is most often made based on five factors including anatomical structure, viral infection, ischemia, inflammation, and cold stimulation responsivity.

Introduction

Bell's palsy is characterised by an acute, unilateral, partial, or complete paralysis of the face. Bell's palsy occurs in a lower motor neurone pattern. The weakness may be partial or complete, and may be associated with mild pain, numbness, increased sensitivity to sound, and altered taste. Bell's palsy is idiopathic, but a proportion of cases may be caused by re-activation of herpes virus at the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve. Bell's palsy is most common in people aged 15 to 40 years, with a 1 in 60 lifetime risk. Most people make a spontaneous recovery within 1 month, but up to 30% show delayed or incomplete recovery.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of drug treatments for Bell's palsy in adults and children? What are the effects of physical treatments for Bell's palsy in adults and children? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 13 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antiviral treatment, corticosteroids (alone or with antiviral treatment), hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and facial re-training.

### The benefits of steroids versus steroids plus antivirals for treatment of Bell's palsy: a meta-analysis [^1174wP8k]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and weaknesses of study

A key strength of our meta-analysis is the inclusion of high quality randomised controlled trials. Non-randomised trials have been published on the topic of antivirals in Bell's palsy; however, one should be guarded in making final conclusions from these studies given the limitations of the study design. Despite other meta-analyses being performed on the treatment of Bell's palsy, our meta-analysis is the first to define whether the addition of antivirals provides any benefit over treatment with steroids alone. We purposely used a random effects model owing to our concerns about study heterogeneity and performed several subgroup analyses in an attempt to characterise the potential causes of heterogeneity. Furthermore, we accounted for publication bias.

Our meta-analysis has some limitations. The Adour et al study did not report intention to treat analyses; therefore, we used the number of patients at final follow-up as our denominator, as these data were available for all studies. However, even when the Adour et al study was removed from the analysis of intention to treat data, the confidence interval of our pooled odds ratio still crossed 1 (odds ratio 1.20, 95% confidence interval 0.93 to 1.56; P = 0.163). In addition, when the three unaccounted lost to follow-up patients from the Adour et al study were added to either arm, our primary finding did not notably change. Our subgroup analyses are limited by the small number of included studies and thus may lack statistical power. However, this was not the case in our subgroup analysis of studies that included patients who presented within three days of symptom onset. Finally, three prospective randomised studies were not included in this meta-analysis as they analysed time to recovery, and the number of patients in each arm was not reported in one such study. In addition, we were unable to obtain the necessary raw data from the investigators leading each of these studies. However, none of these three studies showed a significant benefit of combination therapy over steroids alone. In fact, in the largest of these, the mean time to recovery was shorter in patients on steroids alone (70.7 days) compared with those on combination therapy (76.4 days), although this difference was not significant (P = 0.977).

Propensity score matching resulted in two homogenous cohorts of about 140,800 patients in each cohort, with a mean age ± standard deviation of 55.1 ± 20.7 years and 53% females.

Risk analyses revealed significantly elevated risks for herpes (OR (95% confidence interval [CI]): 6.49 [5.96, 70.5]) (Figure 2), diabetes (OR: 2.4 [CI: 2.36, 2.46]) (Figure 3), and depression (OR: 2.05 [CI: 2.0, 2.1]) (Figure 4). However, the risk analysis yielded a significant negative correlation of BP for pregnancy (OR: 0.76 [CI: 0.73, 0.78]) (Figure 5).

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^1122NsMc]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — imaging indications and modality: Routine imaging at the time of initial diagnosis is discouraged, but there is a distinct role for imaging when suggestive history or physical findings are present or if paralysis fails to recover or worsens; any presentation inconsistent with Bell's palsy should be further evaluated by imaging. Features atypical of Bell's palsy include a second paralysis on the same side, paralysis of isolated facial nerve branches, other cranial nerve involvement, or no sign of recovery after 3 months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the entire facial nerve course, with and without contrast, is the imaging test of choice in these circumstances; imaging should include the internal auditory canal (IAC) and face, and if MRI is contraindicated, a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) can be used.

### Bell's palsy [^111zUbej]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bell's palsy is characterised by an acute, unilateral, partial, or complete paralysis of the face (i.e., lower motor neurone pattern). The weakness may be partial (paresis) or complete (paralysis), and may be associated with mild pain, numbness, increased sensitivity to sound, and altered taste. Bell's palsy remains idiopathic, but a proportion of cases may be caused by reactivation of herpes viruses from the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve. Bell's palsy is most common in people aged 15 to 40 years, with a 1 in 60 lifetime risk. Most make a spontaneous recovery within 1 month, but up to 30% show delayed or incomplete recovery.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments in adults and children? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically. Please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 14 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antiviral treatment, corticosteroids (alone or plus antiviral treatment), hyperbaric oxygen therapy, facial nerve decompression surgery, and facial retraining.

### Antiviral treatment of Bell's palsy based on baseline severity: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116YHBex]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of antiviral agents on complete recovery of Bell's palsy.

Methods

We searched CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and sources of unpublished literature to November 1, 2014. Primary and secondary outcomes were complete and satisfactory recovery, respectively. To evaluate statistical heterogeneity, we performed subgroup analysis of baseline severity of Bell's palsy and between-study sensitivity analyses based on risk of allocation and detection bias.

Results

The 10 included randomized controlled trials (2419 patients; 807 with severe Bell's palsy at onset) had variable risk of bias, with 9 trials having a high risk of bias in at least 1 domain. Complete recovery was not statistically significantly greater with antiviral use versus no antiviral use in the random-effects meta-analysis of 6 trials (relative risk, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.97–1.16; I(2) = 65%). Conversely, random-effects meta-analysis of 9 trials showed a statistically significant difference in satisfactory recovery (relative risk, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.18; I(2) = 63%). Response to antiviral agents did not differ visually or statistically between patients with severe symptoms at baseline and those with milder disease (test for interaction, P = .11). Sensitivity analyses did not show a clear effect of bias on outcomes.

Conclusions

Antiviral agents are not efficacious in increasing the proportion of patients with Bell's palsy who achieved complete recovery, regardless of baseline symptom severity.

Bell palsy antivirals plus steroids versus steroids alone — Class I and Class II controlled studies compare patients treated with antiviral agents and steroids relative to steroids alone and report risk difference (RD) outcomes. In Engström 2008, RD good recovery (CI) was 15% (8%–21%). In Sullivan 2007, RD complete recovery (CI) was 12.8% (7.2%–18.6%). RD is defined as risk difference, with positive values results favoring steroids.

### Bell's palsy [^112aibLo]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Bell's palsy is unilateral, acute onset facial paralysis that is a common condition. One in every 65 people experiences Bell's palsy in the course of their lifetime. The majority of patients afflicted with this idiopathic disorder recover facial function. Initial treatment involves oral corticosteroids, possible antiviral drugs, and protection of the eye from desiccation. A small subset of patients may be left with incomplete recovery, synkinesis, facial contracture, or hemifacial spasm. A combination of medical and surgical treatment options exist to treat the long-term sequelae of Bell's palsy.

### Evidence-based guideline update: steroids and antivirals for Bell palsy: report of the guideline development subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^112tGCs5]. Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Bell palsy — clinical context for steroid use and timing: Although there is strong evidence that steroid use increases the probability of good facial functional recovery in patients with Bell palsy, it does not necessarily follow that all patients with Bell palsy need to take steroids. For example, it would be reasonable for a clinician to opt not to use steroids in a patient with brittle diabetes mellitus, and because the studies included only patients presenting early after palsy onset, it is difficult to determine the effect of steroid or antiviral treatment in patients presenting later in the course of their illness (e.g., 1 week after the onset of facial weakness).

### New concepts in Bell's palsy improve treatment options… [^1124a82B]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Bell's palsy affects about one in 60 persons and has an annual incidence of around 20 per 100, 000 persons. Overall, the condition is most common in persons 15 to 45 years of age, but the incidence is particularly high in pregnant women. Holland and Weiner outlined recent developments concerning the management of Bell's palsy. Approximately 75 percent of patients recover fully from Bell's palsy, and 10 percent have minor sequelae. About one sixth of patients have residual moderate to severe weakness, contracture, spasm, or synkinesis. In patients who do not receive treatment, most improvement occurs within three weeks. Additional improvement is delayed for the four to six months required for nerve regeneration. Although prognosis cannot be predicted accurately, factors associated with poor outcome have been identified in. the accompanying table. The goals of treatment are to accelerate recovery and prevent or minimize complications.

Patients may require considerable reassurance and support during this illness. The eye should be protected from drying by hourly use of lubricating drops while awake and eye ointment at night. Massage, facial exercises, and biofeedback can contribute to improvement but have not been studied extensively. Steroids have been shown to increase the proportion of patients with good outcome by 17 percent if used within seven days of symptom onset. Antiviral agents, such as acyclovir, are increasingly recommended in combination with steroids because of the accumulating evidence of a viral etiology of Bell's palsy. Because acyclovir has low bioavailability, studies are focusing on valacyclovir and famciclovir. One prospective controlled study showed enhanced recovery when valacyclovir was combined with prednisone. The effect was particularly noticeable in older patients. Ideally, patients should begin treatment within 72 hours of symptom onset.

Surgical decompression is reserved for rare cases because of danger of adverse effects. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. The authors conclude that patients with Bell's palsy should begin treatment immediately and be referred to a subspecialist. Patients with significant sequelae should be referred for multidisciplinary management that could include injections of botulinum toxin, facial reanimation, and cosmetic surgery.
