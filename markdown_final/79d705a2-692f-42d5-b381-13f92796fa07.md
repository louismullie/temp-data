## Question

At what platelet count threshold should platelets be transfused?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking at what platelet count threshold platelets should be transfused. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core principle that thresholds are context-dependent. Then, I should verify prophylactic thresholds in hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia and how risk modifiers adjust them. Next, I will review procedure-specific thresholds, carefully checking conflicting data for central venous catheter placement and lumbar puncture. After that, I need to appraise targets during active bleeding, including trauma and DIC. Finally, I should consider special populations and practical algorithmic takeaways, while double-checking evidence quality and integrating alloimmunization considerations.

> Let me first confirm the overarching principle: platelet transfusion thresholds are not universal and must be individualized to the bleeding context, procedure type, patient population, and etiology of thrombocytopenia to balance bleeding risk against transfusion harms such as TACO, infection, and alloimmunization, with modern guidance moving toward restrictive use where safe [^111jFzqe] [^115wm2Gc].

> I will now examine prophylaxis in stable, non-bleeding patients with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia from chemotherapy or allogeneic transplant; the consistent, evidence-based threshold is to transfuse when platelets are less than 10×10⁹/L, and I should double-check that this is a strong recommendation with moderate-to-high certainty in AABB/ICTMG 2025 and supported by ASCO and AAFP, which it is [^1158C4Z4] [^111jFzqe] [^111WGgXs] [^113mBmQd] [^112YjEDC].

> Hold on, I should verify risk modifiers that justify slightly higher prophylactic thresholds; in patients with fever, sepsis, DIC, rapid platelet fall, hyperleukocytosis, anticoagulation, or splenomegaly, a 10–20×10⁹/L target can be reasonable, but I need to ensure this nuance is grounded in guidelines and expert reviews, which it is per ASCO 2018 and BCSH 2017, with mechanistic support from Hematology Education Program summaries [^111WGgXs] [^115FeBcE] [^114DaWY2].

> Let me consider chronic bone marrow failure where prophylaxis is often not beneficial; wait, I should verify whether a no-prophylaxis strategy is endorsed in asymptomatic patients and in nonbleeding adults undergoing ASCT or with aplastic anemia, which is indeed recommended by BCSH and AABB/ICTMG 2025, with individualized management if clinically significant bleeding occurs [^114K18LK] [^115mp7QT] [^notfound].

> Next, I should review stable, non-bleeding critically ill patients; evidence is limited and heterogeneous, but ACCP 2025 conditionally suggests transfusion in high-risk non-bleeding ICU patients when counts drop below 30–50×10⁹/L, and BCSH advises using reversible marrow failure thresholds as a guide while I remind myself that many ICU platelet transfusions at higher counts are often ineffectual or unnecessary in registry studies [^115EfdBM] [^111BTBwp] [^112bR3e6].

> Now for procedures; I need to check lumbar puncture carefully because historical teaching often used 50×10⁹/L. Hmm, wait a minute, that older 50×10⁹/L "rule" is not current for most adults without additional coagulopathy. The updated AABB/ICTMG 2025 guideline recommends transfusing for LP when platelets are less than 20×10⁹/L, while ACCP 2025 suggests considering 40–50×10⁹/L only for bedside LP in critically ill patients at higher risk; I should correct my initial assumption to reflect this modern, more restrictive approach [^115vYG7h] [^116o2iDh].

> Central venous catheter placement is contentious; let me first confirm that AABB/ICTMG 2025 suggests transfusing at counts ≤ 10×10⁹/L for compressible sites, but hold on, the NEJM 2023 RCT shows that in 10–50×10⁹/L thrombocytopenia, withholding prophylaxis before ultrasound-guided CVC increased grade 2–4 bleeding, so I should not overgeneralize a no-transfusion stance; risk must be stratified by site compressibility, ultrasound use, and baseline count, recognizing that prior guidance and Cochrane work highlighted low bleeding risk with ultrasound yet acknowledged uncertainty [^115wm2Gc] [^111Zhg8N] [^116ppfmV].

> For other procedures, I need to ensure I capture standard thresholds; most adult patients proceeding to surgery or childbirth are transfused if platelets are less than 50×10⁹/L, interventional radiology uses about 20×10⁹/L for low-risk and 50×10⁹/L for high-risk procedures, bone marrow aspiration/biopsy is generally safe down to less than 20×10⁹/L, and dentoalveolar surgery lacks robust evidence for a rigid 50×10⁹/L trigger supporting a more restrictive strategy where feasible [^112BXiUr] [^113NtYkN] [^116KLxny] [^112Ymab5].

> Turning to active bleeding, I should confirm targets scale with severity; for severe or life-threatening bleeding, especially CNS involvement or traumatic brain injury, targets of more than 100×10⁹/L are recommended, while in major hemorrhage without CNS injury, more than 50×10⁹/L is the typical goal; let me verify DIC guidance too, which aligns with maintaining more than 50×10⁹/L when bleeding, and I should not forget that for non-severe bleeding some guidance uses less than 30×10⁹/L as a reasonable trigger [^1152v2BJ] [^115yQYkK] [^114xycBk] [^116EPivo] [^116DnhBd].

> But wait, what if the bleeding is GI and portal hypertensive; I need to check whether routine platelets help, and ACCP 2025 suggests avoiding routine platelet transfusion in portal hypertension-related GI bleeding and exercising restraint during endoscopy unless thrombocytopenia is severe and contributory, reinforcing a restrictive approach [^115fcSEi].

> Next, I should review special populations; for neonates, I must confirm the PlaNeT-2 signal favoring a lower prophylactic threshold of about 25×10⁹/L because higher triggers worsened outcomes, which is reflected in AABB/ICTMG 2025 pediatric recommendations; for ITP, I should verify that prophylaxis is avoided and that platelets are reserved for life-threatening bleeding, typically combined with IVIG given rapid clearance of transfused platelets in immune destruction [^111jFzqe] [^117AV48T] [^113Pi2TL].

> Patients on antiplatelet agents raise a different question; hold on, I should verify whether to transfuse platelets in ICH when counts are adequate, and AABB/ICTMG 2025 advises against platelet transfusion in spontaneous or traumatic, non-operative ICH when the platelet count is at least 100×10⁹/L, with ESICM guidance supporting restrictive strategies in ICH patients on antiplatelets absent operative indications [^111Q2vdy] [^116DREub].

> I need to ensure I address platelet dose and refractoriness; standard adult dosing with one apheresis unit is adequate and higher doses do not improve bleeding outcomes, so I should avoid over-transfusion; if refractoriness occurs, let me consider HLA antibody–mediated mechanisms and confirm the role of HLA-matched or crossmatched platelets, recognizing practical constraints and variable outcome impact in the literature, and maintaining vigilance for nonimmune causes that blunt increments [^115wm2Gc] [^1137oACA] [^113ee6RA] [^117VFQHP].

> Next, I should review the strength of evidence and confirm the trend toward restriction; AABB/ICTMG 2025 synthesizes RCTs and observational data indicating that restrictive strategies likely do not increase mortality or bleeding across key populations, whereas many ICU recommendations remain low-certainty and conditional, reinforcing the need to individualize and avoid transfusion when benefit is uncertain [^111jFzqe] [^115JtQkf] [^115EfdBM].

> Finally, let me formulate a practical approach and double-check the thresholds: if there is active major bleeding, target more than 50×10⁹/L, and if CNS injury or TBI is present, target more than 100×10⁹/L; if an invasive procedure is planned, use procedure-specific floors such as 20×10⁹/L for LP, approximately 10–20×10⁹/L for compressible-site CVC under ultrasound with attention to the NEJM RCT signal, and 50×10⁹/L for most surgeries; if the patient is stable and non-bleeding with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia, use less than 10×10⁹/L as the default prophylactic trigger and adjust upward only for well-justified risk factors; in chronic marrow failure and select ASCT contexts, consider no prophylaxis unless bleeding occurs, and always reassess for alloimmunization or nonimmune refractoriness when increments are inadequate [^1152v2BJ] [^115yQYkK] [^115vYG7h] [^111Xkx4j] [^112BXiUr] [^1158C4Z4] [^111jFzqe] [^114K18LK] [^115mp7QT].

Platelet transfusion thresholds vary by clinical context: **< 10×10⁹/L for stable, non-bleeding patients with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia** [^1158C4Z4] [^112YjEDC]. For procedures, transfuse at **< 20×10⁹/L for lumbar puncture or low-risk interventional radiology** [^115vYG7h] [^113NtYkN] and **< 50×10⁹/L for major surgery, high-risk procedures, or active bleeding** [^113DJTxu] [^112BXiUr]. For neurosurgery, spinal surgery, or intracranial hemorrhage, maintain **> 100×10⁹/L** [^1152v2BJ]. In critically ill patients, use a restrictive strategy and avoid routine transfusion unless the bleeding risk is high [^115EfdBM].

---

## Prophylactic platelet transfusion thresholds

Prophylactic transfusions prevent spontaneous bleeding in thrombocytopenia; the usual threshold is **< 10×10⁹/L** for stable, non-bleeding patients with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia [^1158C4Z4] [^112YjEDC].

| **Clinical scenario** | **Platelet count threshold (×10⁹/l)** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Stable, non-bleeding patients with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia (chemotherapy, allo-SCT) | < 10 | Strong recommendation [^1158C4Z4] [^112YjEDC] |
| Chronic bone marrow failure (aplastic anemia, low-dose chemotherapy) | No prophylactic transfusion | Strong recommendation [^115mp7QT] [^114K18LK] |
| Additional bleeding risk factors (fever, sepsis, DIC, anticoagulation) | 10–20 | Consider higher threshold [^115FeBcE] [^114DaWY2] |

---

## Platelet transfusion thresholds for invasive procedures

Thresholds vary by procedural risk; use **procedure-specific thresholds** to balance bleeding risk against transfusion harms.

| **Procedure** | **Platelet count threshold (×10⁹/l)** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Lumbar puncture | < 20 | Strong recommendation [^115vYG7h] |
| Central venous catheter placement (compressible sites) | ≤ 10 | Strong recommendation [^111Xkx4j] |
| Interventional radiology (low-risk) | < 20 | Strong recommendation [^113NtYkN] |
| Interventional radiology (high-risk) | < 50 | Strong recommendation [^113NtYkN] |
| Major surgery or childbirth | < 50 | Strong recommendation [^112BXiUr] |
| Neurosurgery, spinal surgery, or intracranial hemorrhage | > 100 | Strong recommendation [^1152v2BJ] |

---

## Platelet transfusion thresholds for active bleeding

In active bleeding, maintain higher thresholds to preserve hemostasis; use **context-specific targets**.

| **Clinical scenario** | **Platelet count threshold (×10⁹/l)** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Severe active bleeding | > 50 | Strong recommendation [^113DJTxu] |
| Major hemorrhage (trauma, obstetrics) | > 50 | Strong recommendation [^114xycBk] |
| Traumatic brain injury or spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage | > 100 | Strong recommendation [^1152v2BJ] |

---

## Platelet transfusion thresholds in critically ill patients

In critically ill patients, adopt a restrictive strategy and avoid routine transfusion unless the bleeding risk is high; **individualize decisions by risk**.

| **Clinical scenario** | **Platelet count threshold (×10⁹/l)** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Non-bleeding critically ill patients | Restrictive strategy | Conditional recommendation |
| Critically ill patients with high bleeding risk | 30–50 | Conditional recommendation [^115EfdBM] |
| Critically ill patients undergoing bedside lumbar puncture | 40–50 | Conditional recommendation [^116o2iDh] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)**: Transfuse only for serious bleeding or urgent procedures when other treatments fail; usual thresholds may be unachievable [^113Pi2TL].
- **Platelet refractoriness**: Use HLA-matched or cross-matched platelets when available [^113ee6RA].
- **Antiplatelet therapy**: Avoid routine transfusion in non-massively bleeding patients on antiplatelet agents [^116DREub].

## Risks and benefits of platelet transfusion

Platelet transfusion lowers bleeding risk but carries risks (transfusion reactions, alloimmunization, infection, volume overload); **balance risks and benefits** [^112YjEDC] [^111A4LAh].

---

## Summary of platelet transfusion thresholds

| **Clinical scenario** | **Platelet count threshold (×10⁹/l)** |
|-|-|
| Stable, non-bleeding patients | < 10 |
| Lumbar puncture, low-risk procedures | < 20 |
| Major surgery, active bleeding | < 50 |
| Neurosurgery, intracranial hemorrhage | > 100 |

---

Platelet transfusion thresholds are context-specific; as a guide, use **< 10×10⁹/L for stable, non-bleeding patients**, **< 20×10⁹/L** for low-risk procedures, **< 50×10⁹/L** for major surgery or active bleeding, and **> 100×10⁹/L** for neurosurgery or intracranial hemorrhage.

### Platelet transfusion before CVC placement in patients with thrombocytopenia [^111Zhg8N]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Transfusion guidelines regarding platelet-count thresholds before the placement of a central venous catheter (CVC) offer conflicting recommendations because of a lack of good-quality evidence. The routine use of ultrasound guidance has decreased CVC-related bleeding complications.

- **Methods**: In a multicenter, randomized, controlled, noninferiority trial, we randomly assigned patients with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 10,000 to 50,000 per cubic millimeter) who were being treated on the hematology ward or in the intensive care unit to receive either one unit of prophylactic platelet transfusion or no platelet transfusion before ultrasound-guided CVC placement. The primary outcome was catheter-related bleeding of grade 2 to 4; a key secondary outcome was grade 3 or 4 bleeding. The noninferiority margin was an upper boundary of the 90% confidence interval of 3.5 for the relative risk.

- **Results**: We included 373 episodes of CVC placement involving 338 patients in the per-protocol primary analysis. Catheter-related bleeding of grade 2 to 4 occurred in 9 of 188 patients (4.8%) in the transfusion group and in 22 of 185 patients (11.9%) in the no-transfusion group (relative risk, 2.45; 90% confidence interval, 1.27 to 4.70). Catheter-related bleeding of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 4 of 188 patients (2.1%) in the transfusion group and in 9 of 185 patients (4.9%) in the no-transfusion group (relative risk, 2.43; 95% CI, 0.75 to 7.93). A total of 15 adverse events were observed; of these events, 13 were grade 3 catheter-related bleeding (4 in the transfusion group).

### Platelet transfusion practices in the ICU: Data from a large transfusion registry [^112bR3e6]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Platelet transfusions are commonly used in critically ill patients, but transfusion thresholds, count increments, and predictors of ineffectual transfusions remain unclear.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study included consecutive adult non-oncology patients who received platelet transfusions in ICUs at three Canadian academic hospitals between 2006 and 2015. Data were collected from a validated transfusion database. We determined independent predictors of ineffectual platelet transfusions, defined as transfusions that raised platelet counts by < 5 × 10⁹/L. Reasons for transfusion were adjudicated in a subgroup of patients who underwent transfusion despite normal platelet counts.

- **Results**: We identified 7,320 ICU admissions (n = 7,073 patients) during which 15,879 platelet transfusions were administered. Most admissions (78.7%) were for cardiac surgery. Based on 5,700 analyzable transfusions, the median pretransfusion platelet count was 87 × 10⁹/L (interquartile range [IQR], 57–130). The pretransfusion platelet count was ≥ 50 × 10⁹/L and ≥ 150 × 10⁹/L for 79.6% and 17.8% of transfusions, respectively. Reasons for transfusion despite a normal platelet count were active bleeding or surgery in patients receiving antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. The median platelet count increment was 23 × 10⁹/L (IQR, 7–44), and 21.8% of transfusions were ineffectual. ABO incompatibility, sepsis, liver disease, and red cell and cryoprecipitate transfusions were associated with a poor platelet count increment.

- **Conclusions**: Platelet transfusions were commonly used in the ICU setting, but many were found to be ineffective in significantly increasing platelet counts in patients with certain clinical conditions such as ABO incompatibility, sepsis, and liver disease.

### Platelet transfusion threshold in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding: A systematic review [^1144cfKJ]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

There exists uncertainty as to the optimal platelet values when managing patients with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. A systematic review was carried out to determine the optimal approach when managing patients with thrombocytopenia in the setting of nonvariceal upper GI bleeding.

- **Results**: Eighteen of 803 potential articles were selected and reviewed, including 4 randomized controlled trials and 6 cohort studies. The only empirical clinical data available pertained to the management of hematology or oncology patients. There was no high-level evidence that determined the proper threshold of platelet transfusion specifically in GI bleeding. We were, therefore, limited to including principally consensus opinions, recommendations, and guidelines for platelet transfusion triggers as they apply to the treatment (including prophylaxis) of bleeding in general, with a paucity of data addressing major bleeding, let alone bleeding from a gastroenterologic origin. Randomized clinical trials were individually underpowered in allowing definitive conclusions, even though resulting recommendations were supported by similarly underpowered retrospective and prospective observational studies.

- **Conclusions**: There exists a paucity of data to recommend optimal therapeutic platelet count targets in patients with active GI bleeding. Based principally on expert opinion recommendations, we propose a count of 50×10/L. Some professional associations have suggested in very specific clinical settings (postcardiopulmonary bypass surgery or central nervous system procedures).

### The ASH-ASPHO Choosing Wisely campaign: 5 hematologic tests and treatments to question [^111jiXwh]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

Recommendation 2: Avoid platelet transfusion in asymptomatic children at least 1 year of age with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia and a platelet count > 10 × 10³/μL unless an invasive procedure is planned.

The second ASH-ASPHO recommendation advises against transfusing platelets into children with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia conditions such as bone marrow failure or malignancy who experience a platelet count above 10 × 10³/μL, unless signs and/or symptoms of bleeding develop or the patient is to undergo an invasive procedure. In children with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia, attainment of higher platelet transfusion thresholds (above 10 × 10³/μL) has not been associated with a decreased risk of bleeding. Platelet transfusions, although usually well tolerated, can have significant adverse effects after multiple transfusions, thus exposing children to an increased risk for acute transfusion reactions, viral and bacterial infections, and platelet alloimmunization.

Platelets are an expensive, resource-intensive biological product, and the stewardship of this life-supporting, limited blood supply is critical to patient safety. The recommendation for a prudent use of platelet transfusions is consistent with the recently published clinical guidelines established by multiple professional medical organizations, including the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, BSH, and ASCO. It is important to note that the ASH-ASPHO recommendation does not include children younger than 1 year of age and does not account for additional comorbidities and medication.

### Should transfusion trigger thresholds differ for critical care versus perioperative patients? A meta-analysis of randomized trials [^115r6SHJ]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Evidence suggests that the safety of restrictive transfusion thresholds differs for critically ill patients versus perioperative patients. In critical care patients, a restrictive transfusion strategy (transfusion trigger ~7–8 g/dL) reduces the risk of overall mortality, stroke/TIA, transfusion reactions, length of stay, and allogeneic blood exposure. In contrast, for perioperative patients, evidence suggests a restrictive transfusion strategy may increase the risk of mortality, particularly with transfusion triggers of 7–7.5 g/dL.

While the evidence base is sufficiently robust to provide definitive conclusions for critically ill patients due to large accumulated sample size, the existing evidence base for the perioperative population remains less robust due to insufficiently accumulated sample size. Consequently, further research is encouraged in perioperative patients to define safe transfusion thresholds, especially for cardiac surgical patients or high-risk patients undergoing noncardiac surgery.

### Clinical practice guidelines from the AABB: Red blood cell transfusion thresholds and storage [^113nUZwa]. JAMA (2016). High credibility.

More than 100 million units of blood are collected worldwide each year, yet the indication for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and the optimal length of RBC storage prior to transfusion remain uncertain.

- **Objective**: To provide recommendations for the target hemoglobin level for RBC transfusion among hospitalized adult patients who are hemodynamically stable and the length of time RBCs should be stored prior to transfusion.

- **Evidence review**: Reference librarians conducted a literature search for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating hemoglobin thresholds for RBC transfusion (1950-May 2016) and RBC storage duration (1948-May 2016) without language restrictions. The results were summarized using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method.

	- **For RBC transfusion thresholds**: 31 RCTs included 12,587 participants and compared restrictive thresholds (transfusion not indicated until the hemoglobin level is 7–8 g/dL) with liberal thresholds (transfusion not indicated until the hemoglobin level is 9–10 g/dL). The summary estimates across trials demonstrated that restrictive RBC transfusion thresholds were not associated with higher rates of adverse clinical outcomes, including 30-day mortality, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, rebleeding, pneumonia, or thromboembolism.

	- **For RBC storage duration**: 13 RCTs included 5,515 participants randomly allocated to receive fresher blood or standard-issue blood. These RCTs demonstrated that fresher blood did not improve clinical outcomes.

It is good practice to consider the hemodynamic stability when determining transfusion needs based on these guidelines.

### Acute transfusion practice during trauma resuscitation: who, when, where and why [^1155nbSb]. Injury (2013). Low credibility.

Early transfusion (ET = within 24h) is required in approximately 5% of trauma patients. Critical care transfusion guidelines control transfusion triggers using evidence-based cut-offs. Empirical guidelines influence decision-making for ET in trauma.

- **Aim**: To describe the patterns, indications, and timing of ET at a level 1 trauma center.

- **Methods**: A 12-month prospective study was conducted on all trauma admissions requiring ET. Demographics, mechanism, and injury severity score (ISS) were collected. Timing, location, volume, the clinician initiating the first unit of transfusion, and the reason for transfusion were recorded, along with corresponding blood gas results and physiological parameters. Mortality, ICU admission, length of stay, and need for emergent surgery were documented as outcomes.

- **Results**: From 965 trauma admissions, 91 (9%) required ET (76% male, median age: 38 years, range: 10–88, IQR: 22–59). The mechanism was blunt in 87% of cases, with an ISS of 25 (range: 4–66, IQR: 16–34). Massive transfusion protocol (MTP) activation occurred in 43% (39/91) of cases. ET was initiated in the emergency department (ED) in 52% of cases, operating room (OR) in 38%, and ICU in 10%. MTP transfusions commenced at a median of 0.5 hours (range: 0.5–4, IQR: 0.5–1.5), whereas non-MTP transfusions began at a median of 3 hours (range: 0.5–23, IQR: 2–9). The first unit of ET was initiated by a trauma surgeon (35%), anesthetist (30%), ED personnel (19%), ICU staff (13%), and general surgeon (3%). Transfusion triggers for the first unit included 'expected or ongoing bleeding' in 29%, dropping hemoglobin in 26%, hemorrhagic shock in 24%, hypotension in 10%, and tachycardia in 8%. Median systolic blood pressure was 90 (range: 45–125, IQR: 80–100), and heart rate was 100 (range: 53–163, IQR: 87–120).

The study highlights the critical role of timing and triggers in ET practice during trauma resuscitation.

### Cumulative donor-specific antibody threshold predicts platelet transfusion response in HLA-alloimmunized patients [^1137oACA]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

HLA-alloimmunization–mediated platelet transfusion refractoriness and the associated bleeding risks remain therapy-limiting and potentially life-threatening complications in patients with hematologic malignancies and those undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Platelet transfusion refractoriness due to HLA alloimmunization may be mitigated by transfusing platelets that are matched at HLA-A and -B antigens between the platelet donor and transfusion recipient, by avoiding donors with antigens to which the recipient has formed antibodies, and/or by platelet crossmatching donor serum with platelets to be transfused. When HLA-matched donors are unavailable, platelet components with lesser degrees of donor–recipient histocompatibility mismatch may be transfused. These "permissively mismatched" platelet components may express HLA antigens in cross-reactive groups or HLAMatchmaker-defined antigen epitope mismatches to which the transfusion recipients are less likely to be alloimmunized. Blood centers currently use these methods alone or in combination. However, cross-reactive group–based HLA platelet selection has demonstrated inconsistent benefit, and epitope matching requires high-resolution HLA typing (not routinely performed in platelet donors) or a need to impute HLA allele subtype based on the probability of occurrence in local donor pools.

Antigen-conjugated fluorescent bead–based platforms currently used for HLA antibody testing can measure antibody specificity and avidity to specific antigens by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI).

### Prophylactic plasma and platelet transfusion in the critically ill patient: Just useless and expensive or even harmful [^114b3dkg]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Point-of-care-guided bleeding management algorithms, using thromboelastometry and impedance aggregometry, have been shown to be effective in reducing transfusion requirements in cardiovascular surgery, liver transplantation, trauma, obstetrics, and other critically ill patients. Transfusion requirements for FFP, PRBC, and platelets could be reduced by 70–90%, 10–60%, and 20–70%, respectively, which is associated with significant cost savings.

Furthermore, the incidence of massive transfusion, revision surgery, TACO, acute lung injury, multiple organ failure, nosocomial infection, and sepsis, as well as thromboembolic events, could be reduced significantly. This can be explained by the high predictive value of thromboelastometry for postoperative complications after major non-cardiac surgery (ROC AUC = 0.751 for INTEM A10), which allows for defining a therapeutic window to stop bleeding without an increased risk of thromboembolic events. Similar results have been reported for cardiovascular patients.

### Platelet transfusion for patients with cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline update [^111xTyNy]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

To provide evidence-based guidance on the use of platelet transfusion in people with cancer. This guideline updates and replaces the previous ASCO platelet transfusion guideline published initially in 2001.

- **Methods**: ASCO convened an Expert Panel and conducted a systematic review of the medical literature published from September 1, 2014, through October 26, 2016. This review builds on two 2015 systematic reviews conducted by the AABB and the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines. For clinical questions that were not addressed by the AABB and the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines, such as the use of leukoreduction and platelet transfusion in solid tumors or chronic, stable severe thrombocytopenia, or were addressed partially like invasive procedures, the ASCO search extended back to January 2000.

- **Results**: The updated ASCO review included 24 more recent publications: three clinical practice guidelines, eight systematic reviews, and 13 observational studies.

- **Recommendations**: The most substantial change to a previous recommendation involved platelet transfusion in the setting of hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Based on data from randomized controlled trials, adult patients who undergo autologous stem-cell transplantation at experienced centers may receive a platelet transfusion at the first sign of bleeding, rather than prophylactically. Prophylactic platelet transfusion at defined platelet count thresholds is still recommended for pediatric patients undergoing autologous stem-cell transplantation.

### Blood utilisation and transfusion reactions in adult patients transfused with conventional or pathogen-reduced platelets [^112Bi6Zb]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Low credibility.

Safety of the blood supply is critical for patient outcomes and impacts the public's perception of transfusion. Various methods, including donor testing, expanded surveillance cultures, and rapid detection assays, aim to increase the safety of blood products. Among these screening methods for bacterial contamination of platelets, delayed large-volume bacterial culture (DLVBC) implemented by the United Kingdom's National Health System Blood and Transplant and by the Northern Ireland Blood Transfusion Service was able to decrease the reported septic fatality to zero cases. A similar experience with DLVBC was also reported by the Belgian Haemovigilance program. While these strategies have decreased the rate of transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs), they might be ineffective against emerging pathogens and continue to present a risk for test failures (false negatives). Pathogen inactivation (PI) technology has been shown to be effective at reducing TTIs, particularly in platelet products, which continue to have a relatively high rate of bacterial contamination.

An international, open-label, observational haemovigilance program on 19,175 transfusions previously showed that adverse events reported after pathogen-reduced (PR) platelet transfusions were infrequent and were of low-grade severity. Other large-scale studies (involving more than 100 patients per group) found either similar or lower reaction rates between conventional (CONV) and PR platelet products.

### Cumulative donor-specific antibody threshold predicts platelet transfusion response in HLA-alloimmunized patients [^116J2bSp]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

Of the 2012 platelet transfusions analyzed across 73 patients, 1070 and 440 transfusions had complete data at 2 and 24 hours after transfusion, respectively, for inclusion in the multivariable model (Figure 1 A). On average, each patient received 29 transfusions over a mean duration of 45 days. Each patient received a mean of 1 randomly selected apheresis platelet for every 4 HLA-selected units. Recipient demographics by the two outcome measures are summarized in Table 1. Notably, significantly fewer transfusions had corrected count increment (CCI) data at 24 hours (n = 731) compared to 2 hours (n = 1563).

- **Figure 1**: Patient selection and inclusion/exclusion criteria.
	- (A) Patients with a calculated panel reactive antibody (cPRA) of < 50% were excluded because our institutional practice is to give random donor platelets in this setting. Generally, alloimmunization is suspected as a cause of platelet transfusion refractoriness (PTR) after two sequential platelet transfusions with poor count increment; however, this is not a strict criterion.
	- (B) Histograms of the total number of platelet transfusions per patient among 2140 total platelet transfusions.

### Postoperative bleeding after dentoalveolar surgery in patients with thrombocytopenia-are prophylactic platelet transfusions necessary [^112Ymab5]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Low credibility.

Karasneh et al. found no evidence in their systematic review to support the long-standing platelet (PLT) count threshold of < 50×10⁹/L for administration of prophylactic PLT transfusion prior to dentoalveolar surgery. The 2018 clinical practice guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommended a threshold of 40–50×10⁹/L for prophylactic PLT transfusion before major invasive surgery on patients with no other associated coagulation abnormalities. For bone marrow aspirations, bone marrow biopsies, and the removal of central venous catheters, ASCO recommendations state that patients with a PLT count of < 20×10⁹/L do not require prophylactic PLT transfusions.

One unit of PLT costs approximately USD 528 in Sweden and up to USD 4,436 in the US. Over the course of our study (12 years), our cohort had received 86 units of PLT, at a cost of roughly USD 43,000 in Sweden and USD 382,000 in the US. Our data demonstrated no significant reduction in the incidence of postoperative bleeding (POB) when prophylactic PLT transfusions were administered prior to dentoalveolar surgery. The lack of benefit in this setting, in combination with the shortage of blood components and the high costs associated with transfusion, argue for a more restrictive PLT transfusion strategy compared with recommendations in several international guidelines.

The clinical outcome of PLT transfusion is also unpredictable. The recent Karlström et al. study on 40 patients with severe thrombocytopenia reported the effect of PLT transfusion by measuring PLT count at three time points: before transfusion, 1 hour after transfusion, and [text appears to be incomplete].

### Should transfusion trigger thresholds differ for critical care versus perioperative patients? A meta-analysis of randomized trials [^116AitPg]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

- **Results**:

- **Literature search and study selection**: The systematic search retrieved 6,055 citations (PRISMA Flowchart, Supplemental Digital Content 2; legend, Supplemental Digital Content 11). Ultimately, 27 RCTs including 10,797 patients met the inclusion criteria. Twelve trials included primarily critically ill patients, and 15 included primarily surgical (perioperative) patients. For the restrictive transfusion strategy, the trigger threshold was typically defined as hemoglobin concentration of 7–8 g/dL, and for the liberal transfusion strategy, the trigger was typically between hemoglobin 9 and 10 g/dL. Excluded studies are detailed in the online appendix (Supplemental Digital Content 3; legend, Supplemental Digital Content 11).

- **Risk of bias**: Seventeen studies were deemed at moderate risk of bias, and the remaining 10 were at high risk of bias (Risk of Bias Assessment, Supplemental Digital Content 4; legend, Supplemental Digital Content 11).

- **Mortality at 30 days**: In critical care patients, the restrictive transfusion strategy resulted in significantly reduced 30-day mortality compared with a liberal transfusion strategy (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70–0.97; NNTB = 33; p = 0.019) (Fig. 1). In contrast, in surgical patients, the restrictive transfusion strategy led to the opposite direction of effect for 30-day mortality (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.94–1.82; p = 0.12) (Fig. 1), though not reaching conventional levels of significance. More importantly, the test for interaction across the critical care and…

### Cumulative donor-specific antibody threshold predicts platelet transfusion response in HLA-alloimmunized patients [^114dqset]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

Concerning other factors, splenomegaly also negatively affected post-transfusion CCI. Barring unusual circumstances, the impact of this nonmodifiable risk factor may be challenging to overcome. Nonetheless, we did not observe a correlation between increasing spleen size and higher major or minor bleeding rates in this cohort. Transfusion reactions were associated with lower CCI, likely because of the discontinuation of infusions and/or inflammatory potentiation of platelet destruction.

Platelet storage in additive solution, known to mitigate allergic reactions (comprising 32% of the total transfusion reactions in this cohort) and resulting in less complement activation, was also associated with a decreased CCI by 10% compared with storage in plasma in our adjusted analysis. This is consistent with previously reported data. The clinical decision to consider or avoid HLA-selected platelets stored in platelet-additive solution versus plasma may need to be individualized.

One limitation of this study was that the calculation of CCI was based on a presumed platelet count of 3 × 10¹¹ per bag in the absence of consistent platelet yield data for all transfusions. This likely led to mildly overestimating most CCI values because the number of platelets transfused was presumably higher in some cases. Most blood centers use different target median platelet yields for large volume delayed sampling (3.5 × 10¹¹ per bag) versus pathogen-inactivated platelets (3.2 × 10¹¹ per bag). This may have resulted in a disproportionate advantage toward large volume–delayed sampling platelets.

### Platelet transfusions for patients with haematological malignancies: who needs them [^1159Ps2z]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

The goal of platelet transfusions is to prevent severe and life-threatening bleeding in patients with thrombocytopenia. This aim needs to be balanced against the risks associated with platelet transfusions, as well as the challenge of maintaining an adequate supply. This review summarizes the recent evidence regarding the clinical use of platelet transfusions in haematology patients, concentrating on topics that still provoke debate. These include the optimal dose for platelet transfusions and the relative safety of a 'therapeutic only' platelet transfusion strategy compared to the use of prophylactic platelet transfusions.

The type of platelet product has been the subject of two recent systematic reviews. The results of these reviews will be discussed, as well as their implications for practice.

### Physician compliance with platelet usage criteria [^116TQGT7]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Platelet transfusions are used in clinical practice as prophylaxis or to treat bleeding thrombocytopenic patients. This procedure also carries risks and costs and must be allocated appropriately.

- **Objective**: To evaluate physician compliance with the platelet transfusion criteria in our tertiary care academic institution.

- **Design**: We evaluated platelet unit releases from the transfusion service for four months and retrieved pretransfusion platelet counts. Reasons for transfusion were obtained by reviewing patient charts and consulting clinicians. Compliance with hospital criteria for platelet use was determined.

- **Results**: Platelets were given to 113 patients in 282 transfusion episodes. Criteria were not met for 32 (11%) of 282 platelet transfusions. Justifiable reasons for transfusion at platelet counts greater than 10 × 10³/µL included bleeding risk from oral ulcers, other risks of bleeding in patients transfused before discharge, and antiplatelet drug use in cardiac surgery patients. Reasons for transfusion at platelet counts greater than 10 x 10³/µL that were not justified include transfusion at a platelet count of 110 × 10³/µL to a lung cancer patient with no platelet dysfunction and transfusion to four septic patients with platelet counts of 70 to 90 × 10³/µL.

- **Conclusions**: This study showed 89% physician compliance with hospital platelet transfusion criteria. Transfusion-medicine specialists concurred that strict adherence to hospital blood usage criteria was not applicable for 9.2% of these patients.

Regarding the medical management of acute myeloid leukemia, particularly in the context of managing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), the ISTH 2020 guidelines recommend considering a platelet count of less than 20×10⁹/L as the threshold for transfusion in non-acute promyelocytic leukemia (non-APL) patients without active bleeding. In contrast, a higher platelet count should be maintained in patients experiencing clinically significant active bleeding.

### Flow cytometry for near-patient testing in premature neonates reveals variation in platelet function: a novel approach to guide platelet transfusion [^115LZ9Zs]. Pediatric Research (2019). Low credibility.

Despite the evidence that the platelet count by itself has limitations as an effective marker of the need for platelet transfusion, it remains the most commonly applied parameter used in premature infants to guide platelet administration. There is a need to identify better laboratory tests of bleeding risk beyond those provided by platelet count alone, which fails to provide information on platelet function.

Most tests of platelet function require a volume of blood that is not feasible to collect from premature infants. One possible technique is to assess platelet function by flow cytometry, which requires much smaller volumes of blood. The use of flow cytometry for the measurement of platelet function has been utilized in a series of studies in adults and has been shown to be sensitive and reproducible enough to clearly identify individuals who have more or less reactive platelets among a large cohort of healthy individuals. Due to the size of the premature neonates, who are most at risk of bleeding, the use of flow cytometry to measure platelet function is attractive as the assay can be carried out using extremely small samples of whole blood (e.g. < 500 µL). Several studies of platelet function by flow cytometry have been conducted in the neonatal population, suggesting hyporeactivity of neonatal platelets compared to those of adults, potentially related to the lower expression of key platelet surface receptors. This hyporeactivity has been reported to peak in the first few days post-delivery before gradually correcting over the first few weeks of life.

### Comparison of different platelet count thresholds to guide administration of prophylactic platelet transfusion for preventing bleeding in people with haematological disorders after myelosuppressive chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation [^11766Yma]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Platelet transfusions are used in modern clinical practice to prevent and treat bleeding in people who are thrombocytopenic due to bone marrow failure. Although considerable advances have been made in platelet transfusion therapy in the last 40 years, some areas continue to provoke debate, especially concerning the use of prophylactic platelet transfusions for the prevention of thrombocytopenic bleeding. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004, and previously updated in 2012, that addressed four separate questions: prophylactic versus therapeutic-only platelet transfusion policy; prophylactic platelet transfusion threshold; prophylactic platelet transfusion dose; and platelet transfusions compared to alternative treatments. This review has now been split into four smaller reviews focusing on these questions individually; this review specifically compares prophylactic platelet transfusion thresholds.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether different platelet transfusion thresholds for the administration of prophylactic platelet transfusions (platelet transfusions given to prevent bleeding) affect the efficacy and safety of prophylactic platelet transfusions in preventing bleeding in people with haematological disorders undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy or haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

- **Search methods**: We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 6, 23 July 2015), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and CINAHL (from 1937).

### Transfusion strategies in bleeding critically ill adults: A clinical practice guideline from the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^113txGDP]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

- **Implementation issues**: Evidence in this setting is limited to a single trial, creating some concerns around the acceptability of a restrictive threshold for RBC transfusion, in particular whether there is a lower limit. In patients with minor hemorrhage and no symptoms, the decision to transfuse can be discussed with the patient, as preferences may vary. The TF suggested a restrictive transfusion threshold, which is consistent with guidance from other societies, including the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, which adopts both clinical and hematological criteria to guide the decision to perform a blood transfusion. In patients with severe shock and uncontrolled bleeding, a higher threshold may be considered, anticipating ongoing blood loss.

- **Evidence summary**: A total of four RCTs were identified that examined the impact of a restrictive versus a liberal transfusion strategy. A restrictive transfusion strategy led to a reduction in mortality (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43–0.93), risk of rebleeding (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46–0.81), and volume overload (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03–0.54). There was also an improvement in quality of life measured using EQ5D (MD 0.07, 95% CI 0.02–0.12) with a restrictive strategy. There was no effect with regard to stroke (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.29–1.09), myocardial infarction (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.26–1.47), and post-transfusion sepsis (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.81–1.13). There may be moderate cost savings with a reduced risk of bleeding due to fewer patients requiring transfusion. There are no formal studies evaluating a restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategy.

### Fresh frozen plasma and platelet transfusion for nonbleeding patients in the intensive care unit: Benefit or harm [^112TVvJC]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Whereas restrictive red cell transfusion has become a standard of care for the critically ill, evidence-based indications for the use of other blood components, such as fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelet transfusions, are limited. We searched the National Library of Medicine PubMed database, as well as references of retrieved articles, and summarized the evidence for the use of FFP and platelet transfusions in critically ill patients.

- **Results**: Routine coagulation tests are poor determinants of bleeding risk in critically ill patients with coagulopathy. FFP transfusion has limited efficacy and is associated with significant morbidity, particularly pulmonary edema and acute lung injury. Routine minimally invasive critical care procedures can be safely performed by experienced clinicians in the setting of mildly abnormal coagulation test results, and there is no evidence that FFP transfusion alters the risk of bleeding. For platelet transfusion, the American Society of Clinical Oncology has developed practice guidelines designed for oncology patients. However, because the pathophysiology of thrombocytopenia in critically ill patients often differs from that of thrombocytopenia in oncology patients, published guidelines for oncology patients may not be applicable.

- **Conclusion**: Because the risk-benefit ratio of a liberal FFP or platelet transfusion strategy for critically ill patients may not be favorable, randomized controlled trials are warranted for evaluating a restrictive vs. liberal FFP or platelet transfusion strategy for nonbleeding patients.

### Comparison of different platelet transfusion thresholds prior to insertion of central lines in patients with thrombocytopenia [^116ppfmV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) often require the insertion of central lines — central venous catheters (CVCs). CVCs have numerous uses, including the administration of chemotherapy, intensive monitoring and treatment of critically ill patients, administration of total parenteral nutrition, and long-term intermittent intravenous access for patients requiring repeated treatments. In many countries, the practice is to correct thrombocytopenia with platelet transfusions prior to CVC insertion to mitigate the risk of serious procedure-related bleeding. However, the platelet count threshold recommended before CVC insertion varies significantly from country to country. This variation indicates significant uncertainty among clinicians regarding the correct management of these patients. The risk of bleeding following a central line insertion appears to be low if an ultrasound-guided technique is used. Patients may, therefore, be exposed to the risks of a platelet transfusion without any obvious clinical benefit.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of different platelet transfusion thresholds prior to the insertion of a central line in patients with thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).

- **Search methods**: We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 2), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1950), and ongoing trial databases up to 23 February 2015.

- **Selection criteria**: We included RCTs involving transfusions of platelet concentrates, prepared either from individual units.

### Transfusion thresholds and other strategies for guiding allogeneic red blood cell transfusion [^115ypWsB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

There is considerable uncertainty regarding the optimal haemoglobin threshold for the use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in anaemic patients. Blood is a scarce resource and, in some countries, transfusions are less safe than others due to a lack of testing for viral pathogens. Therefore, reducing the number and volume of transfusions would benefit patients.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this review was to compare 30-day mortality and other clinical outcomes in participants randomized to restrictive versus liberal RBC transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin level to trigger transfusion (most commonly 7 g/dL or 8 g/dL), whereas the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin level to trigger transfusion (most commonly 9 g/dL to 10 g/dL).

- **Search methods**: Trials were identified by searching CENTRAL (2016, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1946 to May 2016), Embase (1974 to May 2016), the Transfusion Evidence Library (1950 to May 2016), the Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (1990 to May 2016), and ongoing trial registries (27 May 2016). Reference lists of other published reviews and relevant papers were also checked to identify any additional trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials where intervention groups were assigned based on a clear transfusion 'trigger' — described as a haemoglobin (Hb) or haematocrit (Hct) level below which an RBC transfusion was to be administered — were included.

Data collection and analysis were conducted, but the detailed results and conclusions sections have been truncated.

### Platelet transfusion: 2025 AABB and ICTMG international clinical practice guidelines [^111jFzqe]. JAMA (2025). High credibility.

Platelet transfusion is a frequent procedure with benefits and risks. The objective of this guideline is to provide recommendations for adult and pediatric populations in whom platelet transfusions are commonly performed.

Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was applied to findings from 21 randomized trials and 13 observational studies, especially in contexts where randomized clinical trial data are limited. Transfusion strategies using fewer (restrictive) versus greater (liberal) amounts of platelets were compared.

The evidence demonstrated that restrictive transfusion strategies probably did not cause increases in mortality or bleeding relative to liberal strategies across predefined clinical populations. An exceedingly low incidence of spinal hematoma was identified in patients with thrombocytopenia undergoing lumbar puncture. Due to varying definitions of restrictive strategies across trials, recommendations reflect practical guidance.

The following recommendations are strong recommendations with high/moderate-certainty evidence:

- For hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia in nonbleeding patients receiving chemotherapy or undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplant, platelet transfusion is recommended when the platelet count is less than 10×10³/μL.

- For consumptive thrombocytopenia in neonates without major bleeding, platelet transfusion is recommended when the platelet count is less than 25×10³/μL.

- In patients undergoing lumbar puncture, platelet transfusion is recommended when the platelet count is less than 20×10³/μL.

Consider using higher thresholds for transfusion in patients with signs of hemorrhage, high fever, hyperleukocytosis, rapid fall of platelet count, or coagulation abnormalities such as acute promyelocytic leukemia. Additionally, patients undergoing invasive procedures or circumstances where platelet transfusions may not be readily available (such as outpatients living at a distance from the treatment center) also warrant higher transfusion thresholds.

### How well do platelets prevent bleeding [^114DaWY2]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Low credibility.

Prophylactic platelet transfusions are used to reduce the risk of spontaneous bleeding in patients with treatment- or disease-related severe thrombocytopenia. A prophylactic platelet-transfusion threshold of < 10 × 10³/µL has been shown to be safe in stable hematology/oncology patients. A higher threshold and/or larger or more frequent platelet doses may be appropriate for patients with clinical features associated with an increased risk of bleeding, such as high fevers, sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, anticoagulation therapy, or splenomegaly. Unique factors in the outpatient setting may support the use of a higher platelet-transfusion threshold and/or dose of platelets.

A prophylactic platelet-transfusion strategy has been shown to be associated with a lower risk of bleeding compared with no prophylaxis in adult patients receiving chemotherapy, but not for autologous transplant recipients. Despite the use of prophylactic platelet transfusions, a high incidence (50% to 70%) of spontaneous bleeding remains. Using a higher threshold or larger doses of platelets does not change this risk. New approaches to reduce the risk of spontaneous bleeding, including antifibrinolytic therapy, are currently under study.

### Haematological management of major haemorrhage: A British Society for Haematology guideline [^111bZAbe]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for red blood cell transfusion, particularly concerning transfusion thresholds in the context of massive bleeding, the BSH 2022 guidelines recommend using a standard threshold and target hemoglobin range for RBC transfusion. This approach is crucial to provide critical life-saving support in major bleeding scenarios, alongside clinical judgment on the severity of bleeding. Specifically, the guidelines suggest a hemoglobin threshold of 7 g/dL, with a target range for the post-transfusion hemoglobin level of 7–9 g/dL.

### Platelet transfusion: A clinical practice guideline from the AABB [^115wm2Gc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). High credibility.

The AABB (formerly, the American Association of Blood Banks) developed this guideline on the appropriate use of platelet transfusion in adult patients.

- **Methods**: These guidelines are based on a systematic review of randomized clinical trials and observational studies (1900 to September 2014) that reported clinical outcomes on patients receiving prophylactic or therapeutic platelet transfusions. An expert panel reviewed the data and developed recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework.

- **Recommendation 1**: The AABB recommends that platelets should be transfused prophylactically to reduce the risk for spontaneous bleeding in hospitalized adult patients with therapy-induced hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia. The AABB recommends transfusing hospitalized adult patients with a platelet count of 10 × 10⁹ cells/L or less to reduce the risk for spontaneous bleeding. The AABB recommends transfusing up to a single apheresis unit or equivalent. Greater doses are not more effective, and lower doses equal to one half of a standard apheresis unit are equally effective (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).

- **Recommendation 2**: The AABB suggests prophylactic platelet transfusion for patients having elective central venous catheter placement with a platelet count less than 20 × 10⁹ cells/L (Grade: weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).

- **Recommendation 3**: The AABB suggests prophylactic platelet transfusion for patients having elective diagnostic lumbar puncture with a platelet count less than necessary.

### How I use platelet transfusions [^115kpcev]. Blood (2022). Low credibility.

Platelet transfusions are commonly administered for the prevention or treatment of bleeding in patients with acquired thrombocytopenia across a range of clinical contexts. Recent data, including randomized trials, have highlighted uncertainties in the risk-benefit balance of this therapy, which is the subject of this review. Hemovigilance systems report that platelets are the most frequently implicated component in transfusion reactions. There is considerable variation in platelet count increment after platelet transfusion, and limited evidence of efficacy for clinical outcomes, including prevention of bleeding. Bleeding events commonly occur despite the different policies for platelet transfusion prophylaxis.

The underlying mechanisms of harm reported in randomized trials may be related to the role of platelets beyond hemostasis, including mediating inflammation. Research supports the implementation of a restrictive platelet transfusion policy. Research is needed to better understand the impact of platelet donation characteristics on outcomes, and to determine the optimal thresholds for platelet transfusion before invasive procedures or major surgery, such as laparotomy. Platelet transfusion policies should move toward a risk-adapted approach that does not focus solely on platelet count.

### Prophylactic platelet transfusions prior to surgery for people with a low platelet count [^111XqUbn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

People with thrombocytopenia often require a surgical procedure. A low platelet count is a relative contraindication to surgery due to the risk of bleeding. Platelet transfusions are used in clinical practice to prevent and treat bleeding in people with thrombocytopenia. In many countries, the practice is to correct thrombocytopenia with platelet transfusions prior to surgery. Alternatives to platelet transfusion are also used before surgery.

- **Objectives**: To determine the clinical effectiveness and safety of prophylactic platelet transfusions prior to surgery for people with a low platelet count.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following major databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 2), PubMed (e-publications only), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, the Transfusion Evidence Library, and ongoing trial databases up to 11 December 2017.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs), as well as non-RCTs and controlled before-and-after studies (CBAs), that met Cochrane EPOC (Effective Practice and Organisation of Care) criteria. These studies involved the transfusion of platelets prior to surgery (any dose, at any time, single or multiple) in people with low platelet counts. We excluded studies involving people with a low platelet count who were actively bleeding.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane for data collection. We were only able to combine data for two outcomes, presenting the rest of the findings in a narrative form.

### Platelet transfusion practice and platelet refractoriness for a cohort of pediatric oncology patients: A single-center study [^113ptRjX]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2020). Low credibility.

Platelet transfusions are an essential aspect of supportive care for pediatric oncology patients. However, data regarding the frequency of transfusions, pretransfusion thresholds, posttransfusion increments, and the rate of platelet transfusion refractoriness (PTR) are lacking.

- **Study objectives**: The objectives of this study are to describe platelet transfusion practices for children with malignancy, determine the normal platelet increment following platelet transfusion, and assess the rate of PTR.

- **Methods**: Inpatient pediatric oncology patients were observed. Older children who received ABO incompatible platelet transfusions with a longer storage duration were more likely to have a poor platelet response (increment ≤ 10 × 10⁹/L). The rate of PTR, whether immune and/or non-immune, was low (8%; 11/144).

- **Conclusions**: Practical information is provided to parents and clinicians of newly diagnosed children regarding the likelihood and frequency of platelet transfusions.

### Platelets for neonatal transfusion - study 2: A randomised controlled trial to compare two different platelet count thresholds for prophylactic platelet transfusion to preterm neonates [^112b8hTY]. Neonatology (2014). High credibility.

Neonatal thrombocytopenia is a common and important clinical problem in preterm neonates. A trial assessing clinically relevant outcomes related to the different platelet count thresholds used to trigger transfusion has never been undertaken in preterm neonates with severe thrombocytopenia.

- **Objectives**: Platelets for Neonatal Transfusion - Study 2 (PlaNeT-2) aims to assess whether a higher prophylactic platelet transfusion threshold is superior to lower thresholds in standard practice, in reducing the proportion of patients who have a major bleed or die up to study day 28.

- **Methods**: PlaNeT-2 is a two-stage, randomised, parallel-group, superiority trial. It compares clinical outcomes in preterm neonates (< 34 weeks' gestation at birth) randomised to receive prophylactic platelet transfusions to maintain platelet counts at or above either 25 × 10⁹/l or 50 × 10⁹/l. The primary outcome measure is the proportion of patients who either die or experience a major bleed up to and including study day 28. A total of 660 infants will be randomised.

- **Results and conclusions**: This trial will help define optimal platelet transfusion support for severely thrombocytopenic preterm neonates by evaluating the risks and benefits of two different prophylactic neonatal platelet transfusion thresholds.

### Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma and platelets in critically ill adults: An American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^115JtQkf]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Platelets and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) are frequently administered to critically ill patients. Considering the variability in indications and thresholds guiding these transfusions, a comprehensive review of evidence was conducted to provide guidance to critical care practitioners. This American College of Chest Physicians guideline examined the literature on platelet transfusions in critically ill patients with thrombocytopenia, with and without active bleeding, as well as data on prophylactic platelet and FFP transfusions for common procedures in the critical care setting.

- **Study design and methods**: A panel of experts developed seven Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome questions addressing platelet and FFP transfusions in critically ill patients and performed a comprehensive evidence review. The panel applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach to assess the certainty of evidence and to formulate and grade recommendations. A modified Delphi technique was used to reach consensus on the recommendations.

- **Results**: The initial search identified a total of 7,172 studies, and after the initial screening, 100 articles were reviewed. Sixteen studies met inclusion criteria, comprising 1 randomized controlled trial and 15 observational studies. Overall, the certainty of the evidence for all questions was very low. The panel formulated seven conditional recommendations.

- **Conclusions**: In critically ill patients with thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy, a risk/benefit assessment should be made by providers.

### New strategies for the optimal use of platelet transfusions [^1139tY9A]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with severe thrombocytopenia are presumed to be at increased risk for bleeding, and consequently, it has been standard practice for the past four decades to provide allogeneic platelet transfusions to these individuals as supportive care. Platelet transfusions may be administered either prophylactically, to reduce the risk of bleeding in the absence of clinical hemorrhage, or therapeutically, to control active bleeding when it occurs.

While the necessity of platelet transfusions in the presence of severe bleeding is undisputed, important questions remain regarding what constitutes clinically significant bleeding and whether a strategy of prophylactic platelet transfusions effectively reduces the risk of bleeding in clinically stable patients. It is now uncommon for patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation to die from hemorrhage. However, it is debated to what extent platelet transfusions have contributed to this change in outcome, considering advancements in other aspects of supportive care.

If a prophylactic strategy is adopted, the optimal transfusion trigger or quantity of platelets to be transfused prophylactically per episode needs to be addressed in adequately powered clinical trials. These remain highly controversial issues due to the scarcity of high-quality, prospective, randomized clinical trial (RCT) data evaluating the relative effects of different platelet transfusion regimens or doses on clinical outcomes.

### Transfusion thresholds for guiding red blood cell transfusion [^1174U4w4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

The optimal haemoglobin threshold for the use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in anaemic patients remains an active field of research. Blood is a scarce resource, and in some countries, transfusions are less safe than in others because of inadequate testing for viral pathogens. If a liberal transfusion policy does not improve clinical outcomes, or if it is equivalent, then adopting a more restrictive approach could be recognized as the standard of care.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this review update was to compare 30-day mortality and other clinical outcomes for participants randomized to restrictive versus liberal RBC transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all clinical conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 7.0 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL), and the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 9.0 g/dL to 10.0 g/dL).

- **Search methods**: We identified trials through updated searches: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to November 2020), Embase (1974 to November 2020), Transfusion Evidence Library (1950 to November 2020), Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (1990 to November 2020), and trial registries (November 2020). We checked the reference lists of other published reviews and relevant papers to identify additional trials. We were aware of one trial identified in earlier searching that was in the process of being published (in February 2021), and we were able to include it.

### Prophylactic plasma and platelet transfusion in the critically ill patient: just useless and expensive or even harmful [^117Somkm]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Similar considerations have been made regarding the predictive value of platelet count versus thromboelastometric clot firmness for bleeding after invasive interventions. Weigand et al. demonstrated that coagulation disorders with altered INR (≥ 1.5) or platelet count (≤ 50×10⁹/L) did not increase the risk of significant bleeding when inserting a central venous catheter. Zeidler et al. demonstrated in their retrospective single-center analysis of 604 central venous catheter insertions in 193 patients with acute leukemia that only patients with platelet counts of less than 20×10⁹/L were at higher risk of bleeding compared to patients with platelet counts of 100×10⁹/L or more.

However, Greene et al. demonstrated that thromboelastometric clot firmness (EXTEM or INTEM A10 or MCF) is superior to platelet count in predicting bleeding in pediatric patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and severe thrombocytopenia (< 30×10⁹/L). Superiority of thromboelastometry maximum clot firmness (MCF) compared to platelet count in predicting bleeding in patients with hematological malignancies has recently been confirmed in the prospective observational ATHENA study. Further studies confirmed that EXTEM clot firmness (A10 and MCF) can be used to assess the efficacy of prophylactic platelet transfusion before insertion of a central venous catheter in patients with bone marrow failure and in thrombocytopenic children undergoing chemotherapy. Furthermore, Fayed et al. reported that a thromboelastometry-guided transfusion protocol in patients undergoing liver transplantation can avoid 75% of unnecessary transfusions, enhancing patient safety and reducing healthcare costs.

### Evidence and triggers for the transfusion of blood and blood products [^112tbmLX]. Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Allogeneic red cell transfusion is a commonly used treatment to improve the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood during the peri-operative period. Increasing arterial oxygen content by increasing haemoglobin does not necessarily increase tissue oxygen delivery or uptake. Although the evidence base for red cell transfusion practice is incomplete, randomized studies across a range of clinical settings, including surgery, consistently support the restrictive use of red cells, with no evidence of benefit for maintaining patients at higher haemoglobin thresholds (liberal strategy).

A recent meta-analysis of 7,593 patients concluded that a restrictive transfusion strategy was associated with a reduced risk of healthcare-associated infections (pneumonia, mediastinitis, wound infection, sepsis) when compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. The degree to which the optimal haemoglobin concentration or transfusion trigger should be modified for patients with additional specific risk factors (e.g. ischaemic heart disease) remains less clear and requires further research.

Although most clinical practice guidelines recommend restrictive use of red cells, and many blood transfusion services have seen marked falls in overall usage of red cells, the use of other blood components such as fresh frozen plasma, platelets, and cryoprecipitate has risen. In clinical practice, the administration of fresh frozen plasma is usually guided by laboratory tests of coagulation, mainly prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, and activated partial thromboplastin time, but the predictive value of these tests is…

### Blood utilisation and transfusion reactions in adult patients transfused with conventional or pathogen-reduced platelets [^111A4LAh]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Low credibility.

The availability and safety of blood transfusion is a fundamental public health responsibility overseen in the United States by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Internationally, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends adopting policies to improve the quality, safety, and availability of blood [WHO, 2017]. While transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs) are rare compared to other adverse events (AEs) of transfusion, they remain a source of morbidity and are responsible for 10% of transfusion-related mortality [Bihl et al, 2007].

The search for methods to reduce the risk of TTIs led to a detailed donor selection process and the development of serological and nucleic acid tests for known pathogens, with a focus on viral and parasitic infections. Additionally, platelet components are cultured to screen for bacterial pathogens caused either by bacteraemia in the donor or by contamination during collection or processing. These efforts are generally considered "reactive" or "passive", as the testing is done to detect known pathogens rather than remove potential pathogens from the blood supply.

Reactive approaches have been employed multiple times in the past with emerging infections, including human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, Babesia, and Zika virus, among others. However, even for known pathogens, test failures and serological window periods can lead to false-negative results. Passive approaches to screen for bacterial contamination also present challenges, especially in platelet units stored at room temperature.

### How I treat patients who are refractory to platelet transfusions [^113ee6RA]. Blood (2025). High credibility.

Patients with thrombocytopenia requiring ongoing platelet transfusion support may develop inadequate platelet count increments, referred to as platelet refractoriness (PR), which further complicates their care. The underlying etiologies of PR can be broadly divided into immune and nonimmune causes. A high index of suspicion is required to initiate testing for alloimmunization, and the leading culprit in immune PR is the development of class I HLA antibodies.

The approach to the diagnosis of immune PR has changed over recent years with new technologies, but questions regarding the clinical significance and interpretation of these methods have not been conclusively answered. The provision of HLA-matched platelets requires close and timely coordination between transfusion services and clinical teams; however, the true impact of their provision on clinical outcomes is not clear. This paper reviews diagnostic and management challenges, appraises the existing data available to support treatment options, and identifies research gaps.
