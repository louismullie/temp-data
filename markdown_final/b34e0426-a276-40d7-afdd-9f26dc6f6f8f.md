diabetes step up medication

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a stepwise medication intensification plan for type 2 diabetes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about foundational principles and glycemic targets. Then, I should verify the initial therapy choices and when to start combination therapy. Next, I will examine first-line intensification options and how to select among them. After that, I need to check insulin initiation thresholds and preferred combinations. Then, I will review insulin intensification strategies and how to avoid overbasalization. Finally, I should consider special populations, deintensification, and a practical monitoring cadence to avoid therapeutic inertia.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principles and targets so I don't jump to conclusions. Type 2 diabetes is progressive, so therapy must be dynamic and individualized, balancing efficacy, hypoglycemia risk, weight effects, comorbidities, and patient preferences; shared decision-making is essential, and I should avoid therapeutic inertia by reassessing and modifying treatment every 3–6 months when goals are not met [^115n3kKz] [^112UhBgF] [^112KqxYW]. For most nonpregnant adults, an A1C goal around 7% is reasonable, with more stringent targets for some and less stringent targets for those with limited life expectancy, severe hypoglycemia, or multiple comorbidities; the VA/DoD suggests a pragmatic 7.0–8.5% range for many patients if safely achievable, which I should keep in mind for older or frail adults [^112z9Yaz] [^111FocK4].

> I need to check the initial therapy anchor. Unless contraindicated, metformin should be started at diagnosis alongside lifestyle interventions, titrated to a maximally tolerated dose, and continued as long as tolerated because of its favorable safety, weight neutrality, and compatibility with combination therapy; this is consistent across ADA, AACE, and ACP guidance [^114dK8ee] [^114o419W] [^116xFxwU]. Hold on, I should verify the timing of combination therapy; ADA 2025 supports considering combination therapy at initiation to shorten time to goal, particularly when A1C is above about 7.5–8.0% or when rapid control is needed, which aligns with modern evidence favoring early combination in appropriate patients [^116WNWFw].

> Next, I should review first-line intensification when A1C remains above goal after 3 months of metformin. ADA 2025 recommends GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors as preferred add-on options, with selection tailored to cardiorenal risk, weight goals, and hypoglycemia risk; ACP similarly prioritizes adding an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 agonist for their mortality and cardiorenal benefits, and I should avoid adding a DPP-4 inhibitor to metformin because it does not reduce morbidity or mortality and offers limited incremental benefit in that context [^116przRK] [^111ucKR7] [^116EFrYW]. Wait, let me verify the DPP-4 point; yes, ACP issues a strong recommendation against adding DPP-4 to metformin for glycemic control to reduce morbidity and mortality, which supports choosing GLP-1 RA or SGLT2 instead when intensifying [^112btP1f].

> I will now examine insulin initiation thresholds, since missing these delays control. Insulin should be initiated if there are symptoms of hyperglycemia or when A1C is very high (generally > 10%) or glucose is ≥ 300 mg/dL; in the absence of insulin deficiency, GLP-1 RA or dual GIP/GLP-1 RA is preferred to insulin, but insulin cannot be delayed when catabolic or severely hyperglycemic features are present [^115C63cJ] [^112KqxYW]. Hold on, I should verify AACE's stance on symptomatic hyperglycemia; AACE advises that basal insulin with or without prandial coverage may be needed initially when A1C is > 10% and/or glucose > 300 mg/dL with catabolic symptoms, and GLP-1 RA alone is not recommended in this acute setting due to titration lag, which reinforces the need for timely insulin in severe presentations [^116t4cvs].

> Let me consider insulin-first scenarios and how to combine rationally. If insulin is used, combining with a GLP-1 RA or dual GIP/GLP-1 RA improves glycemic effectiveness, lowers hypoglycemia risk, and mitigates weight gain compared with insulin alone; fixed-ratio combinations like iDegLira or iGlarLixi offer once-daily dosing and have supportive real-world data for durability and safety, which can simplify regimens and improve adherence [^115C63cJ] [^111vBSgY] [^116dQwNm]. I should double-check that ADA explicitly supports this combination approach and dose reassessment upon GLP-1 addition; yes, ADA 2025 does recommend reassessing insulin dosing when adding or escalating GLP-1 therapy, which is critical to avoid hypoglycemia [^115C63cJ].

> Next, I should review how to intensify when basal insulin alone is insufficient. If fasting glucose is at goal but A1C remains above target, or if there is significant postprandial hyperglycemia or evidence of overbasalization, I should either add a GLP-1 RA or dual GIP/GLP-1 RA, or initiate prandial insulin using a basal-plus approach starting with the largest meal; practical dosing starts with 4 units or about 10% of the basal dose before that meal, with titration every few days to premeal targets, and I should maintain metformin, SGLT2 inhibitor, and GLP-1 RA when appropriate while limiting or discontinuing sulfonylureas to reduce hypoglycemia risk [^117TKWu3] [^114vL31g]. Wait, let me verify the sequence; ADA favors GLP-1 RA addition before layering multiple prandial injections when feasible due to weight and hypoglycemia advantages, which I should prioritize in shared decision-making [^117TKWu3].

> I need to ensure I address overbasalization and regimen complexity. If basal insulin exceeds about 0.5 units/kg without achieving A1C targets, I should suspect overbasalization and pivot to prandial coverage or GLP-1 RA rather than further basal escalation; for patients on complex regimens with recurrent hypoglycemia or high burden, simplification to fixed-ratio combinations or fewer injections can maintain control with less risk, and I should regularly reassess whether deintensification is warranted when benefits no longer outweigh harms [^117TKWu3] [^114UhzHN]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines endorse simplification; expert panels support simplification to improve adherence and safety without sacrificing efficacy in appropriate patients, which aligns with a patient-centered approach [^114UhzHN].

> Let me think about special populations so I don't overgeneralize. In older adults or those with limited life expectancy, less stringent A1C targets and deintensification of hypoglycemia-prone agents are appropriate; in youth, maximize noninsulin therapies such as metformin, GLP-1 RA, and empagliflozin before escalating insulin when safe and indicated; in patients with established ASCVD, HF, or CKD, prioritize GLP-1 RA and/or SGLT2 inhibitors irrespective of A1C for comprehensive risk reduction, and in pregnancy or specific comorbid states, tailor choices to safety profiles and regulatory guidance [^1111fM3o] [^116cvRMY] [^115KUzAa]. I should confirm that ADA supports cardiorenal benefit–driven selection independent of A1C; yes, ADA 2025 explicitly recommends including GLP-1 RA and/or SGLT2 inhibitors for patients with established or high risk of ASCVD, HF, or CKD regardless of baseline A1C [^116przRK].

> I should double-check the monitoring cadence and triggers for action to avoid inertia. Reassess every 3–6 months and intensify promptly if A1C is above goal; when adding GLP-1 RA to insulin, reassess insulin dosing and consider down-titration to mitigate hypoglycemia; when initiating weight-loss pharmacotherapy, monitor early response and adjust or discontinue if early weight loss is insufficient, aligning with shared decision-making to balance efficacy, tolerability, and burden [^112KqxYW] [^115C63cJ] [^1154aeeq]. But wait, what if the patient is stable and near goal? Even then, periodic reassessment prevents overtreatment and allows timely deintensification when risks outweigh benefits, which is especially important in older adults [^1111fM3o].

> Putting this together, my stepwise approach is as follows, and I will sanity-check each transition against the evidence as I go. Start metformin at diagnosis with lifestyle therapy and titrate to tolerance; if A1C remains above goal after about 3 months, add GLP-1 RA or SGLT2 inhibitor based on cardiorenal risk, weight, and hypoglycemia considerations; if A1C is very high or there is symptomatic hyperglycemia, initiate insulin without undue delay and combine with GLP-1 RA when possible; if basal insulin is titrated to an appropriate dose but A1C remains above goal or postprandial excursions persist, add GLP-1 RA or implement basal-plus prandial insulin; reassess every 3–6 months and simplify regimens when complexity undermines safety or adherence, all while individualizing targets and avoiding therapeutic inertia [^115C63cJ] [^112KqxYW] [^117TKWu3] [^112UhBgF].

The step-up medication approach for type 2 diabetes is a **progressive, individualized strategy** that begins with metformin and lifestyle changes, then adds agents based on A1C, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^111qpTGw]. For A1C ≥ 7.5% or ≥ 1.5% above goal, **add a second agent** (GLP-1 RA, SGLT2 inhibitor, or basal insulin) [^112dHfyA]; for A1C ≥ 9% or ≥ 1.5% above goal, consider **dual or triple therapy** [^114o5Fsx]. Prioritize GLP-1 RAs or SGLT2 inhibitors for cardiovascular/renal benefit, and use insulin when A1C > 10% or glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL [^115C63cJ]. Reassess every 3–6 months and adjust therapy to maintain individualized A1C targets while minimizing hypoglycemia and weight gain [^112UhBgF] [^112KqxYW].

---

## Initial therapy: metformin and lifestyle interventions

- **Metformin**: First-line unless contraindicated; continue as long as tolerated [^117H4U9h].
- **Lifestyle**: Diet, exercise, and weight management are foundational and continued throughout [^114dK8ee].
- **Monitoring**: Reassess every 3–6 months; intensify if A1C is above goal [^112KqxYW].

---

## Step-up therapy: adding second-line agents

Add a second agent if A1C remains ≥ 7.5% or ≥ 1.5% above goal after 3 months of metformin; **agent selection** should be individualized based on comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, weight, and patient preference [^116przRK].

| **Medication class** | **Indications** | **Benefits** | **Considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| GLP-1 receptor agonists | - Cardiovascular disease <br/> - Obesity <br/> - Need for weight loss | - Cardiovascular risk reduction <br/> - Weight loss <br/> - Low hypoglycemia | - Gastrointestinal side effects <br/> - Injectable |
| SGLT2 inhibitors | - Cardiovascular disease <br/> - Chronic kidney disease <br/> - Heart failure | - Cardiovascular and renal benefits <br/> - Weight loss <br/> - Low hypoglycemia | - Genital infections <br/> - Volume depletion |
| Basal insulin | - A1C > 10% <br/> - Glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL <br/> - Symptomatic hyperglycemia | - Potent glucose lowering <br/> - Rapid control | - Hypoglycemia <br/> - Weight gain <br/> - Injection |
| DPP-4 inhibitors | - Elderly <br/> - Low hypoglycemia risk | - Low hypoglycemia <br/> - Oral | - Limited efficacy <br/> - No cardiovascular benefit |
| Sulfonylureas | - Low cost <br/> - Short-term use | - Potent glucose lowering <br/> - Oral | - Hypoglycemia <br/> - Weight gain |

---

## Step-up therapy: adding third-line agents

Consider **triple therapy** if dual therapy fails to achieve A1C targets, with selection tailored to comorbidities and patient preference [^114o5Fsx].

---

## Special considerations

- **Cardiovascular/renal disease**: Prioritize GLP-1 RAs or SGLT2 inhibitors for added benefit [^115KUzAa].
- **Hypoglycemia risk**: Prefer GLP-1 RAs, SGLT2 inhibitors, or DPP-4 inhibitors [^111qpTGw].
- **Obesity**: Favor GLP-1 RAs or SGLT2 inhibitors for weight loss [^111qpTGw].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

Regular **monitoring** with A1C checks every 3–6 months guides timely intensification or deintensification [^112KqxYW]. Individualized **targets** should reflect age, comorbidities, and patient preference, with less stringent goals for the elderly or those with limited life expectancy [^112z9Yaz].

---

## Summary of step-up approach

Begin with **metformin plus lifestyle**; add a second agent if A1C remains elevated, and escalate to triple therapy if needed. Prioritize GLP-1 RAs or SGLT2 inhibitors for cardiovascular/renal benefit, and use insulin for severe hyperglycemia. Reassess every 3–6 months to maintain individualized A1C targets while minimizing hypoglycemia and weight gain.

### Early insulin treatment in type 2 diabetes: what are the pros? [^111oFx64]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The prevalence of diabetes in the world is growing at an unprecedented rate and rapidly becoming a health concern and burden in both developed and developing countries. In addition, we are now witnessing an upsurge in the incidence of type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents, with the potential of translating into a future catastrophic disease burden as vascular complications of the disease begin affecting a younger population. Although there may be contention regarding the impact of lowering glycemia on macrovascular disease risk, there is strong consensus of the definite benefits of lowering blood glucose to reduce the risk of retinopathy and nephropathy in either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Despite supporting data and multiple guidelines advanced by professional organizations, overall glycemic control falls far below expectations. Overall, < 36% of individuals with diabetes are at recommended glycemic targets, with the most difficult-to-control cases represented by insulin-deficient individuals on insulin therapy to manage their diabetes. Furthermore, as β-cell dysfunction progresses over time, many patients with type 2 diabetes, treated with oral agents, fail to achieve or maintain adequate glycemic control. Unfortunately, in many of these cases, antiglycemic therapy is not adjusted or advanced, thereby exposing patients to prolonged hyperglycemia and the increased risk of diabetes-related complications. The term "clinical inertia", which has come to define the lack of initiation, or intensification of therapy when clinically indicated, is most pronounced in the setting of insulin initiation. Subjects with type 2 diabetes, managed in a large integrated health care system, were initiated on additional blood glucose–lowering treatment only when the mean baseline A1C reached a value of 9.0%. Patients started on insulin had an even higher mean A1C of 9.6% and tended to have more severe baseline complications and comorbidities than those started on sulfonylurea, or metformin therapy. In addition, the higher the starting A1C when therapy was initiated or changed, the less likely the patient was of achieving adequate glycemic control. Although specialists are slightly more proficient than general practitioners in intensifying diabetes therapy when warranted, overall clinical inertia results in the majority of patients failing to achieve, or maintain, adequate metabolic goals from a period of months to several years. In summary, to improve these suboptimal metabolic outcomes, and reduce the risk of disease-related complications, more intensive management of glycemia is warranted, including the option of introducing insulin therapy earlier than the current widely practiced substandard of care.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^115C63cJ]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment — insulin thresholds and combinations specify that in adults with type 2 diabetes, initiation of insulin should be considered if symptoms of hyperglycemia are present or when A1C or blood glucose levels are very high (i.e. A1C > 10% [≥ 86 mmol/mol] or blood glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL [≥ 16.7 mmol/L]); in adults with type 2 diabetes and no evidence of insulin deficiency, a GLP-1 RA, including a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, is preferred to insulin; if insulin is used, combination therapy with a GLP-1 RA, including a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, is recommended for greater glycemic effectiveness as well as beneficial effects on weight and hypoglycemia risk for adults with type 2 diabetes, and insulin dosing should be reassessed upon addition or dose escalation of a GLP-1 RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA; and in adults initiating insulin therapy, continue glucose-lowering agents (unless contraindicated or not tolerated) for ongoing glycemic and metabolic benefits.

### Evidence-based recommendations for insulin intensification strategies after basal insulin in type 2 diabetes [^115sgDCs]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

Over the time due to progressive nature of diabetes, proactive intensification of the existing insulin therapy becomes imminent as it minimizes patients' exposure to chronic hypo/hyperglycaemia and reduces weight gain while achieving individualized glycaemic targets. This review focuses on the strength of evidence behind various options for intensification, primarily the insulins as also the GLP-1 analogues. The recommendations presented here are meant to serve as a guide for the physician managing type 2 diabetes patients requiring insulin intensification upon failing of basal insulin therapy.

### Treatment intensification in patients with inadequate glycemic control on basal insulin: rationale and clinical evidence for the use of short-acting and other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [^116uj1Wk]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

An estimated 40–50% 1 of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) do not achieve optimal glycemic control when treated with oral medications and basal insulin. In other patients, control is maintained until disease progression brings about the need for additional pharmacotherapeutic management 2. When basal insulin offers insufficient control, a common course of action is the intensification of insulin therapy with the addition of prandial insulin, which can be effective but presents drawbacks such as the requirement for patient training in self‐monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), weight gain and increased risk of hypoglycemia. Therefore, it is important to consider the individual patient's characteristics when deciding how to intensify therapy 2 and to consider options other than prandial insulin. Some patients will benefit from a different therapeutic approach, such as incretin‐based therapy with a glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist (GLP‐1 RA), dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP‐4) inhibitor or a sodium‐glucose co‐transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor as add‐on to basal insulin.

Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists exert an important action on glycemic control, show favourable effects on body weight and are associated with reduced risk of hypoglycemia; some have also demonstrated a complementary mechanism of action when combined with basal insulin 3. There are, however, several GLP‐1 RAs available, each with particular pharmacologic characteristics, which presents significant challenges for the clinician, including their correct positioning in the therapeutic algorithm. This review will discuss the rationale behind, and evidence for, the use of GLP‐1 RA therapies, in particular that of lixisenatide, versus other possible combination treatments, in patients who do not achieve glycemic control with basal insulin alone. Figure 1 shows a possible algorithm based on current guidelines 2 for intensification of basal insulin therapy, with particular regard to the placement of GLP‐1 RAs.

Medications

The characteristics of currently available glucose-lowering interventions, when used as monotherapy, are summarized in Table 1. The glucose-lowering effectiveness of individual therapies and combinations demonstrated in clinical trials is predicated not only on the intrinsic characteristics of the intervention but also on the duration of diabetes, baseline glycemia, previous therapy, and other factors. A major factor in selecting a class of drugs, or a specific medication within a class, to initiate therapy or when changing therapy, is the ambient level of glycemic control. When levels of glycemia are high (e.g. A1C > 8.5%), classes with greater and more rapid glucose-lowering effectiveness, or potentially earlier initiation of combination therapy, are recommended; however, patients with recent-onset diabetes often respond adequately to less intensive interventions than those with longer-term disease. When glycemic levels are closer to the target levels (e.g. A1C < 7.5%), medications with lesser potential to lower glycemia and/or a slower onset of action may be considered.

Obviously, the choice of glycemic goals and the medications used to achieve them must be individualized for each patient, balancing the potential for lowering A1C and anticipated long-term benefit with specific safety issues, as well as other characteristics of regimens, including side effects, tolerability, ease of use, long-term adherence, expense, and the nonglycemic effects of the medications. Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease characterized by worsening glycemia; higher doses and additional medications are required over time if treatment goals are to be met.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to initial therapy, treatment intensification, ACP 2024 guidelines recommend to do not add a DPP4 inhibitor to metformin and lifestyle modifications in adult patients with T2DM with inadequate glycemic control to reduce morbidity and all-cause mortality.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^116qZT8W]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Glycemic management in type 2 diabetes mellitus has become increasingly complex and, to some extent, controversial, with a widening array of pharmacological agents now available, mounting concerns about their potential adverse effects and new uncertainties regarding the benefits of intensive glycemic control on macrovascular complications. Many clinicians are therefore perplexed as to the optimal strategies for their patients. As a consequence, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) convened a joint task force to examine the evidence and develop recommendations for antihyperglycemic therapy in nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes. Several guideline documents have been developed by members of these two organizations and by other societies and federations (,–). However, an update was deemed necessary because of contemporary information on the benefits/risks of glycemic control, recent evidence concerning efficacy and safety of several new drug classes, the withdrawal/restriction of others, and increasing calls for a move toward more patient-centered care.

This statement has been written incorporating the best available evidence and, where solid support does not exist, using the experience and insight of the writing group, incorporating an extensive review by additional experts (acknowledged below). The document refers to glycemic control; yet this clearly needs to be pursued within a multifactorial risk reduction framework. This stems from the fact that patients with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; the aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure and lipid therapy, antiplatelet treatment, and smoking cessation) is likely to have even greater benefits.

These recommendations should be considered within the context of the needs, preferences, and tolerances of each patient; individualization of treatment is the cornerstone of success. Our recommendations are less prescriptive than and not as algorithmic as prior guidelines. This follows from the general lack of comparative-effectiveness research in this area. Our intent is therefore to encourage an appreciation of the variable and progressive nature of type 2 diabetes, the specific role of each drug, the patient and disease factors that drive clinical decision making, and the constraints imposed by age and comorbidity. The implementation of these guidelines will require thoughtful clinicians to integrate current evidence with other constraints and imperatives in the context of patient-specific factors.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment of type 2 diabetes: synopsis of the 2020 American diabetes association's standards of medical care in diabetes clinical guideline [^113UpWzV]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Description

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) updates the Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes annually to provide clinicians, patients, researchers, payers, and other interested parties with evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of diabetes.

Methods

To develop the 2020 Standards, the ADA Professional Practice Committee, comprising physicians, adult and pediatric endocrinologists, diabetes educators, registered dietitians, epidemiologists, pharmacists, and public health experts, continuously searched MEDLINE (English language only) from 15 October 2018 through August-September 2019 for pertinent studies, including high-quality trials that addressed pharmacologic management of type 2 diabetes. The committee selected and reviewed the studies, developed the recommendations, and solicited feedback from the larger clinical community.

Recommendations

This synopsis focuses on guidance relating to the pharmacologic treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. Recommendations address oral and noninsulin injectable therapies, insulin treatment, and combination injectable therapies. Results of recent large trials with cardiovascular and renal outcomes are emphasized.

### Current antihyperglycemic treatment guidelines and algorithms for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113tKjX8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. While lifestyle interventions such as medical nutrition therapy and appropriately prescribed physical activity remain cornerstones of disease prevention and treatment, most patients with type 2 diabetes will eventually require pharmacotherapy for glycemic control. Fortunately, many of these patients are able to achieve desired glycemic targets with the use of currently available antihyperglycemic agents. Both not-for-profit disease-specific organizations and healthcare specialty societies have provided guidance about the appropriate selection of these therapies. Type 2 diabetes treatment guidelines and algorithms have been developed, taking into account a combination of evidence-based information and expert opinions, with various groups offering diverse glucose goals and approaches to hyperglycemia management. Virtually all recognize that type 2 diabetes is a multifaceted disease, necessitating an integrated yet individualized approach to patient care.

### An evidence-based medicine approach to antihyperglycemic therapy in diabetes mellitus to overcome overtreatment [^116p9qDh]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Overtreatment is pervasive in medicine and leads to potential patient harms and excessive costs in health care. Although evidence-based medicine is often derided as practice by rote algorithmic medicine, the appropriate application of key evidence-based medicine principles in clinical decision making is fundamental to preventing overtreatment and promoting high-value, individualized patient-centered care. Specifically, this article discusses the importance of (1) using absolute rather than relative estimates of benefits to inform treatment decisions; (2) considering the time horizon to benefit of treatments; (3) balancing potential harms and benefits; and (4) using shared decision making by physicians to incorporate the patient's values and preferences into treatment decisions. Here, we illustrate the application of these principles to considering the decision of whether or not to recommend intensive glycemic control to patients to minimize microvascular and cardiovascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Through this lens, this example will illustrate how an evidence-based medicine approach can be used to individualize glycemic goals and prevent overtreatment, and can serve as a template for applying evidence-based medicine to inform treatment decisions for other conditions to optimize health and individualize patient care.

### Basal insulin intensification in patients with type 2 diabetes: a review [^114zNrvZ]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

As the number of people living with type 2 diabetes (T2D) continues to rise, managing their complex needs presents an increasing challenge to physicians. While treatment guidelines provide evidence-based guidance, they are not prescriptive-rather they emphasize individualization of management based on a patient's clinical needs and preferences. Physicians, therefore, need to be fully aware of the advantages and disadvantages of the multiple and increasing treatment options available to them at each stage of the disease. The progressive nature of T2D means that treatment with basal insulin will become inevitable for many patients, while for some patients basal insulin alone will eventually be insufficient for maintaining glycemic targets. Recent guidelines recommend two basic approaches for intensifying basal insulin: the use of rapid-acting insulin, either as additional prandial injections or as part of premix (biphasic) insulin; and the addition of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) to the insulin therapy, which can be administered via subcutaneous injection once or twice daily, or weekly depending on formulation. More recently, two fixed-ratio combinations of basal insulin and a GLP-1 RA that allow for once-daily dosing have been approved. Each of these approaches has potential benefits and drawbacks, particularly in terms of risk for hypoglycemia, weight change, convenience, and side effects. Understanding these differences is central to guiding patient and physician choice. This article discusses the rationale, advantages, disadvantages, and implementation of currently available strategies for basal insulin treatment intensification in patients with T2D.

### Characterization of the open-label lead-in period of two randomized controlled phase 3 trials evaluating dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, and metformin in type 2 diabetes [^112bzkv2]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease characterized by a decline in β-cell function and loss of glycemic control. Achieving control of glucose levels is a major focus of treatment. Current guidelines recommend metformin as first-line glucose-lowering therapy in people with type 2 diabetes, with stepwise addition of other antidiabetes agents as glycemic control deteriorates. A wide range of second- and subsequent-line therapies are available for this purpose, each targeting various aspects of the disease pathophysiology; however, there is no clear consensus on the optimal treatment regimen for patients with type 2 diabetes that is inadequately controlled with metformin alone. A key consideration is the need to balance efficacy with the potential risks of adverse effects, and guidelines recommend transition to triple therapy if glycemic targets are not reached or maintained after 3 months of dual therapy. However, treatment intensification in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes is often delayed.

### How can we implement current therapies and interventions to achieve glycemic control? [^116Sawje]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To discuss the appropriate use of oral therapies to achieve and sustain glycemic targets in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

The stages in the development and progression of type 2 diabetes are reviewed, and the limitations of single-drug therapy are addressed.

Results

The development of diabetes is a staged progression; affected patients show evolution through numerous stages of glucose intolerance before clinical diabetes manifests. Beta cell function continues to deteriorate until absolute failure occurs; however, other factors, such as glucose and lipid toxicities, insulin resistance in peripheral tissues, and loss of the first-phase insulin response, further impair the body's ability to regulate release of insulin in response to glucose. Traditional treatment algorithms often fail to address the progressive, multifaceted nature of type 2 diabetes, with its numerous related abnormalities. Combination therapy with orally administered agents can be used to manage glucose concentrations and other risk factors safely and effectively.

Conclusion

The therapeutic goal in type 2 diabetes is to achieve and maintain a physiologic profile as close to normal as possible. This outcome necessitates treatment of multiple defects with use of various combinations of orally administered agents. Clinicians should focus on effective treatment of these defects to achieve established targets.

### Guideline approach to therapy in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes [^111wdWcV]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Case for guidelines

Evidence-based recommendations should be at the core of the guidelines. Not all practice guidelines on antihyperglycemic drugs, however, are consistent with available evidence. Patient enrollment in clinical studies is also based mainly on baseline A1C, and treatment of a comparator is sometimes chosen unrelated to its pathophysiologic effect on hyperglycemia.

Our past experience with antihyperglycemic drugs is that recommendations to stepwise increase these drugs whenever A1C is above target might fail to prevent disease progression, necessitating intensive insulin therapy over time. This might be due to delayed reaction by the physician to a patient's change in A1C. One possible reason for this delay is that the other antihyperglycemic drugs (other than metformin), i.e. sulfonylureas and peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor (PPAR)-γ, have side effects that discourage physicians from recommending them as soon as A1C is above target. Introduction of insulin therapy in patients not at target, in particular, is also delayed substantially. At this stage, aiming to target with intensive insulin therapy might increase the risk for morbidity and mortality while the already long hyperglycemic exposure still puts the patient at great risk for late micro- and macrovascular complications (,–). The newer available drugs (incretins as well as sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors), owing to their efficacy and relatively mild side effects, could change physicians' inertia in such a way that they will prescribe these drugs at a much earlier stage — as soon as A1C is above target. This earlier intervention could prevent treat to failure and be as effective as early combination therapy.

### Options for combination therapy in type 2 diabetes: comparison of the ADA / EASD position statement and AACE / ACE algorithm [^113paztV]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Treating patients with diabetes is one of the most challenging and important activities a physician (primary care physician or specialist) can undertake. A key to successful therapy for type 2 diabetes is the insight that this condition is progressive and that the need for additional agents over time is normative. The ability to individualize therapy by patient and medication characteristics comes from experience and knowledge of pertinent clinical studies. However, guidelines from expert bodies such as the American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology can help clinicians of all levels of expertise to approach therapy choices more rationally. There is unity across these guidelines about the role and benefits of metformin as first-line pharmacological treatment, probability of good efficacy, low risk of hypoglycemia, modest weight loss, and overall long-term data. Unfortunately, this unity does not extend to recommendations for subsequent pharmacological agents and their use in combination to intensify treatment when insulin is not (yet) appropriate. Across both statements, some drug classes seem more prominent, and looking at their benefit-risk profile, it is clear why this is the case. The most profound recent change in diabetes therapy has been the introduction of incretin therapies. Incretin therapies minimize 2 important adverse effects seen with many other therapies: hypoglycemia and weight gain. These agents have increased the range of options available for early intensification of treatment of type 2 diabetes. In combination with more established therapies, there are more opportunities than ever to accommodate patient preferences while improving glycemic control and harnessing extraglycemic benefits of a second (or third) agent.

### Newer pharmacologic treatments in adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^111qpTGw]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Clinical considerations — initial and add-on therapy emphasize that metformin (unless contraindicated) and lifestyle modifications are the first steps in managing type 2 diabetes in most patients; clinicians should prioritize adding SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes and CHF or CKD and should prioritize adding GLP-1 agonists in patients with an increased risk for stroke or when total body weight loss is an important goal; clinicians should aim to achieve HbA1c levels between 7% and 8% in most adults with type 2 diabetes and deintensify pharmacologic treatments in adults with HbA1c levels less than 6.5%; self-monitoring of blood glucose might be unnecessary for patients not receiving insulin; when SGLT-2 or GLP-1 therapy yields adequate glycemic control, clinicians should reduce or discontinue sulfonylureas or long-acting insulins due to increased risk for severe hypoglycemia; sulfonylureas and long-acting insulins are inferior to SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists in reducing all-cause mortality and morbidity but may have limited value for glycemic control.

Step 2: addition of a second medication.

If lifestyle intervention and the maximal tolerated dose of metformin fail to achieve or sustain the glycemic goals, another medication should be added within 2–3 months of the initiation of therapy or at any time when the target A1C level is not achieved. Another medication may also be necessary if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated. The consensus regarding the second medication added to metformin was to choose either insulin or a sulfonylurea (Fig. 2). As discussed above, the A1C level will determine in part which agent is selected next, with consideration given to the more effective glycemia-lowering agent, insulin, for patients with an A1C level of > 8.5% or with symptoms secondary to ehyperglycemia. Insulin can be initiated with a basal (intermediate- or long-acting) insulin (see Fig. 1 for suggested initial insulin regimens). However, many newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients will usually respond to oral medications, even if symptoms of ehyperglycemia are present.

Step 3: further adjustments.

If lifestyle, metformin, and sulfonylurea or basal insulin do not result in achievement of target glycemia, the next step should be to start, or intensify, insulin therapy (Fig. 1). Intensification of insulin therapy usually consists of additional injections that might include a short- or rapid-acting insulin given before selected meals to reduce postprandial glucose excursions (Fig. 1). When insulin injections are started, insulin secretagogues (sulfonylurea or glinides) should be discontinued, or tapered and then discontinued, since they are not considered to be synergistic. Although addition of a third oral agent can be considered, especially if the A1C level is close to target (A1C < 8.0%), this approach is usually not preferred, as it is no more effective in lowering glycemia, and is more costly, than initiating or intensifying insulin.

Antihyperglycemic medications should be titrated to the maximally tolerated dose and additional agents should be considered in a timely fashion to avoid therapeutic inertia. If the A1C is > 9% or ≥ 1.5% above goal, ≥ 2 antihyperglycemic agents may need to be initiated at once.

### Advancing therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus with early, comprehensive progression from oral agents to insulin therapy [^114RA5Bo]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Early and intensive glycemic control is necessary to prevent or minimize the development of microvascular and macrovascular complications in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, many patients are unable to attain glycemic control, partly due to protracted treatment with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) despite inadequate control and barriers to initiating insulin therapy. Patients at different stages of disease may benefit from the early introduction of intensive glycemic control.

Objective

This article discusses some of the potential barriers to achieving and maintaining optimal glycemic levels in patients whose blood glucose is sub-optimally controlled with OADs and reviews the benefits of early introduction of intensive glycemic control in patients at various stages of disease, with an emphasis on insulin therapy.

Methods

Relevant English-language articles published from 1996 to 2006 were identified through searches of the National Center for Biotechnology PubMed database. Search terms included insulin, insulin therapy, type 2 diabetes, insulin analogs, early insulinization, and diabetes prevention, among others. Studies were assessed regarding designs, primary and secondary efficacy parameters, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose, incidence of hypoglycemia, and other safety assessments. Inclusion criteria were multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group trials, as well as retrospective observational studies, conducted in Europe or the United States. Additional analyses and guideline-based recommendations are included.

Results

The landmark results of the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study, which found that an intensive strategy in 3867 newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes was associated with stricter glycemic control than was conventional care (HbA1c over 10 years, 7.0% vs 7.9%; P < 0.001), as well as a 25% reduction in the risk for microvascular complications (P = 0.01). Early initiation of insulin therapy concomitantly with OADs appeared well tolerated in the populations studied, was effective in recently diagnosed patients, and may also confer anti-inflammatory and antiatherogenic effects. Characteristics associated with newer formulations of insulin (eg, basal insulin analogues as well as rapid-acting insulin analogues, the insulin pump, or inhaled insulin) may help overcome barriers associated with initiating insulin therapy.

Conclusions

Based on the literature, early and persistent intensification of antidiabetic therapy is an approach that most likely will achieve optimal glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes and help prevent associated complications. Greater clinical experience with newer therapeutic approaches, including incretin mimetics and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitors, will provide insight into their place in the spectrum of diabetes treatments.

### Can newer therapies delay the progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus? [^115VRrom]. Endocrine Practice (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the multifactorial and progressive nature of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the consequences of its progression, and the potential of traditional and newer therapies to delay the progression of this disease.

Methods

The relevant literature is reviewed, and the mechanisms of action of novel agents for treatment of T2DM are discussed.

Results

The global prevalence of diabetes has been increasing in recent decades, reaching near-epidemic proportions, and is projected to more than double by 2030. More than 90% of cases of diabetes in most countries consist of T2DM, but many individuals remain undiagnosed or are diagnosed only after their disease has progressed considerably. Inadequate glycemic control in a majority of patients with T2DM is due to the progressive nature of the disease, delay in initiating pharmacotherapy, and failure to intensify treatment more quickly in patients who do not achieve glycemic targets. Traditional oral therapies are usually effective at lowering hyperglycemia initially but do not prevent disease progression; thus, many patients ultimately require insulin. Furthermore, because most antidiabetic therapies are associated with weight gain or risk of hypoglycemia (or both), patients may not adhere to treatment recommendations.

Conclusion

A new therapeutic approach focuses on the use of the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1. Analogues of this hormone delay the progression of beta-cell dysfunction and promote beta-cell regeneration in animal models. In clinical trials, they have been shown to improve glycemic control by increasing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and suppressing glucagon secretion. At high concentrations, they also slow gastric emptying and increase satiety, which often promotes weight loss. Another approach is to inhibit the enzyme dipeptidyl-peptidase 4, which rapidly inactivates glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, thereby increasing endogenous incretin levels.

Choosing specific diabetes interventions and their roles in treating type 2 diabetes

Numerous reviews have focused on the characteristics of the specific diabetes interventions listed below. In addition, meta-analyses and reviews have summarized and compared the glucose-lowering effectiveness and other characteristics of the medications. The aim here is to provide enough information to justify the choices of medications, the order in which they are recommended, and the use of combinations of therapies. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of high-quality studies that provide head-to-head comparisons of the ability of the medications to achieve the currently recommended glycemic levels. The authors highly recommend that such studies be conducted. However, even in the absence of rigorous, comprehensive studies that directly compare the efficacy of all available glucose-lowering treatments and their combinations, we feel that there are enough data regarding the characteristics of the individual interventions to provide the guidelines below.

An important intervention that is likely to improve the probability that a patient will have better long-term control of diabetes is to make the diagnosis early, when the metabolic abnormalities of diabetes are usually less severe. Lower levels of glycemia at the time of initial therapy are associated with lower A1C levels over time and decreased long-term complications.

Antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy for persons with type 2 diabetes — treatment escalation thresholds specify that for some recently diagnosed individuals with T2D and more severe hyperglycemia (A1C ≥ 7.5%), early combination pharmacotherapy should be considered, usually to include metformin plus another agent that does not cause hypoglycemia; for newly diagnosed persons with T2D and an entry A1C > 9.0% and/or ≥ 1.5% above target, clinicians should initiate dual- or possibly triple-combination pharmacotherapy usually including metformin, and basal insulin along with noninsulin therapy is recommended if there are significant signs or symptoms of hyperglycemia, especially including catabolism or a very high A1C > 10% (86 mmol/mol) or BG levels ≥ 300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L); persons with T2D initially treated with monotherapy who do not achieve or maintain glycemic targets should progress to dual-combination therapy and then triple-combination therapy, if needed, and use a basal insulin to adequately obtain and maintain control.

Conclusions

Type 2 diabetes is epidemic. Its long-term consequences translate into enormous human suffering and economic costs; however, much of the morbidity associated with long-term microvascular and neuropathic complications can be substantially reduced by interventions that achieve glucose levels close to the nondiabetic range. Although new classes of medications and numerous combinations have been demonstrated to lower glycemia, current-day management has failed to achieve and maintain the glycemic levels most likely to provide optimal healthcare status for people with diabetes.

### Changing the care pathway for type 2 diabetes at the time of diagnosis: the role of the multidisciplinary team [^116Zdwhc]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Conventionally, specialists become involved in the later stages of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, whereas evidence supports the role of time‐limited specialist input at the start of the treatment journey 1. The diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes should be seen as a key opportunity for multidisciplinary teams to intensify therapy aimed at quickly correcting underlying metabolic dysfunction.

Insulin resistance can precede diabetes for a decade 2, during which time β‐cell dysfunction and a higher cardiovascular risk have accrued 2. Over half of people with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes have evidence of diabetes‐related tissue damage 3; therefore, by the time of diagnosis, many years of metabolic dysfunction may have elapsed. Further treatment delay, in the belief that the condition is 'new' or 'mild', cannot be justified.

Current guidelines persist with the concept of a stepwise process to achieve glycaemic control: initial lifestyle intervention, followed by oral agents as monotherapy and then in combination, and finally insulin or glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist therapy 4. This paradigm is responsive to poor metabolic control after it has developed and mitigates against proactive intensification early in the disease trajectory. The National Institute for Clinical and Health Excellence (NICE) advocates continuation of pharmacological treatment until HbA 1c levels are ≥ 59 mmol/mol (7.5%) 4, which has been dubbed a 'treatment to failure' approach 5.

### Expert panel guidance and narrative review of treatment simplification of complex insulin regimens to improve outcomes in type 2 diabetes [^114UhzHN]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Given the progressive nature of type 2 diabetes (T2D), most individuals with the disease will ultimately undergo treatment intensification. This usually involves the stepwise addition of a new glucose-lowering agent or switching to a more complex insulin regimen. However, complex treatment regimens can result in an increased risk of hypoglycaemia and high treatment burden, which may impact negatively on both therapeutic adherence and overall quality of life. Individuals with good glycaemic control may also be overtreated with unnecessarily complex regimens. Treatment simplification aims to reduce individual treatment burden, without compromising therapeutic effectiveness or safety. Despite data showing that simplifying therapy can achieve good glycaemic control without negatively impacting on treatment efficacy or safety, it is not always implemented in clinical practice. Current clinical guidelines focus on treatment intensification, rather than simplification. Where simplification is recommended, clear guidance is lacking and mostly focused on treatment of the elderly. An expert, multidisciplinary panel evaluated the current treatment landscape with respect to guidance, published evidence, recommendations and approaches regarding simplification of complex insulin regimens. This article outlines the benefits of treatment simplification and provides practical recommendations on simplifying complex insulin treatment strategies in people with T2D using illustrative cases.

### Initiating therapy in patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes: combination therapy vs a stepwise approach [^114jH2JQ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

There is clear evidence that achieving glycaemic targets reduces the risk of developing complications as a result of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Many patients, however, continue to have suboptimal glycaemic control because of issues that include unclear advice on how to achieve these targets as well as clinical inertia. The two management approaches recommended for patients newly diagnosed with T2D are stepwise and combination therapy, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. Stepwise therapy may result in good patient adherence and allow greater individualization of therapy, and minimization of side effects and cost, and so may be appropriate for patients who are closer to goal. Stepwise therapy, however, may also lead to frequent delays in achieving glycaemic goals and longer exposure to hyperglycaemia. Combination therapy, which is now emerging as an important therapy option, has a number of potential advantages over stepwise therapy, including reduction in clinical inertia and earlier and more frequent achievement of glycated haemoglobin goals by targeting multiple pathogenic mechanisms simultaneously, which may more effectively delay disease progression. Compared with stepwise therapy, the disadvantages of combination therapy include reduced patient adherence resulting from complex, multi-drug regimens, difficulty determining the cause of poor efficacy and/or side effects, patient refusal to accept disease, and higher cost. Fixed-dose and fixed-ratio combinations are novel therapeutic approaches which may help address several issues of treatment complexity and patient burden associated with combination therapy comprising individual drugs. The choice of which drugs to administer and the decision to use stepwise vs combination therapy, however, should always be made on an individualized basis.

CONSERVATIVE MANAGEMENT

The "stepwise approach"' is usually adopted to manage glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. On diagnosis, lifestyle modification is initiated, followed by treatment with a single oral antidiabetic agent, which is often up-titrated to maximal recommended doses before combination therapy is introduced. However, this conservative approach has a number of drawbacks. On the contrary, a proactive approach and therapy tailored to the individual by methodical selection among available agents can optimize patient care.

Several clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of diet and exercise in preventing diabetes and reducing disease progression, but, as aforementioned, such regimens are difficult to implement and maintain, and glycemic control is rarely achieved. Hence, in conjunction with lifestyle intervention, pharmacologic approaches become the key component of diabetes management to the point that the recent American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes consensus suggested nutritional therapy should be initiated together with metformin. The latter is almost unanimously recognized as the drug of choice, but failure is expected to occur. In the UKPDS, after 9-year monotherapy, cumulative incidence of failure was 87% in obese patients randomized to metformin. In ADOPT, the 5-year cumulative incidence of metformin failure was 21%, and in two large retrospective analyses, the rate of metformin secondary failure was 35.5 and 38% at 4 and 5.7 years, respectively. Although different definitions for failure were used in these studies, all suggested that unacceptable therapeutic inertia occurs in clinical practice. Analysis of the 1994–2002 Kaiser Permanente Northwest database revealed that the average time between achieving A1C action point of 8% and switching to, or adding a second oral antidiabetic agent for patients on metformin, or sulfonylurea monotherapy, was 14.5 or 20.5 months, respectively. The authors of this analysis concluded that, "Clinicians should change glucose-lowering treatments in type 2 diabetes much sooner or use treatments that are less likely to fail". This view has been reinforced by the Global Partnership of Effective Diabetes Management and by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists. Taking the same approach is the more recent American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes consensus statement advocating individualized therapeutic choices to be considered as soon as A1C overcomes a 7.0% threshold, supporting more intensive and earlier use of combination therapy and introduction of insulin therapy if glycemic control is not achieved. Several studies have shown how early use of submaximal combination doses of agents can improve glycemic control without significantly increasing side effects. The use of multiple drugs should be considered not simply on the basis of greater efficacy, but also in terms of a rational therapeutic approach of the multiple pathogenetic mechanisms underlying hyperglycemia and its progression. In particular, the primary role of progressive loss of β-cell function should be taken into full consideration as discussed hereunder.

### Clinical inertia on insulin treatment intensification in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients of a tertiary public diabetes center with limited pharmacologic armamentarium from an upper-middle income country [^113LET28]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2018). Low credibility.

Background

There are significant evidences that hyperglycemia is associated to both microvascular and macrovascular complications and it is one of the risk factors on the clinical course of cardiovascular diseases. Nevertheless, uncontrolled glycemia is a global problem and most of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients often do not reach recommended glycemic targets in daily clinical practice.

Diabetes guidelines typically advocate a target glycated hemoglobin (A1c) value of 6.5 or 7.0% but highlight that glycemic management must be individualized (individually adjusted A1c), considering a less stringent goal (A1c between 7 and 8%) for the patients with severe hypoglycemia risk, elderly, limited life expectancy or extensive comorbid conditions.

Insulin should be considered for patients with T2DM when noninsulin antihyperglycemic therapy fails to achieve target glycemic control or when a patient has symptomatic hyperglycemia. While the difficulty of maintaining the desired A1c level over time is related to both lifestyle and type of prescribed medication, it derives primarily from the progressive decline in beta cell function, with the need of insulin as the natural result of this temporal process.

Another important aspect related to the difficulty of achieving and maintaining optimal glycemic control is the clinical inertia, defined as the failure to initiate or intensify therapy when indicated. It also may apply to the failure of physicians to stop or reduce therapy no longer needed. Clinical inertia for insulin introduction has been extensively studied in T2DM patients. It is well documented in Western countries, however similar data in low-middle income countries are lacking, specifically in the real world public healthcare system context where there are restrictions on antihyperglycemic therapy availability.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical inertia of insulin treatment intensification in a group of T2DM patients followed at a tertiary public Diabetes Center with limited pharmacologic armamentarium.

### A practical approach to the clinical challenges in initiation of basal insulin therapy in people with type 2 diabetes [^115Q2RgR]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Initiating insulin therapy with a basal insulin analogue has become a standard of care in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Despite increasing choices in pharmacological approaches, intensified glucose monitoring and improvements in quality of care, many patients do not achieve the desired level of glycaemic control. Although insulin therapy, when optimized, can help patients reach their glycaemic goals, there are barriers to treatment initiation on both the side of the patient and provider. Providers experience barriers based on their perceptions of patients' capabilities and concerns. They may lack the confidence to solve the practical problems of insulin therapy and avoid decisions they perceive as risky for their patients. In this study, we review recommendations for basal insulin initiation, focussing on glycaemic targets, titration, monitoring, and combination therapy with non-insulin anti-hyperglycaemic medications. We provide practical advice on how to address some of the key problems encountered in everyday clinical practice and give recommendations where there are gaps in knowledge or guidelines. We also discuss common challenges faced by people with T2DM, such as weight gain and hypoglycaemia, and how providers can address and overcome them.

Tier 1: well-validated core therapies

These interventions represent the best established and most effective and cost-effective therapeutic strategy for achieving the target glycemic goals. The tier one algorithm is the preferred route of therapy for most patients with type 2 diabetes.

Step 1: lifestyle intervention and metformin.

Based on the numerous demonstrated short- and long-term benefits that accrue when weight loss and increased levels of activity are achieved and maintained, as well as the cost-effectiveness of lifestyle interventions when they succeed, the consensus is that lifestyle interventions should be initiated as the first step in treating new-onset type 2 diabetes (Fig. 2). These interventions should be implemented by health care professionals with appropriate training — usually registered dietitians experienced in behavioral modification — and be sensitive to ethnic and cultural differences among populations. Moreover, lifestyle interventions to improve glucose, blood pressure, and lipid levels, and to promote weight loss or at least avoid weight gain, should remain an underlying theme throughout the management of type 2 diabetes, even after medications are used. For the 10–20% of patients with type 2 diabetes who are not obese or overweight, modification of dietary composition and activity levels may play a supporting role, but medications are still generally required early in the course of diabetes (seebelow).

The authors recognize that for most individuals with type 2 diabetes, lifestyle interventions fail to achieve or maintain the metabolic goals either because of failure to lose weight, weight regain, progressive disease, or a combination of factors. Therefore, our consensus is that metformin therapy should be initiated concurrently with lifestyle intervention at diagnosis. Metformin is recommended as the initial pharmacological therapy, in the absence of specific contraindications, for its effect on glycemia, absence of weight gain or hypoglycemia, generally low level of side effects, high level of acceptance, and relatively low cost. Metformin treatment should be titrated to its maximally effective dose over 1–2 months, as tolerated (see text box, entitled Titration of Metformin). Rapid addition of other glucose-lowering medications should be considered in the setting of persistent symptomatic hyperglycemia.

Algorithm

The algorithm (Fig. 2) takes into account the characteristics of the individual interventions, their synergies, and expense. The goal is to achieve and maintain A1C levels of < 7% and to change interventions at as rapid a pace as titration of medications allows when target glycemic goals are not being achieved. Mounting evidence suggests that aggressive lowering of glycemia, especially with insulin therapy, in newly diagnosed diabetes can result in sustained remissions, i.e. normoglycemia without need for glucose-lowering medications. Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease, and patients should be informed that they are likely to require the addition of glucose-lowering medications over time.

The amylin agonists, α-glucosidase inhibitors, glinides, and DPP-4 inhibitors are not included in the two tiers of preferred agents in this algorithm, owing to their lower or equivalent overall glucose-lowering effectiveness compared with the first- and second-tier agents and/or to their limited clinical data or relative expense (Table 1). However, they may be appropriate choices in selected patients.

Process

The guidelines and algorithm that follow are derived from two sources. One source is the clinical trials that address the effectiveness and safety of the different modalities of therapy. Here, the writing group reviewed a wide variety of studies related to the use of drugs as monotherapy or in combination to lower glycemia. Unfortunately, the paucity of high-quality evidence in the form of well-controlled clinical trials that directly compare different diabetes treatment regimens remains a major impediment to recommending one class of drugs, or a particular combination of therapies, over another.

The second source of material that informed our recommendations was clinical judgement, that is, our collective knowledge and clinical experience, which takes into account benefits, risks, and costs in the treatment of diabetes. As in all clinical decision making, an evidence-based review of the literature must also be supplemented by value judgements, where the benefits of treatment are weighed against risks and costs in a subjective fashion. While we realize that others may have different judgements, we believe that the recommendations made in this new iteration of our treatment algorithm will guide therapy and result in improved glycemic control and health status over time.

### Treatment intensification in patients with inadequate glycemic control on basal insulin: rationale and clinical evidence for the use of short-acting and other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [^1118iy9w]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Rationale for combining GLP‐1 RAs with basal insulin

Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists have demonstrated efficacy at different points in the treatment paradigm, as evidenced by clinical recommendations 2. Current guidelines recommend that, in patients with inadequate control on metformin monotherapy alone, escalation to a two‐drug combination is indicated, with the choice of addition of a thiazolidinedione, a sulfonylurea, a DPP‐4 inhibitor, an SGLT2 inhibitor, a GLP‐1 RA, or basal insulin. Subsequently, when a combination regimen including basal insulin fails to achieve the glycemic target after 3 months, the recommendation is to add either multiple daily insulin doses or a GLP‐1 RA (Figure 1) 2.

Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists are an important candidate class for addition to basal insulin because of the differing mechanisms of action and, particularly in the case of the short‐acting GLP‐1 RAs, complementary physiologic effects between the two agents. The principal effect of basal insulin is on FPG via inhibition of hepatic glucose production 2. The GLP‐1 RAs can also lower FPG (particularly the long‐acting formulations), but they also affect PPG and meal‐related glucose oscillations, which is particularly true for the short‐acting formulations 3. While basal insulin may induce 'rest of β‐cell function' 34, GLP‐1 RAs stimulate endogenous insulin secretion and inhibit glucagon secretion in a glucose‐dependent manner without causing β‐cell overload 3. They also have a significant potential for inducing β‐cell survival and protection from pro‐apoptotic actions of cytokines and fatty acids 35, 36, 37. Preclinical investigation has shown that lixisenatide may protect pancreatic β cells from apoptosis – when administered alone, it reduced the number of apoptotic cells by 50–60%. An 80% reduction was seen when lixisenatide and insulin glargine were added together, suggesting a synergistic effect on β‐cell survival 38, 39.

### Breaking down patient and physician barriers to optimize glycemic control in type 2 diabetes [^114QkxC7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Approximately half of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) do not achieve globally recognized blood glucose targets, despite the availability of a wide range of effective glucose-lowering therapies. Failure to maintain good glycemic control increases the risk of diabetes-related complications and long-term health care costs. Patients must be brought under glycemic control to improve treatment outcomes, but existing barriers to optimizing glycemic control must first be overcome, including patient nonadherence to treatment, the failure of physicians to intensify therapy in a timely manner, and inadequacies in the health care system itself. The reasons for such barriers include treatment side effects, complex treatment regimens, needle anxiety, poor patient education, and the absence of an adequate patient care plan; however, newer therapies and devices, combined with comprehensive care plans involving adequate patient education, can help to minimize barriers and improve treatment outcomes.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^117TKWu3]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Combination injectable therapy and prandial insulin — indications and dosing — indicates that if basal insulin has been titrated to an acceptable fasting blood glucose level and A1C remains above goal, if there is evidence of significant postprandial hyperglycemia, or if signs of overbasalization are present, advancement to combination injectable therapy is necessary. This approach can use a GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA added to basal insulin or multiple doses of prandial insulin, and if an individual is not already being treated with these, a GLP-1 RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA should be considered prior to starting prandial insulin. Starting with a single prandial dose with the largest meal of the day is simple and effective. We suggest starting with a prandial insulin dose of 4 units or 10% of the amount of basal insulin at the largest meal or the meal with the greatest postprandial excursion. Individuals with type 2 diabetes require higher daily doses (~1 unit/kg). When initiating intensification of insulin therapy, metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 RAs (or a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA) should be maintained, use of sulfonylureas, meglitinides, and DPP-4 inhibitors should be limited or discontinued, and adjunctive use of pioglitazone may help to improve glycemia and reduce the amount of insulin needed.

Insulin can be used as the first injectable if symptoms of hyperglycemia are present or when A1C or blood glucose levels are very high (i.e. A1C > 10% [86 mmol/mol] or blood glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL [16.7 mmol/L]).

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^112nAFox]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The epidemic of type 2 diabetes and the recognition that achieving specific glycemic goals can substantially reduce morbidity have made the effective treatment of hyperglycemia a top priority. While the management of hyperglycemia, the hallmark metabolic abnormality associated with type 2 diabetes, has historically taken center stage in the treatment of diabetes, therapies directed at other coincident features, such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, hypercoagulability, obesity, and insulin resistance, have also been a major focus of research and therapy. Maintaining glycemic levels as close to the nondiabetic range as possible has been demonstrated to have a powerful beneficial effect on diabetes-specific microvascular complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, in the setting of type 1 diabetes; in type 2 diabetes, more intensive treatment strategies have likewise been demonstrated to reduce microvascular complications. Intensive glycemic management resulting in lower A1C levels has also been shown to have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) complications in type 1 diabetes; however, current studies have failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect of intensive diabetes therapy on CVD in type 2 diabetes.

The development of new classes of blood glucose–lowering medications to supplement the older therapies, such as lifestyle-directed interventions, insulin, sulfonylureas, and metformin, has increased the number of treatment options available for type 2 diabetes. Whether used alone or in combination with other blood glucose–lowering interventions, the increased number of choices available to practitioners and patients has heightened uncertainty regarding the most appropriate means of treating this widespread disease. Although numerous reviews on the management of type 2 diabetes have been published in recent years, practitioners are often left without a clear pathway of therapy to follow. We developed the following consensus approach to the management of hyperglycemia in the nonpregnant adult to help guide health care providers in choosing the most appropriate interventions for their patients with type 2 diabetes.

Current recommendations and insulin therapy options

The current ADA/EASD guidelines recommend that individuals with Type 2 diabetes are initially treated using lifestyle modifications; once this fails to maintain HbA 1c levels < 7%, they should be progressed to metformin monotherapy (Fig. 1). If up to 3 months of metformin monotherapy does not enable the individual to reach the HbA 1c target, they should be progressed to a two-drug combination of metformin with a sulphonylurea, thiazolidinedione, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, glucagon-like peptide-1–receptor agonist or basal insulin. If after 3 months the HbA 1c remains above the glycaemic target set for the individual, therapy should then be progressed as represented in Fig. 1.

When a three-drug combination therapy with basal insulin does not achieve HbA 1c targets, then a more complex insulin strategy is recommended. The two possible strategies are (1) to continue with the basal insulin and add rapid-acting insulin in a stepwise manner or (2) to transfer to twice-daily premixed insulin (Fig. 2). The more flexible stepwise addition of prandial insulin to basal insulin is the preferred strategy from the guidelines. Eventually, it may be necessary to progress to a full basal–bolus regimen to achieve the desired glycaemic target.

The stepwise addition of prandial insulin has been investigated in several clinical trials. The addition of a single prandial insulin injection to the existing basal regimen before breakfast or the main meal, or before the meal consistently with the highest postprandial glucose, is referred to as a 'basal-plus' strategy. This basal-plus strategy has been identified as effective when intensifying insulin therapy, before a full basal–bolus regimen is considered.

### Glycemia treatment strategies in the action to control cardiovascular risk in diabetes (ACCORD) trial [^115RCRd4]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

There is an independent progressive epidemiologic relation between glycemia and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events; however, whether lowering glucose levels with currently available therapies can reduce CVD events remains unknown. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial is designed to answer this question in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In ACCORD, 10,251 patients with type 2 diabetes and other CVD risk factors or CVD were randomly allocated to intensive glycemic control, targeting a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level < 6%, or standard glycemic control, targeting an HbA1c level of 7.0%-7.9%. All participants are provided with diabetes education, glucose-monitoring equipment, and antidiabetic medications. All participants in the intensive glycemic control group are started on ≥ 2 classes of agents. Doses are intensified or a new medication class is added every month if HbA1c levels are ≥ 6% or if > 50% of premeal or postmeal capillary glucose readings are > 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) or > 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL), respectively. All drug combinations are permitted, and drugs are reduced only because of side effects or contraindications. Annual training, menus of approaches for intensification, regular electronic messaging, audits of achieved glycemia, and central feedback to sites support glycemic intensification strategies in intensive participants. In participants in the standard glycemic control group, therapy is intensified whenever HbA1c is ≥ 8%, and antihyperglycemic drugs that promote hypoglycemia (ie, insulin or insulin secretagogues) are reduced if HbA1c persistently decreases to < 7% in the setting of hypoglycemia. ACCORD addresses the hypothesis that aggressive glucose lowering prevents CVD events in patients with type 2 diabetes. It is focused on the levels of glycemia achieved using a variety of strategies, not on the specific therapies used. It will also provide information on how to safely approach near-normal levels of glucose control in clinical practice and evidence to support future clinical guidelines for diabetes management in older adults.

ANTIHYPERGLYCEMIC THERAPY

Glycemic targets

The ADA's "Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes" recommends lowering HbA 1c to < 7.0% in most patients to reduce the incidence of microvascular disease. This can be achieved with a mean plasma glucose of ∼8.3–8.9 mmol/L (∼150–160 mg/dL); ideally, fasting and premeal glucose should be maintained at < 7.2 mmol/L (< 130 mg/dL) and the postprandial glucose at < 10 mmol/L (< 180 mg/dL). More stringent HbA 1c targets (e.g. 6.0–6.5%) might be considered in selected patients (with short disease duration, long life expectancy, no significant CVD) if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment. Conversely, less stringent HbA 1c goals — e.g. 7.5–8.0% or even slightly higher — are appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, advanced complications, extensive comorbid conditions and those in whom the target is difficult to attain despite intensive self-management education, repeated counseling, and effective doses of multiple glucose-lowering agents, including insulin.

The accumulated results from the aforementioned type 2 diabetes cardiovascular trials suggest that not everyone benefits from aggressive glucose management. It follows that it is important to individualize treatment targets (,–). The elements that may guide the clinician in choosing an HbA 1c target for a specific patient are shown in Fig. 1. As mentioned earlier, the desires and values of the patient should also be considered, since the achievement of any degree of glucose control requires active participation and commitment. Indeed, any target could reflect an agreement between patient and clinician. An important related concept is that the ease with which more intensive targets are reached influences treatment decisions; logically, lower targets are attractive if they can be achieved with less complex regimens and no or minimal adverse effects. Importantly, utilizing the percentage of diabetic patients who are achieving an HbA 1c < 7.0% as a quality indicator, as promulgated by various health care organizations, is inconsistent with the emphasis on individualization of treatment goals.

### Insights from VERIFY: early combination therapy provides better glycaemic durability than a stepwise approach in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes [^111YpJd6]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Stepwise Treatment Intensification to Avoid Clinical Inertia

In type 2 diabetes, the goals of treatment are to prevent or delay chronic complications and maintain the patient's quality of life, which requires control of glycaemia and managing cardiovascular risk factors. Treating to target glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) levels is therefore fundamental to achieving disease control and preventing chronic complications and premature mortality. The standard of care for first-line drug therapy has been metformin monotherapy with lifestyle measures (e.g. nutrition and exercise) followed by stepwise treatment intensification to achieve HbA 1c targets (e.g. HbA 1c < 7.0%, < 53 mmol/mol; Fig. 1). Yet, for most patients with HbA 1c > 8.0–8.5% at diagnosis, metformin monotherapy will not lower HbA 1c sufficiently to achieve target levels. Furthermore, once diagnosed, many patients with diabetes may experience one treatment failure after another, often due to delayed intervention. In a substantial number of newly diagnosed patients, their treating physicians fail to intensify therapy within 6 months of failure of metformin monotherapy. This inability to achieve target glycaemic control is multifactorial. The person with diabetes often has difficulties in completely understanding the importance of glycaemic control. They can have the unrealistic expectation that the condition will resolve spontaneously, rather than progressively worsening over decades. The 'wait and see' approach of the stepwise treatment approach also creates uncertainties for the physician who may therefore become indecisive. This clinical inertia — a failure to initiate or intensify treatment in a timely manner — is common and may expose patients to long-term elevation of HbA 1c that can negatively impact their prognosis.

If symptomatic hyperglycemia is present, a GLP-1 RA alone is not recommended as it requires titration and may delay glucose control. The goal of initial intensive insulin therapy for symptomatic hyperglycemia is to reduce glucose levels safely and promptly. After improved glycemic control is achieved with short-term insulin therapy, especially with a new diagnosis of DM, a role for noninsulin antihyperglycemic agents could be considered.

### What is the 'real-world' experience with fixed-ratio combination therapy (insulin + GLP-1 receptor agonist) in routine clinical practice? Take-home messages for clinicians regarding key outcomes [^116dQwNm]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Intensification from basal insulin ±

Initiation of basal insulin remains a common intensification strategy for individuals with T2D not achieving glycaemic targets on OADs alone. When this approach does not provide adequate glycaemic control, further intensification with a GLP‐1 RA is recommended. This can be accomplished by adding a GLP‐1 RA to the existing basal insulin regimen (free combination) or by transitioning to an FRC that combines both agents in a single, once‐daily injection. Several real‐world studies have evaluated the clinical effectiveness of switching from basal insulin (± OADs) to FRC therapy; key findings are summarized below and in Tables 2 and 3.

TABLE 2
Real‐world studies assessing intensification from basal insulin ± OADs to a fixed‐ratio combination.

Real‐world comparative effectiveness studies of fixed‐ratio combinations versus other intensification strategies.

In a retrospective, single‐centre study from Italy, Di Loreto et al. followed 137 adults initiating IDegLira, of whom 104 (76%) had previously been treated with basal insulin ± OADs. In this subgroup, the mean baseline HbA1c was 8.4%, with reductions of 1.1% at 6 months and 0.9% at both 12 and 18 months. The mean starting dose of IDegLira was 17 dose steps, increasing to 22 and 28 dose steps at months 6 and 18, respectively. Body weight increased slightly at 18 months (+0.9 kg), and no side effects were reported during follow‐up. In a 4‐year extension involving 88 participants, Di Loreto et al. reported that sustained HbA1c reductions of 1.3% were observed, with no change in body weight. No cases of severe hypoglycaemia were reported, and only 3.2% discontinued treatment.

Type 2 diabetes — sequencing for greater glucose‑lowering potency: when even greater potency of glucose lowering is desired to reduce blood glucose to target and A1C goals, a basal insulin, either human NPH or a long‑acting insulin analog, should be initiated; however, if not already receiving GLP‑1 RA or dual GIP and GLP‑1 RA, an agent from these classes should be started first, and high‑potency GLP‑1 RAs and dual GIP and GLP‑1 RA are the preferred options for individuals requiring more intensive glucose management.

The upcoming GRADE (Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study) trial will address some of these points. In addition, studies on how best to combine the various agents, as well as the optimal timing (early combination therapy vs. the traditional step-wise approach), are urgently needed.

Furthermore, even the most carefully considered set of guidelines is based on averages — average A1C-lowering effect, average efficacy, average risk of adverse effects — without adequate consideration of the confidence intervals around those averages. Averages fail to identify subpopulations that respond better and have better tolerance to specific agents, and without these data, evidence-based personalized advice cannot be provided. For now, all HCPs, whether in specialty or primary care settings, should test the efficacy and weigh the safety risks of any given drug in each patient, ideally trying options over a period of months to see how well they work at the individual level.

### Guideline approach to therapy in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes [^1122oE4d]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Stepwise treatment according to guidelines: is it justified?

The answer is yes, since under current guideline therapy, with the availability of newer drug classes with minor side effects, using a stepwise increase in antihyperglycemic drug therapy as soon as A1C is above target can be implemented and might prevent disease progression similarly to combination or triple therapy. Moreover, a large proportion of patients will maintain near-normal A1C levels for many years under proper lifestyle and monotherapy, i.e. metformin, sulfonylurea, or early insulin therapy. We cannot, however, identify these patients in advance. Using combination or triple therapy from the beginning in these patients in an effort to correct the different pathophysiological defects seems unjustified, since it might hinder efforts to identify the drug to which these patients respond or do not respond and might complicate the diagnosis of relation of side effects to the drug.

On the other hand, an initial early stepwise increase from monotherapy to combination therapy when A1C is above target may maintain durability similar to that which can be achieved by starting with combination therapy or triple therapy as suggested by DeFronzo. Stepwise addition, however, allows evaluation of drug efficacy and possible side effects. Moreover, at the very early stage of diabetes or prediabetes, responses of patients with near-normal A1C to treatment, even if effective, are often marginal. Using combination or triple therapy at this stage may result in treating a patient for years with ineffective or unnecessary drugs with their concomitant side effects and safety issues at high cost.

The current approach of choosing drugs in relation to their efficacy and safety and addressing part of the pathophysiological faults still seems justified. The recent ADA/EASD position paper recommends the addition of one of five antihyperglycemic drugs beyond metformin when A1C is above target in a step-wise manner — acknowledging their side effects and safety.

Objective

This consensus statement provides (1) visual guidance in concise graphic algorithms to assist with clinical decision-making of health care professionals in the management of persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve patient care and (2) a summary of details to support the visual guidance found in each algorithm.

Methods

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) selected a task force of medical experts who updated the 2020 AACE Comprehensive Type 2 Diabetes Management Algorithm based on the 2022 AACE Clinical Practice Guideline: Developing a Diabetes Mellitus Comprehensive Care Plan and consensus of task force authors.

Results

This algorithm for management of persons with type 2 diabetes includes 11 distinct sections: (1) Principles for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes; (2) Complications-Centric Model for the Care of Persons with Overweight/Obesity; (3) Prediabetes Algorithm; (4) Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Algorithm: Dyslipidemia; (5) Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Algorithm: Hypertension; (6) Complications-Centric Algorithm for Glycemic Control; (7) Glucose-Centric Algorithm for Glycemic Control; (8) Algorithm for Adding/Intensifying Insulin; (9) Profiles of Antihyperglycemic Medications; (10) Profiles of Weight-Loss Medications (new); and (11) Vaccine Recommendations for Persons with Diabetes Mellitus (new), which summarizes recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Conclusions

Aligning with the 2022 AACE diabetes guideline update, this 2023 diabetes algorithm update emphasizes lifestyle modification and treatment of overweight/obesity as key pillars in the management of prediabetes and diabetes mellitus and highlights the importance of appropriate management of atherosclerotic risk factors of dyslipidemia and hypertension. One notable new theme is an emphasis on a complication-centric approach, beyond glucose levels, to frame decisions regarding first-line pharmacologic choices for the treatment of persons with diabetes. The algorithm also includes access/cost of medications as factors related to health equity to consider in clinical decision-making.

Introduction

Diabetes is one of the major health priority of the 21st centurycausing 1.5 million deaths in 2012. It is expected that by 2025–2030, there will be 380 million people with type 2 diabetes, and this pathology will move up to the seventh leading cause of death worldwide. Diabetes is recognized as a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), responsible for about a twofold excess risk for various vascular diseases such as coronary heart diseases (CHD), strokes, and other vascular deaths.

Type 2 diabetes requires the adoption of a healthy diet, physical activity and maintenance of a normal body weight. But, the cornerstone of type 2 diabetes treatment includes oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) and insulin use in the event of increased glycemia.

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensusfor the management of type 2 diabetes recommends a glycemic target hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) < 7% (53 mmol/mol). The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) showed that each 1% reduction in HbA1c is associated with a risk reduction of complications that is clinically and statistically significant. After adjusting for multiple potential confounding factors, 1% rise in HbA1c was associated with a 7% increase in the risk of a first major CV event, a 12% rise in the risk of death, a 20% rise in the risk of heart failure. The goal of therapy for the majority of people with diabetes is to prevent CV events by achieving a sustained glycemic control (HbA1c < 7% (53 mmol/mol)). The choice of the medications used to achieve glycemic goals must be individualized for each patient and adjusted as diabetes is a progressive disease. When lifestyle, metformin, and sulfonylurea or basal insulin are insufficient and do not lead to a glycemic control, the next step should be an initiation or intensification of insulin therapy including additional injections of short-acting or rapid-acting insulins. Despite an availability of a range of pharmacological agents and the stepwise approach to type 2 diabetes treatment advocated by ADA/EASD position statement, many patients with type 2 diabetes remain in poor glycemic control for prolonged periods of time.

The aim of the present study was to assess the clinical and non-clinical predictive factors for achieving the glycemic goal HbA1c as targeted by the treating physician in adults with type 2 diabetes requiring insulin initiation, titration, and/or intensification.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to insulin therapy, indications, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to offer combination therapy with a GLP-1 receptor agonist, including a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, and insulin (if used) for greater glycemic effectiveness as well as beneficial effects on weight and hypoglycemia risk in adult patients with T2DM. Reassess insulin dosing upon addition or dose escalation of a GLP-1 receptor agonist or dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist.

### Maintenance of glycaemic control with liraglutide versus oral antidiabetic drugs as add-on therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled with metformin alone: a randomized clinical trial in primary care (LIRA-PRIME) [^113rP5Em]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Because the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are treated in primary care, primary care clinicians have a key role in optimizing diabetes management. Improvement in, and retainment of, glycaemic control are associated with greater adherence to glucose‐lowering therapy, and maintaining adequate glycaemic control reduces the long‐term risk of T2D complications.

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes guidelines recommend metformin as first‐line pharmacotherapy for patients with T2D. Options for treatment intensification following failure of first‐line therapy to improve glycaemic control include a glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist (GLP‐1 RA), sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 inhibitor (SGLT‐2i), dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitor (DPP‐4i), sulphonylurea (SU), thiazolidinedione, and basal insulin, or a combination of glucose‐lowering therapies. The choice should be based on drug‐specific effects and patient characteristics, such as risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events or hypoglycaemia, need for body weight reduction, and cost. However, evidence to guide intensification strategies in primary care is sparse, which may contribute to treatment inertia and suboptimal treatment. Accordingly, the LIRA‐PRIME trial aimed to compare the efficacy in controlling glycaemia and safety of liraglutide versus a pooled oral antidiabetic drug (OAD) group, or the most commonly prescribed individual OAD classes in this trial (SGLT‐2i, DPP‐4i, and SU; post hoc analysis) in patients uncontrolled on metformin in a primary care setting to inform optimal antihyperglycaemic strategies.

### Intensifying insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus: dosing options for insulin analogue premixes [^1134V1Jq]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

As the diabetes epidemic expands, health care providers need more options to achieve glycemic control. Insulin analogue premixes provide basal and prandial insulin with 1 injection.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to provide an overview of the efficacy and tolerability of insulin analogue premixes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Methods

Sources of information for the present review included guidelines from the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, the American Diabetes Association (ADA), and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes. A PubMed search of clinical trials that have assessed the efficacy and tolerability of insulin lispro, biphasic insulin aspart, biphasic human insulin, insulin analogue premix, insulin glargine, insulin detemir, and neutral protamine Hagedorn, as well as the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine grades of recommendation and ADA levels of evidence, were employed.

Results

Of the 240 articles identified, 19 presented relevant clinical trial data. Biphasic insulin analogues have been associated with changes in hemoglobin A(1c), including aspart 70/30 (BIAsp 30) (changes, -1.23% to -2.89%), lispro mix 75/25 (-1.8%), and lispro mix 50/50 (-1.87%). Hypoglycemic events were reported in 18%, 23% to 42%, and 32% to 40% of patients who received BIAsp 30, lispro 75/25, and lispro 50/50, respectively. In some studies, algorithms were used for ensuring correct doses of BIAsp 30 and lispro mix 75/25. These algorithms were reported to be useful for guiding patients and physicians when more intense therapy with biphasic insulin analogues was required for effective glycemic control.

Conclusions

Based on the findings from the present review, health care providers may improve patient care by using the most appropriate insulin type and individualizing dosing regimens. The initiation of treatment with biphasic insulin analogue premixes should be considered when basal insulin therapy alone is not sufficient to obtain optimal glycemic control.

Type 2 diabetes — antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy principles and initial therapy: The goal of antihyperglycemic treatment is to achieve clinical and laboratory targets with minimal adverse effects and reduce diabetes-related complications, and minimizing the risks of hypoglycemia and weight gain and maximizing cardiovascular and renal benefits should be priorities. As monotherapy, most noninsulin agents reduce A1C by 0.5% to 2.0%. Metformin is often the preferred initial therapy for most persons with new-onset type 2 diabetes and, once initiated, should be continued as long as it is tolerated and not contraindicated; it can be used in combination with virtually all other antihyperglycemic agents, including insulin, when monotherapy does not reach the glycemic target.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to initial therapy, treatment intensification, DC 2024 guidelines recommend to prioritize medications with specific cardiorenal benefits in certain patient subgroups, regardless of the HbA1c level, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists and/or SGLT-2 inhibitors with demonstrated evidence of benefit for patients at high cardiovascular risk, SGLT-2 inhibitors with demonstrated evidence of benefit for patients with HFrEF or HFpEF, and SGLT-2 inhibitors with demonstrated evidence of benefit for patients with CKD.

### Secondary metformin monotherapy failure in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116V17Rp]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic and progressive disease characterized by elevated blood glucose levels. Estimates from national studies and surveillance registries in the United States estimate the prevalence of diabetes among adults age 18 and older is 13%, of which 21.4% are undiagnosed. For most patients, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards of care state that 'An A1C goal for many non-pregnant adults of < 7% (53 mmol/mol) is appropriate', although less stringent targets may be appropriate for some patients. Half of patients with T2DM have suboptimal glycemic control. Optimal glycemic control reduces the risk of hypoglycemia, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, liver disease, obesity, and other microvascular complications.

Unless contraindicated, the ADA recommends metformin monotherapy (MM) as the first-line pharmacologic agent for T2DM treatment. Clinicians may consider second-line therapies on the basis of efficacy, hypoglycemia risk, weight change, side effects, and cost. If MM treatment does not result in glycemic control at a maximal tolerated dose over 3–6 months, individuals may receive either treatment intensification on top of metformin or switch to another antihyperglycemic agent (AHA) if metformin is not tolerated.

### Treatment intensification in patients with inadequate glycemic control on basal insulin: rationale and clinical evidence for the use of short-acting and other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [^1152MTCc]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Importantly, insulin therapy is known to increase the risk of hypoglycemia 40, whereas treatment with GLP‐1 RAs is associated with a relatively low propensity to hypoglycemia because of glucose‐dependent effects on α and β cells 2. Furthermore, insulin therapy is associated with weight gain 41, while GLP‐1 RA therapy is associated with favourable weight effects 10, 21.

As both FPG level and PPG excursions contribute to a patient's glycemic profile 42, 43, it is logical to use a therapeutic approach that targets both to maintain overall glucose control, such as combining a prandial GLP‐1 RA and basal insulin. However, the relative degree to which FPG and PPG each contribute to overall HbA 1c varies, being influenced by lifestyle, disease duration, specific etiologic and pathophysiologic features, and treatment 42, 43. While some patients will still require further FPG control after initiation of basal insulin, PPG excursions have been shown to provide an important contribution to persistent hyperglycemia in this population 43, making short‐acting GLP‐1 RAs a valuable option for treatment intensification in patients receiving basal insulin.

Combining short‐acting GLP‐1 RAs and basal insulin has been shown to be beneficial in clinical trials

Data from clinical trials demonstrate the efficacy of short‐acting GLP‐1 RAs when used in combination with basal insulin.

In a 30‐week randomized study, mean change from baseline in HbA 1c was –1.74% (95% confidence interval [CI] –1.91, –1.56) with exenatide BID added to basal insulin, compared with –1.04% (–1.22, –0.86) in patients treated with basal insulin alone (between group difference: –0.69% [–0.93, –0.460]; p < 0.001). Weight loss occurred in the exenatide group compared with weight gain in the insulin‐only group (Table 2; Figure 2). There was no significant difference between the exenatide and insulin‐only groups in incidence of hypoglycemia 44.

Nonglycemic effects of medications

In addition to variable effects on glycemia, specific effects of individual therapies on CVD risk factors, such as hypertension or dyslipidemia, were also considered important. We also included the effects of interventions that may benefit or worsen the prospects for long-term glycemic control in our recommendations. Examples of these would be changes in body mass, insulin resistance, or insulin secretory capacity in type 2 diabetic patients.

### Obesity and weight management for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1154aeeq]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Assessing efficacy and safety of weight management pharmacotherapy — upon initiating medications for obesity, assess their effectiveness and safety at least monthly for the first 3 months and at least quarterly thereafter; those who achieve sufficient early weight loss upon starting a chronic weight management medication (typically defined as > 5% weight loss after 3 months of use) should continue the medication long-term, whereas when early weight loss results are modest (typically < 5% weight loss after 3 months of use), the benefits of ongoing treatment need to be examined in the context of the glycemic response, alternative options, tolerance, and burden. Ongoing monitoring of the achievement and maintenance of weight management goals is recommended, and sudden discontinuation of semaglutide and tirzepatide results in regain of one-half to two-thirds of the weight loss within 1 year. Shared decision-making should be used to determine the best long-term approach (continuing on the lowest effective dose, using intermittent therapy, or stopping medication followed by close weight monitoring), and for those not reaching or maintaining goals, avoid treatment inertia by reevaluating therapies and intensifying with additional approaches (e.g., metabolic surgery, additional pharmacologic agents, structured lifestyle programs).

### Matching treatment to pathophysiology in type 2 diabetes [^112Ui6Xf]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Because type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition, > 50% of all patients whose disease is initially controlled with diet and exercise will eventually need single or multiple pharmacologic agents to maintain adequate glycemic control. Although current treatment standards require that combination therapy be instituted only after the failure of monotherapy, the results of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study suggest that aggressive initial treatment is crucial to slowing the evolution of long-term complications associated with this disease.

Objectives

This article reviews the diagnosis and classification of type 2 diabetes, describes the multiple defects in glucose metabolism associated with the disease, and discusses the various pharmacologic options for achieving glycemic control in these patients.

Methods

The information in this review was compiled through a search of MEDLINE. Search terms included but were not limited to type 2 diabetes and antihyperglycemic agents. In addition, abstracts were identified using the Web sites of diabetes-related professional organizations.

Results

Two pathophysiologic mechanisms, insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion, are usually present at diagnosis in type 2 diabetes. Several studies have shown that combination therapy with antihyperglycemic agents having different mechanisms of action provides greater efficacy than treatment with single agents.

Conclusions

Current research suggests that early aggressive treatment with combination therapy achieves glycemic control at lower doses and with fewer side effects than monotherapy with either component.

### Initial combination therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus: is it ready for prime time? [^113inb9Q]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is primarily being driven by the increasing global rates of overweight/obesity. Given the magnitude of this epidemic, we can expect these metabolic abnormalities to play an increasing role in the development of cardiovascular disease. In a pathophysiologic sense, type 2 diabetes is a multiorgan, multifactorial condition, characterized by β-cell dysfunction, insulin resistance in peripheral tissues and the liver, defective incretin activity, and elevated levels of free fatty acids and proinflammatory mediators. Despite the considerable burden of disease associated with type 2 diabetes, most patients are not at, or are unable to achieve, recommended glycemic control guideline targets. In part, this is because of the relentlessly progressive nature of the disease, but it may also be attributable to the current diabetes treatment paradigm, which is characterized by ineffective lifestyle interventions, followed by monotherapy and frequent early treatment failure with prolonged periods of elevated glucose as a consequence of clinical inertia. Thus, it is most appropriate to rethink the current treatment paradigm for type 2 diabetes in the context of a more aggressive initial therapy; specifically with early initiation of combination therapy. Our current understanding of the complex pathophysiology of the disease and the progressive deterioration in glycemic control over time supports the philosophy of earlier intervention with a more comprehensive initial therapy. Thus, while control of hyperglycemia remains the paramount goal, focusing on the underlying pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes is increasingly becoming the therapeutic strategy, with the aim of potentially providing disease modification. Although this is a logical approach, it remains to be demonstrated that early combination therapy will result in disease modification in a clinical setting. Not surprisingly, the incretin-based therapies have gained a great deal of attention in the context of being a component of initial combination therapy, given their potential beneficial effects on β-cell function with lowered risk of weight gain and hypoglycemia.

### Treatment intensification in patients with inadequate glycemic control on basal insulin: rationale and clinical evidence for the use of short-acting and other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [^112cwiqM]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

There is evidence of an underlying GLP‐1 insufficiency in Asian patients with T2DM 78. Therefore, the addition of GLP‐1 RA therapy to basal insulin may be especially advantageous in Asian patients. Indeed, a clinical trial has demonstrated the efficacy and safety of lixisenatide plus basal insulin in Asian patients 65, 77, 78. Similarly, a small (n = 84) study in obese Chinese patients found that the addition of liraglutide to existing insulin treatment conferred similar glycemic control to that seen with an increase in insulin dose, but with lower incidence of hypoglycemia 79.

It is noteworthy that the most recent update to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) treatment guidelines place GLP‐1 RAs alongside prandial insulin in the final line of treatment of T2DM. This means that patients who do not achieve satisfactory glycemic control with other monotherapies or dual‐ or triple‐combination regimens should be treated with metformin plus basal insulin and either prandial insulin or a GLP‐1 RA 2.

Other options for treatment intensification

While the addition of a GLP‐1 RA to basal insulin is a viable option for treatment intensification, other strategies are available at this point in the treatment algorithm – addition of prandial insulin, DPP‐4 inhibitor, or SGLT2 inhibitor may also be considered. Mechanistic differences between these approaches are shown in Table 4.

Table 4
Mechanistic effects of basal and prandial insulin, glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitor, or a sodium‐glucose co‐transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors

To date, few head‐to‐head studies have examined the relative safety and efficacy of GLP‐1 RAs and prandial insulin added onto basal insulin. In those studies that have 80, 81, 82, both regimens provided similar overall glycemic control, with favourable weight benefits and lower risk of hypoglycemia with the GLP‐1 RA regimens.

How to initiate diabetes therapy and advance interventions

Except in rare circumstances, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or patients who are extremely catabolic or hyperosmolar or who are unable to hydrate themselves adequately (seebelow), hospitalization is not required for initiation or adjustment of therapy. The patient is the key player in the diabetes care team and should be trained and empowered to adjust medications with the guidance of health care professionals to achieve glycemic goals and to prevent and treat hypoglycemia. Many patients may be managed effectively with monotherapy; however, the progressive nature of the disease will require the use of combination therapy in many, if not most, patients over time, to achieve and maintain glycemia in the target range.

The measures of glycemia that are initially targeted on a day-to-day basis are fasting and preprandial glucose levels. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is an important element in adjusting or adding new interventions and, in particular, in titrating insulin doses. The need for and number of required SMBG measurements are not clear and are dependent on the medications used. Oral glucose-lowering regimens that do not include sulfonylureas or glinides, and are therefore not likely to cause hypoglycemia, usually do not require SMBG. However, SMBG may be used to determine whether therapeutic blood glucose targets are being achieved and for adjustment of treatment regimens without requiring the patient to have laboratory-based blood glucose testing. Insulin therapy requires more frequent monitoring.

### Advances and counterpoints in type 2 diabetes. what is ready for translation into real-world practice, ahead of the guidelines [^112siXSF]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

This review seeks to address major gaps and delays between our rapidly evolving body of knowledge on type 2 diabetes and its translation into real-world practice. Through updated and improved best practices informed by recent evidence and described herein, we stand to better attain A1c targets, help preserve beta cell integrity and moderate glycemic variability, minimize treatment-emergent hypoglycemia, circumvent prescribing to "treatment failure", and prevent long-term complications. The first topic addressed in this review concerns updates in the 2023 and 2024 diabetes treatment guidelines for which further elaboration can help facilitate integration into routine care. The second concerns advances in diabetes research that have not yet found their way into guidelines, though they are endorsed by strong evidence and are ready for real-world use in appropriate patients. The final theme addresses lingering misconceptions about the underpinnings of type 2 diabetes — fundamental fallacies that continue to be asserted in the textbooks and continuing medical education upon which physicians build their approaches. A corrected and up-to-date understanding of the disease state is essential for practitioners to both conceptually and translationally manage initial onset through late-stage type 2 diabetes.

Use an SGLT-2 inhibitor to reduce the risk for all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, progression of chronic kidney disease, and hospitalization due to congestive heart failure, and use a GLP-1 agonist to reduce the risk for all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, and stroke.

### Type 2 diabetes therapies: a STEPS approach [^117SpZm5]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

A concise way to evaluate pharmacotherapy options for type 2 diabetes mellitus is to use the five patient-oriented STEPS criteria: safety, tolerability, efficacy, price, and simplicity. The first-line treatment option, metformin, is safe and fairly well-tolerated, has excellent long-term efficacy for patient-oriented outcomes, is moderately priced, and has a simple dosing regimen. However, most patients with type 2 diabetes require more than one medication. The STEPS approach can help choose subsequent medications if metformin does not provide adequate glycemic control.

### Insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes [^1177jkAq]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes is a common disorder often accompanied by numerous metabolic abnormalities leading to a high risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Results from the UKPDS have confirmed that intensive glucose control delays the onset and retards the progression of microvascular disease and possibly of macrovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. In the early stages of the disease, insulin resistance plays a major role in the development of hyperglycemia and other metabolic abnormalities, and patients with type 2 diabetes often benefit from measures to improve insulin sensitivity such as weight loss, dietary changes, and exercise. Later, the use of oral insulin secretagogues and insulin sensitizers as monotherapy and in combination helps maintain glycemia for varying periods of time. Ultimately, because of the progressive nature of the disease and the progressive decline in pancreatic beta-cell function, insulin therapy is almost always obligatory to achieve optimal glycemic goals. Not all patients are candidates for aggressive insulin management; therefore, the goals of therapy should be modified, especially in elderly individuals and those with co-morbid conditions. Candidates for intensive management should be motivated, compliant, and educable, without other major medical conditions and physical limitations that would preclude accurate and reliable HGM and insulin administration. In selected patients, combination therapy with insulin and oral antidiabetic medications can be an effective method for normalizing glycemia without the need for rigorous multiple-injection regimens. The patients for whom combination therapy is most commonly successful are those who do not achieve adequate glycemic control using daytime oral agents but who still show some evidence of responsiveness to the medications. Bedtime intermediate-acting or predinner premixed intermediate- and rapid-acting insulin is administered and progressively increased until the FPG concentration is normalized. If combination therapy is not successful, a split-mixed regimen of intermediate- and rapid-acting insulin equally divided between the prebreakfast and pre-dinner periods is advised for oese patients, and more intensive regimens are advised for thin patients. Insulin therapy is invariably associated with weight gain and hypoglycemia. The use of metformin or glitazones in combination with insulin has been demonstrated to have insulin-sparing properties. Also, metformin use may ameliorate weight gain. The use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pumps can be particularly beneficial in treating patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who do not respond satisfactorily to more conventional treatment strategies. Intraperitoneal insulin delivery systems hold considerable promise in type 2 diabetes because of their more physiologic delivery of insulin and their ability to inhibit hepatic glucose production selectively, with less peripheral insulinemia than with subcutaneous insulin injections. Newer insulin analogues such as the rapidly acting Lispro insulin and the peakless, long-acting glargine insulin are increasingly being used because of their unique physiologic pharmacokinetics. New developments such as inhaled and buccal insulin preparations will also make it easier for many patients to initiate and maintain a proper insulin regimen. Finally, a new generation of gut peptides such as amylin and GLP-1 will add a new dimension to glycemic control through modification of nutrient delivery and other mechanisms; however, the ultimate goal in the management of type 2 diabetes is the primary prevention of the disease. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) sponsored by the National Institutes of Health has currently randomly assigned more than 3000 persons with impaired glucose tolerance and at high risk of developing diabetes into three treatment arms: metformin arm, an intensive lifestyle-modification arm, and a placebo arm. The study will conclude in 2002 after all participants have been followed for 3 to 6 years.

### Advances and counterpoints in type 2 diabetes. what is ready for translation into real-world practice, ahead of the guidelines [^11411GsN]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the recent expansion of antidiabetic agents such as GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT-2is, glycemic control remains suboptimal in many patients. Approximately half of all type 2 diabetic patients in the United States and worldwide fail to achieve the glycemic target of A1c ≥ 7.0%.

Ninety percent of diabetes cases are managed by primary care providers. Guidelines are integral to updating best practices and are especially edifying for general practitioners who maintain a broad knowledge base across numerous medical conditions. Primary care providers are encouraged to apply the most effective treatment parameters in clinical practice rather than relying on specialists. This review seeks to highlight key developments in the field to both provision and empower generalists as well as specialists in dispensing care in line with the latest knowledge in the disease state ready for use in routine care.

The field of type 2 diabetes research has detailed guidelines issued by the American Diabetes Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology. Many advances, however, see extensive delays in anatomizing research discoveries into clinical approaches. This prudence helps prevent the need to elaborate extensively on areas pending additional research or to deadopt a faulty recommendation. On the other hand, it impedes the timeliness of advances reaching patients. It also sets a deceptively slow rate of change in best practices, contributing to "physician habituation", one contributing aspect to clinical inertia.

In this review, we shortlisted timely leaps in the management of type 2 diabetes — advances that we believe are ready for "prime time". We provide context for selected updates that have already been incorporated into guidelines — context that we feel will edify the rationale for readers and speed adoption into real-world use. Second, we detail several important developments that are yet to be translated to the clinic while these remain either in vigorous debate or in limbo despite a strong body of evidence of the benefit and utility of these having benefit to patients.

Third, this review revisits outmoded dogmas about the basic science of type 2 diabetes — premises that continue to be widely reiterated in physician education but are, in fact, incorrect. Today's type 2 diabetes is "not your mother's type 2 diabetes", that is, our modern understanding of dysglycemia is a departure from old tenets. A correct understanding of beta cell function and dysglycemia is needed for physicians to be in command and optimally control diabetes and its sequelae in their clinics.

### Effective utilization of oral hypoglycemic agents to achieve individualized HbA1c targets in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116HkqrU]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes is a progressive life-long condition that, if poorly managed, results in significant morbidity as a result of micro- and macrovascular complications. Macrovascular or cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes, accounting for 54% of deaths. Effective diabetes management to prevent the development of long-term complications requires intensive treatment of numerous risk factors, including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperglycemia. In recent years, the treatment options to achieve optimum glycemic control have rapidly expanded. There are currently five groups of oral agents and two injectable therapies available (Fig. 1). The challenge for clinicians is determining which combination of treatment is most appropriate for an individual with type 2 diabetes, with the recommendation being that a maximum combination of three oral treatments are used.

### Combination therapy for type 2 diabetes [^113Pm7wG]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To discuss a rational approach to improvement of glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with use of combination therapy.

Methods

We review the mechanisms of action and clinical applications for the various antidiabetic agents alone and in various combinations. Relevant studies in the literature are reviewed.

Results

Although diet and exercise remain the cornerstones of treatment, in most patients with type 2 diabetes, pharmacologic agents are needed to achieve optimal glycemic control and likely reduce the incidence of microvascular and possibly macrovascular complications as well. Sulfonylureas have long been the foundation of oral pharmacologic therapy and provide adequate glycemic control for most patients for 5 to 10 years or longer. In the past, when treatment with sulfonylureas was no longer effective, insulin therapy was inevitable. With the approval of several new pharmacologic agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, however, the addition of one or more orally administered agents to sulfonylurea therapy or use of other oral combination therapy is rapidly evolving as a means of optimizing glycemic control. In many patients, combination therapy can delay the need to add or switch to insulin, or it can enhance glycemic control in patients already receiving insulin. In selected patients treated solely with insulin, discontinuation of insulin treatment and reinitiation of oral therapy may even be possible.

Conclusion

Currently, four classes of orally administered antidiabetic agents are available for use in patients with type 2 diabetes: insulin secretagogues, biguanides, a-glucosidase inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones. By taking advantage of differing mechanisms of action, combination therapy is evolving as a means of optimizing glycemic control in patients in whom a single agent or insulin is inadequate. Combinations of orally administered agents can often delay the need for insulin or in combination with insulin aid in achieving glycemic goals. Continuing research will help optimize combination therapies even further.
