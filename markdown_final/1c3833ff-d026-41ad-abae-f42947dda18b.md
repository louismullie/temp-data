## Question

antibiotics in prolonged bronchitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when antibiotics are indicated in prolonged bronchitis across different populations and contexts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "prolonged bronchitis" differently in children versus adults. Then, I should verify the evidence base for pediatric protracted bacterial bronchitis and the recommended antibiotic regimens. Next, I will examine adult data for acute bronchitis, chronic bronchitis, and COPD exacerbations, and I need to check where antibiotics help and where they do not. After that, I should review special populations and stewardship considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and double-check for any contradictions or gaps before concluding with a concise recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate entities. In children, "prolonged bronchitis" typically refers to protracted bacterial bronchitis, defined as a chronic wet or productive cough lasting more than 4 weeks without an alternative diagnosis and often responsive to antibiotics, whereas in adults, "prolonged bronchitis" can mean persistent symptoms after acute bronchitis or relate to chronic bronchitis/COPD exacerbations, which are distinct clinical scenarios with different indications for antibiotics [^1122TkjS] [^113Vbbu9] [^112Smz9Q].

> Now, I will examine pediatric protracted bacterial bronchitis. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence before jumping to treatment. High-quality evidence from randomized trials and a Cochrane review shows that antibiotics significantly improve cough resolution in children with chronic wet cough, with a number needed to treat around 3, and guidelines recommend a 2-week course of amoxicillin–clavulanate as first-line therapy, extending to 4 weeks if cough persists, with further evaluation if there is no response after 4 weeks due to risk of bronchiectasis [^1137RANQ] [^116CyNjx] [^113Vbbu9] [^1169SMQn]. Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic confirmation strategy: resolution of cough within 2 weeks of appropriate antibiotics supports the diagnosis of PBB, which aligns with guideline statements and helps avoid unnecessary investigations when the clinical course is typical [^113isVG8] [^113Qf6DS].

> Next, I should review adult acute bronchitis, because many adults present with cough persisting beyond 2–3 weeks. I need to ensure I don't overstate benefit. Multiple high-quality guidelines and systematic reviews consistently advise against routine antibiotics for uncomplicated acute bronchitis, noting only modest, clinically marginal reductions in cough duration with increased adverse effects, so antibiotics should generally be avoided unless pneumonia is suspected or pertussis is confirmed [^117ABtD6] [^111FGJZY] [^1128x35v] [^1179Kpu9]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought antibiotics might meaningfully shorten cough by several days, but the best estimates are closer to a half-day reduction, which reinforces the recommendation to avoid routine antibiotics in this setting [^117ABtD6] [^111FGJZY].

> I will now examine chronic bronchitis and stable COPD, where patients often have chronic productive cough. Let me double-check the guidance here. For chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis, expert panels conclude there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine antibiotics to relieve cough, so antibiotics are not indicated for stable disease in the absence of an acute exacerbation phenotype [^113hWerd] [^113op11x]. But wait, what if the patient has frequent exacerbations despite optimal inhaled therapy? In that subgroup, long-term macrolide prophylaxis can reduce exacerbations, though benefits must be balanced against resistance and ototoxicity risks, and guidelines suggest preferential use in former smokers with careful monitoring [^114C293u] [^115rzPgH] [^114wjutB].

> Next, I should review COPD exacerbations, because this is where antibiotics can be clearly indicated. I need to check the cardinal symptom criteria. Guidelines recommend antibiotics when there is increased dyspnea, increased sputum volume, and/or increased sputum purulence, with typical outpatient durations of 5 days, which achieve comparable outcomes to longer courses and reduce early relapse and treatment failure in appropriately selected patients [^112Smz9Q] [^115KNG56] [^1159Zckd]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies to outpatients with mild to moderate exacerbations; yes, the evidence and recommendations are strongest for patients meeting the Anthonisen-type symptom complex during exacerbations, not for stable chronic bronchitis [^112Smz9Q] [^115KNG56].

> Let me consider special populations so I don't miss important nuances. In children with CRMS/CFSPID and prolonged cough, expert guidance supports selective use of oral antibiotics after shared decision-making, acknowledging uncertainty about pathogen impact and the need to balance benefits and burdens, which is distinct from routine care in otherwise healthy children [^111gJSqo] [^11134WuZ]. For adults with bronchiectasis and frequent exacerbations, long-term macrolides are recommended to reduce exacerbations, whereas long-term non-macrolide oral antibiotics are not advised as first-line, and inhaled antibiotics may be considered in selected patients with chronic infection and high exacerbation risk despite standard care [^113oG6jD] [^112RrkiD] [^112vexmK]. I should confirm that these adult bronchiectasis recommendations do not generalize to unexplained chronic cough without bronchiectasis; indeed, long-term macrolides should not be used for unexplained chronic cough in adults without bronchiectasis [^112rP1jp].

> I need to ensure antibiotic stewardship is integrated into decision-making. Procalcitonin-guided strategies can safely reduce unnecessary antibiotic initiation in lower respiratory tract infections, including some bronchitis-like presentations, though evidence is less definitive in COPD exacerbations and should be applied contextually rather than as a blanket rule [^114MaMYq] [^112skr5A]. But wait, let me verify the practical outpatient levers: delayed prescribing and clear safety-netting reduce unnecessary antibiotic use without harming satisfaction, which is useful when patients request antibiotics for acute bronchitis or early in the course of cough [^113hYQ39].

> Next, I should review duration and agent selection where antibiotics are indicated, to avoid overtreatment. For pediatric PBB, 2 weeks of amoxicillin–clavulanate is first-line, extending to 4 weeks if needed, with further workup if cough persists beyond 4 weeks, which aligns with both efficacy data and the risk of underlying bronchiectasis [^116CyNjx] [^113Vbbu9] [^1169SMQn]. For COPD exacerbations warranting antibiotics, 5-day courses are recommended and achieve outcomes comparable to longer regimens, and for long-term macrolide prophylaxis in COPD, azithromycin or erythromycin for 6–12 months can be considered in carefully selected patients with monitoring for resistance and hearing effects [^112Smz9Q] [^115KNG56] [^114C293u] [^115rzPgH].

> Hold on, I should verify the decision framework so it is clinically usable. In children with chronic wet cough, start with a therapeutic trial of amoxicillin–clavulanate for 2 weeks, extend to 4 weeks if needed, and if still not improved, evaluate for bronchiectasis or other causes; in adults with persistent cough after acute bronchitis, avoid antibiotics unless pneumonia is suspected or pertussis is confirmed; in adults with stable chronic bronchitis, do not use antibiotics for cough suppression; in COPD exacerbations, use antibiotics for 5 days when cardinal symptoms are present; and in frequent COPD exacerbators despite optimal therapy, consider macrolide prophylaxis with informed consent and monitoring [^1122TkjS] [^1128x35v] [^113hWerd] [^112Smz9Q] [^114C293u].

> I should double-check for any internal contradictions or overgeneralizations. Initially, I almost equated "prolonged bronchitis" in adults with the pediatric PBB paradigm, but that would be incorrect. Adult acute bronchitis is predominantly viral and antibiotics are not beneficial, whereas pediatric PBB is a bacterial bronchitis syndrome with strong evidence for antibiotic benefit, so the populations and indications are not interchangeable [^117ABtD6] [^1137RANQ]. Also, I briefly considered whether macrolides might help all adults with chronic productive cough, but guidelines restrict long-term macrolides to selected COPD or bronchiectasis phenotypes due to resistance and safety concerns, reinforcing the need to match therapy to the underlying condition rather than to cough alone [^114C293u] [^113oG6jD].

> In summary, antibiotics are indicated for pediatric protracted bacterial bronchitis and for COPD exacerbations meeting symptom criteria, with clear, time-limited regimens and defined follow-up. They are not indicated for uncomplicated adult acute bronchitis or for stable chronic bronchitis, where symptomatic management and condition-specific prophylaxis strategies should prevail, always anchored in shared decision-making and antimicrobial stewardship [^1137RANQ] [^112Smz9Q] [^1128x35v] [^113hWerd].

Antibiotics are indicated for **prolonged bronchitis** when cough persists > 4 weeks with purulent sputum or clinical features suggesting bacterial infection, especially in children with protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) [^1137RANQ] or in adults with chronic bronchitis/COPD exacerbations meeting Anthonisen criteria [^115KNG56]. Routine antibiotics are not recommended for **acute bronchitis** [^1179Kpu9] or stable chronic bronchitis without bacterial features [^113hWerd]. Use **amoxicillin-clavulanate** for 2–4 weeks in children with PBB [^1137RANQ] [^113Vbbu9] and a 5–7 day course of macrolides or doxycycline for adult exacerbations with increased dyspnea, sputum volume, or purulence [^115KNG56] [^1159Zckd]. If cough persists after 4 weeks of appropriate therapy, evaluate for underlying conditions such as bronchiectasis or immunodeficiency [^1169SMQn] [^1122TkjS].

## Indications for antibiotic therapy in prolonged bronchitis

### Pediatric protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB)

- **Definition**: Chronic wet/productive cough > 4 weeks without underlying disease or specific cough pointers (e.g. digital clubbing) [^116CyNjx].
- **Indication**: Antibiotics are first-line therapy; high-quality evidence shows improved cough resolution [^1137RANQ] [^1122TkjS].
- **Recommended antibiotics**: Amoxicillin-clavulanate for 2 weeks; extend to 4 weeks if cough persists [^115vjqBg] [^113Vbbu9].
- **Follow-up**: If cough persists after 4 weeks, evaluate for bronchiectasis or other underlying disease [^1169SMQn] [^11378NGj].

---

## Evidence supporting antibiotic use

| **Clinical scenario** | **Evidence supporting antibiotic use** | **Recommended antibiotics** |
|-|-|-|
| Pediatric PBB | High-quality evidence shows improved cough resolution with antibiotics [^1137RANQ] [^1122TkjS] | Amoxicillin-clavulanate for 2–4 weeks [^115vjqBg] [^1169SMQn] |
| Adult COPD exacerbations | Antibiotics reduce treatment failure, relapse, and hospitalization in exacerbations with bacterial features [^112Smz9Q] [^115KNG56] | Macrolides or doxycycline for 5–7 days [^notfound] |
| Long-term macrolide therapy in COPD | Reduces exacerbations in patients with frequent exacerbations despite optimal therapy [^114C293u] [^115rzPgH] | Azithromycin or erythromycin for 6–12 months [^114wjutB] [^115rzPgH] |

## Situations where antibiotics are not recommended

Routine antibiotics are not recommended for **acute bronchitis** [^1179Kpu9] because it is usually viral and self-limited [^1156nhgo]. They are also not recommended for **stable chronic bronchitis without bacterial features** [^113hWerd] because evidence is insufficient to support routine antibiotic use [^113op11x].

---

## Potential risks and benefits of antibiotic therapy

### Benefits

Benefits include **symptom improvement** — reduced cough, sputum production, and faster recovery in bacterial exacerbations [^112Smz9Q] — and **fewer complications**, including fewer treatment failures, relapses, and hospitalizations in COPD exacerbations [^112Smz9Q].

---

### Risks

- **Adverse effects**: Gastrointestinal upset, allergic reactions, and antibiotic-associated colitis [^117ABtD6] [^111s1h3S].
- **Antibiotic resistance**: Increased resistance in respiratory pathogens with repeated or inappropriate use [^115rzPgH].
- **Hearing impairment**: Risk with long-term macrolide therapy [^114C293u] [^115rzPgH].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **Pediatric PBB**: Antibiotics are first-line therapy; use amoxicillin-clavulanate for 2–4 weeks [^116CyNjx] [^113Vbbu9].
- **Adult COPD exacerbations**: Use antibiotics when Anthonisen criteria are met; macrolides or doxycycline for 5–7 days [^112Smz9Q] [^115KNG56].
- **Long-term macrolide therapy**: Consider in frequent exacerbators despite optimal therapy; monitor for resistance and hearing impairment [^114C293u] [^115rzPgH].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Antibiotics are indicated for **prolonged bronchitis** when cough persists > 4 weeks with purulent sputum or clinical features suggesting bacterial infection, especially in children with PBB or adults with COPD exacerbations. Routine antibiotics are not recommended for acute bronchitis or stable chronic bronchitis without bacterial features. Use **amoxicillin-clavulanate** for 2–4 weeks in children with PBB and a 5–7 day course of macrolides or doxycycline for adult exacerbations with bacterial features. If cough persists after 4 weeks of appropriate therapy, evaluate for underlying conditions such as bronchiectasis or immunodeficiency.

### Diagnosis and management of acute bronchitis [^112hWrZf]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Acute bronchitis is one of the top 10 conditions for which patients seek medical care. Physicians show considerable variability in describing the signs and symptoms necessary to its diagnosis. Because acute bronchitis most often has a viral cause, symptomatic treatment with protussives, antitussives, or bronchodilators is appropriate. However, studies indicate that many physicians treat bronchitis with antibiotics. These drugs have generally been shown to be ineffective in patients with uncomplicated acute bronchitis. Furthermore, antibiotics often have detrimental side effects, and their overuse contributes to the increasing problem of antibiotic resistance. Patient satisfaction with the treatment of acute bronchitis is related to the quality of the physician-patient interaction rather than to prescription of an antibiotic.

Methods

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotics with placebo or no antibiotics in COPD patients suffering from an acute exacerbation defined as a worsening of a previous stable situation with symptoms such as increased dyspnea, increased cough, increased sputum volume or change in sputum colour. We considered studies if > 90% of patients had a clinical (physician-based) diagnosis of COPD or, ideally, spirometrically confirmed COPD. We excluded studies of patients with acute bronchitis, pneumonia, asthma or bronchiectasis.

We included trials evaluating any antibiotics that were administered orally or parenterally daily for a minimum period of at least three days. We chose three days because this is the minimum duration for which antibiotics are usually prescribed in clinical practice for COPD exacerbations.

The outcome measure of primary interest was treatment failure defined as (1) no resolution of symptoms and signs as reported by patients or physicians or as (2) need for further antibiotics. Outcome measures of secondary interest were duration of hospital admission, admission to an intensive care unit, health-related quality of life, symptoms, mortality, and any adverse events registered during the study period.

Search strategy

The search was carried out by information specialists (Bazian, London, UK) and included searches in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2005 issue 4), PREMEDLINE (1960 to 1965), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2006), EMBASE (1974 to March 2006), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE, March 2006). We entered all included studies into the Pub-med "related articles" function and the science citation index. In addition, we scrutinised the reference lists of included studies and review articles as well the conference proceedings of the international congresses of the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society from 2000 to 2006 since these studies might not have been fully published yet. We also contacted representatives of the pharmaceutical industry for additional published or unpublished data (Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, BoehringerIngelheim, Pfizer and MSD). Finally, we searched international data bases for trial registration to identify ongoing or recently completed trials.

Study selection

Two members of the review team independently assessed the titles and abstracts of all identified citations without imposing any language restrictions. The reviewers then evaluated the full text of articles that seemed potentially eligible by one of the reviewers. Final decisions on in- and exclusion were recorded in the Endnote file and agreement was assessed using chance-adjusted kappa statistics.

### Bronchiectasis, chronic suppurative lung disease and protracted bacterial bronchitis [^112qg3Uo]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2018). Low credibility.

Bronchiectasis is a structural airway disease characterized by dilated bronchi and bronchioles due to severe or recurrent lower airways inflammation. Bronchiectasis can occur as a result of chronic pulmonary aspiration. Bronchiectasis may also be associated with a wide variety of systemic diseases, which should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Children with bronchiectasis typically have a chronic or recurrent productive cough and carry a significant burden of disease with a considerable impact on quality of life. The diagnosis of bronchiectasis is made by high-resolution chest computerized tomography. Aggressive management of bronchiectasis is necessary to reduce the daily symptom burden and frequency of exacerbations. Chronic suppurative lung disease may be a precursor to bronchiectasis, only lacking the defining radiographic features of bronchiectasis. Children with chronic suppurative lung disease may have the same symptoms as children with bronchiectasis and should be treated similarly. Protracted bacterial bronchitis is defined as a cough lasting at least four weeks that responds to antibiotic therapy. Protracted bacterial bronchitis may occur following a viral respiratory tract infection. Protracted bacterial bronchitis can be treated with a prolonged course of empiric antibiotics. Further evaluation is necessary if a child with suspected protracted bacterial bronchitis does not adequately respond to antibiotics as chronic suppurative lung disease or bronchiectasis must be considered.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We used the Cochrane systematic review as the basis for assessing the evidence. The authors of the Cochrane review searched for primary research of randomised controlled trials with no language restrictions in CENTRAL 2016, issue 11 (accessed Jan 13, 2017), MEDLINE (1966 to Jan week 1, 2017), Embase (1974 to Jan 13, 2017), and LILACS (1982 to Jan 13, 2017); and searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform andon April 5, 2017. Search terms are in the appendix (p 13). The review of antibiotics for acute bronchitis documented that antibiotics have a modest effect on cough duration (seven studies, 2776 participants, mean difference −0·46 days [95% CI −0·87 to −0·04]). However, the trials in the Cochrane review included very few children and the differences in immunity and anatomy between adults and children prohibit simply applying evidence derived in adults to the management of children.

Added value of this study

This study confirms that antibiotics (amoxicillin) do not provide a clinically important benefit for symptom duration among children presenting with uncomplicated lower respiratory tract infections (antibiotic median 5 days vs placebo 6 days, hazard ratio 1·13 [95% CI 0·90 to 1·42]), nor in the key clinical subgroups that clinicians commonly prescribe for (those with chest signs, fever, physician rating of unwell, sputum or chest rattle, and shortness of breath).

Implications of all the available evidence

The data from our study and previous studies suggest that unless pneumonia is suspected, clinicians should provide so-called safety-netting advice (ie, explain what illness course to expect and when it would be necessary to reattend) but not prescribe antibiotics for most children presenting with chest infections.

### Uncomplicated acute bronchitis [^114fk38g]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Acute bronchitis is an acute cough illness in otherwise healthy adults that usually lasts 1 to 3 weeks. This review describes the pathophysiology of the condition and provides a practical approach to the evaluation and treatment of adults with uncomplicated acute bronchitis. Practical points to be made are:1. Respiratory viruses appear to cause the large majority of cases of uncomplicated acute bronchitis.2. Pertussis infection is present in up to 10% to 20% of adults with cough illness of more than 2 to 3 weeks' duration. No clinical features distinguish pertussis from nonpertussis infection in adults who were immunized against pertussis as children.3. Transient bronchial hyperresponsiveness appears to be the predominant mechanism of the bothersome cough of acute bronchitis.4. Ruling out pneumonia is the primary objective in evaluating adults with acute cough illness in whom comorbid conditions and occult asthma are absent or unlikely. In the absence of abnormalities in vital signs (heart rate > 100 beats/min, respiratory rate > 24 breaths/min, and oral body temperature > 38 degrees C), the likelihood of pneumonia is very low.5. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials do not support routine antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis.6. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials have shown that inhaled albuterol decreases the duration of cough in adults with uncomplicated acute bronchitis.7. Intervention studies suggest that antibiotic treatment of acute bronchitis can be reduced by using a combination of patient and physician education. Decreased rates of antibiotic treatment are not associated with increased utilization, return visits, or dissatisfaction with care.

### Bronchitis (acute) [^114RWvnp]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute bronchitis, with transient inflammation of the trachea and major bronchi, affects over 40/1000 adults a year in the UK. The causes are usually considered to be infective, but only around half of people have identifiable pathogens. The role of smoking or of environmental tobacco smoke inhalation in predisposing to acute bronchitis is unclear. A third of people may have longer-term symptoms or recurrence.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute bronchitis in people without chronic respiratory disease? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2007 (BMJ Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 19 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics (amoxicillin [with or without clavulanic acid], cephalosporins, or macrolides), antihistamines, antitussives, beta(2) agonists (inhaled or oral), cephalosporins, expectorants, and analgesics.

### The problems of meta-analysis for antibiotic treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a heterogeneous disease: a commentary on puhan et al [^115PTo5q]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchitis is among the most common reasons for antibiotic prescription worldwide. This diagnosis includes two distinct entities, acute bronchitis in the absence of underlying lung disease and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Acute bronchitis is predominantly a viral disease with good evidence that antibiotics are not of benefit in its management. Exacerbations of COPD, on the other hand, can be of bacterial, viral or mixed etiology, with bacterial infection currently estimated to contribute up to 50% of exacerbations. Furthermore, in contrast to acute bronchitis, these exacerbation episodes are not benign events, as they have consequences ranging from days lost from work, deterioration of health status, progression of airflow obstruction and even death. Therefore, appropriate management of COPD exacerbations is crucial.

Antibiotics are often used in the management of COPD exacerbations. It is estimated that more than 80% of COPD exacerbations are treated on an outpatient basis, which can be regarded as mild to moderate exacerbations. The article published by Puhan et al this month in BMC Medicine makes the argument that there is a lack of evidence for antibiotic benefit in mild to moderate exacerbations of COPD and that additional placebo-controlled trials are required. Their argument is based on a meta-analytic approach where they identified five placebo-controlled randomized trials in the literature, which were confined to 'mild to moderate' exacerbations of COPD. With this approach, although all but one of the trials favor antibiotics, the combined odds ratio is not statistically significant.

Although their conclusions based on the analysis are not erroneous, their approach to this question highlights a number of issues that make it difficult to resolve this argument; these include the heterogeneity of exacerbations, patients and antibiotics in these trials. Another major issue is the acceptance of the results of these trials without critically examining the limitations of the end-points used in these studies. The 'devil is in the details' in these trials, and these details are often overlooked in a meta-analytic approach.

### Community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections: etiology and treatment [^115MX4yS]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

The current therapy for community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections is often empiric, usually involving administration of a beta-lactam or macrolide. However, the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance in frequently isolated respiratory tract pathogens has complicated the antimicrobial selection process. This review will discuss the incidence of various respiratory pathogens, as well as update the clinician on the various antimicrobial alternatives available, with particular emphasis on the role of the newer fluoroquinolones in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and community-acquired pneumonia.

### Bronchitis (acute) [^112idXny]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute bronchitis affects over 40/1000 adults a year in the UK. The causes are usually considered to be infective, but only around half of people have identifiable pathogens. The role of smoking or of environmental tobacco smoke inhalation in predisposing to acute bronchitis is unclear. One third of people may have longer-term symptoms or recurrence.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute bronchitis in people without chronic respiratory disease? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to March 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 21 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: analgesics, antibiotics (macrolides, tetracyclines, cephalosporins, penicillins, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [co-trimoxazole]), antihistamines, antitussives, beta(2) agonists (inhaled or oral), and expectorants/mucolytics.

Pediatric chronic wet/productive cough (≤ 14 years) persistent after initial antibiotics — For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic wet or productive cough unrelated to an underlying disease and without any specific cough pointers (eg, coughing with feeding, digital clubbing) when the wet cough persists after 2 weeks of appropriate antibiotics, we recommend treatment with an additional 2 weeks of the appropriate antibiotic(s) (Grade 1C).

### Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: when are antibiotics indicated? A systematic review [^111Koq5T]. Respiratory Research (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our systematic review informs the debate about appropriate prescription of antibiotics for COPD exacerbations. As long as exacerbations remain an ill-defined event, the distinction between in- and outpatient treatment may serve as simple guidance to decide for or against antibiotics. Patients with severe exacerbations requiring hospital admission benefit substantially from antibiotics. In outpatients with mild to moderate exacerbations, antibiotics appear to offer no benefits in general. Further research will show how the subgroup of patients with mild to moderate exacerbations, who might benefit from antibiotics, can be identified.

### Antibiotics for acute bronchitis [^111FGJZY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The benefits and risks of antibiotics for acute bronchitis remain unclear despite it being one of the most common illnesses seen in primary care.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics in improving outcomes and to assess adverse effects of antibiotic therapy for people with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2016, Issue 11 (accessed 13 January 2017), MEDLINE (1966 to January week 1, 2017), Embase (1974 to 13 January 2017), and LILACS (1982 to 13 January 2017). We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 5 April 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo or no treatment in acute bronchitis or acute productive cough, in people without underlying pulmonary disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Main Results

We did not identify any new trials for inclusion in this 2017 update. We included 17 trials with 5099 participants in the primary analysis. The quality of trials was generally good. At follow-up there was no difference in participants described as being clinically improved between the antibiotic and placebo groups (11 studies with 3841 participants, risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.15). Participants given antibiotics were less likely to have a cough (4 studies with 275 participants, RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.85; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 6) and a night cough (4 studies with 538 participants, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.83; NNTB 7). Participants given antibiotics had a shorter mean cough duration (7 studies with 2776 participants, mean difference (MD) -0.46 days, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.04). The differences in presence of a productive cough at follow-up and MD of productive cough did not reach statistical significance. Antibiotic-treated participants were more likely to be improved according to clinician's global assessment (6 studies with 891 participants, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.79; NNTB 11) and were less likely to have an abnormal lung exam (5 studies with 613 participants, RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.70; NNTB 6). Antibiotic-treated participants also had a reduction in days feeling ill (5 studies with 809 participants, MD -0.64 days, 95% CI -1.16 to -0.13) and days with impaired activity (6 studies with 767 participants, MD -0.49 days, 95% CI -0.94 to -0.04). The differences in proportions with activity limitations at follow-up did not reach statistical significance. There was a significant trend towards an increase in adverse effects in the antibiotic group (12 studies with 3496 participants, RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.36; NNT for an additional harmful outcome 24).

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited evidence of clinical benefit to support the use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis. Antibiotics may have a modest beneficial effect in some patients such as frail, elderly people with multimorbidity who may not have been included in trials to date. However, the magnitude of this benefit needs to be considered in the broader context of potential side effects, medicalisation for a self limiting condition, increased resistance to respiratory pathogens, and cost of antibiotic treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics in improving outcomes and assess adverse effects of antibiotic therapy for patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 12, MEDLINE (1966 to January week 1, 2014), EMBASE (1974 to January 2014) and LILACS (1982 to January 2014).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo or no treatment in acute bronchitis or acute productive cough, in patients without underlying pulmonary disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Main Results

Seventeen trials with 3936 participants were included in the primary analysis. The quality of trials was generally good. There was limited evidence to support the use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis. At follow-up, there was no difference in participants described as being clinically improved between antibiotic and placebo groups (11 studies with 3841 participants, risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.15; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 22. Participants given antibiotics were less likely to have a cough (four studies with 275 participants, RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.85; NNTB 6); have a night cough (four studies with 538 participants, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.83; NNTB 7) and a shorter mean cough duration (seven studies with 2776 participants, mean difference (MD) -0.46 days, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.04). The differences in presence of a productive cough at follow-up and MD of productive cough did not reach statistical significance. Antibiotic-treated patients were more likely to be unimproved according to clinician's global assessment (six studies with 891 participants, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.79; NNTB 25); have an abnormal lung exam (five studies with 613 participants, RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.70; NNTB 6); have a reduction in days feeling ill (five studies with 809 participants, MD -0.64 days, 95% CI -1.16 to -0.13) and a reduction in days with limited activity (six studies with 767 participants MD -0.49 days, 95% CI -0.94 to -0.04). The differences in proportions with activity limitations at follow-up did not reach statistical significance. There was a significant trend towards an increase in adverse effects in the antibiotic group (12 studies with 3496 participants) (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.36; NNT for an additional adverse effect 5).

### Medication regimens for managing COPD exacerbations [^114ziMd3]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Exacerbations are a hallmark feature of COPD and contribute to morbidity and mortality. There is general agreement that the pharmacotherapy of COPD exacerbations includes bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics. Strong evidence exists for the benefit of corticosteroids for exacerbations and of antibiotics in the acute hospital setting. There remains considerable uncertainty, however, in the best drug selection, dose, route, and duration of treatment. This article reviews the evidence base and expert recommendations for drug treatment of COPD exacerbations in the out-patient and in-patient settings.

### Where is the supporting evidence for treating mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations with antibiotics? A systematic review [^113MyjFe]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Methods

Data sources and searches

For the identification of antibiotics trials in COPD patients, we used a comprehensive literature search described elsewhere. In brief, information specialists (Bazian, London, UK,) searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2005 issue 4), PREMEDLINE (1960 to 1965), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2006), EMBASE (1974 to March 2006), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE, March 2006) for any randomised trials on antibiotics in COPD patients. Two reviewers independently assessed the titles and abstracts of all the identified citations without imposing any language restrictions. The full text of any article that seemed potentially eligible by one of the reviewers was ordered. The reviewers then evaluated the full text of retrieved articles and selected those meeting the inclusion criteria. Each reviewer's decisions were recorded in the Endnote file and any disagreements were resolved by consensus.

Study selection

We included randomised head-to-head trials comparing any antibiotics or an antibiotic with placebo for the treatment of mild to moderate exacerbations in COPD patients. Placebo-controlled trials allow for an estimation of the specific effects of the treatment and offer a proof of effectiveness.

As with any systematic review on this topic, a difficulty is that definitions of COPD have varied over time. In particular, spirometry criteria became widespread only after 1995 and we accepted a clinical diagnosis of COPD, chronic bronchitis or emphysema. However, in order to include only trials whose patients were very likely to have COPD, we included studies only if patients with chronic bronchitis were at least 40 years of age and/or if at least 80% were smokers or ex-smokers. The presence of these characteristics (chronic bronchitis, age and smoking history) renders a diagnosis of COPD according to modern (spirometric) criteria extremely likely. We defined patients to have 'mild to moderate exacerbations' if they needed any outpatient treatment (level I exacerbation) according to the Operational Classification of Severity of the European Respiratory and American Thoracic Societies.

### Antibiotics for acute bronchitis [^117ABtD6]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Are antibiotics associated with improved outcomes in patients with acute bronchitis?

Bottom Line

Prescribing antibiotics for acute bronchitis was associated with reduced overall and nighttime cough and with an approximately half-day reduction in duration of cough, in days feeling ill, and in days with impaired activities. However, at follow-up, there were no significant differences in patients receiving antibiotics compared with those receiving placebo in overall clinical improvements or limitations in work or other activities. There was a significant increase in adverse effects in the antibiotic group, particularly gastrointestinal symptoms.

### Short-course antibiotic treatment in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and COPD: a meta-analysis of double-blind studies [^111NusUR]. Thorax (2008). Low credibility.

Background

A study was undertaken to determine whether a short course of antibiotic treatment (≤ 5 days) is as effective as the conventional longer treatment in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials were searched to July 2006. Studies considered eligible were double-blind randomised clinical trials including adult patients ≥ 18 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of exacerbation of COPD or chronic bronchitis, no antimicrobial therapy at the time of diagnosis and random assignment to antibiotic treatment for ≤ 5 days versus > 5 days. The primary outcome measure was clinical cure at early follow-up on an intention-to-treat basis.

Results

21 studies with a total of 10 698 patients were included. The average quality of the studies was high: the mean (SD) Jadad score was 3.9 (0.9). At early follow-up (< 25 days), the summary odds ratio (OR) for clinical cure with short treatment versus conventional treatment was 0.99 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.08). At late follow-up the summary OR was 1.0 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.10) and the summary OR for bacteriological cure was 1.05 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.26). Similar summary ORs were observed for early cure in trials with the same antibiotic in both arms and in studies grouped by the antibiotic class used in the short-course arm.

Conclusions

A short course of antibiotic treatment is as effective as the traditional longer treatment in patients with mild to moderate exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and COPD.

### Duration of initial antibiotic course is associated with recurrent relapse in protracted bacterial bronchitis [^111gVfs7]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2020). Medium credibility.

Protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) is the leading cause of chronic wet cough in young children from developed countries. Despite its high prevalence there is a paucity of evidence to inform the optimal duration of treatment leading to variation in practice. Relapse of chronic cough is common and recurrent PBB (> 3 episodes in 12 months) is associated with a future diagnosis of bronchiectasis. We investigated the factors associated with any relapse (≥ 1 episode in 12 months) and recurrent PBB in 66 children. No factor was significantly associated with any relapse. Duration of initial antibiotic treatment was the only factor significantly associated with recurrent PBB. Those who received antibiotics for 6weeks antibiotics were less likely to develop recurrent PBB than those who received for 2weeks (p = 0.046). This is the first study to show an association between duration of initial antibiotic course and therefore future bronchiectasis. Prospective studies are needed to investigate this association.

### Chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis: CHEST expert panel report [^111BWZ1A]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis — evidence base and clinical statement: Only six studies were eligible, with five pharmacological and one nonpharmacological intervention, and the nonpharmacological study used positive end-expiratory pressure; although all authors reported significant improvement in cough measures, studies were very small, had design or outcome limitations, several did not present cough outcome data, most were short in duration (2 to 12 weeks for pharmacologic studies and 6 months for the nonpharmacologic study), and using GRADE the evidence level was very low; accordingly, for adult patients with chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of any pharmacologic treatments (antibiotics, bronchodilators, mucolytics) as a means of relieving cough per se.

### Clinical significance of the infection-free interval in the management of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis [^111xHDwB]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Rational and appropriate antibiotic use for patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB) is a major concern, as approximately half of these patients do not have a bacterial infection. Typically, the result of antimicrobial therapy for patients with acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (ABECB) is not eradication of the pathogen but resolution of the acute symptoms. However, the length of time before the next bacterial exacerbation can be another important variable, as the frequency of exacerbations will affect the overall health of the patient and the rate of lung deterioration over time. Clinical trials comparing antimicrobial therapies commonly measure resolution of symptoms in AECB patients as the primary end point, regardless of whether the exacerbation is documented as bacterial in nature. Ideally, the scientific approach to assessing the efficacy of antibiotic therapy for ABECB should include a measurement of acute bacterial eradication rates in patients with documented bronchial bacterial infection followed by measurement of the infection-free interval (IFI), ie, the time to the next ABECB. The use of these variables can provide a standard for comparing various antimicrobial therapies. As we learn more about how antibiotics can affect the IFI, treatment decisions should be adapted to ensure optimal management of ABECB for the long-term.

### Protracted bacterial bronchitis: the last decade and the road ahead [^115vjqBg]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2016). Low credibility.

Cough is the single most common reason for primary care physician visits and, when chronic, a frequent indication for specialist referrals. In children, a chronic cough (> 4 weeks) is associated with increased morbidity and reduced quality of life. One common cause of childhood chronic cough is protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), especially in children aged < 6 years. PBB is characterized by a chronic wet or productive cough without signs of an alternative cause and responds to 2 weeks of appropriate antibiotics, such as amoxicillin-clavulanate. Most children with PBB are unable to expectorate sputum. If bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage are performed, evidence of bronchitis and purulent endobronchial secretions are seen. Bronchoalveolar lavage specimens typically reveal marked neutrophil infiltration and culture large numbers of respiratory bacterial pathogens, especially Haemophilus influenzae. Although regarded as having a good prognosis, recurrences are common and if these are frequent or do not respond to antibiotic treatments of up to 4-weeks duration, the child should be investigated for other causes of chronic wet cough, such as bronchiectasis. The contribution of airway malacia and pathobiologic mechanisms of PBB remain uncertain and, other than reduced alveolar phagocytosis, evidence of systemic, or local immune deficiency is lacking. Instead, pulmonary defenses show activated innate immunity and increased gene expression of the interleukin-1β signalling pathway. Whether these changes in local inflammatory responses are cause or effect remains to be determined. It is likely that PBB and bronchiectasis are at the opposite ends of the same disease spectrum, so children with chronic wet cough require close monitoring.

### Procalcitonin to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment in acute respiratory infections: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^112skr5A]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) comprise a large and heterogeneous group of infections, including bacterial infections, viral infections, and infections of other etiologies. Early initiation of adequate antibiotic therapy is the cornerstone in the treatment of bacterial ARIs and is associated with improved clinical outcomes. However, overuse of antibiotics by overprescription in outpatients with bronchitis, for instance, and prolonged duration of antibiotic therapy in patients with bacterial ARIs in the hospital and intensive care setting is associated with increased resistance for common bacteria, high costs, and adverse drug reactions. The safe reduction in antibiotic use is therefore of utmost importance.

In recent years, procalcitonin (PCT) has emerged as a promising marker for the diagnosis of bacterial infections because higher levels are found in severe bacterial infections than in viral infections and nonspecific inflammatory diseases. Hence, PCT may be used to support clinical decision making for the initiation and discontinuation of antibiotic therapy. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the feasibility of such a strategy in different ARI patient populations and different settings ranging from primary care to emergency departments (EDs), hospital wards, and intensive care units (ICUs). Most individual trials, however, lacked the statistical power to assess the risk for mortality and severe infectious disease complications associated with PCT-guided decision making.

We undertook an individual patient data meta-analysis of trials comparing the effects of using PCT to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with ARI assigned to routine PCT measurement or standard of care without PCT measurement. The aim of this analysis was to assess the safety and efficacy of this approach over a large range of patients with varying severity of ARIs.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis: background [^1152zHys]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute bronchitis apply to immunocompetent adults without complicating comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease. The evaluation of adults with an acute cough illness or a presumptive diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bronchitis should focus on ruling out serious illness, particularly pneumonia. In healthy, nonelderly adults, pneumonia is uncommon in the absence of vital sign abnormalities or asymmetrical lung sounds, and chest radiography is usually not indicated. In patients with cough lasting 3 weeks or longer, chest radiography may be warranted in the absence of other known causes. Routine antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis is not recommended, regardless of duration of cough. If pertussis infection is suspected (an unusual circumstance), a diagnostic test should be performed and antimicrobial therapy initiated. Patient satisfaction with care for acute bronchitis depends most on physician — patient communication rather than on antibiotic treatment.

### Management of children with chronic wet cough and protracted bacterial bronchitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^1122TkjS]. Chest (2017). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline — management of chronic wet cough and protracted bacterial bronchitis in children: In children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic (> 4 weeks' duration) wet/productive cough, there is high-quality evidence that using appropriate antibiotics improves cough resolution, and further investigations (eg, flexible bronchoscopy, chest CT scans, immunity tests) should be undertaken when specific cough pointers (eg, digital clubbing) are present. When the wet cough does not improve following 4 weeks of antibiotic treatment, there is moderate-quality evidence that further investigations should be considered to look for an underlying disease. New recommendations include recognition of the clinical diagnostic entity of protracted bacterial bronchitis.

### Management of children with chronic wet cough and protracted bacterial bronchitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^1169SMQn]. Chest (2017). Medium credibility.

Chronic wet cough/protracted bacterial bronchitis in children — antibiotic efficacy and duration evidence indicate that three randomized controlled trials showed benefit with antibiotics, with number needed to treat for benefit by end of study 3 [95% CI, 2.0–4.3]; treatment durations ranged from 1 to 8 weeks, with prospective studies using 7 days to 2 weeks and retrospective studies 4–6 weeks and 6–8 weeks; overall, a 2-week course is generally sufficient but up to 4 weeks may be required in a minority of children; British Thoracic Society cough guidelines suggest 4 to 6 weeks, though this review did not identify prospective study-derived evidence for that duration; if chronic wet cough does not resolve after 4 weeks of appropriate oral antibiotics, one study reported an increased likelihood of CT scan-diagnosed bronchiectasis (adjusted OR, 5.9 [95% CI, 1.2–28.5]).

### Antibiotics for persistent cough or wheeze following acute bronchiolitis in children [^115oPypm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiolitis is a common acute respiratory condition with high prevalence worldwide. This clinically diagnosed syndrome is manifested by tachypnoea (rapid breathing), with crackles or wheeze in young children. In the acute phase of bronchiolitis (≤ 14 days), antibiotics are not routinely prescribed unless the illness is severe or a secondary bacterial infection is suspected. Although bronchiolitis is usually self-limiting, some young children continue to have protracted symptoms (e.g. cough and wheezing) beyond the acute phase and often re-present to secondary care.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness of antibiotics versus controls (placebo or no treatment) for reducing or treating persistent respiratory symptoms following acute bronchiolitis within six months of acute illness.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), the World Health Organization (WHO) trial portal, the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, and ClinicalTrials.gov, up to 26 August 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics versus controls (placebo or no treatment) given in the post-acute phase of bronchiolitis (> 14 days) for children younger than two years with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies against predefined criteria, and selected, extracted, and assessed data for inclusion. We contacted trial authors for further information.

Main Results

In this review update, we added one study with 219 children. A total of two RCTs with 249 children (n = 240 completed) were eligible for inclusion in this review. Both studies contributed to our primary and secondary outcomes, but we assessed the quality of evidence for our three primary outcomes as low, owing to the small numbers of studies and participants; and high attrition in one of the studies. Data show no significant differences between treatment groups for our primary outcomes: proportion of children (n = 249) who had persistent symptoms at follow-up (odds ratio (OR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37 to 1.28; fixed-effect model); and number of children (n = 240) rehospitalised with respiratory illness within six months (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.05 to 6.21; random-effects model). We were unable to analyse exacerbation rate because studies used different methods to report this information. Data showed no significant differences between treatment groups for our secondary outcome: proportion of children (n = 240) with wheeze at six months (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.06 to 3.95; random-effects model). One study reported bacterial resistance, but only at 48 hours (thus with limited applicability for this review). Another study reported adverse events from which all children recovered and remained in the study.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence is insufficient to inform whether antibiotics should be used to treat or prevent persistent respiratory symptoms in the post-acute bronchiolitis phase. Future RCTs are needed to evaluate the efficacy of antibiotics for reducing persistent respiratory symptoms. This is particularly important in populations with high acute and post-acute bronchiolitis morbidity (e.g. indigenous populations in Australia, New Zealand, and the USA).

### Causes of chronic productive cough: an approach to management [^117T5Gvx]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

A chronic 'productive' or 'wet' cough is a common presenting complaint for patients attending the adult respiratory clinic. Most reviews and guidelines suggest that the causes of a productive cough are the same as those of a non-productive cough and as such the same diagnostic pathway should be followed. We suggest a different diagnostic approach for patients with a productive cough, focussing on the conditions that are the most likely causes of this problem. This review is intended to briefly summarise the epidemiology, clinical features, pathophysiology and treatment of a number of conditions which are often associated with chronic productive cough to aid decision making when encountering a patient with this often distressing symptom. The conditions discussed include bronchiectasis, chronic bronchitis, asthma, eosinophilic bronchitis and immunodeficiency. We also propose an adult version of the paediatric diagnosis of protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) in patients with idiopathic chronic productive cough who appear to respond well to low dose macrolide therapy.

### Long-term antibiotics in the management of non-CF bronchiectasis – do they improve outcome? [^115ybeLu]. Respiratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

In addition to bacteria and inflammatory cells, the sputum of patients with bronchiectasis contains mediators that damage the airway epithelium and promote inflammatory change. The deleterious effects of these mediators, such as neutrophil elastase, reduce host defences and consequently perpetuate the propensity to recurrent infection. This 'vicious cycle' of infection and inflammation in bronchiectasis suggests that long-term antibiotic therapy might be beneficial in these patients by reducing microbial load and, in doing so, inhibit inflammation in the lung allowing tissue repair to occur. Short courses of antibiotics achieve clinical improvements and also have been shown to reduce the levels of harmful mediators in the sputum. This article will cite the studies reported for long-term antibiotic treatment in bronchiectasis and overall there seems to be benefits for patients with chronic sputum purulence. The evidence that supports the postulated pathological mechanisms will also be discussed. Important issues in clinical practice such as the usefulness of antibiotic sensitivities, the evolution of resistance patterns, and drug delivery will also be discussed.

### Antibiotics for prolonged wet cough in children [^1137RANQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cough is a frequent symptom presenting to doctors. The most common cause of childhood chronic (greater than fours weeks' duration) wet cough is protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) in some settings, although other more serious causes can also present this way. Timely and effective management of chronic wet or productive cough improves quality of life and clinical outcomes. Current international guidelines suggest a course of antibiotics is the first treatment of choice in the absence of signs or symptoms specific to an alternative diagnosis. This review sought to clarify the current evidence to support this recommendation.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of antibiotics in treating children with prolonged wet cough (excluding children with bronchiectasis or other known underlying respiratory illness) and to assess risk of harm due to adverse events.

Search Methods

We undertook an updated search (from 2008 onwards) using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, trials registries, review articles and reference lists of relevant articles. The latest searches were performed in September 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with a placebo or a control group in children with chronic wet cough. We excluded cluster and cross-over trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methods as recommended by Cochrane. We reviewed results of searches against predetermined criteria for inclusion. Two independent review authors selected, extracted and assessed the data for inclusion. We contacted authors of eligible studies for further information as needed. We analysed data as 'intention to treat'.
Main Results

We identified three studies as eligible for inclusion in the review. Two were in the previous review and one new study was included. We considered the older studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias whereas we judged the newly included study at low risk of bias. The studies varied in treatment duration (from 7 to 14 days) and the antibiotic used (two studies used amoxicillin/clavulanate acid and one used erythromycin). We included 190 children (171 completed), mean ages ranged from 21 months to six years, in the meta-analyses. Analysis of all three trials (190 children) found that treatment with antibiotics reduced the proportion of children not cured at follow-up (primary outcome measure) (odds ratio (OR) 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.31, using intention-to -treat analysis), which translated to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 3 (95% CI 2 to 4). We identified no significant heterogeneity (for both fixed-effect and random-effects model the I² statistic was 0%). Two older trials assessed progression of illness, defined by requirement for further antibiotics (125 children), which was significantly lower in the antibiotic group (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.34; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 5). All three trials (190 children) reported adverse events, which were not significantly increased in the antibiotic group compared to the control group (OR 1.88, 95% CI 0.62 to 5.69). We assessed the quality of evidence GRADE rating as moderate for all outcome measures, except adverse events which we assessed as low quality.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence suggests antibiotics are efficacious for the treatment of children with chronic wet cough (greater than four weeks) with an NNTB of three. However, antibiotics have adverse effects and this review reported only uncertainty as to the risk of increased adverse effects when they were used in this setting. The inclusion of a more robust study strengthened the previous Cochrane review and its results.

### Procalcitonin-guided diagnosis and antibiotic stewardship revisited [^114MaMYq]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Summary, future directions, and conclusions

This update of a previous narrative review found several interesting new clinical settings in which PCT-guided therapy could help to reduce antibiotic exposure by decreasing either initiation or duration of treatment. Particularly, controlled clinical studies have found that PCT improves the management of patients with lower respiratory tract infections and critically ill sepsis patients, as well as patients with UTIs, postoperative infections, meningitis, and acute heart failure with possible superinfection (i.e. pneumonia). Recording PCT levels on hospital admission was found to substantially reduce the initiation of antibiotic treatment in low-risk situations (i.e. bronchitis, AECOPD). For more severe infections (i.e. pneumonia, sepsis), antibiotic stewardship by monitoring PCT kinetics resulted in shorter antibiotic treatment duration by early cessation of therapy. These strategies appear to be safe without increasing the risk for mortality, recurrent infections, or treatment failure. PCT kinetics have also proved to have prognostic value, correlating with disease severity (i.e. pancreatitis, abdominal infection) and resolution of illness (i.e. sepsis). While there is strong evidence regarding antibiotic stewardship in respiratory infection and sepsis, PCT has not been as well studied for other types of infections. Thus, future research should focus on non-respiratory infections and investigate whether PCT improves antibiotic decisions in these patients. PCT should also be compared to other markers, such as CRP, in regard to diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness.

Emerging bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents calls for more effective efforts to reduce the unnecessary and prolonged use of antibiotics in self-limiting non-bacterial and resolving diseases. Healthcare professionals share a common goal of achieving symptom relief from infection as fast as possible and often see antibiotics as the best means to achieve this goal. This "one size fits all" approach, however, does not answer the basic questions of who truly benefits from antibiotic therapy and what would be the optimal duration of treatment. There is a growing body of literature supporting the use of PCT as a persuasive, evidence-based approach to a more rational use of antibiotics.

### Should we prescribe antibiotics for acute bronchitis? [^111s1h3S]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

People with acute bronchitis may show little evidence of bacterial infection. If effective, antibiotics could shorten the course of the disease. However, if they are not effective, the risk of antibiotic resistance may be increased. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of antibiotic treatment in patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis.

Search Strategy

The authors searched MEDLINE, Embase, reference lists of articles, personal collections up to 1996 and Sci-search from 1989 to 1996.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo in acute bronchitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two reviewers extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Primary Results

The results of eight trials involving 750 patients from eight years of age to 65 and older and including smokers and nonsmokers were included. The quality of the trials was variable. A variety of outcome measures was assessed. In many cases, only outcomes that showed a statistically significant difference between groups were reported. Overall, patients taking antibiotics had slightly better outcomes than those taking placebo. They were less likely to report feeling unwell at a follow-up visit (odds ratio, 0.42; 95 percent confidence interval [CI] 0.22 to 0.82), to show no improvement on physician assessment (odds ratio, 0.43; CI, 0.23 to 0.79) or to have abnormal lung findings (odds ratio, 0.33; CI, 0.13 to 0.86), and had a more rapid return to work or usual activities (weighted mean difference, 0.7 days earlier; CI, 0.2 to 1.3). Antibiotic-treated patients reported significantly more adverse effects (odds ratio, 1.64; CI, 1.05 to 2.57), such as nausea, vomiting, headache, skin rash or vaginitis.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Antibiotics appear to have a modest beneficial effect in the treatment of acute bronchitis, with a correspondingly small risk of adverse effects. The benefits of antibiotics may be overestimated in this analysis because of the tendency of published reports to include complete data only on outcomes found to be statistically significant.

Infectious Disease Interventions

The CFF recommends, for people with CRMS/CFSPID, selectively offering inhaled antibiotics for the treatment of Pa based on a positive respiratory culture (Grade C).
The CFF recommends, for people with CRMS/CFSPID and an unexplained prolonged cough (> 2 weeks), selectively offering the use of oral antibiotics (Grade C).

A higher prevalence of Pa is reported in respiratory cultures from people with CRMS/CFSPID compared with those collected from children without CF, and treatment to eradicate incident Pa infection is recommended for pwCF. However, the clinical impact of Pa in respiratory cultures from people with CRMS/CFSPID is unclear. Pa may clear spontaneously, (ie, independent of whether treatment is provided), calling into question the value of Pa eradication therapy. The committee recommends selectively offering this treatment after a SDM process incorporating the potential benefits, risks, and treatment burden of inhaled antibiotic therapy in people with CRMS/CFSPID with positive respiratory culture for Pa. If the decision is to treat, then follow-up cultures are warranted to ensure Pa clearance.

Precedent is established regarding use of oral antibiotics for prolonged cough for individuals with respiratory conditions other than CF, including tracheobronchomalacia, protracted bacterial bronchitis, non-CF bronchiectasis and neuromuscular disease. – The committee discussed this consideration while weighing the potential benefits and harms of antibiotic therapy. The use of any antibiotic for eradication or treatment may depend on clinical status of the individual, and the risks and benefits of treatment burden should be assessed for each family. For people with CRMS/CFSPID with a cough lasting > 2 weeks, other etiologies of persistent cough, such as asthma, should be considered.

### Management of children with chronic wet cough and protracted bacterial bronchitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116CwFWy]. Chest (2017). Medium credibility.

Children with chronic wet cough and protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) — key research priorities and guideline conclusions are as follows: priorities include determining the outcomes of chronic wet cough following an acute infection in various settings (community and hospital) through multicenter cohort studies; conducting multicenter, parallel-group randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on antibiotic efficacy in primary care using validated cough outcome measures, and "Ideally, an objective cough outcome (eg, cough counts) should also be included as an outcome"; determining the optimal length of antibiotics in different circumstances; defining the most appropriate time point for referral for further investigations when specific cough pointers are absent and wet cough persists after antibiotic treatment; and intervention studies to prevent recurrence of PBB, especially for those with very frequent recurrences. The document states that this update of the 2006 CHEST Cough Guidelines produced new recommendations from systematic reviews addressing two key clinical questions, recognizes PBB as a clinical diagnostic entity not mentioned in the 2006 guidelines, and notes these recommendations were endorsed by the CHEST Expert Cough Panel, with high-quality evidence for most recommendations but remaining gaps particularly in primary care. The guideline is endorsed by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (AAAAI), American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC), American Thoracic Society (ATS), Asian Pacific Society of Respirology (APSR), and Irish Thoracic Society (ITS).

### Antibiotics for lower respiratory tract infection in children presenting in primary care in england (ARTIC PC): a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^116voCdS]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Only one trial in the Cochrane review of antibiotics for acute bronchitis included children as young as 3 years of age presenting with uncomplicated acute chest infections. In that trial, there were only 100 children aged 12 years or younger, and the estimate of immediate antibiotics compared with no offer of antibiotics on symptom duration (HR 1·00) and symptom severity (mean reduction −0·3 on a scale of 0–6) was similar to the non-significant result of the whole trial cohort. These results are consistent with the results of the current study. A Cochrane review found inconclusive evidence for the effect of antibiotics in preventing RTIs, but a more recent trial of azithromycin used in early infections was effective in preventing severe illness among preschool children with recurrent infection(from 8% to 5%), although concern remains about the longer-term effects on antibiotic resistance from the use of long-acting macrolides. A placebo-controlled trial of antibiotic versus placebo for pneumonia in young children in an LMIC setting found low failure rates in both placebo (5%) and antibiotic (3%) groups, and a 5-day course is equivalent to 10 days for community-acquired pneumonia.

### Bronchitis (acute) [^116AouQL]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute bronchitis affects more than 40 in 1000 adults per year in the UK. The causes are usually considered to be infective, but only around half of people have identifiable pathogens. The role of smoking or of environmental tobacco smoke inhalation in predisposing to acute bronchitis is unclear. One third of people may have longer-term symptoms or recurrence.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review, aiming to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute bronchitis in people without chronic respiratory disease? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2015 (Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview).

Results

At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 420 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 306 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 245 studies and the further review of 61 full publications. Of the 61 full articles evaluated, three updated systematic reviews and three RCTs were added at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for 12 PICO combinations.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we categorised the efficacy for six intervention-comparison combinations, based on information about the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, antihistamines, antitussives, beta2 agonists (inhaled), and expectorants/mucolytics.

### Chronic cough due to acute bronchitis: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1156nhgo]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of cough due to acute bronchitis and make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice. Acute bronchitis is one of the most common diagnoses made by primary care clinicians and emergency department physicians. It is an acute respiratory infection with a normal chest radiograph that is manifested by cough with or without phlegm production that lasts for up to 3 weeks. Respiratory viruses appear to be the most common cause of acute bronchitis; however, the organism responsible is rarely identified in clinical practice because viral cultures and serologic assays are not routinely performed. Fewer than 10% of patients will have a bacterial infection diagnosed as the cause of bronchitis. The diagnosis of acute bronchitis should be made only when there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and the common cold, acute asthma, or an exacerbation of COPD have been ruled out as the cause of cough. Acute bronchitis is a self-limited respiratory disorder, and when the cough persists for > 3 weeks, other diagnoses must be considered.

Methods

Recommendations for this review were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, which was performed in August 2004. The search was limited to literature published in the English language and human studies, using search terms such as "cough", "acute bronchitis", and "acute viral respiratory infection".

Results

Unfortunately, most previous controlled trials guiding the treatment of acute bronchitis have not vigorously differentiated acute bronchitis and the common cold, and also have not distinguished between an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and acute asthma as a cause of acute cough. For patients with the putative diagnosis of acute bronchitis, routine treatment with antibiotics is not justified and should not be offered. Antitussive agents are occasionally useful and can be offered as therapy for short-term symptomatic relief of coughing, but there is no role for inhaled bronchodilator or expectorant therapy. Children and adult patients with confirmed and probable whooping cough should receive a macrolide antibiotic and should be isolated for 5 days from the start of treatment; early treatment within the first few weeks will diminish the coughing paroxysms and prevent spread of the disease; the patient is unlikely to respond to treatment beyond this period.

Conclusion

Acute bronchitis is an acute respiratory infection that is manifested by cough and, at times, sputum production that lasts for no more than 3 weeks. This syndrome should be distinguished from the common cold, an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and acute asthma as the cause of acute cough. The widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of acute bronchitis is not justified, and vigorous efforts to curtail their use should be encouraged.

### Antibiotics for prolonged moist cough in children [^115aG7bK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Cough is the most common symptom which presents to doctors. Chronic cough is reported in up to 9% of preschool aged children. American general practice guidelines suggest antimicrobial treatment may be indicated in children with cough lasting > 10 days. Questions concerning the benefits and harm of antibiotic treatment for prolonged cough in children need to be resolved.

Objectives

A Cochrane systematic review was undertaken to determine the efficacy of antibiotics in treating children with chronic moist cough (excluding those with bronchiectasis or other underlying respiratory illnesses).

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, review articles and reference lists of relevant articles were searched. The latest searches were performed on 12th April 2004.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with a placebo or a control group in children with chronic moist cough were considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Results of searches were reviewed against pre-determined criteria for inclusion. Two independent reviewers selected, extracted and assessed the data for inclusion. Authors were contacted for further information. Data were analysed as 'intention to treat'.

Main Results

Two studies were eligible for inclusion in the review. Neither study was high quality. Both studies failed to include a prospective analysis of cough quality in their inclusion criteria, although indicating > 75% of children included had moist cough (Darelid 1993). A total of 140 patients, aged seven years or less, were included in meta-analysis. Treatment with antibiotics reduced the proportion of children not cured at follow-up (primary outcome measure) in both studies; pooled odds ratio (OR) was 0.13, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.32 (using intention to treat analysis), which translates to number needed to treat (NNT) of 3 (95% CI 2 to 4). No significant heterogeneity was found (fixed and random-effects model I(2) was 4%). However for this outcome measure, the overall estimate of effect and degree of statistical heterogeneity were sensitive to the model used for meta-analysis. Progression of illness, defined by requirement for further antibiotics, was significantly lower in the treatment group (OR 0.10, 95%CI 0.03 to 0.34), NNT was 4 (95% CI 3 to 5). Adverse events were not significantly increased in the treatment group.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotics are likely to be beneficial in the treatment of children with chronic moist cough. This evidence is however limited by study quality, study design and sensitivity analysis data. The use of antibiotics however has to be balanced against their well known adverse events. Further well-designed RCTs using valid cough outcome measures are needed to answer this question conclusively.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^115KNG56]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations — antibiotic indications and duration: Antibiotics should be given to patients with exacerbations of COPD who meet cardinal symptom criteria or require mechanical ventilation (invasive or noninvasive). A metanalysis demonstrated that ≤ 5 days of antibiotic treatment had the same clinical and bacteriological efficacy as longer conventional treatment in outpatients, and We recommend a duration of ≤ 5 days of antibiotic treatment for outpatient treatment of COPD exacerbations. Based on conflicting data, we cannot recommend at this time the use of procalcitonin-based protocols to decide on antibiotic use in COPD exacerbations.

### Management of children with chronic wet cough and protracted bacterial bronchitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115VXYy7]. Chest (2017). Medium credibility.

Summary of evidence and interpretation — study limitations and outcome needs: The systematic review was limited by the small number of studies, with all but one study conducted in major hospitals; large multicenter studies particularly in primary care will be required to build the evidence base to inform management outside of major hospitals or tertiary referral centers, and when cough is used as a study outcome, the use of validated outcome measures would improve the quality of studies, as the lack of the use of validated cough outcomes and a priori definitions are major limitations of many chronic cough studies in children.

### Macrolides and airway inflammation in children [^1169RotN]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

For more than 20 years macrolide antibiotics have been used to treat chronic inflammatory airway diseases based on their immunomodulatory activity. Macrolide antibiotics down-regulate damaging prolonged inflammation as well as increase mucus clearance, decrease bacterial virulence and prevent biofilm formation. Initially shown to decrease morbidity and mortality in diffuse panbronchiolitis and in steroid-dependent asthma, long-term macrolide therapy has now been shown to significantly reduce exacerbations and improve lung function and quality of life in children with cystic fibrosis. They have also proven beneficial in Japanese children and adults with chronic sinobronchitis especially when there is nasal polyposis. Long-term macrolides have also proven clinically beneficial in some patients with plastic bronchitis. Adverse reactions are few and generally self-limited when used at the recommended dosage for immunomodulation.

### Effectiveness of anti-inflammatory treatment versus antibiotic therapy and placebo for patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis with purulent sputum. the BAAP study protocol [^113ket9Z]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

In recent years the idea that acute bronchitis is more an inflammatory than infectious process has begun to take shape. Thus, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have shown to be effective in reducing the duration and the intensity of cough in patients with bronchitis in observational studies and they are therefore recommended in the guidelines of clinical practice. However, their effectiveness has not been observed in clinical trials. To date, no study has been published comparing the role of anti-inflammatory drugs with antibiotics. We therefore designed this clinical trial with the aim of determining the effectiveness of ibuprofen (most frequently prescribed anti-inflammatory drug in Spain) compared with the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (antibiotic most often prescribed by Spanish primary care physicians) and also compared with a placebo groups of healthy adult patients with acute bronchitis and purulent expectoration.

Objectives

The aim of the study is to evaluate the number of days of frequent cough (defined by the symptom diary with a score of 1 or more) in the three treatment arms (oral anti-inflammatory, antibiotic or placebo) taken during 10 days. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy on the second visit, evaluate the speed of action in the resolution of the symptoms of acute bronchitis in the three treatment arms, assess the relationship between C-reactive protein concentrations and the resolution of the symptoms in each treatment arm and evaluate the secondary effects and adverse reactions in the three treatment arms of the study.

### Antibiotics for bacterial exacerbations of bronchitis… [^111fqJY3]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae). However, many physicians advocate the use of empiric antibiotic therapy in all patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis because of the potential for significant morbidity. Chodosh and colleagues performed a double-blind study comparing ciprofloxacin and clarithromycin to determine clinical and bacteriologic efficacy and safety of the two therapies. They also sought to compare the length of the infection-free interval between one acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and the next exacerbation. Patients were randomized to receive two 250-mg tablets of either ciprofloxacin or clarithromycin, which were identical in appearance. The antibiotics were administered twice daily for 14 days. The use of expectorants and bronchodilators was permitted.

The effectiveness of the antimicrobial agents was assessed by patient clinical response and laboratory measurements, with a physical examination at two, 12, 24 and 36 weeks post-treatment — or when a treatment failure or a new exacerbation ocurred. A total of 376 patients were initially randomized into the study. Approximately one-third of the patients were smokers; otherwise no significant differences existed between the two groups. Two hundred and eleven patients completed the study; however, the other 162 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis arm of the study. The median length of infection-free interval was 142 days in the ciprofloxacin group and 51 days in the clarithromycin group. Bacterial eradication at the end of therapy was 91 percent in the ciprofloxacin group but only 77 percent in the clarithromycin patients.

The authors conclude from this study that patients taking ciprofloxacin showed a longer infection-free interval than did those treated with clarithromycin. In addition, ciprofloxacin is more effective at producing bacterial eradication than clarithromycin and appears to be favored as first-line therapy for treatment of chronic bronchitis. editor's note: This study, although performed in a select group of high-risk patients, is consistent with a trend in the literature showing that the quinolones may be a good alternative as first-line treatment for acute lower respiratory infections. In the same issue of this journal, a second study shows similar results in the same subtype of patients treated with either ciprofloxacin or cefuroxime axetil, a second-generation cephalosporin. Also of note, several of the newer quinolone antibiotics have better efficacy against.

### Head-to-head oral prophylactic antibiotic therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115mKXrM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; including chronic bronchitis and emphysema) is a chronic respiratory condition characterised by shortness of breath, cough and recurrent exacerbations. Long-term antibiotic use may reduce both bacterial load and inflammation in the airways. Studies have shown a reduction of exacerbations with antibiotics in comparison to placebo in people with COPD, but there are concerns about antibiotic resistance and safety.

Objectives

To compare the safety and efficacy of different classes of antibiotics (continuous, intermittent or pulsed) for prophylaxis of exacerbations in patients with COPD.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register and bibliographies of relevant studies. The latest literature search was conducted on 6 February 2019.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were selected that compared one prophylactic antibiotic with another in patients with COPD.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methods. Two independent review authors selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Discrepancies were resolved by involving a third review author.

Main Results

We included two RCTs, both published in 2015 involving a total of 391 participants with treatment duration of 12 to 13 weeks. One RCT compared a quinolone (moxifloxacin pulsed, for 5 days every 4 weeks), with a tetracycline (doxycycline continuous) or a macrolide (azithromycin intermittent). The second RCT compared a tetracycline (doxycycline continuous) plus a macrolide (roxithromycin continuous), with roxithromycin (continuous) alone. The trials recruited participants with a mean age of 68 years, with moderate-severity COPD. Both trials included participants who had between two and five exacerbations in the previous one to two years. In one trial, 17% of patients had previously been using inhaled corticosteroids. In the other study, all patients were positive for Chlamydophila pneumoniae (C pneumoniae). Overall, we judged the evidence presented to be of very low-certainty, mainly due to imprecision, but we also had concerns about indirectness and methodological quality of the included studies. The primary outcome measures for this review included exacerbations, quality of life, drug resistance and serious adverse events. Macrolide + tetracycline versus macrolide There was no clear difference between treatments in improvement in quality of life as assessed by the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ). The CRQ scale ranges from 0 to 10 and higher scores on the scale indicate better quality of life. CRQ sub-scales for dyspnoea (mean difference (MD) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.84 to 2.00; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence), fatigue (MD 0.02, 95% CI -1.08 to 1.12; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence), emotional function (MD -0.37, 95% CI -1.74 to 1.00; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or mastery (MD -0.79, 95% CI -1.86 to 0.28; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at 12 weeks. For serious adverse events, it was uncertain if there was a difference between combined roxithromycin and doxycycline versus roxithromycin alone at 48 weeks follow-up after active treatment of 12 weeks (odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.93; 198 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were five deaths reported in the combined treatment arm, versus three in the single treatment arm at 48 weeks follow-up after active treatment of 12 weeks (OR 1.63, 95% CI 0.38 to 7.02; 198 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Quinolone versus tetracycline There was no clear difference between moxifloxacin and doxycycline for the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.38; 50 participants, very low-certainty evidence) at 13 weeks. There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported in either treatment groups. We did not identify any evidence for our other primary outcomes. Quinolone versus macrolide There was no clear difference between moxifloxacin and azithromycin for the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.32 to 3.10; 50 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at 13 weeks. There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported in either treatment groups. We did not identify any evidence for our other primary outcomes. Marcolide versus tetracycline There was no clear difference between azithromycin and doxycycline for the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.38; 50 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at 13 weeks. There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported in either treatment groups. We did not identify any evidence for our other primary outcomes. We did not find head-to-head evidence for impact of antibiotics on drug resistance.

Authors' Conclusions

It is not clear from the evidence included in this review whether there is a difference in efficacy or safety between different classes or regimens of prophylactic antibiotic, given for 12 to 13 weeks to people with COPD. Whilst no head-to-head comparisons of antibiotic resistance were identified, concerns about this continue. The sample size in this review is small and both included studies are of short duration. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty in effects observed and the effects of different prophylactic antibiotics requires further research.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^115rzPgH]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotics — In older studies prophylactic, continuous use of antibiotics had no effect on the frequency of exacerbations in COPD and a study of chemoprophylaxis undertaken in winter months over a period of 5 years concluded that there was no benefit, although later studies have shown that regular use of some antibiotics may reduce exacerbation rate. Azithromycin (250 mg/day or 500 mg three times per week) or erythromycin (250 mg two times per day) for one year in patients prone to exacerbations reduced the risk of exacerbations compared to usual care, but azithromycin use was associated with an increased incidence of bacterial resistance, prolongation of QTc interval, and impaired hearing tests. A post-hoc analysis suggests lesser benefit in active smokers, and there are no data showing the efficacy or safety of chronic azithromycin treatment to prevent COPD exacerbations beyond one-year of treatment.

Comparison with other studies

One of the results of this study is that antibiotic treatment was not more effective than placebo in shortening the duration of cough. Systematic analyses of clinical trials also suggest that antibiotics may achieve a reduction, albeit marginal, in the duration of the symptoms. A review of the Cochrane Library showed that patients given antibiotics were less likely to have a cough than were those given placebo (risk ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.49 to 0.85), but these results came from only four clinical trials with 275 participants in total. Another randomised clinical trial, based on data from the genomics to combat resistance against antibiotics in community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections in Europe (GRACE) study, not included in the Cochrane Library review, has recently been published. It constitutes, by far, the largest study carried out, including 16 networks in 12 European countries with 2061 adults aged 18 or older with acute cough of less than one month's duration as the prominent symptom, and once pneumonia was excluded on the basis of clinical grounds. Symptoms rated moderately bad or worse, which was considered as the main outcome, lasted a median of six days in the group allocated to amoxicillin 3 g daily and seven days in the placebo group, with a non-significant difference (hazard ratio 1.06, 95% confidence interval 0.96 to 1.18). Similar to our study design, Stott and colleagues included only patients with acute bronchitis and purulent sputum and did not observe any statistically significant differences in the resolution of cough between the group treated with antibiotics and the group assigned to the control. Current guidelines, endorsed by several national societies, including the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the European Respiratory Society, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America, do not recommend the routine use of antibiotics for uncomplicated acute bronchitis in otherwise normal people. None the less, after their introduction in the 1940s, antibacterial agents were rapidly embraced for treatment of acute bronchitis. At present, more than 60% of patients receive antibiotics for acute bronchitis, and it is currently one of the five most commonly cited infections for excessive antibiotic use in outpatients. Many doctors may not give antibiotics on the first visit, but are more likely to prescribe these antibacterials on subsequent visits, mainly if discoloured sputum is present. In a prospective study of more than 3000 adults with acute cough due a lower respiratory tract infection in 13 European countries, Butler and colleagues observed that patients who presented discoloured sputum were prescribed antibiotics 3.2 times more often than those patients without discoloured sputum. In other studies this odds ratio of antibiotic prescribing in the presence of discoloured sputum ranged from 2.1 to 4.8. This aspect is even more important since more than half of the patients with acute bronchitis report the production of purulent sputum. Peroxidase released by the leucocytes in sputum causes the colour changes; hence, colour alone should not be considered indicative of bacterial infection. Another explanation for the frequent prescription of antibiotics is the lack of distinction between acute and chronic bronchitis. This may explain why clinicians perceive antibiotics to be more beneficial to smokers.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^114hBege]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence for the diagnosis and management of cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients was reviewed as an update to the 2006 "Chronic Cough Due to Acute Bronchitis: American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines".

Methods

Acute bronchitis was defined as an acute lower respiratory tract infection manifested predominantly by cough with or without sputum production, lasting no more than 3 weeks with no clinical or any recent radiographic evidence to suggest an alternative explanation. Two clinical population, intervention, comparison, outcome questions were addressed by systematic review in July 2017: (1) the role of investigations beyond the clinical assessment of patients presenting with suspected acute bronchitis, and (2) the efficacy and safety of prescribing medication for cough in acute bronchitis. An updated search was undertaken in May 2018.

Results

No eligible studies relevant to the first question were identified. For the second question, only one relevant study met eligibility criteria. This study found no difference in number of days with cough between patients treated with an antibiotic or an oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent compared with placebo. Clinical suggestions and research recommendations were made based on the consensus opinion of the CHEST Expert Cough Panel.

Conclusions

The panelists suggested that no routine investigations be ordered and no routine medications be prescribed in immunocompetent adult outpatients first presenting with cough due to suspected acute bronchitis, until such investigations and treatments have been shown to be safe and effective at making cough less severe or resolve sooner. If the cough due to suspected acute bronchitis persists or worsens, a reassessment and consideration of targeted investigations should be considered.

### Chronic cough in children [^115yjhEg]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic cough has been variably defined as a cough lasting longer than 3, 4 or 8 weeks. Many post viral or pertussis like illnesses are associated with prolonged coughing that resolves over time. Management involves first trying to make a diagnosis and identify the presence of any underlying condition. Targeted treatments can then be employed. Trials of treatments are often used to make a diagnosis. Because natural resolution of cough is so common any trial of treatment to confirm a diagnosis should be time limited and the treatment only restarted if the coughing returns. Only a small proportion of children with an isolated non-specific dry cough have asthma and care is needed not to over diagnose asthma. Children with chronic wet cough may have protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) that responds to a full course of antibiotics. Children with PBB failing to respond to treatment or with specific pointers should be investigated for specific causes of suppurative lung disease.

### Short-course fluoroquinolone therapy in exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and COPD [^113cgW3y]. Respiratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are associated with significant healthcare costs and contribute to the progress of the disease. Although a number of factors may trigger these episodes, between 40% and 60% are bacterial in nature. Antimicrobial therapy can be effective in treating exacerbations, leading to improved peak expiratory flow rates, fewer hospitalizations, lower relapse rates, and greater clinical success. Evidence suggests that short-course antimicrobial therapy can be as effective as standard duration therapy (> 7 days) in treating exacerbations. Randomized trials have shown that clinical and bacteriological success rates are comparable with both 5-day and standard antibiotic courses. Furthermore, 5-day fluoroquinolone therapy is associated with faster recovery, fewer relapses, prolonged duration between episodes, and less hospitalization when compared with standard therapy. Both moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin have received FDA-approval for 5-day therapy in AECB.

### Efficacy of anti-inflammatory or antibiotic treatment in patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis and discoloured sputum: randomised placebo controlled trial [^111Ha4ku]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Most of these infections are self limiting, and several studies have suggested that the benefit of antimicrobial treatment is marginal. However, most patients with acute bronchitis receive antibiotics, even in countries with low rates of antibiotic prescribing. This over-prescription constitutes a global problem and is an important factor in increasing the levels of antibiotic resistance. Several approaches for controlling acute cough have included narcotic cough suppressants, expectorants, antihistamines, decongestants, herbal remedies, and β 2 agonists. Even though all these drugs are widely prescribed in patients with acute bronchitis, evidence is scant that their use may be helpful for adults with cough. A Cochrane review of the use of antitussives in patients with acute cough showed no clear benefit for duration of cough. Some studies did report the beneficial effects of expectorants, but these studies were small and had methodological flaws. Another Cochrane review of β 2 agonists showed little evidence for their efficacy in adults with acute cough. These agents may reduce symptoms, including cough, in people with evidence of airflow obstruction. However, their potential benefit in patients without chronic airway disease is not well supported by the data available and must be weighed against the adverse effects associated with their use. There is therefore an urgent need to identify novel treatment measures to deal with this common infectious disease, particularly in light of growing patient expectations and increasing antibiotic resistance. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are widely prescribed in patients with lower respiratory tract infections, mainly for alleviating fever and chest pain as well as other common complaints such as cough. Notwithstanding, the effectiveness of these drugs for reducing the duration and intensity of cough has not been analysed in randomised clinical trials. No sufficiently powered studies have been published comparing the role of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with that of antibiotics. We therefore compared the efficacy of ibuprofen and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid with placebo in a group of otherwise healthy adults with acute bronchitis and discoloured sputum.

### Antibiotics for acute bronchitis [^115ZLpNh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotic treatment of acute bronchitis, which is one of the most common illnesses seen in primary care, is controversial. Most clinicians prescribe antibiotics in spite of expert recommendations against this practice.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of antibiotic treatment for patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis.

Search Strategy

In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2004); MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2004); EMBASE (January 2000 to December 2003); SciSearch from 1989 to 2004; reference lists of articles and the authors' personal collections up to 1996, and also wrote to study authors and drug manufacturers. EMBASE has previously been searched from 1974 to 2000).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo in acute bronchitis or acute productive cough without other obvious cause in patients without underlying pulmonary disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two reviewers extracted data and assessed trial quality. Authors were contacted for missing data.

Main Results

Nine trials involving over 750 patients aged eight to over 65 and including smokers and non-smokers were included in the primary analysis. The quality of the trials was variable. A variety of outcome measures were assessed. Overall, patients receiving antibiotics had better outcomes than did those receiving placebo. At a follow-up visit, they were less likely to have a cough (relative risk (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.85; number-needed-to-treat (NNT) 5; 95% CI 3 to 14), show no improvement on physician assessment (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.87; NNT 14; 95% CI 8 to 50), or have abnormal lung findings (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.89; NNT 11; 95% CI 6 to 50); and had shorter durations of cough (weighted mean difference 0.58 days; 95% CI 0.01 to 1.16 days), productive cough (weighted mean difference (WMD) 0.52 days; 95% CI 0.01 to 1.03 days), and feeling ill (WMD 0.58 days; 95% CI 0.00 to 1.16 days). There were no significant differences regarding the presence of night cough, productive cough, or activity limitations at follow up, or in the mean duration of activity limitations. The benefits of antibiotics were less apparent in a sensitivity analysis that included data from two other studies of patients with upper respiratory tract infections with productive cough. There was a non significant trend towards an increase in adverse effects in the antibiotic group, relative risk (RR) 1.22 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.58).

Reviewers' Conclusions

Overall, antibiotics appear to have a modest beneficial effect in patients who are diagnosed with acute bronchitis. The magnitude of this benefit, however, is similar to that of the detriment from potential adverse effects.

### Building toolkits for COPD exacerbations: lessons from the past and present [^117TrbtP]. Thorax (2019). Medium credibility.

Anthonisen's 1987 RCT demonstrated the superiority of antibiotics over placebo in exacerbations presenting with at least two of the three cardinal symptoms of increased breathlessness, sputum volume and sputum purulence. Importantly, this had been conducted in patients with COPD, rather than just those with chronic bronchitis. However, the placebo response rate was high, likely reflecting viral pathogens as a common cause of exacerbation, and more recent studies have not shown a benefit of antibiotics in other outcomes such as prolonging the time to next exacerbation. Biomarkers such as sputum colour and procalcitoninhave been suggested as strategies to better guide antibiotic therapy, but there remains unmet need to better define which exacerbations do and do not benefit from antibiotic therapy. It is also notable that there are no effective interventions to treat (or prevent) rhinovirus infections, thought to be the single the most common cause of a COPD exacerbation.

Salbutamol has been available since the late 1960s, with ipratropium following in the 1970s. These replaced the non-selective β adrenoreceptor agonist isoprenaline. There are no good data on long-acting bronchodilator drugs at the time of exacerbation.

The 1980s audit referred to abovehighlighted the widespread use of theophyllines (in 48% of patients), and use of respiratory stimulants such as doxapram in the management of hospitalised exacerbations. Use of theophylline has reduced, while respiratory stimulants have been replaced by non-invasive ventilation for the management of hypercapnoeic respiratory failure in the respiratory ward environment, following initial studies in the early 1990s.

Models of care have changed, with the recognition that earlier access to treatment for exacerbations can be associated with faster recovery and reduced risk of hospital admission. However, the risks and benefits of patient-held rescue packs remain to be definitely established.

### Should patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis be treated with antibiotics? Advantages of the use of fluoroquinolones [^115UPJ2N]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

The pathological changes in chronic bronchitis (CB) produce airflow obstruction, reduce the effectiveness of the mucocilliary drainage system and lead to bacterial colonisation of bronchial secretion. The presence of bacteria induces an inflammatory response mediated by leukocytes. There is a direct relationship between the degree of impairment of the mucocilliary drainage system, the density of bacteria in mucus and the number of leukocytes in the sputum. Purulent sputum is a good marker of a high bacterial load. Eventually, if the number of leukocytes is high, their normal activity could decrease the effectiveness of the drainage system, increase the bronchial obstruction and probably damage the lung parenchyma. Whenever the density of bacteria in the bronchial lumen is ≥ 10(6) CFU/mL, there is a high probability that the degree of inflammatory response will lead to a vicious cycle which in turn tends to sustain the process. This situation can arise during the clinical course of any acute exacerbation of CB, independently of its aetiology, provided the episode is sufficiently severe and/or prolonged. Fluoroquinolones of the third and fourth generation are bactericidal against most microorganisms usually related to acute exacerbations of CB. Their diffusion to bronchial mucus is adequate. When used in short (5-day) treatment they reduce the bacterial load in a higher proportion than is achieved by beta-lactam or macrolide antibiotics given orally. Although the clinical cure rate is similar to that obtained with other antibiotics, the time between exacerbations could be increased.

Because the clinical impact of Pa in respiratory cultures from people with CRMS/CFSPID is unclear and Pa may clear spontaneously, the committee recommends selectively offering Pa eradication treatment after a SDM process that weighs potential benefits, risks, and treatment burden.

Anti-inflammatory therapy in stable COPD — phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors and antibiotics: In patients with chronic bronchitis, severe to very severe COPD and a history of exacerbations, roflumilast improves lung function and reduces moderate and severe exacerbations, and ensifentrine improves lung function but an effect on exacerbations has not been evaluated in patients at increased exacerbation risk. Long-term azithromycin and erythromycin therapy reduces exacerbations over one year. Preferentially, but not only in former smokers with exacerbations despite appropriate therapy, azithromycin can be considered. Treatment with azithromycin is associated with an increased incidence of bacterial resistance and hearing test impairments.

### Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and antibiotics: what studies are still needed? [^114k3YFH]. The European Respiratory Journal (2002). Low credibility.

The use of antibiotics in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECBs) remains the subject of controversy despite considerable medical and socioeconomic implications. First, the contribution of bacterial infection to AECBs is difficult to assess in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are chronically colonized with respiratory pathogens. In addition, several studies suggest a major role of viral infections in AECBs. Secondly, it is unlikely that all COPD patients will benefit from antibiotics during AECBs. In particular, the benefit in mild COPD remains uncertain. Unfortunately, the number of studies complying with evidence-based medicine requirements is too small for definite recommendations in AECBs to be drawn up. Considering the impact of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, as well as the community, and the impact of antibiotic therapy on the development of bacterial resistance, there is an urgent need for the design of appropriate multicentric studies to define the usefulness of this type of treatment in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.

### Macrolide antibiotics for bronchiectasis [^116Rv6si]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiectasis is a chronic respiratory disease characterised by abnormal and irreversible dilatation and distortion of the smaller airways. Bacterial colonisation of the damaged airways leads to chronic cough and sputum production, often with breathlessness and further structural damage to the airways. Long-term macrolide antibiotic therapy may suppress bacterial infection and reduce inflammation, leading to fewer exacerbations, fewer symptoms, improved lung function, and improved quality of life. Further evidence is required on the efficacy of macrolides in terms of specific bacterial eradication and the extent of antibiotic resistance.

Objectives

To determine the impact of macrolide antibiotics in the treatment of adults and children with bronchiectasis.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, which contains studies identified through multiple electronic searches and handsearches of other sources. We also searched trial registries and reference lists of primary studies. We conducted all searches on 18 January 2018.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least four weeks' duration that compared macrolide antibiotics with placebo or no intervention for the long-term management of stable bronchiectasis in adults or children with a diagnosis of bronchiectasis by bronchography, plain film chest radiograph, or high-resolution computed tomography. We excluded studies in which participants had received continuous or high-dose antibiotics immediately before enrolment or before a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, sarcoidosis, or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Our primary outcomes were exacerbation, hospitalisation, and serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of 103 records. We independently screened the full text of 40 study reports and included 15 trials from 30 reports. Two review authors independently extracted outcome data and assessed risk of bias for each study. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) and continuous data as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs). We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 14 parallel-group RCTs and one cross-over RCT with interventions lasting from 8 weeks to 24 months. Of 11 adult studies with 690 participants, six used azithromycin, four roxithromycin, and one erythromycin. Four studies with 190 children used either azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, or roxithromycin. We included nine adult studies in our comparison between macrolides and placebo and two in our comparison with no intervention. We included one study with children in our comparison between macrolides and placebo and one in our comparison with no intervention. In adults, macrolides reduced exacerbation frequency to a greater extent than placebo (OR 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.54; 341 participants; three studies; I² = 65%; moderate-quality evidence). This translates to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome of 4 (95% CI 3 to 8). Data show no differences in exacerbation frequency between use of macrolides (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.15; 43 participants; one study; moderate-quality evidence) and no intervention. Macrolides were also associated with a significantly better quality of life compared with placebo (MD -8.90, 95% CI -13.13 to -4.67; 68 participants; one study; moderate-quality evidence). We found no evidence of a reduction in hospitalisations (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.62; 151 participants; two studies; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence), in the number of participants with serious adverse events, including pneumonia, respiratory and non-respiratory infections, haemoptysis, and gastroenteritis (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.23; 326 participants; three studies; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence), or in the number experiencing adverse events (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.35; 435 participants; five studies; I² = 28%) in adults with macrolides compared with placebo. In children, there were no differences in exacerbation frequency (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.41; 89 children; one study; low-quality evidence); hospitalisations (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.11; 89 children; one study; low-quality evidence), serious adverse events, defined within the study as exacerbations of bronchiectasis or investigations related to bronchiectasis (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.05; 89 children; one study; low-quality evidence), or adverse events (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.83; 89 children; one study), in those receiving macrolides compared to placebo. The same study reported an increase in macrolide-resistant bacteria (OR 7.13, 95% CI 2.13 to 23.79; 89 children; one study), an increase in resistance to Streptococcus pneumoniae (OR 13.20, 95% CI 1.61 to 108.19; 89 children; one study), and an increase in resistance to Staphylococcus aureus (OR 4.16, 95% CI 1.06 to 16.32; 89 children; one study) with macrolides compared with placebo. Quality of life was not reported in the studies with children.

Authors' Conclusions

Long-term macrolide therapy may reduce the frequency of exacerbations and improve quality of life, although supporting evidence is derived mainly from studies of azithromycin, rather than other macrolides, and predominantly among adults rather than children. However, macrolides should be used with caution, as limited data indicate an associated increase in microbial resistance. Macrolides are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular death and other serious adverse events in other populations, and available data cannot exclude a similar risk among patients with bronchiectasis.

### Effectiveness of anti-inflammatory treatment versus antibiotic therapy and placebo for patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis with purulent sputum. the BAAP study protocol [^1132kc9R]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Acute bronchitis is a clinical term which implies a self-limiting infection of the large airways and is characterized by clinical manifestations of cough without pneumonia. This process affects approximately 5% of adults annually with a greater incidence in the winter. It accounts for 9.4% of the infections attended by family physicians. Acute bronchitis is mainly a viral infection. The role of bacteria in this infection continues to be controversial since bronchial biopsies have never demonstrated bacterial invasion. In some cases atypical germs may be involved including Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumonia.

It is thought that acute bronchitis reflects an inflammatory response to infections of the epithelium of the bronchi. Microscopic examination demonstrates a thickening of the bronchial and tracheal mucosa corresponding to the inflamed areas. These pathological findings are consistent with publications of proximal lower airway inflammation observed with positron emission tomography. During the first days of infection, the symptoms of upper respiratory infections cannot be clinically distinguished from the symptoms of acute bronchitis. However, in acute bronchitis cough lasts more than five days and during this prolonged period of symptoms, the results of functional respiratory tests are usually abnormal. Forty per cent of the patients present significant reductions in forced espiratory volume in the first second (FEV 1) with values of less than 80% over the theoretical value, or bronchial hyper-reactivity with improvement during the following 5–6 weeks. Cough may persist from 10 to 20 days in acute bronchitis, but it may sometimes last up to 4 weeks or more. In a recent study on the efficacy of the acellular pertussis vaccine including 2,781 healthy adults, the mean duration of cough in acute bronchitis by all causes was 18 days, with a median of 24 days. Moreover, almost half of the patients with acute bronchitis report the production of purulent expectoration. Peroxidase released by the leukocytes in sputum causes the colour changes; hence, colour alone should not be considered indicative of bacterial infection. Indeed, in healthy adults, the positive predictive value of purulent sputum for the presence of alveolar disease is low, being of approximately 10%.

Bronchitis has shown to reduce the quality of life of patients. One study on the quality of life of patients with infections of the upper respiratory tract, some of which were labelled acute bronchitis, showed a reduction in seven subscales of the 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey, including vital and social function, although this decrease was transitory. Furthermore, up to twenty per cent of the patients return to their physician within the first month for the persistence of symptoms.
