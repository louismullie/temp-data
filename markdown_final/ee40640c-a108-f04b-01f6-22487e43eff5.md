## Question

Which medications cause medication overuse headache?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medications cause medication overuse headache. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal diagnostic criteria and thresholds that define medication overuse. Then, I should verify which drug classes are implicated and how their risk differs. Next, I will examine exceptions and controversies, including whether any acute treatments are safe from MOH risk. After that, I should consider special populations and comorbidities that modify risk. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized list of medications to avoid or limit, and confirm the strength of evidence supporting causality versus association.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework so I don't jump to conclusions. Medication overuse headache is defined in ICHD-3 as headache occurring on 15 or more days per month in a person with a pre-existing primary headache disorder, developing as a consequence of regular overuse of acute headache medications for more than 3 months, with medication-specific thresholds of 10 or more days per month for triptans, opioids, ergotamine, and combination analgesics, and 15 or more days per month for simple analgesics like NSAIDs and acetaminophen [^76c936a3] [^e43628c3] [^10b01b88].

> Wait, let me verify the core principle about causality. Virtually all acute headache medications can cause MOH in susceptible patients with a pre-existing headache disorder, and the risk is driven more by frequency of use than by total dose, which is why the thresholds are framed in days per month rather than milligrams or tablets [^76c936a3] [^e43628c3] [^6433a2e7]. I should also note that MOH is a secondary headache disorder that typically resolves or improves after withdrawal of the overused medication, reinforcing a causal relationship in many cases, though confounding by indication remains a methodological limitation in some studies [^76c936a3] [^51ac1b26].

> Next, I should review which medication classes carry the highest risk and why. Triptans, opioids, ergotamine, and combination analgesics are implicated at lower monthly frequency thresholds and are associated with faster transformation to chronic headache and higher relapse rates after withdrawal, whereas simple analgesics like NSAIDs and acetaminophen require more frequent use to trigger MOH but still carry meaningful risk [^e43628c3] [^d5cd09aa] [^76043cc8]. Hold on, I should verify the comparative risk signal: multiple sources indicate triptans and opioids have a stronger propensity for MOH than simple analgesics, and opioid overuse is particularly problematic for relapse and poor outcomes [^e43628c3] [^76043cc8] [^732190e0].

> I will now examine specific high-risk agents I need to flag. Butalbital-containing compounds are repeatedly singled out as having a low threshold for harm and should generally be avoided for headache treatment; opioids are consistently linked to progression to chronic migraine and poor withdrawal outcomes; and combination analgesics that include caffeine or codeine also carry elevated MOH risk at 10 or more days per month [^9f13ad38] [^d5cd09aa] [^e43628c3]. Let me double-check the butalbital point: yes, professional societies advise against butalbital for headache given MOH risk and limited benefit, which aligns with guideline positions [^9f13ad38].

> But wait, what about newer acute migraine therapies like gepants and ditans; do they cause MOH too. Early preclinical data suggest gepants may not induce latent sensitization or MOH-like phenomena, whereas the ditan lasmiditan has shown signals of hyperalgesia in animal models, so I should be cautious and note that human data are still limited and evolving [^ea922ee5] [^563033b8] [^ffe60450]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: until robust clinical data accrue, I should advise limiting frequent use of any acute medication, including gepants, and monitor for escalating headache frequency patterns [^notfound].

> Next, I should review special populations and modifiers of risk. Children and adolescents with migraine should be counseled to limit ibuprofen or acetaminophen to no more than 14 days per month and triptans to no more than 9 days per month to avoid MOH, and preventive strategies should be considered when frequency rises [^3c9ba8e9]. I need to ensure I also mention that patients with anxiety, depression, obesity, smoking, and high baseline headache frequency are at increased risk of MOH and may require closer monitoring and earlier preventive therapy [^e43628c3] [^81f9f35b].

> Let me synthesize a practical, prioritized list of medications to avoid or strictly limit. Highest risk and generally to be avoided: butalbital-containing compounds; opioids; combination analgesics with caffeine or codeine; frequent ergotamine. Moderate risk requiring strict day-count limits: triptans limited to fewer than 10 days per month. Lower but nontrivial risk with higher day thresholds: simple NSAIDs and acetaminophen, limited to fewer than 15 days per month. And emerging therapies like gepants should be used judiciously pending more definitive MOH data, with vigilance for frequency escalation [^e43628c3] [^10b01b88] [^ea922ee5]. I should confirm that these thresholds align with ICHD-3 and contemporary guidelines, which they do [^76c936a3] [^10b01b88].

> Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence and acknowledge controversies. While the association between frequent acute medication use and chronic headache is strong and supported by multiple high-quality reviews and guidelines, some authors argue that medication overuse may be a marker of poorly controlled headache rather than a sole cause, and that withdrawal benefits may be overestimated in uncontrolled studies; nonetheless, randomized and pragmatic trials show that withdrawal plus preventive strategies improve outcomes, and guideline bodies continue to recommend addressing overuse as part of standard care [^51ac1b26] [^d085a54c] [^11746fda]. I need to ensure balanced counseling that emphasizes both the risks of overuse and the importance of optimizing preventive therapy and behavioral strategies [^e43628c3].

> Finally, I should confirm the clinical implications and next steps. In patients with 15 or more headache days per month, I should screen meticulously for medication overuse, educate on day-count limits, and implement a plan to reduce or withdraw the overused agent, often alongside initiation or optimization of preventive therapy, with follow-up to prevent relapse; this approach is supported by ICHD-3, European Academy of Neurology guidelines, and randomized data comparing withdrawal strategies [^76c936a3] [^11746fda] [^d085a54c]. If I encounter opioids or butalbital, I should plan a slow taper and consider inpatient strategies when indicated, given withdrawal risks and relapse potential [^f04ec02e] [^3b79427f].

Medication overuse headache (MOH) is caused by **regular overuse of acute headache medications** in patients with a pre-existing primary headache disorder [^76c936a3]. The main culprits are **triptans, opioids, barbiturates, ergotamines, and combination analgesics** (especially those with caffeine or codeine) when used on ≥ 10 days/month for > 3 months [^e43628c3] [^2c010aa0]. Simple analgesics (NSAIDs, acetaminophen) can also cause MOH when used on ≥ 15 days/month for > 3 months [^e43628c3] [^2c010aa0]. MOH is less likely with gepants and ditans, but evidence is limited; **limit acute medication use to ≤ 2–3 days/week** to prevent MOH [^ea922ee5] [^563033b8] [^e1d34a7c].

## Medications implicated in MOH

MOH is **linked to overuse of acute headache medications**, with risk varying by drug class and frequency of use [^e43628c3]:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Risk threshold** |
|-|-|-|
| Triptans | - Sumatriptan <br/> - Rizatriptan <br/> - Eletriptan | ≥ 10 days/month for > 3 months [^e43628c3] [^2c010aa0] |
| Opioids | - Codeine <br/> - Morphine <br/> - Oxycodone | ≥ 10 days/month for > 3 months [^e43628c3] [^2c010aa0] |
| Barbiturates | - Butalbital (often with caffeine and acetaminophen) | ≥ 10 days/month for > 3 months [^e43628c3] [^2c010aa0] |
| Ergotamines | - Ergotamine tartrate | ≥ 10 days/month for > 3 months [^e43628c3] [^2c010aa0] |
| Combination analgesics | - Acetaminophen/codeine <br/> - Aspirin/acetaminophen/caffeine | ≥ 10 days/month for > 3 months [^e43628c3] [^2c010aa0] |
| Simple analgesics | - NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen) <br/> - Acetaminophen | ≥ 15 days/month for > 3 months [^e43628c3] [^2c010aa0] |

## Mechanisms underlying MOH

MOH arises from **complex neurobiological changes** driven by frequent acute medication use:

- **Central sensitization**: Repeated medication exposure increases neuronal excitability, lowering pain thresholds and amplifying headache frequency and intensity [^76c936a3] [^65ccabab].
- **Altered descending pain modulation**: Chronic medication use disrupts endogenous pain control, promoting headache chronification [^76c936a3] [^bf86c658].
- **Neurotransmitter dysregulation**: Frequent triptan or opioid use alters serotonin, dopamine, and endogenous opioid systems, contributing to dependence and withdrawal phenomena [^bf86c658] [^732190e0].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting medication-specific risks

- **Triptans**: Strongly associated with MOH; overuse transforms episodic migraine into chronic migraine, with faster chronification than simple analgesics [^e43628c3] [^d1f98820].
- **Opioids and barbiturates**: High risk of MOH, dependence, and withdrawal; butalbital-containing compounds are particularly problematic [^9f13ad38] [^d5cd09aa].
- **Combination analgesics**: Caffeine-containing combinations increase MOH risk and worsen withdrawal symptoms [^e43628c3] [^6823af80].
- **Simple analgesics**: Lower MOH risk than triptans or opioids but still significant with frequent use; NSAIDs may be protective at low frequencies but risky with chronic use [^d5cd09aa] [^e43628c3].

---

## Medications with lower or uncertain MOH risk

- **Gepants (CGRP receptor antagonists)**: Early evidence suggests low MOH risk; ubrogepant did not induce latent sensitization in preclinical models [^ea922ee5] [^563033b8].
- **Ditans (5-HT1F agonists)**: Preclinical data suggest differential risk; lasmiditan showed hyperalgesia in animal models, but human data are limited [^563033b8] [^ffe60450].
- **Preventive medications**: Beta-blockers, topiramate, and anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies are not associated with MOH and are used to treat it [^5bf55860] [^7a3c078f].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **prevention through limiting acute medication use**:

- **Limit acute medications**: ≤ 2–3 days/week (≤ 10 days/month for triptans, opioids, barbiturates, ergotamines; ≤ 15 days/month for simple analgesics) [^e43628c3] [^2c010aa0].
- **Avoid high-risk medications**: Minimize or avoid opioids, barbiturates, and combination analgesics, especially with caffeine or codeine [^9f13ad38] [^81f9f35b].
- **Use preventives**: Initiate preventive therapy for frequent headaches to reduce acute medication needs [^65ccabab] [^5bf55860].
- **Educate patients**: Counsel on MOH risk and monitor medication use with diaries [^91e5b9b0] [^65ccabab].

---

## Conclusion

MOH is a preventable iatrogenic disorder driven by **regular overuse of acute headache medications**, especially triptans, opioids, barbiturates, ergotamines, and combination analgesics. Simple analgesics also cause MOH when used frequently. Emerging therapies like gepants may carry lower risk, but evidence remains limited. Prevention hinges on **limiting acute medication use** and using preventive strategies for patients with frequent headaches [^76c936a3] [^e43628c3].

### Medication overuse headache [^76c936a3]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2023). High credibility.

Medication overuse headache (MOH) is a secondary headache disorder attributed to overuse of acute headache medications by a person with an underlying headache disorder, usually migraine or tension-type headache. MOH is common among individuals with 15 or more headache days per month. Although MOH is associated with substantial disability and reductions in quality of life, this condition is often under-recognized. As MOH is both preventable and treatable, it warrants greater attention and awareness. The diagnosis of MOH is based on the history and an unremarkable neurological examination, and is made according to the diagnostic criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders third edition (ICHD-3). Pathophysiological mechanisms of MOH include altered descending pain modulation, central sensitization and biobehavioural factors. Treatment of MOH includes the use of headache preventive therapies, but essential to success is eliminating the cause, by reducing the frequency of use of acute headache medication, and perhaps withdrawing the overused medication altogether. Appropriate treatment is usually highly effective, leading to reduced headache burden and acute medication consumption.

### Medication-overuse headache: where are we now? [^2f25d5b1]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Many important studies on medication-overuse headache have been published in the last year. Some of them investigated the pathophysiology of headache chronicity, others focused on evaluation of risk factors. The International Headache Society revised the classification criteria. We provide a summary of the new findings and concepts.

Recent Findings

Medication-overuse headache was previously defined by the International Headache Society as a chronic headache which occurs following overuse of headache drugs and improves after withdrawal. Hence, the improvement of headache after withdrawal was mandatory for diagnosis. The new appendix criteria appeared last year and established a broader concept of medication-overuse headache no longer requiring improvement after discontinuation of medication overuse. Several large population-based longitudinal studies clearly demonstrated that overuse of any kind of acute headache medication is the main risk factor leading to development of chronic headache. Imaging studies provided new important insights into the pathophysiology of headache chronicity. New treatment strategies have been suggested.

Summary

Recent data provide better insight into pathophysiology of medication-overuse headache. Epidemiological studies clearly demonstrate the necessity of establishing a predictive model for early recognition of patients at high risk to intervene early and avoid development of chronic headache.

### Medication-overuse headache [^225c19d4]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Medication-overuse headache is defined as headache occurring on more than 15days in a month in people with pre-existing primary headache, and developing as a consequence of regular overuse of acute headache treatments. Medication-overuse headache is common in general neurology clinics and can be difficult to manage. Most patients have a background of migraine, which has slowly transformed over months and years from the episodic to chronic form; with this comes an increased use of acute migraine treatment. This paper identifies who is at risk of developing medication-overuse headache, and reviews preventive measures and current treatment strategies.

### Medication overuse headache: an entrenched idea in need of scrutiny [^51ac1b26]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

It is a widely accepted idea that medications taken to relieve acute headache pain can paradoxically worsen headache if used too often. This type of secondary headache is referred to as medication overuse headache (MOH); previously used terms include rebound headache and drug-induced headache. In the absence of consensus about the duration of use, amount, and type of medication needed to cause MOH, the default position is conservative. A common recommendation is to limit treatment to no more than 10 or 15 days per month (depending on medication type) to prevent headache frequency progression. Medication withdrawal is often recommended as a first step in treatment of patients with very frequent headaches. Existing evidence, however, does not provide a strong basis for such causal claims about the relationship between medication use and frequent headache. Observational studies linking treatment patterns with headache frequency are by their nature confounded by indication. Medication withdrawal studies have mostly been uncontrolled and often have high dropout rates. Evaluation of this evidence suggests that only a minority of patients required to limit the use of symptomatic medication may benefit from treatment limitation. Similarly, only a minority of patients deemed to be overusing medications may benefit from withdrawal. These findings raise serious questions about the value of withholding or withdrawing symptom-relieving medications from people with frequent headaches solely to prevent or treat MOH. The benefits of doing so are smaller, and the harms larger, than currently recognized. The concept of MOH should be viewed with more skepticism. Until the evidence is better, we should avoid dogmatism about the use of symptomatic medication. Frequent use of symptom-relieving headache medications should be viewed more neutrally, as an indicator of poorly controlled headaches, and not invariably a cause.

### Definitions of medication-overuse headache in population-based studies and their implications on prevalence estimates: a systematic review [^ec230382]. Cephalalgia (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Case definitions of medication-overuse headache (MOH) in population-based research have changed over time. This study aims to review MOH prevalence reports with respect to these changes, and to propose a practical case definition for future studies based on the ICHD-3 beta.

Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted to identify MOH prevalence studies. Findings were summarized according to diagnostic criteria.

Results

Twenty-seven studies were included. The commonly used case definition for MOH was headache ≥15 days/month with concurrent medication overuse ≥3 months. There were varying definitions for what was considered as overuse. Studies that all used ICHD-2 criteria showed a wide range of prevalence among adults: 0.5%-7.2%.

Conclusions

There are limits to comparing prevalence of MOH across studies and over time. The wide range of reported prevalence might not only be due to changing criteria, but also the diversity of countries now publishing data. The criterion "headache occurring on ≥15 days per month" with concurrent medication overuse can be applied in population-based studies. However, the new requirement that a respondent must have "a preexisting headache disorder" has not been previously validated. Exclusion of other headache diagnoses by expert evaluation and ancillary examinations is not feasible in large population-based studies.

### Medication-overuse headache: a worldwide problem [^c20838b6]. The Lancet: Neurology (2004). Medium credibility.

Medication overuse and subsequent medication-overuse headache (MOH) is a growing problem worldwide. Epidemiological data suggest that up to 4% of the population overuse analgesics and other drugs for the treatment of pain conditions such as migraine and that about 1% of the general population in Europe, North America, and Asia have MOH. Recent clinical studies gave further insights in clinical and pharmacological features, such as critical monthly doses and frequencies. These features seem to vary significantly and depend on the primary headache disorder and the type of drug that is overused. Along with these findings the new international classification of headache disorders has now incorporated additional criteria and new headache entities that will facilitate the diagnosis of MOH. Withdrawal therapy is the only treatment for this disorder and clear restriction of monthly doses is the central requirement for successful prevention.

### Medication overuse headache [^1cb4d126]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The current literature on medication overuse headache will be reviewed with regard to clinical presentation, pathophysiology, therapy and prognosis in the light of the new headache classification.

Recent Findings

Medication overuse headache is a widely unrecognized medical condition, which according to recent epidemiological studies has evolved to the third most frequent form of headache after tension-type headache and migraine. The first classification of headache disorders from 1988 defined medication overuse headache (formerly called 'drug-induced headache') on the bases of drugs that were available in the 1980s. For the most important anti-headache drugs, including triptans, new data on specific clinical features and more important mean critical monthly dosages and mean critical monthly intake frequencies are now available. Furthermore, recent prospectively conducted studies have revealed rates and predictors of relapse after successful withdrawal.

Summary

The newly available data on medication overuse headache may provide the basis for future consensus guidelines for the management of this condition.

### Medication-overuse headache [^f21c333a]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Medication-overuse headache (MOH) is a well described clinical entity. There is a growing body of knowledge on the epidemiology of MOH, risk factors, and treatment strategies.

Recent Findings

The International Headache Society updated the classification criteria for MOH. Population-based studies provided an insight into the prevalence and peculiarities of MOH patients in eastern Europe and Asia. Large-scaled population-based longitudinal studies made it possible to analyze risk factors leading to the development of MOH. Imaging studies helped to better understand the pathophysiology of headache chronicity. New treatment strategies have been suggested.

Summary

MOH is a common headache disorder and a serious public health problem all over the world. Although the treatment regimen for MOH patients is straightforward and the outcomes are favorable, it is time now to move forward and establish a predictive model for early recognition of patients at high risk, to intervene early and avoid development of chronic headache.

### Pathophysiology, prevention, and treatment of medication overuse headache [^e76af10c]. The Lancet: Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Regular or frequent use of analgesics and acute antimigraine drugs can increase the frequency of headache, and induce the transition from episodic to chronic headache or medication overuse headache. The 1-year prevalence of this condition in the general population is between 1% and 2%. Medication overuse headache is more common in women and in people with comorbid depression, anxiety, and other chronic pain conditions. Treatment of medication overuse headache has three components. First, patients need education and counselling to reduce the intake of medication for acute headache attacks. Second, some patients benefit from drug withdrawal (discontinuation of the overused medication). Finally, preventive drug therapy and non-medical prevention might be necessary in patients at onset of treatment or in patients who do not respond to the first two steps. The optimal therapeutic approach requires validation in controlled trials.

### Medication-overuse headache: a review [^f4a596f2]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Medication-overuse headache (MOH) is a worldwide health problem with a prevalence of 1%-2%. It is a severe form of headache where the patients often have a long history of headache and of unsuccessful treatments. MOH is characterized by chronic headache and overuse of different headache medications. Through the years, withdrawal of the overused medication has been recognized as the treatment of choice. However, currently, there is no clear consensus regarding the optimal strategy for management of MOH. Treatment approaches are based on expert opinion rather than scientific evidence. This review focuses on aspects of epidemiology, diagnosis, pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of MOH. We suggest that information and education about the risk of MOH is important since the condition is preventable. Most patients experience reduction of headache days and intensity after successful treatment. The first step in the treatment of MOH should be carried out in primary care and focus primarily on withdrawal, leaving prophylactic medication to those who do not manage primary detoxification. For most patients, a general practitioner can perform the follow-up after detoxification. More complicated cases should be referred to neurologists and headache clinics. Patients suffering with MOH have much to gain by an earlier treatment-focused approach, since the condition is both preventable and treatable.

### Medication overuse headache [^34a12e91]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Medication overuse headache (MOH)is a disabling problem worldwide with areas of controversy regarding its cause. This article reviews the recent ideas regarding the development of this disorder and its effective management.

Recent Findings

It has been proposed that all acute migraine medications can lead to MOH, with differences in the propensity of different agents to cause the problem. Early data suggests that gepants, which are small-molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists used for the acute treatment of migraine, may be an exception. Recent studies show that practitioners and the general public are still largely unaware of the problem of medication overuse and its damaging effects.

Summary

MOH is an accepted concept of an increase in headaches driven by the frequent administration of acute antimigraine drugs. The impressions of providers, and studies documenting the concept may be flawed. Although it is likely that MOH does occur, and restricting the amount of acute medications is necessary to prevent it, it is also possible that increasing amounts of acute medications are simply a reflection of poorly controlled headaches, rather than a cause. Objective markers need to be developed to identify those who have MOH, which does not include all with chronic migraine, and to use these markers in diagnosis and management, particularly in those patients where the frequent acute drugs might only be a reflection of frequent headaches, rather than a cause.

### Medication-overuse headache: causes, consequences and management [^e43628c3]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Medication-overuse headache (MOH) has a prevalence of approximately 1% and is among the top 20 causes of disability worldwide, leading to considerable medical, social, and economic costs. It is defined in the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) as a headache occurring on at least 15 days per month in someone with a pre-existing headache disorder and developing as a result of regular overuse of one or more acute/symptomatic headache treatments for at least 3 months. Overuse is defined as at least 10 days per month for triptans, opioids and ergotamine, or at least 15 days per month for paracetamol, aspirin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The frequency of acute medication use seems more important in the development of MOH than the cumulative dosage taken. MOH most often develops in those with underlying migraine or tension-type headache, but it can occur with other primary headache disorders such as cluster headache or new daily persistent headache. The quality of the headache is often similar to that of the underlying headache disorder which can make diagnosis of MOH difficult unless symptomatic improvement after acute drug withdrawal is observed. Women are four times as likely to develop MOH as men with peak prevalence at age 40–50. Other risk factors associated with MOH include obesity, anxiety or depression, low educational level, smoking, chronic musculoskeletal or gastrointestinal diseases, and physical inactivity. Treatment strategies include drug withdrawal, with or without preventive medication cover, and patient education.

This month’s journal club examines three papers reporting on the causes, consequences and treatments of MOH. The first is a systematic review and critical appraisal of gene polymorphism association studies, assessing the evidence for genetic predisposition to MOH. The second examines association between MOH and suicidal ideation and the third reports an open-label, randomized clinical trial of three treatment strategies.

### Medication-overuse headache: a review [^d3e27f65]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Medication-overuse headache (MOH) is a worldwide health problem with a prevalence of 1%–2%. It is a severe form of headache where the patients often have a long history of headache and of unsuccessful treatments. MOH is characterized by chronic headache and overuse of different headache medications. Through the years, withdrawal of the overused medication has been recognized as the treatment of choice. However, currently, there is no clear consensus regarding the optimal strategy for management of MOH. Treatment approaches are based on expert opinion rather than scientific evidence. This review focuses on aspects of epidemiology, diagnosis, pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of MOH. We suggest that information and education about the risk of MOH is important since the condition is preventable. Most patients experience reduction of headache days and intensity after successful treatment. The first step in the treatment of MOH should be carried out in primary care and focus primarily on withdrawal, leaving prophylactic medication to those who do not manage primary detoxification. For most patients, a general practitioner can perform the follow-up after detoxification. More complicated cases should be referred to neurologists and headache clinics. Patients suffering with MOH have much to gain by an earlier treatment-focused approach, since the condition is both preventable and treatable.

### Medication-overuse headache: risk factors, pathophysiology and management [^76043cc8]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Medication-overuse headache (MOH) is defined by the International Classification of Headache Disorders as a headache in patients with a pre-existing primary headache disorder that occurs on ≥15 days per month for >3 months, and is caused by overuse of medication intended for acute or symptomatic headache treatment. The prevalence of MOH in the general population is around 1%, but the condition is much more common in people with headache, in particular chronic migraine. The phenotype of the headache in MOH depends on the initial primary headache and the type of overused acute medication. In this Review, we will discuss the epidemiology, risk factors, pathophysiology, prevention and treatment of MOH. Treatment of MOH is performed in three steps: educating patients about the relationship between frequent intake of acute headache medication and MOH with the aim to reduce intake of acute medication; initiation of migraine prevention (such as topiramate or onabotulinumtoxin A in migraine) in patients who fail step 1; detoxification on an outpatient basis or in a day hospital or inpatient setting, depending on severity and comorbidities. The success rate of treatment is around 50-70%, although patients whose MOH is associated with opioid overuse have higher relapse rates. In all patients with MOH, relapse rates can be reduced by patient education and care in the follow-up period.

### European Academy of Neurology guideline on the management of medication-overuse headache [^11746fda]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for medication overuse headache, more specifically with respect to discontinuation of overused medication, advice, EAN 2020 guidelines recommend to recognize that withdrawal from overused acute medications is effective in ceasing overuse and restoring an episodic pattern of headache for prolonged periods in most patients, and withdrawal is associated with documented improvements in healthcare costs, QoL, coexisting depression, and anxiety.

### Exploring medication-overuse and medication-overuse headache in cluster headache [^25649a15]. Cephalalgia (2025). Medium credibility.

BackgroundIt is not well established to what extent medication-overuse occurs in cluster headache (CH), if medication-overuse headache exists in CH and whether the existing criteria for medication-overuse headache are a suitable diagnostic tool in CH. We aimed to examine the prevalence of medication-overuse and probable medication-overuse headache in a well characterized cohort of people with CH and describe associated factors and clinical impact.MethodsParticipants diagnosed with CH according to International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3) beta and ICHD-3 were invited to participate in a semi-structured interview investigating medication-overuse and probable medication-overuse headache according to ICHD-3. To add nuance to the debate, we also included a more conservative definition, applying the ICHD-3 criteria for the medication-overuse but specified the headache phenotype to a daily bilateral headache.ResultsIn total, 21% of 433 participants with CH had a medication-overuse according to ICHD-3. Of these, 16% fulfilled the criteria for probable medication-overuse headache according to the ICHD-3, and 12% if excluding isolated triptan overuse. The overused analgesics constituted simple analgesics (52.2%), triptans (37.3%), opioids (29.9%) and combination therapies (20.9%). Associated factors were having chronic CH (odds ratio = 11.4, p <0.00001) and comorbid migraine (odds ratio = 2.35, p <0.05). Participants with probable medication-overuse headache had longer attack duration (30.0 vs. 20.0minutes, p <0.01) and less effect of acute and preventive medication than those without (20.0 vs. 55.9%, p <0.05 and 13.3 vs. 37.3%, p <0.01, respectively). If applying the conservative definition with a daily bilateral headache along with a medication-overuse, the prevalence was reduced to 4%.ConclusionsProbable medication-overuse headache was present in every sixth participant with CH in this large cross-sectional cohort study. Interestingly, only a smaller proportion was the result of isolated triptan overuse. In CH, where patients often suffer from daily attacks and may suffer from a daily bilateral inter-ictal pain, our very conservative definition noted a prevalence of 4%. While the existing ICHD-3 criteria for medication-overuse headache may not be directly applicable in CH, the applicability and validity of the very conservative definition warrant further investigation. Still, as in other cross-sectional populations with medication-overuse, we noted an association that acute and preventive treatments were less effective in participants with probable medication-overuse headache compared to those without. Altogether, future prospective studies are necessary to establish the exact extent and presentation of medication-overuse headache in CH and determine whether it is an aggravating factor for the disease. We do not recommend discontinuing triptans if suspecting MOH due to ethical concerns.

### Management of medication overuse headache [^52c9f1a3]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2010). Low credibility.

Headache is one of the most frequent reasons for medical consultation in both general practice and specialist neurology clinics.1 Prescribed and over-the-counter medications are taken to alleviate headaches, but may be used incorrectly.2 In particular, use of some drugs both frequently and regularly can have a paradoxical effect, causing headaches rather than relieving them, and leading to medication overuse headache (MOH).3 Such overuse is a common cause of frequent headache. Here we review MOH and its management.

### Frequent headaches: evaluation and management [^65ccabab]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Most frequent headaches are typically migraine or tension-type headaches and are often exacerbated by medication overuse. Repeated headaches can induce central sensitization and transformation to chronic headaches that are intractable, are difficult to treat, and cause significant morbidity and costs. A complete history is essential to identify the most likely headache type, indications of serious secondary headaches, and significant comorbidities. A headache diary can document headache frequency, symptoms, initiating and exacerbating conditions, and treatment response over time. Neurologic assessment and physical examination focused on the head and neck are indicated in all patients. Although rare, serious underlying conditions must be excluded by the patient history, screening tools such as SNNOOP10, neurologic and physical examinations, and targeted imaging and other assessments. Medication overuse headache should be suspected in patients with frequent headaches. Medication history should include nonprescription analgesics and substances, including opiates, that may be obtained from others. Patients who overuse opiates, barbiturates, or benzodiazepines require slow tapering and possibly inpatient treatment to prevent acute withdrawal. Patients who overuse other agents can usually withdraw more quickly. Evidence is mixed on the role of medications such as topiramate for patients with medication overuse headache. For the underlying headache, an individualized evidence-based management plan incorporating pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies is necessary. Patients with frequent migraine, tension-type, and cluster headaches should be offered prophylactic therapy. A complete management plan includes addressing risk factors, headache triggers, and common comorbid conditions such as depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and chronic musculoskeletal pain syndromes that can impair treatment effectiveness. Regular scheduled follow-up is important to monitor progress.

Pathogenesis

Approximately half of those who experience headache on ≥15 days per month have MOH.Most headache experts regard the association between overuse of acute medication and development of MOH as causal.Improvement in two thirds to three quarters of patients after successful medication withdrawal supports its causative role in generating or maintaining chronic headache. However, it is still a matter of debate whether the overuse is a consequence or cause of chronic headache.Further, not all headache patients with medication-overuse develop MOH, and the mechanism behind how chronic exposure to abortive medication leads to MOH remains unclear.

Virtually all acute headache medication may cause MOH. It has been suggested that the mean critical duration of overuse is shortest for triptans (1.7 years), longer for ergotamine (2.7 years), and longest for simple analgesics (4.8 years). The mean critical monthly intake frequency in the same study was lowest for triptans, higher for ergotamine, and highest for analgesics.

A pre-existing headache disorder seems to be required to develop MOH.Patients with migraine or tension-type headache have a higher potential for developing MOH than other primary headaches.However, patients with cluster headaches may also develop MOH, but most of these patients have co-occurrence of migraine or a positive family history of migraine.MOH does not develop in persons without a history of headache when medication is taken regularly for other conditions, such as arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease.Thus, a connection between headache-specific pain pathways and the effects of headache medication seems to be a central factor in generating a more chronic pain. However, since the different primary headaches have different underlying pathophysiology, and the different medications have different pharmacological actions, it is unlikely that MOH is caused by the specific action of any single agent. Mechanisms may differ from one class of overused drug to another, and different possible pathogenetic mechanisms have been suggested. It is of course possible that there is a common as yet unknown mechanism by which pharmacologically different medications lead to MOH independently of underlying primary headache. However, at present, it is possible only to describe mechanisms (mostly from preclinical studies) that appear to be associated with or may predispose people to develop MOH.

Medication-overuse headache

Medication-overuse headache is headache occurring on 15 or more days per month, developing as a consequence of regular overuse of acute or symptomatic headache medication (simple analgesics and NSAIDs on 15 days or more; or triptans, opioids and combination analgesics on 10 days or more days per month) for over 3 months. It occurs in patients with pre-existing primary headache who, in association with regular acute medication use, develop a new type of headache or a marked worsening of their pre-existing headache. Phenotypically, the headaches usually resemble migraine or tension-type headache.

Medication-overuse headache is a common, frequently debilitating, sequel to pre-existing headache. Headaches develop on withdrawal of analgesics, triggering more analgesic usage, leading to a self-perpetuating cycle. The problem is more severe with overuse of triptans and opiates than, for example, NSAIDs and simple analgesics, but can develop following overuse of any analgesic. A detailed look at a patient's list of over-the-counter medication can be quite revealing (table 5).

Table 5 
Common over-the-counter migraine acute treatments

Unfortunately, the process of withdrawing from analgesics is often challenging. Patients may develop not only a withdrawal or rebound headache but also nausea and other gastrointestinal disturbances (about a week for triptan withdrawal and up to 4 weeks for opiates and codeine-based medication). Before withdrawal, it is important that the patient is fully aware of the likely initial worsening of symptoms. The overused abortives should ideally be stopped for at least 1 month. It can be encouraging to the patient to explain the evidence that medication withdrawal alone can improve the headaches (see figure 3).

Figure 3 
Headache frequency after medication withdrawal in medication-overuse headache. This Danish study of people with probable medication-overuse headache (175 patients) compared the frequency of headache before and after complete drug withdrawal and then after drug management in the clinic. Between the initial visit (before withdrawal) and discharge from clinic post-withdrawal, there was a mean reduction in headache frequency across the cohort of 46% (p<0.0001). The values represent mean reduction in headache days per month with median and range in brackets. *p<0.0001 (adapted from Zeeburg et al).

Conclusion

MOH is common and debilitating, has a widely variable phenotype, usually arises as a result of inadequate long-term treatment of an underlying headache disorder and can be associated with an increased suicide risk. The aetiology of this condition remains unclear, but any candidate gene associations are likely to require confirmation in an unbiased genome-wide association study. Drug withdrawal strategies are effective but need to be coupled with patient education on the risks of analgesic overuse to prevent relapse.

### Medication-overuse headache: a review [^e4fadb44]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Headache disorders are a major public health concern given their high prevalence and the large amount of associated disability and financial costs to both the individual and society.–According to the Global Burden of Disease Study from 2010, headache is among the top ten causes of disability measured as years of life lost to disability (YLDs).

Headache usually occurs episodically, but 2%–5% of the general population have headache on ≥15 days per month, defined as chronic headache.–Patients with chronic headache represent a large population in primary care and neurology settings.–Headache is usually treated with analgesics, and is probably the most common reason for use of analgesics in the general population.–Studies have identified 20%–40% of the general population to use analgesics over the previous 14 days.In Denmark, sales figures of over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics were extrapolated to correspond to almost 8% of the general population taking the highest recommended daily dose every day for a whole year.

Too much use of symptomatic medication for headaches may lead to medication-overuse headache (MOH).This is a condition characterized by chronic headache and overuse of different acute headache medications. Withdrawal headache after overuse of ergotamine was described in the early 1950s, and since the 1980s, studies have shown that frequent intake of symptomatic headache medication may transform episodic headache to chronic headache.–

The treatment of MOH is often complex and withdrawal of the overused medication is recognized as the treatment of choice.Although several reviews on MOH have already been published,–this review attempts to give an update on different aspects of MOH.

### Medication overuse headache [^35cad807]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Medication overuse headache (MOH) is defined as a new or worsening headache occurring more than 15 days a month in people with a pre-existing primary headache that develops as a result of regular overuse of acute headache treatments. MOH is a common secondary headache disorder with an estimated prevalence of 1% to 5%. The presence of a pre-existing primary headache disorder is the main risk factor for MOH.

Medication use and health care utilization

While over-the-counter drugs are the most commonly overused headache medications in primary care, accounting for approximately 60% of overused medication, secondary and tertiary care have a greater proportion of MOH patients who overuse more potent centrally acting drugs like combination analgesics and opioids.–In addition, many MOH patients overuse more than one type of acute medication.

The drugs implicated in MOH change over time and differ between regions.As an example, butalbital-containing medicine is still a problem in the USA, but is banned in the European Union.Ergotamine is no longer the large problem it once was in western Europe, but still is in other parts of the world. However, triptans are now one of the most common causes of MOH in the Western world, but are probably too expensive to be a big problem in developing countries, where simple analgesics and ergotamine are much cheaper options.

The clinical features of MOH caused by different headache medications are quite similar. The fact that many patients overuse more than one type of acute headache drug makes it somewhat difficult to conclude if different types of drugs give different types of headache characteristics. However, one study showed that people overusing triptans developed a more migraine-like headache, in contrast with those overusing ergotamines and analgesics, who developed a more tension-type-like headache.In another study, MOH caused by a combination of analgesics and triptans resulted in a higher frequency and intensity of headache, but this needs to be further explored.

In the general population, only 5%–15% of MOH patients use prophylactic medication, which is a low number considering the chronicity of the headache and frequent medication use.The relative frequency of MOH in secondary and tertiary care is considerably higher than in primary care and in the general population. Headache clinics report that 50%–70% of their patients are overusing medication.–

### Treatment of medication overuse headache – guideline of the EFNS headache panel [^f04ec02e]. European Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Medication overuse headache is a common condition with a population-based prevalence of more than 1-2%. Treatment is based on education, withdrawal treatment (detoxification), and prophylactic treatment. It also includes management of withdrawal headache.

Aims

This guideline aims to give treatment recommendations for this headache.

Materials and Methods

Evaluation of the scientific literature.

Results

Abrupt withdrawal or tapering down of overused medication is recommended, the type of withdrawal therapy is probably not relevant for the outcome of the patient. However, inpatient withdrawal therapy is recommended for patients overusing opioids, benzodiazepine, or barbiturates. It is further recommended to start individualized prophylactic drug treatment at the first day of withdrawal therapy or even before. The only drug with moderate evidence for the prophylactic treatment in patients with chronic migraine and medication overuse is topiramate up to 200mg. Corticosteroids (at least 60mg prednisone or prednisolone) and amitriptyline (up to 50mg) are possibly effective in the treatment of withdrawal symptoms. Patients after withdrawal therapy should be followed up regularly to prevent relapse of medication overuse.

Discussion and Conclusion

Medication overuse headache can be treated according to evidence-based recommendations.

### Pharmacologic options for the treatment of chronic daily (...) [^9f13ad38]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Butalbital is a commonly used abortive treatment with little evidence to support its use and growing evidence of risk. Despite being studied only for the treatment of tension headaches, butalbital is taken by 6% of patients with acute migraine headaches and 13% of patients with chronic migraine headaches. 1 Unfortunately, butalbital is the abortive medication most likely to lead to medication overuse headaches. 2 As a result, the American Academy of Neurology, the American Headache Society, and the American Board of Internal Medicine recommend avoiding its use as a first-line agent for the treatment of headaches.
3. The list of prophylactic medications in the article included tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors but excluded venlafaxine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.

Although the strength of evidence is limited, studies show that venlafaxine is comparable to some recommended medications, notably gabapentin and tizanidine. 4, 5 In addition, as pointed out in the AAN guideline, venlafaxine appears to have equivalent benefit to tricyclic antidepressants but with fewer adverse effects. 6 The AAN gives venlafaxine a category B recommendation for prophylaxis of migraine headaches, the same as tricyclic antidepressants. in reply: I agree with Dr. Arnold that butalbital should be avoided for acute treatment of headaches. Regarding the use of venlafaxine for headache prophylaxis, the AAN guideline Dr. Arnold cites is for prophylaxis of episodic migraine, not for chronic daily headache, which by International Headache Society definition occurs for 15 days or more per month for at least three months. 3 or had unclear numbers of patients with chronic daily headache vs. episodic headaches.

4, 5 In addition, all of the studies were sponsored by the same pharmaceutical company. 3–5 Although venlafaxine may have some effectiveness for prophylaxis of episodic migraines, I believe that more studies are needed before recommending its use over other available options for chronic daily headache prophylaxis.

### Clinical features, pathophysiology, and treatment of medication-overuse headache [^ca0fa08a]. The Lancet: Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Medication-overuse headache (MOH) is a chronic headache disorder defined by the International Headache Society as a headache induced by the overuse of analgesics, triptans, or other acute headache compounds. The population-based prevalence of MOH is 0.7% to 1.7%. Most patients with MOH have migraine as their primary headache and overuse triptans or simple analgesics. The pathophysiology of MOH is still unknown. As well as psychological mechanisms such as operant conditioning, changes in endocrinological homoeostasis and neurophysiological changes have been observed in patients with MOH. Recently, a genetic susceptibility has been postulated. In most cases, treatment of MOH consists of abrupt withdrawal therapy and then initiation of an appropriate preventive drug therapy. There is no clear evidence on which method of withdrawal therapy is the most efficacious. Withdrawal symptoms can be treated with steroids; however, not all data support this concept. As MOH can severely affect the quality of life of patients, it needs to be recognised early to enable appropriate treatment to be initiated.

### A systematic review and critical appraisal of gene polymorphism association studies in medication-overuse headache [^80cea689]. Cephalalgia (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose of review Medication-overuse headache is a secondary chronic headache disorder, evolving from an episodic primary headache type, caused by the frequent and excessive use of headache symptomatic drugs. While gene polymorphisms have been deeply investigated as susceptibility factors for migraine, little attention has been paid to medication-overuse headache genetics. In the present study we conducted a systematic review to identify, appraise and summarize the current findings of gene polymorphism association studies in medication-overuse headache. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted on PubMed and Web of Knowledge databases of primary studies that met the diagnostic criteria for medication-overuse headache according to the temporally-relevant Classification of Headache Disorder of the International Headache Society. Results A total of 17 candidate gene association studies focusing on medication-overuse headache were finally included in the qualitative review. Among these, 12 studies investigated the role of common gene polymorphisms as risk factors for medication-overuse headache susceptibility, six studies focused on the relationship with clinical features of medication-overuse headache patients, and four studies evaluated their role as determinants of clinical outcomes in medication-overuse headache patients. Conclusion Results of single studies show a potential role of polymorphic variants of the dopaminergic gene system or of other genes related to drug-dependence pathways as susceptibility factors for disease or as determinants of monthly drug consumption, respectively. In this systematic review, we summarize the findings of gene polymorphism association studies in medication-overuse headache and discuss the methodological issues that need to be addressed in the design of future studies.

### Ubrogepant does not induce latent sensitization in a preclinical model of medication overuse headache [^ea922ee5]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Effective management of patients’ migraine is often inadequate, and treatments are associated with unintended consequences. Frequent use of acute medications, including opiates, cannabinoids, barbiturates, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), as well as migraine-specific medications (e.g. triptans), can lead to medication overuse headache (MOH), characterized by increased frequency of headache attacks, increased pain intensity, and increased disability (–). Novel drugs with new mechanisms of action have recently been approved, but it is unknown whether these will also carry the risk of inducing MOH in vulnerable patients. MOH is defined in the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) as a headache that (a) develops as a consequence of regular overuse of symptomatic headache medication in a person with a preexisting headache disorder and (b) occurs on >14 days/month for >3 months and cannot be better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis. The prevalence of MOH has been estimated at 1% to 2% in the general population and is among the top 20 causes of years lived with disability (–). Multiple drug classes are used for the acute treatment of headaches and, to date, almost all are implicated in the development of MOH. Medication overuse is a risk factor in the transformation of episodic migraine to chronic migraine, which is associated with decreased quality of life (,–). The need for novel drugs that are effective in the acute treatment of migraine but that do not provoke development of MOH is desired by both patients and clinicians.

### Pathophysiology of medication overuse headache: insights and hypotheses from preclinical studies [^bf86c658]. Cephalalgia (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Medication overuse headache (MOH) is a clinical concern in the management of migraine headache. MOH arises from the frequent use of medications used for the treatment of a primary headache. Medications that can cause MOH include opioid analgesics as well as formulations designed for the treatment of migraine, such as triptans, ergot alkaloids, or drug combinations that include caffeine and barbiturates.

Literature Review

Gathering evidence indicates that migraine patients are more susceptible to development of MOH, and that prolonged use of these medications increases the prognosis for development of chronic migraine, leading to the suggestion that similar underlying mechanisms may drive both migraine headache and MOH. In this review, we examine the link between several mechanisms that have been linked to migraine headache and a potential role in MOH. For example, cortical spreading depression (CSD), associated with migraine development, is increased in frequency with prolonged use of topiramate or paracetamol.

Conclusions

Increased CGRP levels in the blood have been linked to migraine and elevated CGRP can be casued by prolonged sumatriptan exposure. Possible mechanisms that may be common to both migraine and MOH include increased endogenous facilitation of pain and/or diminished diminished endogenous pain inhibition. Neuroanatomical pathways mediating these effects are examined.

### Assessing and managing medication overuse headache in Australian clinical practice [^12a61037]. BMJ Neurology Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Medication overuse headache (MOH) is described in the latest International Classification of Headache Disorders third edition (ICHD-3) criteria as a secondary headache disorder that occurs as a consequence of the overuse of medication to alleviate symptoms of a primary headache disorder, such as chronic migraine or tension-type headache. Patients caught in this vicious cycle may experience increasing frequency and severity of headache despite taking increasing and excessive amounts of acute headache medication.

The pathophysiology of MOH is poorly understood.Central sensitisation is thought to play an important role given that patients with migraines or tension-type headache appear more prone to developing the secondary headache disorder.

Migraine is the leading cause of disability in Australia.According to 2019 estimates, more than 3.41 (3.995–2.931 IU) million Australians are affected by migraine, and with a global prevalence of 1%–2%, an estimated quarter of a million of these Australians have MOH.

For patients with MOH, withdrawal failures and relapse rates remain high,likely because patients often experience high rates of monthly migraine days (MMDs) despite medication withdrawal.Successful treatment may be further complicated by comorbidities of MOH, such as anxiety, depression and subclinical obsessive-compulsive disorders.

In Australia, real-world evidence demonstrates a high rate of opioid use in the treatment of acute migraine in the emergency setting.The popularity of self-medication with easily available over-the-counter analgesicsmay also contribute to the national burden of MOH.

Although MOH accounts for a large proportion of referrals to specialist headache clinics,the advent of newer, highly effective migraine-preventive medications may help general neurology practices better manage MOH.

This viewpoint article provides an overview of the assessment and management of MOH in Australia. For an in-depth discussion about MOH, the recent review from Dr Sun-Edelstein et al is recommended.

Introduction

Patients with migraine commonly overuse acute medications, including simple and combination analgesics, triptans, and opioids., Medication overuse headache (MOH) is an International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) recognized secondary headache disorder defined by sustained overuse of acute headache medication(s) with clinical observation of significant worsening of a pre-existing headache or development of a new type of headache in association with the medication overuse.According to the ICHD-3 criteria, MOH diagnosis is limited to patients with pre-existing primary headache disorders who have developed a chronic headache pattern (ie, 15 or more headache days per month for more than 3 months) due to sustained medication overuse.

Prevalence estimates of MOH in an adult Western population have been reported to be 1% to 2%.The most common presentation of MOH is in association with migraine. Chronic migraine (CM) associated with MOH (CM-MOH) has been linked to an increased risk of preventive treatment failure, stronger association with psychiatric comorbidities (eg, mood and/or substance-related disorders), increased migraine-related disability, higher levels of health care utilization, and overall decreased quality of life. An analysis from The Medication Overuse Treatment Strategy trial including over 600 participants from 34 sites found that CM-MOH is associated with substantial negative consequences and that depression symptom severity had the strongest relationship with pain interference and headache impact.In one observational study, patients with CM with high frequency medication use had significantly worse Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6) and Migraine Disability Assessment scores compared with patients with low-frequency medication use.MOH is the most costly of the primary and secondary headache disorders. In the European Union (EU), the Eurolight project using survey data from 2008 to 2009 estimated that the total annual cost of MOH among adults aged 18 to 65 years amounted to €37 billion ($40.1 billion.),

Patients with MOH should be managed by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists or pain specialists and behavioral psychologists. Patients in whom education is not effective should be withdrawn from overused drugs and should receive preventive treatment with drugs of proven efficacy. Patients with MOH in whom preventive treatment is not effective should undergo drug withdrawal. Drug intake can be abruptly terminated or restricted in patients overusing simple analgesics, ergots or triptan medication. In patients with long-lasting abuse of opioids, barbiturates or tranquilizers, slow tapering of these drugs is recommended. Withdrawal can be performed on an outpatient basis or in a daycare or inpatient setting.

Medication-overuse headache—description, diagnostic criteria, and coding guidance are as follows: Headache occurring on 15 or more days/month in a patient with a pre-existing primary headache and developing as a consequence of regular overuse of acute or symptomatic headache medication (on 10 or more or 15 or more days/month, depending on the medication) for more than 3 months, and it usually, but not invariably, resolves after the overuse is stopped. Diagnostic criteria specify A. Headache occurring on ≥15-days/month in a patient with a pre-existing headache disorder; B. Regular overuse for >3-months of one or more drugs that can be taken for acute and/or symptomatic treatment of headache; and C. Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis. Patients who meet criteria for both 1.3 Chronic migraine and 8.2 Medication-overuse headache should be given both diagnoses. Previously used terms include: Rebound headache, medication-misuse headache, drug-induced headache. Coding notes state patients should be coded for one or more subtypes of 8.2 Medication-overuse headache according to the specific medication(s) overused, with examples including receiving both 8.2.2 Triptan-overuse headache and a subform of 8.2.3 Non-opioid analgesic-overuse headache, except when combination-analgesic medications are overused, who are coded 8.2.5 Combination-analgesic-overuse headache and not according to each constituent; patients using multiple drugs without any single drug overused should be coded 8.2.6 Medication-overuse headache attributed to multiple drug classes not individually overused; and those clearly overusing multiple drugs but unable to specify names/quantities are coded 8.2.7 Medication-overuse headache attributed to unspecified or unverified overuse of multiple drug classes, and in almost all cases, this necessitates diary follow-up.

Comparison of 3 treatment strategies for medication-overuse headache. A randomized clinical trial

This paper reported an open-label, randomised clinical trial of three MOH outpatient treatment strategies. A total of 120 consecutive patients with MOH were recruited from a tertiary headache centre in Denmark, randomised 1:1:1 to three treatment strategies, and followed up for 6 months. Inclusion criteria included a headache diagnosis of chronic migraine (52.0%), tension-type headache (15.7%) or a mixture of the two (32.4%). Individuals with other headache diagnoses (e.g. cluster headache) or significant physical or psychiatric comorbidities were excluded from the study.

Treatment strategies were (1) withdrawal alone; (2) withdrawal with preventive treatment from start; (3) preventive treatment without withdrawal. Drug withdrawal involved discontinuation of all analgesics for 2 months. The withdrawal group (1) was offered preventive medication after the initial 2-month withdrawal period. Preventive medications were prescribed using existing Danish guidelines and included candesartan (44.1%), amitriptyline (12.7%), and metoprolol (9.8%). The mean age of patient was 43.9 years, and the female: male ratio was 4:1, as expected. The medications overused were simple analgesics (28.4%), triptans (17.6%), or combinations of these and other acute drugs (53.9%), with the duration of overuse ranging from 3 months to over 10 years. On entering the study, patients had a median of 27 headache days per month (range 15–30 days). During the withdrawal period, short-term analgesics were completely discontinued by 20 of 36 (55.6%) in the withdrawal group (1) and 18 of 31 (58.1%) in the withdrawal plus preventive group (2), with the remaining patients reducing their intake of short-term medications to below the threshold for MOH.

Treatment

MOH is a treatable but very heterogeneous condition.A further challenge in the treatment is the fact that no worldwide consensus for the management of these patients exists. This may be due to the lack of randomized controlled studies, but also reflects differences in use of headache classification and treatment strategies across the world.

Whether or not to detoxify MOH patients initially and whether prophylactic medication should be initiated immediately at withdrawal or after withdrawal therapy has been completed are probably the most disputed areas in the treatment of MOH.–Although recently debated, withdrawal of the overused medication(s) is regarded by most headache experts as the treatment of choice, since withdrawal of the overused medication(s) in most cases leads to an improvement of the headache.,,

Most patients experience withdrawal symptoms lasting 2–10 days after detoxification. The most common symptom is an initial worsening of the headache (rebound-headache), accompanied by various degrees of nausea, vomiting, hypotension, tachycardia, sleep disturbances, restlessness, anxiety, and nervousness. The duration of withdrawal headaches has been found to vary with different drugs, being shorter in patients overusing triptans than in those overusing ergotamine or analgesics.

Detoxification procedures vary widely and include both inpatient (2 days to 2 weeks) and outpatient withdrawal.–The different strategies include abrupt or tapered withdrawal with just simple advice, multidisciplinary approaches, use of antiemetics, neuroleptics, rescue medication (an analgesic other than the overused one), and intravenous hydration. Steroids have for a long time been expected to alleviate withdrawal headache in the acute phase, but two placebo-controlled studies did not find prednisolone (60 mg or 100 mg for 5 days) superior to placebo.However, it is still debated if it may be useful in certain subgroups of patients.

Independent of the strategy used, the main aims of treatment are withdrawal of the overused medication and continuing support (pharmacological and nonpharmacological) to prevent relapse. Comorbidity with other medical conditions (including psychiatric disorders) has to be treated in addition to withdrawal therapy to avoid relapse.

### Three strategies are effective in managing patients with... [^7d97a5a2]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question What are the effective approaches to managing patients with medication overuse headaches. Bottom Line In this study, achieving cure from medication overuse headaches after six months was likely regardless of strategy: detoxification plus pharmacologic prophylaxis, pharmacologic prophylaxis without withdrawal, or detoxification with pharmacologic preventive therapy delayed for two months. Although the authors favor the combined strategy, it seems like this is a good time for shared decision-making. . Synopsis This study was fundamentally aimed at determining if detoxification is needed in patients with medication overuse headaches by comparing three outpatient strategies: detoxification plus pharmacologic prophylaxis, pharmacologic prophylaxis without withdrawal, and detoxification with pharmacologic preventive therapy delayed for two months.

The pharmacologic prophylactic therapy was at the discretion of the treating physician, and monoclonal antibody therapy was not available. The following prophylactic agents were ultimately used: metoprolol, lisinopril, candesartan, topiramate, amitriptyline, mirtazapine, and onabotulinumtoxinA. All patients had access to rescue antiemetic therapy during withdrawal. Forty patients with medication overuse headaches were randomized to receive each strategy; after six months, between 10% and 22. 5% dropped out of each arm. More than a 20% drop-out rate is worrisome. Although the presentation of their data is confusing, the authors report that medication overuse headaches were cured in 97% of those completing the detoxification plus pharmacologic prophylaxis strategy compared with 74% of those completing the pharmacologic preventive strategy and 89% of those completing the detoxification strategy.

They also observed no significant differences in the number of headache days, in the subsequent use of short-term analgesics, or in headache severity. Each strategy appeared to be highly effective, but the unmasked design, loose medication management, and spotty drop-out rates raise some concerns about the data. The authors plan additional follow-up at 12 months and at four years.

### Medication-overuse headache: a review [^5da480cf]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Therefore, based on today’s knowledge, we suggest that initial withdrawal is the treatment of choice. Prophylactic headache medication should be restricted to patients who do not benefit sufficiently from cessation of medication-overuse, and those who have previously failed withdrawal attempts or have significant comorbidity. Some authors contest this view since many MOH patients are already suffering and heavily disabled before starting a possible troublesome detoxification with withdrawal symptoms. However, it is an aim in itself to achieve a behavioral change and to restructure the approach from “have pain – take tablet” thinking to better ways of handling headache. In addition, a period free of medication-overuse has been suggested to lead to recovery of prophylactic responsiveness.For patients still needing prophylactic medication after withdrawal, the choice should be based on the underlying primary headache, comorbidity, and possible side effects of treatment. Other more experimental treatments, such as surgery and neuromodulation, have conflicting results and should not be recommended before new evidence clearly demonstrates a clinical effect.

### Health care resource utilization and costs associated with diagnosed medication overuse headache and potential acute medication overuse in individuals with migraine [^8206ef06]. Cephalalgia (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Estimate health care resource utilization and costs associated with medication overuse headache and potential acute medication overuse.

Methods

A retrospective analysis was conducted with Clinformatics Data Mart data (1 January 2019-31 December 2019) that included continuously enrolled commercially insured adults with migraine (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-10-CM] code G43.xxx). Medication overuse headache was defined as ≥1 inpatient or ≥2 outpatient claims with an ICD-10-CM code G44.41/40 (drug-induced headache). Potential acute medication overuse was defined as possessing sufficient medication for >10 mean treatment days/month for ergots, triptans, opioids, or combination analgesics or >15 mean cumulative days/month for simple prescription analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, other non-opioid analgesics) for >6 consecutive months. All-cause and migraine-related health care resource utilization and costs were compared after adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics.

Results

Among 90,017 individuals with migraine, the frequency of medication overuse headache/potential acute medication overuse was 12.6% (diagnosed medication overuse headache: 0.6%; potential acute medication overuse: 12.1%). Adjusted all-cause total costs ($31,235 vs $21,486; difference: $9,749 [ P <0.001]) and adjusted migraine-related total costs ($9,770 vs $6,207; difference: $3,563 [ P <0.001]) were higher in the medication overuse headache/potential acute medication overuse group versus those without medication overuse headache/potential acute medication overuse.

Conclusions

Individuals with diagnosed medication overuse headache/potential acute medication overuse had higher all-cause and migraine-related health care resource utilization and costs versus individuals without medication overuse headache/potential acute medication overuse, suggesting that improved migraine management is needed to reduce associated costs.

### Eighty years of medication-overuse headache: what about medication-overuse backpain? [^38a0e736]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although chronic low back pain (CLBP) is one of the most common pain syndromes, up to now, clear pathophysiological causes or specific treatment options are missing. Medication-overuse has been associated with chronic headache, but never with CLBP.

Hypothesis

Based on several similarities between CLBP and Medication-Overuse Headache (MOH), we hypothesized that medication-overuse might contribute to CLBP as well, maybe even as an own entity. Might there be something like Medication-Overuse Backpain (MOB)?

Methods

We substantiate our hypothesis with a preliminary case-series analyzing five patients suffering from CLBP with a marked medication-overuse. In these patients, a stepwise analgesic withdrawal was recommended.

Results

Within 6 months of recruitment, five patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and successfully completed discontinuation of their medication. All patients reported noticeable pain relief, despite the discontinuation of their analgesics. Withdrawal was well tolerated in all cases.

Conclusions

Considering our results, the described withdrawal method seems to be a simple and safe method to achieve pain reduction while simultaneously preventing organ damage. Despite the preliminary character of our results, our hypothesis might stimulate a new understanding of CLBP's pathophysiology.

### Headache management: pharmacological approaches [^e9029251]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The effective management of headache disorders remains a moving field and a potential challenge to the neurologist. The frequency of headache and its burden of disability make it essential for neurologists to manage headache in an informed way. Therapeutic decisions are hampered by minimal evidence to support the use of many therapies and hence we a need large, robust clinical trials. However, emerging therapies specifically targeting headache pain pathways are likely to improve significantly the management options and advance the field.

A practical approach is important—using existing evidence and guidelines—to enable effective headache management. It is an area where the clinician can have a huge and very rewarding impact upon patient care.

Key points

Headache is a common cause of disability; an accurate diagnosis is essential, though is often delayed or missed.
Medication-overuse headache frequently coexists and should be actively sought and discussed with patients with headache.
National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends acute migraine abortive treatment with a triptan together with paracetamol (or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) plus an antiemetic; lack of efficacy with one triptan does not mean that others will not work.
NICE guidelines for migraine prophylaxis suggest using topiramate or a beta blocker; comorbidities or lack of efficacy often means that other agents are also prescribed.
Start migraine prophylactic agents at low dose, build the dose up progressively and maintain a therapeutic dose for 3 months before judging its efficacy.

### Medication-overuse headache and opioid-induced hyperalgesia: a review of mechanisms, a neuroimmune hypothesis and a novel approach to treatment [^732190e0]. Cephalalgia (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Patients with chronic headache who consume large amounts of analgesics are often encountered in clinical practice. Excessive intake of analgesics is now considered to be a cause, rather than simply a consequence, of frequent headaches, and as such the diagnosis "medication-overuse headache" (MOH) has been formulated. Despite the prevalence and clinical impact of MOH, the pathophysiology behind this disorder remains unclear and specific mechanism-based treatment options are lacking.

Discussion

Although most acute headache treatments have been alleged to cause MOH, here we conclude from the literature that opioids are a particularly problematic drug class consistently associated with worsening headache. MOH may not be a single entity, as each class of drug implicated may cause MOH via a different mechanism. Recent evidence indicates that chronic opioid administration may exacerbate pain in the long term by activating toll-like receptor-4 on glial cells, resulting in a pro-inflammatory state that manifests clinically as increased pain. Thus, from the available evidence it seems opioid-overuse headache is a phenomenon similar to opioid-induced hyperalgesia, which derives from a cumulative interaction between central sensitisation, due to repeated activation of nociceptive pathways by recurrent headaches, and pain facilitation due to glial activation.

Conclusion

Treatment strategies directed at inhibiting glial activation may be of benefit alongside medication withdrawal in the management of MOH.

### Efficacy and safety of erenumab in adults with medication overuse headache: final results from a phase 4 randomized placebo-controlled study [^5d14ddb2]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Medication overuse headache (MOH) is recognized by the International Classification of Headache Disorders, Third Edition (ICHD‐3), as a secondary, chronic headache disorder defined by sustained overuse of acute headache medication(s) with significant worsening of a preexisting headache or development of a chronic headache pattern (i.e. ≥ 15 headache days/month for more than 3 months). The most common approach to MOH management is participant education combined with withdrawal from the overused medication, initiation or optimization of preventive therapy, and limited use of alternate medication or bridge therapy. However, underutilization of preventive treatments and high rates of relapse within 1 year of withdrawal (25%–41%) remain important challenges that limit effective long‐term management of MOH. Underutilization of preventive therapies for MOH is, in part, due to inappropriate migraine management and devaluation of the condition by participants and physicians. High rates of relapse may be the result of psychosocial factors. In a qualitative study, participants with frequent relapse, defined as requiring ≥ 2 withdrawals for MOH within 3 years, tended to have a pessimistic attitude, poor coping strategies, and lacked awareness of their condition. Although data with older nonspecific migraine‐preventive drugs (e.g. topiramate) are questionable, migraine‐specific preventive treatments are proving to be effective even in participants with associated MOH.

It is worthwhile noting that the classification does not depend on the number of drug units or dosage, but only count the number of days per month with medication use. Further, the pain characteristics and intensity are not a part of the diagnostic criteria since the location of pain varies in MOH.

### Efficacy of atogepant in chronic migraine with and without acute medication overuse in the randomized, double-blind, phase 3 PROGRESS trial [^4a7bceaa]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic migraine (CM) is a debilitating neurologic disease characterized by ≥15 headache days per month, with ≥8 days meeting migraine criteria.The global prevalence of CM in the general population is estimated at 1.4%–2.2%.Patients with CM experience greater headache-related disability, lower health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and higher rates of comorbidities than those with episodic migraine (EM), who have <15 headache days per month.

Acute treatments are used to address migraine symptoms and reduce disability; however, these treatments may be ineffective and may lead to an increase in dosing and the overuse of these medications.Acute medication overuse is defined as taking simple analgesics for ≥15 days per month or taking triptans, ergots, opioids, or combinations of medications for ≥10 days per month.Large longitudinal, cross-sectional studies estimate the prevalence of acute medication overuse in the migraine population at 15.4%–17.7%, ; however, studies from headache specialist centers estimate the prevalence as high as 50%–70%.Acute medication overuse is often linked with CM and associated with greater pain intensity and disability and worse 24-hour pain relief outcomes.Acute medication overuse is also a risk factor for the progression of EM to CM and for medication-overuse headache, a type of secondary headache in patients overusing acute headache medications with an underlying headache disorder.,, Patients with CM and medication-overuse headache have a significantly poorer quality of life and greater disability than those with CM without medication-overuse headache.Owing to the high prevalence of acute medication overuse in the migraine population and the increased disability, there is a need for more effective preventive treatments to reduce the use of symptomatic acute medication.

Atogepant is an oral, small-molecule, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist specifically developed for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults.The phase 3 PROGRESS trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of atogepant for the preventive treatment of CM compared with placebo.Once daily, oral atogepant resulted in a significant decrease in mean monthly migraine days (MMDs) compared with placebo over 12 weeks (primary end point) in participants with CM. The primary research question addressed by this subgroup analysis of the PROGRESS trial was the efficacy and safety of atogepant compared with placebo in participants with CM with and without acute medication overuse.

Classification of headache disorders and MOH

Headache is a subjective symptom, and no laboratory tests or other objective tests are available to diagnose headache. Classification and diagnostic criteria are therefore of essential importance both in clinical practice and research settings. Until 1960, headache diagnoses and studies were based on nonuniform descriptions of symptomatology. Diagnostic criteria for headache were first presented in 1962 when an ad hoc committee of the National Institutes of Health published a first set of criteria.In 1988, the International Headache Society (IHS) published a classification system that became the standard for headache diagnosis: Classification and diagnostic criteria for headache disorders, cranial neuralgias and facial pain.In the 1988 edition, the diagnosis “headache induced by chronic substance use or exposure” was taken into the classification. In 2004, a second edition “The International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-II)” was published, and the term “medication-overuse headache” was introduced.To be more applicable to patients in clinical practice, the diagnostic criteria for MOH were revised twice for the ICHD-II.–Before the last revision, MOH should paradoxically be entitled as “probable MOH” until overuse was discontinued, and then, if the patient improved after detoxification, given a definite MOH diagnosis. This meant that the patient could not receive a definite diagnosis of MOH until after a successful withdrawal of medication, following which she/he would no longer have MOH.

In 2013, a new version, “The International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd beta edition (ICHD-IIIb)”, was published, taking these changes to MOH into account.

According to the ICHD-IIIb, “MOH is headache occurring on 15 or more days per month developing as a consequence of regular overuse of acute or symptomatic headache medication (on 10 or more, or 15 or more days per month, depending on the medication) for more than 3 months. It usually, but not invariably, resolves after the overuse is stopped” (Figure 1). With the present criteria, MOH can be diagnosed immediately, and independently of withdrawal.

MOH is classified as a secondary chronic headache, but whether MOH is a primary or secondary headache is still under debate, and the concept of medication-overuse in other secondary headaches is unclear.Further, the concept of chronic migraine with medication-overuse is probably one of the most disputed aspects of the classification.

Despite the recent advances in the understanding and classification of the chronic daily headaches, considerable controversy still exists regarding the classification of individual headaches, including chronic migraine (CM) and medication overuse headache (MOH). The original criteria, published in 2004, were difficult to apply to most patients with these disorders and were subsequently revised, resulting in broader clinical applicability. Nonetheless, they remain a topic of debate, and the revisions to the criteria have further added to the confusion. Even some prominent headache specialists are unsure which criteria to use. We aimed to explain the nature of the controversies surrounding the entities of CM and MOH. A clinical case will be used to illustrate some of the problems faced by clinicians in diagnosing patients with chronic daily headache.

Importance

Medication overuse headache (MOH) is a disabling, globally prevalent disorder representing a well-known and debated clinical problem. Evidence for the most effective treatment strategy is needed.

Objective

To compare 3 treatment strategies for MOH.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This open-label, randomized clinical trial with 6 months of follow-up was conducted in the tertiary sector at the Danish Headache Center, Glostrup, from October 25, 2016, to June 28, 2019. Of 483 patients with MOH referred during the inclusion period, 195 met the criteria consisting of migraine and/or tension-type headache, 18 years or older, eligibility for outpatient treatment, no severe physical or psychiatric disorder, no other addiction, and not pregnant or breastfeeding. Of these, 75 refused participation and 120 were included. Data were analyzed from July 3 to September 6, 2019.

Interventions

Random assignment (1:1:1 allocation) to 1 of the 3 outpatient treatments consisting of (1) withdrawal plus preventive treatment, (2) preventive treatment without withdrawal, or (3) withdrawal with optional preventive treatment 2 months after withdrawal.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was change in headache days per month after 6 months. Predefined secondary outcomes were change in monthly migraine days, use of short-term medication, pain intensity, number of responders, patients with remission to episodic headache, and cured MOH.

Results

Of 120 patients, 102 (mean [SD] age, 43.9 [11.8] years; 81 women [79.4%]) completed the 6-month follow-up. Headache days per month were reduced by 12.3 (95% CI, 9.3-15.3) in the withdrawal plus preventive group, by 9.9 (95% CI, 7.2-12.6) in the preventive group, and by 8.5 (95% CI, 5.6-11.5) in the withdrawal group (P=.20). No difference was found in reduction of migraine days per month, use of short-term medication, or headache intensity. In the withdrawal plus preventive group, 23 of 31 patients (74.2%) reverted to episodic headache, compared with 21 of 35 (60.0%) in the preventive group and 15 of 36 (41.7%) in the withdrawal group (P=.03). Moreover, 30 of 31 patients (96.8%) in the withdrawal plus preventive group were cured of MOH, compared with 26 of 35 (74.3%) in the preventive group and 32 of 36 (88.9%) in the withdrawal group (P=.03). These findings corresponded to a 30% (relative risk, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.6) increased chance of MOH cure in the withdrawal plus preventive group compared with the preventive group (P=.03).

Conclusion and Relevance

All 3 treatment strategies were effective, but based on these findings, withdrawal therapy combined with preventive medication from the start of withdrawal is recommended as treatment for MOH.

### Severity of analgesic dependence and medication-overuse headache [^faeb0ca4]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Dependence-like behavior is often seen as a challenging factor in the prescription of medication to patients who are suspected of having a substance misuse problem, or being at risk for such behavior. Usage of over-the-counter (OTC) medications unknown to the treating physician may complicate matters. Specialists who do not usually work in the addiction field may sometimes choose to ignore any suggestion of dependency-like behavior being involved as this may complicate discussions of medication. However, awareness of such behavior may serve to optimize treatment of some conditions. One such condition may be medication-overuse headache (MOH), which is a chronic headache (headache ≥15 days per month) that affects about 1% to 2% of the general population worldwide. It is characterized by overuse of analgesics (defined as simple analgesics use on ≥15 days per month or ≥10 days per month for triptans, opiates and combination analgesics) in parallel with worsening of a pre-existing headache disorder. MOH patients develop tolerance to the effects of the overused analgesic(s) and exhibit several other dependence-like characteristics such as withdrawal symptoms, loss of control, drug-seeking behavior, use of medication in a larger amount or for a longer period than intended, unsuccessful efforts to cut down and a high relapse rate (;;). It is unlikely that MOH is caused by the specific analgesic action of any single agent. Withdrawal from the offending medications is the treatment of choice, and approximately 2 out of 3 MOH patients experience headache improvement after having overcome the withdrawal phase.

### What predicts the change from episodic to chronic migraine? [^81f9f35b]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Because migraine worsens in a sizeable subgroup of sufferers, but not in most, identifying factors that predict the change from episodic into chronic migraine is of extreme interest and should be seen as a priority in headache research.

Recent Findings

Potentially remediable risk factors include frequency of migraine attacks, obesity, excessive use of medications containing opioids and barbiturates, caffeine overuse, stressful life events, depression, sleep disorders and cutaneous allodynia.

Summary

While we wait for evidence regarding the benefits of risk factor modifications in the prevention of chronic migraine, several interventions are justifiable based on their other established benefits. For example, decreasing headache frequency with behavioral and pharmacological interventions will decrease current disability even if it does not modify clinical course. Monitoring the body mass index and encouraging maintenance of normal body weight is good practice in patients with and without migraine. Avoiding overuse of caffeine is desirable apart from its potential benefit in preventing progression. Sleep problems should be investigated and treated. Psychiatric comorbidities should be identified and addressed. Medications containing opioids and barbiturates should be reserved for a few selected cases of migraine, and their use should be monitored. For these interventions, the possibility of preventing progression may motivate clinicians to offer good care and patients to engage in the treatment plan.

### New appendix criteria open for a broader concept of chronic migraine [^263c7060]. Cephalalgia (2006). Low credibility.

After the introduction of chronic migraine and medication overuse headache as diagnostic entities in The International Classification of Headache Disorders, Second Edition, ICHD-2, it has been shown that very few patients fit into the diagnostic criteria for chronic migraine (CM). The system of being able to use CM and the medication overuse headache (MOH) diagnosis only after discontinuation of overuse has proven highly unpractical and new data have suggested a much more liberal use of these diagnoses. The International Headache Classification Committee has, therefore, worked out the more inclusive criteria for CM and MOH presented in this paper. These criteria are included in the appendix of ICHD-2 and are meant primarily for further scientific evaluation but may be used already now for inclusion into drug trials, etc. It is now recommended that the MOH diagnosis should no longer request improvement after discontinuation of medication overuse but should be given to patients if they have a primary headache plus ongoing medication overuse. The latter is defined as previously, i.e. 10 days or more of intake of triptans, ergot alkaloids mixed analgesics or opioids and 15 days or more of analgesics/NSAIDs or the combined use of more than one substance. If these new criteria for CM and MOH prove useful in future testing, the plan is to include them in a future revised version of ICHD-2.

### Excessive acute migraine medication use and migraine progression [^d5cd09aa]. Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Long considered a chronic disorder with a stable course, recent research demonstrates that, in a subgroup, migraine progresses to chronic migraine. Among the risk factors for migraine progression, acute symptomatic medication overuse (SMO) is regarded as one of the most important. Though SMO and chronic migraine are associated, several questions remain unanswered. First, the causal path is controversial (SMO as a cause or consequence). Second, it is unclear if specific classes of medication, as well as critical doses of exposures, are necessary. Herein we review this topic in the light of recent conducted research. Although several caveats exist and the data should be taken with caution, important findings are as follows: 1) Opiates are associated with migraine progression; critical dose of exposure is around 8 days per month, and the effect is more pronounced in men. 2) Barbiturates are also associated with migraine progression. Critical dose of exposure is around 5 days per month and the effect is more pronounced in women. 3) Triptans induced migraine progression in those with high frequency of migraine at baseline (10-14 days per month), but not overall. 4) Anti-inflammatory medications were protective in those with <10 days of headache at baseline, and, as triptans, induced migraine progression in those with high frequency of headaches. Accordingly, specific classes of medications are associated with migraine progression, and high frequency of headaches seems to be a risk factor for chronic migraine regardless of medication exposure.

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^65f1abf9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Medication overuse headache (MOH) in patients with a preexisting headache condition can be diagnosed when they use non-opioid analgesic, opioid, or combination analgesic medications for the acute treatment of headache more than 10–15 days each month (dependent on the type of medication or medications used), and headache attributed to MOH occurs 15 or more days per month with overuse of one or more acute headache medications for more than 3 months. MOH is described as a frequently missed diagnosis when evaluating chronic headache disorders, and in the United States nearly one-quarter of people with chronic headaches take abortive medications daily. The association between butalbital containing compounds and developing MOH is highlighted along with the importance of not abruptly stopping these medications (because abrupt cessation can precipitate withdrawal seizures). MOH is noted as a condition that can be treated or even prevented with judicious and infrequent use of abortive pain medications and close communication and collaboration between patients and health care providers regarding the degree of headache control, appropriate use of headache preventive medications, and accurate assessment of the use of as-needed pain medication.

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^2c010aa0]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Medication overuse headache (International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd Edition [ICHD-3]) is diagnosed by headache on 15 or more days per month in a patient with a preexisting headache disorder, regular overuse for more than 3 months of acute/symptomatic headache medication, and no better ICHD-3 diagnosis. Medication-specific overuse thresholds are: butalbital overuse ≥5 days/month for >3 months; opioid overuse ≥8 days/month for >3 months; triptan overuse ≥10 days/month for >3 months; ergotamine overuse ≥10 days/month for >3 months; combination-analgesic overuse (any combination of classes, not to include combinations that include only non-opioid analgesics) ≥10 days/month for >3 months; and non-opioid analgesic overuse (e.g., aspirin, NSAIDs, acetaminophen, steroids, and combinations of non-opioid analgesics) ≥15 days/month for >3 months. The Work Group notes that for opioids and barbiturates, some population studies suggest lower thresholds, stating the frequency threshold is approximately 8 days of opioid use per month and 5 days of butalbital use per month, and it suggests that providers ask about use for non-headache indications as days per month are a total for any use of these medications; combination-analgesic refers to a headache abortive medication that contains more than one active ingredient.

### Medication-overuse headache: causes, consequences and management [^eecd9a8a]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

After 6 months, there was a reduction in headache days per month in each of the three treatment groups [withdrawal − 8.5 days (95% CI 5.6–11.5); withdrawal plus preventive − 12.3 days (95% CI 9.3–15.3); preventive alone − 9.9 days (95% CI 7.2–12.6)] with no significant difference between the three groups. An analysis of secondary endpoints at 6 months showed that the withdrawal plus preventive strategy conferred a modest but significant advantage over the other two strategies. For example, withdrawal plus preventive was 80% more likely to promote conversion from chronic to episodic headache than withdrawal alone (relative risk 1.8 (95% CI, 1.1–2.8; p = 0.03).

Comment: This pragmatic study directly compared three simple outpatient strategies for treating MOH and showed that they are all effective, with withdrawal plus preventive being marginally favoured. Limitations of this study included the small sample sizes, the lack of a no treatment group, and the heterogeneity of the population. For example, the underlying headache diagnosis, the medications overused, the duration of MOH, and the preventives prescribed were all variable. The small sample sizes prevented subgroup analyses to assess the impact of these factors.

### Differential medication overuse risk of novel anti-migraine therapeutics [^563033b8]. Brain (2020). Medium credibility.

Medication overuse headache is estimated to affect 2% of the population, and is ranked in the top 20 most disabling disorders due to its high level of disability. Several therapies used in the treatment of acute migraine are thought to be associated with medication overuse headache, including opioids and triptans. With limited treatment options, it is critical to determine the risk profile of novel therapies prior to their widespread use. The current study explores the potential medication overuse risk of two novel therapeutic drug classes, namely the ditans: 5-HT1F receptor agonists, and the gepants: calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists, in a preclinical model of medication overuse. Persistent exposure of mice to the 5-HT1F agonist LY344864, but not olcegepant produced a significant reduction in hind paw and orofacial mechanical withdrawal thresholds as a surrogate readout of allodynia. In agreement, only LY344864 induced neuroplastic changes in trigeminal sensory afferents, increasing calcitonin gene-related peptide expression and basal trigeminal nociception. Our data highlight a differential medication overuse headache risk profile for the ditan and gepant classes of drugs that has important implications for their clinical use and patient education to help reduce the burden of medication overuse headache.

### The patient with daily headaches [^efc791df]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

The term "chronic daily headache" (CDH) describes a variety of headache types, of which chronic migraine is the most common. Daily headaches often are disabling and may be challenging to diagnose and treat. Medication overuse, or drug rebound headache, is the most treatable cause of refractory daily headache. A pathologic underlying cause should be considered in patients with recent-onset daily headache, a change from a previous headache pattern, or associated neurologic or systemic symptoms. Treatment of CDH focuses on reduction of headache triggers and use of preventive medication, most commonly anti-depressants, antiepileptic drugs, and beta blockers. Medication overuse must be treated with discontinuation of symptomatic medicines, a transitional therapy, and long-term prophylaxis. Anxiety and depression are common in patients with CDH and should be identified and treated. Although the condition is challenging, appropriate treatment of patients with CDH can bring about significant improvement in the patient's quality-of-life.

### National awareness campaign to prevent medication-overuse headache in Denmark [^e023a742]. Cephalalgia (2018). Low credibility.

Background Medication-overuse headache is prevalent, but in principle preventable. Objective To describe the Danish national awareness campaign for medication-overuse headache. Methods The Danish Headache Center, the Association of Danish Pharmacies, and headache patient organizations implemented a four-month medication-overuse headache awareness campaign in 2016. Target groups were the general public, general practitioners, and pharmacists. Key messages were: Overuse of pain-medication can worsen headaches; pain-medication should be used rationally; and medication-overuse headache is treatable. A range of communication technologies was used. A survey on the public's awareness of medication-overuse headache was conducted. Results The Danish adult population is 4.2 million. Online videos were viewed 297,000 times in three weeks. All 400 pharmacies received campaign materials. Over 28,000 leaflets were distributed. Two radio interviews were conducted. A television broadcast about headache reached an audience of 520,000. Forty articles were published in print media. Information was accessible at 32 reputable websites and five online news agencies. Three scientific papers were published. Information was available at an annual conference of general practitioners, including a headache lecture. The survey showed an increase in percentage of the public who knew about medication-overuse headache (from 31% to 38%). Conclusion A concerted campaign to prevent medication-overuse headache can be implemented through involvement of key stakeholders.

Introduction

Frequent use of acute headache medications or medication overuse in individuals with headache disorders can lead to medication overuse headache (MOH). MOH is characterized by an increased frequency of headache attacks and disability (–). MOH is defined by the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition (ICHD-3) as a headache that develops as a consequence of regular overuse of symptomatic headache medication in a person with a pre-existing headache disorder and that occurs on more than 14 days per month for more than 3 months and cannot be better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis. It is estimated that the prevalence of MOH is 1–2% in the general population (–), affecting over 100 million people worldwide. MOH comes at a significant cost to the individual and society, both financially (–) and psychosocially. MOH has been estimated by the World Health Organization’s Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 as being responsible for over 9.5 million years lived with disability, more than any other neurologic disorder excluding other headache disorders.

The majority of drug classes used to treat acute headache, including opioids, barbiturate containing medications, ergotamines, triptans, and simple analgesics such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen/paracetamol, have been implicated in MOH. In individuals with migraine, medication overuse is a risk factor for the transformation of episodic to chronic migraine which is associated with increased disability and decreased quality of life (–). It has been estimated that migraine accounts for up to 67–100% of the primary headache types of those with MOH (–). Triptans, 5-HT 1B/1D agonists, specifically designed for the acute treatment of migraine and perhaps the most effective migraine abortive medications, are associated with MOH in 5–18% of patients.
