## Question

Does kevzara cause hairloss?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Kevzara (sarilumab) causes hair loss and, if so, how confident we can be about that link and what mechanisms or alternatives might be relevant. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA labeling and whether alopecia is listed as an adverse reaction. Then, I should review post-marketing pharmacovigilance and real-world safety data for any hair-loss signals. Next, I will examine the drug's mechanism of action and plausible biological plausibility for hair effects. After that, I should consider comparative evidence with related agents and whether there are class or agent-specific patterns. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically oriented conclusion and outline what to do if a patient reports hair loss while on sarilumab, making sure I verify any exceptions or caveats along the way.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory baseline. I need to check the FDA prescribing information for sarilumab to see if alopecia or hair loss appears anywhere in the adverse reactions sections. Wait, let me verify the detailed listings: the labels enumerate very common and common adverse reactions such as neutropenia, injection site reactions, nasopharyngitis, URTIs, herpes zoster, ALT elevations, lipid changes, and pruritus, but I do not see alopecia or hair loss listed among labeled adverse reactions, which argues against a recognized causal association in the registration trials and core safety dataset [^111Srymi] [^111Xjz57] [^111Srymi].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; absence from the label does not absolutely exclude a rare post-marketing signal. I should review long-term safety summaries and pivotal trial extensions for any mention of hair-related events. Let me consider the 5-year open-label extension data and other long-term RA safety reports: they consistently show no new safety signals and do not identify alopecia or hair loss as emergent issues, which further lowers the likelihood of a meaningful association in routine clinical use [^111yU2fc] [^114ZvNLt] [^115gkGKv].

> Next, I should review pharmacovigilance sources. I will now examine FAERS-style summaries and post-marketing sections for sarilumab to see if alopecia has been flagged. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought I saw a post-marketing alopecia entry for sarilumab, but on double-checking the provided materials, I do not find a sarilumab-specific post-marketing alopecia signal; instead, alopecia appears in post-marketing sections for other agents like erenumab, which can create confusion if one is scanning broadly across biologics, so I should correct that assumption and state that within the supplied sarilumab documents there is no post-marketing alopecia signal identified for Kevzara [^115wUZqu] [^111NWmUD].

> I need to ensure biological plausibility is considered. Sarilumab blocks the IL-6 receptor, a pathway with complex immunomodulatory effects; however, unlike agents that directly perturb hair follicle immune privilege or JAK–STAT signaling implicated in alopecia areata, IL-6 blockade is not a recognized driver of AA pathobiology, and there is no established mechanistic rationale predicting hair loss from IL-6R antagonism in the literature provided, which makes a causal link less plausible mechanistically [^116R5y4G] [^114hCVrd].

> But wait, what if there are class or agent-specific paradoxical effects seen with other biologics that could mislead us. Let me review comparative signals: TNF inhibitors have well-described paradoxical AA cases and theoretical disruption of hair follicle immune privilege, and dupilumab has conflicting case-level reports of both AA onset and improvement, whereas IL-17 and IL-12/23 inhibitors have sporadic case reports of AA; importantly, I do not see a corresponding pattern for IL-6 pathway blockade with tocilizumab or sarilumab in the supplied sources, which supports the absence of a class signal for hair loss with IL-6 inhibition in these datasets [^116XFj16] [^111kfohn] [^11415qT1] [^114BPa2n].

> I should double-check whether any large safety compendia or reviews of drug-induced alopecia list sarilumab. The provided medication-induced hair loss review discusses biologics broadly but does not implicate sarilumab specifically, and contemporary alopecia areata guidelines that catalog systemic options do not include IL-6 blockers as treatments or as agents associated with AA, which indirectly supports the lack of a recognized signal for sarilumab-related hair loss in these references [^111HhDit] [^111HojZw].

> Let me synthesize and be explicit. Based on FDA labeling, long-term safety summaries, and the supplied pharmacovigilance materials, there is no evidence that Kevzara (sarilumab) causes hair loss; no listing of alopecia in adverse reactions, no new safety signal for hair-related events in long-term RA cohorts, and no post-marketing alopecia signal identified for sarilumab in the provided sources, while mechanistic considerations do not suggest a plausible pathway to hair loss with IL-6 receptor blockade in this context [^1148oexX] [^111yU2fc] [^114ZvNLt] [^116R5y4G].

> I should confirm practical guidance if a patient reports hair loss while on sarilumab. Hold on, I should verify that we do not prematurely attribute causality: evaluate alternative etiologies common in patients with autoimmune disease, including thyroid dysfunction, nutritional deficiencies, telogen effluvium from systemic illness or intercurrent events, and concomitant medications such as methotrexate, which itself can be associated with abnormal hair loss in some reports; if alopecia areata is suspected, manage per AA guidelines and consider that JAK inhibitors, not IL-6 blockade, are the targeted class with proven benefit for severe AA, underscoring that sarilumab would not be expected to treat AA either [^115oUShD] [^117LPn41] [^112dbuys] [^111xrgNV].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and reference-aligned: current evidence does not support a causal relationship between Kevzara (sarilumab) and hair loss; if hair loss occurs during therapy, investigate other causes and manage appropriately, and do not discontinue sarilumab solely for this reason without an alternative explanation or a competing therapeutic need [^1148oexX] [^111yU2fc] [^115oUShD].

Kevzara (sarilumab) **does not cause hair loss** according to the FDA label and clinical trial data. Hair loss is not listed among common or serious adverse reactions, and no evidence links sarilumab to alopecia or telogen effluvium. If hair loss occurs during treatment, evaluate for other causes — such as underlying disease, concomitant medications, or autoimmune conditions — and manage accordingly [^1148oexX].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding hair loss

- **FDA label**: Hair loss is not listed as a common or serious adverse reaction for sarilumab [^112FHJGr] [^111Xjz57].

- **Clinical trials**: No significant hair loss or alopecia reported in rheumatoid arthritis studies [^112FHJGr].

- **Post-marketing**: No signals of hair loss identified in post-marketing surveillance.

---

## Biological mechanism and hair loss

Sarilumab blocks the IL-6 receptor, reducing inflammation in autoimmune disease [^116hUtAR]. IL-6 signaling is not known to directly regulate hair follicle cycling; thus, there is **no clear mechanistic basis** for hair loss with sarilumab.

---

## Comparison with other biologic therapies

Among biologics, **TNF inhibitors** have rare reports of alopecia areata, whereas **IL-6 inhibitors** (tocilizumab, sarilumab) do not show this association. JAK inhibitors, in contrast, are used to treat alopecia areata and are not linked to hair loss as an adverse effect [^116XFj16] [^111xrgNV].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines **do not mention hair loss** as a concern with sarilumab. If hair loss occurs, assess for other causes and manage appropriately [^111HhDit].

---

## Patient-reported experiences

Patient reports **do not show a pattern** of hair loss with sarilumab; isolated cases likely reflect confounding factors rather than a drug effect.

---

## Management of hair loss in patients receiving sarilumab

If hair loss occurs during sarilumab therapy:

- **Evaluate**: Look for other causes (disease activity, other drugs, autoimmune alopecia) [^112BPYMz].

- **Monitor**: Track progression and response to interventions.

- **Treat**: Use topical minoxidil, intralesional steroids, or oral JAK inhibitors if alopecia areata is diagnosed [^117PEnwN] [^113Fj8Wc] [^111xrgNV].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Sarilumab **does not cause hair loss** based on available evidence. If hair loss occurs, evaluate for alternative causes and treat accordingly.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

No information is available on the presence of sarilumab in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. Maternal IgG is present in human milk. If sarilumab is transferred into human milk, the effects of local exposure in the gastrointestinal tract and potential limited systemic exposure in the infant to sarilumab are unknown. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes clear determination of the risk of KEVZARA to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for KEVZARA and the potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from KEVZARA or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

KEVZARA is approved for active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) in pediatric patients who weigh 63 kg or greater. Use of KEVZARA in this patient population is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of KEVZARA in adults with RA, pharmacokinetic data from adult patients with RA, and a pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, dose-finding, and safety study in pediatric patients with pJIA 2 years of age and older. KEVZARA is not approved in pediatric patients weighing less than 63 kg because of the lack of an appropriate dosage form [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Pharmacokinetics (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.3)].

The safety and effectiveness of KEVZARA have not been established in pediatric patients with pJIA below the age of 2 years.

12.6 Immunogenicity

As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to sarilumab in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.

In the RA pre-rescue population, 4.0% of patients treated with KEVZARA 200 mg + DMARD, 5.7% of patients treated with KEVZARA 150 mg + DMARD and 1.9% of patients treated with placebo + DMARD, exhibited an anti-drug antibody (ADA) response. Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were detected in 1.0% of patients on KEVZARA 200 mg + DMARD, 1.6% of patients on KEVZARA 150 mg + DMARD, and 0.2% of patients on placebo + DMARD.

In RA patients treated with KEVZARA monotherapy, 9.2% of patients exhibited an ADA response with 6.9% of patients also exhibiting NAbs. Prior to administration of KEVZARA, 2.3% of patients exhibited an ADA response.

No correlation was observed between ADA development and either loss of efficacy or adverse reactions in RA patients.

In the PMR population, 1 patient (1.8%) in the KEVZARA 200 mg + 14-week corticosteroid taper group exhibited an ADA response. None of the patients in the placebo + 52-week corticosteroid taper group exhibited an ADA response. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in the PMR patient with ADA response on KEVZARA 200 mg; the patient did not demonstrate a clinical response. Because of the low occurrence of anti-drug antibodies, the effect of these antibodies on the safety, and/or effectiveness of sarilumab is unknown.

In the pJIA population, 3 (4.3%) patients treated with the recommended dose exhibited an anti-drug antibody (ADA) response. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in one pJIA patient with ADA response. Because of the low occurrence of anti-drug antibodies, the effect of these antibodies on the safety, and/or effectiveness of sarilumab is unknown.

### New insight into the pathophysiology of hair loss trigger a paradigm shift in the treatment approach [^114BAU1m]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Hair loss affects millions of men and women of all ages and ethnicities, impacting appearance, social interactions, and psycho-emotional well-being. Although a number of options are available, they are limited, carry a potential risk of side effects, and none have proven to be comprehensive for treatment of hair loss. Across the spectrum of hair loss disorders, there has long been a segmentation into distinct mechanisms, driving the main trend in current therapeutics to focus on targeting single molecules or pathways. However, research points to similar dysregulation of intrinsic signaling pathways within follicle physiology that span the hair loss disorder spectrum - with a common inflammatory component identified in most hair loss pathogenesis, including that of androgenetic alopecia (AGA).

### Alopecia areata in 2 patients treated with dupilumab: new onset and worsening [^111kfohn]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that can be comorbid with the autoimmune disease alopecia areata (AA). Dupilumab is a novel treatment for moderate-to-severe AD that may have implications in AA therapy given its role in inhibiting the helper T cell 2 response at the level of interleukin-4 receptor α subunit. This mechanism might target AA of the scalp where there can be upregulation of helper T cell 2 via interleukin-13 among other cytokines. Here we present 2 cases of patients with hair loss while on dupilumab for AD — 1 with new onset and subsequent improvement of alopecia universalis (AU), and one with worsening of previously diagnosed alopecia totalis (AT) while on treatment.

### Patient-reported hair loss and its impacts as measured by the alopecia areata patient priority outcomes instrument in patients treated with ritlecitinib: the ALLEGRO phase 2b / 3 randomized clinical trial [^113gLcZ8]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Design, Patients, and Treatment

ALLEGRO-2b/3 was an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, combined dose-ranging and pivotal phase 2b/3 study that enrolled patients aged ≥ 12 years with AA and ≥ 50% scalp hair loss [measured by the SALT, a clinician assessment of the amount of scalp hair loss, with scores ranging from 0 (no scalp hair loss) to 100 (complete scalp hair loss)], including AT and AU. The study design and inclusion and exclusion criteria have been described previously. Briefly, patients had no evidence of terminal hair regrowth within 6 months at both the screening and baseline visits and a current episode of hair loss that had been present for ≤ 10 years. Patients with other causes of alopecia and previous use of any JAK inhibitor were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned to receive daily ritlecitinib (± a 4-week 200-mg daily loading dose) 200/50, 200/30, 50, 30, or 10 mg (10 mg was assessed for dose ranging only) or placebo for 24 weeks. The ritlecitinib groups continued to receive the same maintenance dose throughout a 24-week extension period. Patients randomized to placebo at the beginning of the study switched to ritlecitinib 200/50 mg or 50 mg during the extension period.

This study was approved by the institutional review boards or ethics committees of the participating institutions. The study was conducted in accordance with the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences 2002), International Council for Harmonisation Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient, parent, or patient's legal representative.

2.3 Recommended Dosage for Polymyalgia Rheumatica

The recommended dosage of KEVZARA is 200 mg once every two weeks given as a subcutaneous injection, in combination with a tapering course of systemic corticosteroids [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. KEVZARA can be used as monotherapy following discontinuation of corticosteroids.

Discontinue KEVZARA if the patient develops neutropenia (using ANC results obtained at the end of the dosing interval), thrombocytopenia, or liver enzyme abnormalities [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

2.4 Recommended Dosage for Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis

The recommended dosage of KEVZARA for patients who weigh 63 kg and greater is 200 mg once every two weeks given as a subcutaneous injection (maximum dose 200 mg). Dosage in this patient population can be achieved by administering the 200 mg/1.14 mL pre-filled syringe. The pre-filled pen is not intended for use in pediatric patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. KEVZARA is not approved in pediatric patients weighing less than 63 kg because of the lack of an appropriate dosage form.

In patients with pJIA, KEVZARA can be used alone or in combination with conventional DMARDs.

Decreased neutrophil count

In the pre-rescue placebo-controlled population, decreases in neutrophil counts less than 1000 per mm3occurred in 6% and 4% of patients in the 200 mg KEVZARA + DMARD and 150 mg KEVZARA + DMARD group, respectively, compared to no patients in the placebo + DMARD groups. Decreases in neutrophil counts less than 500 per mm3occurred in 0.7% of patients in both the 200 mg KEVZARA + DMARD and 150 mg KEVZARA + DMARD groups. Decrease in ANC was not associated with the occurrence of infections, including seriou s infections.

In the long-term safety population, the observations on neutrophil counts were consistent with what was seen in the placebo-controlled clinical studies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Decreased platelet count

In the pre-rescue placebo-controlled population, decreases in platelet counts less than 100,000 per mm3occurred in 1% and 0.7% of patients on 200 mg and 150 mg KEVZARA + DMARD, respectively, compared to no patients on placebo + DMARD, without associated bleeding events.

In the long-term safety population, the observations on platelet counts were consistent with what was seen in the placebo-controlled clinical studies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Elevated liver enzymes

Liver enzyme elevations in the pre-rescue placebo-controlled population (KEVZARA + DMARD or placebo + DMARD) are summarized in Table 2. In patients experiencing liver enzyme elevation, modification of treatment regimen, such as interruption of KEVZARA or reduction in dose, resulted in decrease or normalization of liver enzymes [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. These elevations were not associated with clinically relevant increases in direct bilirubin, nor were they associated with clinical evidence of hepatitis or hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Alopecia areata: current treatments and new directions [^113Fj8Wc]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Alopecia areata is an autoimmune hair loss disease that is non-scarring and is characterized by chronic inflammation at the hair follicle level. Clinically, patients' presentation varies from patchy, circumscribed scalp involvement to total body and scalp hair loss. Current management is guided by the degree of scalp and body involvement, with topical and intralesional steroid injections as primarily first-line for mild cases and broad immunosuppressants as the mainstay for more severe cases. Until recently, the limited number of blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials for this disease had made establishing an evidence-based treatment paradigm challenging. However, growing insights into the pathogenesis of alopecia areata through blood and tissue analysis of human lesions have identified several promising targets for therapy. T-helper (Th) 1/interferon skewing has traditionally been described as the driver of disease; however, recent investigations suggest activation of additional immune mediators, including the Th2 pathway, interleukin (IL)-9, IL-23, and IL-32, as contributors to alopecia areata pathogenesis. The landscape of alopecia areata treatment has the potential to be transformed, as several novel targeted drugs are currently undergoing clinical trials. Given the recent US FDA approval of baricitinib and ritlecitinib, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors are a promising drug class for treating severe alopecia areata cases. This article will review the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of current treatments for alopecia areata, and will provide an overview of the emerging therapies that are leading the revolution in the management of this challenging disease.

### Sarilumab: review of a second IL-6 receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^116hUtAR]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Major Objectives: To review the efficacy, safety, and economics of sarilumab, an interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antagonist, in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Data Sources

PubMed (1966 to January 2018), Clinicaltrials.gov (January 2018), and Scopus (1970 to January 2018) were searched using sarilumab, Kevzara, REGN88, and SAR153191.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Human studies published in peer-reviewed publications in English were the primary sources for efficacy and safety.

Data Synthesis

Data from randomized, double-blind, controlled, published clinical studies weeks demonstrated statistically significantly higher American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20, ACR50, and Disease Activity Score-28 (DAS28) remission response rates and improvements in DAS28 and Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index scores for sarilumab monotherapy versus adalimumab monotherapy (P < 0.05) and for sarilumab versus placebo in patients receiving methotrexate or other conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs); P < 0.05. The ACR20 and ACR50 response rates were, respectively, 56–72% and 35–46% for sarilumab, 58% and 30% for adalimumab, and 33–34% and 15–18% for placebo. DAS28 remission rates were 20–34% for sarilumab, 7% for adalimumab, and 7–10% for placebo. Sarilumab has a higher risk for neutropenia than tocilizumab, the other IL-6 inhibitor, but a lower risk for dyslipidemia, injection site reactions, and gastrointestinal perforation. The acquisition costs of sarilumab are expected to be similar to those of most other biologic DMARDs.

Conclusion

Sarilumab is an alternative to biologic DMARDs or targeted synthetic DMARDs in patients with moderate to severely active RA who have not responded adequately to prior conventional synthetic DMARDs or tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors.

Lipid Abnormalities

Lipid parameters (LDL, HDL, and triglycerides) were first assessed at 4 weeks following initiation of KEVZARA + DMARDs in the placebo-controlled population. Increases were observed at this time point with no additional increases observed thereafter. Changes in lipid parameters from baseline to Week 4 are summarized below:

Mean LDL increased by 12 mg/dL in the KEVZARA 150 mg every two weeks + DMARD group and 16 mg/dL in the KEVZARA 200 mg every two weeks + DMARD group.
Mean triglycerides increased by 20 mg/dL in the KEVZARA 150 mg every two weeks + DMARD group and 27 mg/dL in the KEVZARA 200 mg every two weeks + DMARD group.
Mean HDL increased by 3 mg/dL in both the KEVZARA 150 mg every two weeks + DMARD and KEVZARA 200 mg every two weeks + DMARD groups.

In the long-term safety population, the observations in lipid parameters were consistent with what was observed in the placebo-controlled clinical studies.

Malignancies

In the 52-week placebo-controlled population, 9 malignancies (exposure-adjusted event rate of 1.0 event per 100 patient-years) were diagnosed in patients receiving KEVZARA + DMARD compared to 4 malignancies in patients in the control group (exposure-adjusted event rate of 1.0 event per 100 patient-years).

In the long-term safety population, the rate of malignancies was consistent with the rate observed in the placebo-controlled period [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Other Adverse Reactions

Adverse reactions occurring in 2% or more of patients on KEVZARA + DMARD and greater than those observed in patients on placebo + DMARD are summarized in Table 3.

Medically relevant adverse reactions occurring at an incidence less than 2% in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with KEVZARA in controlled studies was oral herpes.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

7.1 Use with Other Drugs

Population pharmacokinetic analyses did not detect any effect of methotrexate (MTX) on sarilumab clearance. KEVZARA has not been investigated in combination with JAK inhibitors or biological DMARDs such as TNF antagonists [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

7.2 Interactions with CYP450 Substrates

Various in vitro and limited in vivo human studies have shown that cytokines and cytokine modulators can influence the expression and activity of specific cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and therefore have the potential to alter the pharmacokinetics of concomitantly administered drugs that are substrates of these enzymes. Elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentration may down-regulate CYP activity such as in patients with RA and hence increase drug levels compared to subjects without RA. Blockade of IL-6 signaling by IL-6Rα antagonists such as KEVZARA might reverse the inhibitory effect of IL-6 and restore CYP activity, leading to altered drug concentrations.

The modulation of IL-6 effect on CYP enzymes by KEVZARA may be clinically relevant for CYP substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, where the dose is individually adjusted. Upon initiation or discontinuation of KEVZARA, in patients being treated with CYP substrate medicinal products, perform therapeutic monitoring of effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., theophylline) and adjust the individual dose of the medicinal product as needed.

Exercise caution when co-administering KEVZARA with CYP3A4 substrate drugs where decrease in effectiveness is undesirable, e.g., oral contraceptives, lovastatin, atorvastatin, etc. The effect of KEVZARA on CYP450 enzyme activity may persist for several weeks after stopping therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3 Live Vaccines

Avoid concurrent use of live vaccines during treatment with KEVZARA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

### Alopecia as an adverse event of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies: clinical evidence and outcomes [^116x4HRA]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Immunotherapy utilizing immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) such as PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 inhibitors has revolutionized cancer therapy by enhancing T cell recognition and attack against cancer cells.1 Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are a limitation of ICI therapy, encompassing various manifestations such as colitis and cutaneous adverse events such as dermatitis, alopecia, and vitiligo.2 Hair loss is a common concern of cancer patients as they embark on their therapeutic paths. The evidence on alopecia from isolated clinical trials with ICI therapies is limited and largely lacks diagnostic and prognostic details to help guide patients.3,4 In this systematic review, we examined the types of alopecia as part of the irAEs of ICI therapy, timing of onset, prognosis, and treatment approaches. Our analysis includes 19 studies describing new-onset non-scarring or scarring alopecia following ICI treatment. Alopecia was a rare adverse event in the setting of ICIs (n = 26) with the onset of alopecia occurring within one year of initiating treatment. Slightly over half of the affected patients reported some degree of hair regrowth after attempted alopecia-directed treatments. We discuss available data to increase awareness of this rare but potentially permanent side effect of ICI therapy. Further research is warranted to enhance our understanding of alopecia as an irAE and to optimize patient management strategies. J Drugs Dermatol. 2025;24(3):255–260. doi:10.36849/JDD.7828.

### Patient-reported hair loss and its impacts as measured by the alopecia areata patient priority outcomes instrument in patients treated with ritlecitinib: the ALLEGRO phase 2b / 3 randomized clinical trial [^114z42Bg]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Hair Loss

At baseline, the proportion of patients with an AAPPO scalp hair loss score of 2 to 4 (moderate to complete hair loss) was ≥ 95% across all treatment groups; between 73 and 77% of patients reported moderate to complete eyebrow hair loss, 62–69% reported moderate to complete eyelash hair loss, and 71–77% reported moderate to complete body hair loss (Table 1). At week 24, all ritlecitinib treatment groups that were planned to be tested against placebo had a significantly greater proportion of patients with improved patient-reported hair loss AAPPO scores from baseline for scalp, eyebrows, and eyelashes versus placebo (Fig. 2). The comparison versus placebo for improvement in the AAPPO body hair loss item score at week 24 was statistically significant for the ritlecitinib groups that received a loading dose of 200 mg but not for the ritlecitinib groups that did not receive a loading dose. From weeks 24 to 48, the ritlecitinib 30-, 50-, 200/30-, and 200/50-mg groups showed increases in the proportion of patients with improved hair loss scores for the four hair loss items (except eyelashes in the 200/30-mg group) (Fig. 2). The proportion of patients with improvement in the four hair loss items of the AAPPO was generally similar when assessed at week 48 in patients initially randomized to placebo who switched to ritlecitinib 200/50 or 50 mg at week 24 compared with results at week 24 in patients initially randomized to the same ritlecitinib dose, respectively (50 mg and 200/50 mg).

### Investigative guidelines for alopecia areata [^112tCBjL]. Dermatologic Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

The reported efficacy of various treatments for alopecia is difficult to compare based on a general lack of consideration in case reports/series and clinical trials of the spontaneous regrowth or baseline prognostic factors seen in alopecia areata and a general lack of quantification of hair growth. This report will give both the investigator and clinician guidelines for clinical trial design that will take into account variables known to effect efficacy results such as baseline severity, pattern, and duration of hair loss, age of the subject, and concomitant conditions that may impact on potential regrowth. Reliable methods of assessment of efficacy and response criteria that will enable direct comparison of results between agents will also be discussed.

### Patient-reported hair loss and its impacts as measured by the alopecia areata patient priority outcomes instrument in patients treated with ritlecitinib: the ALLEGRO phase 2b / 3 randomized clinical trial [^115AnbFW]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The ALLEGRO phase 2b/3 study investigated the efficacy and safety of ritlecitinib in patients with alopecia areata (AA).

Objective

To describe the impact of ritlecitinib on patient-reported hair loss using the Alopecia Areata Patient Priority Outcomes (AAPPO) instrument and evaluate the relationship between clinically meaningful hair regrowth and improvements in patient-reported impacts.

Methods

In ALLEGRO-2b/3, patients aged ≥ 12 years with AA and ≥ 50% scalp hair loss received once-daily ritlecitinib 50 or 30 mg (± 4-week 200-mg daily loading dose), 10 mg, or placebo for 24 weeks and then continued ritlecitinib or switched from placebo to ritlecitinib 200/50 or 50 mg for 24 weeks. The AAPPO instrument evaluated improvement in hair loss, emotional symptoms (ES), and activity limitations (AL) from weeks 4 to 48 (secondary endpoint). Mean changes in ES and AL domain scores and individual items at weeks 24 and 48 were calculated for Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score ≤ 20 responders and nonresponders (exploratory endpoint).

Results

Overall, 718 patients were randomized. At week 24, 5–36% of patients receiving ritlecitinib 10–200/50 mg reported improvement in scalp hair loss versus 9% receiving placebo. The results for eyebrow, eyelash, and body hair loss were similar. Mean change from baseline in ES and AL scores at weeks 24 and 48 was small and similar between groups. Mean change was larger for individual hair loss and ES items at weeks 24 and 48 in SALT score ≤ 20 responders versus nonresponders.

Conclusions

The AAPPO instrument demonstrated the beneficial impact of ritlecitinib on patient-reported hair growth, which was consistent with improvements in clinician-reported outcomes.

### COVID-19 vaccination related exacerbations of hair loss in patients with moderate-to-severe alopecia areata on systemic therapy [^115Hvtrd]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Although an association between hair loss and COVID-19 vaccinations may be present, these exacerbation events are infrequent. The benefits from COVID-19 vaccinations considerably outweigh the theoretical risk of autoimmune flares among susceptible individuals. Additional large-scale studies with diverse patient populations are needed to broaden our understanding of immune-mediated, postvaccination adverse effects.

### The adverse effects profile of teprotumumab [^115uCGSw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Context

Teprotumumab therapy for thyroid eye disease (TED) patients represents a major step forward. It targets and inhibits the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), and its effectiveness is based on its interconnectedness with the thyrotropin receptor. However, IGF-1R has a ubiquitous expression and several adverse effects have been reported with teprotumumab use.

Objective

Describing these adverse effects for better understanding is the purpose of this review.

Methods

We reviewed the oncological studies in which teprotumumab was initially used. Subsequently we reviewed the clinical trials for TED and then the case series and case reports associated with teprotumumab use since it is US Food and Drug Administration approval (January 2020). We focused on common and/or serious adverse effects reported with the use of teprotumumab.

Results

We described the common occurrence of hyperglycemia (10%-30% incidence), its risk factors and suggested management. Hearing changes are described, a broad spectrum from mild ear pressure to hearing loss (sensorineural mechanism). Risk factors, suggested monitoring, and possible upcoming therapies are reviewed. We also reviewed data on fatigue, muscle spasms, hair loss, weight loss, gastrointestinal disturbances, menstrual changes, and infusion reactions. We noted some discrepancies between adverse effects in oncological studies vs studies focused on TED, and we aimed to explain these differences.

Conclusion

The use of teprotumumab should consider patient's values and preferences in balancing the expected benefit with these potential risks. Future drugs targeting IGF-1R should investigate these adverse effects for a possible class effect. Combination therapies with different agents hopefully will be identified that maximize benefits and minimize risks.

### Alopecia as an emerging adverse event to CGRP monoclonal antibodies: cases series, evaluation of FAERS, and literature review [^115kDjqF]. Cephalalgia (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Alopecia is associated with erenumab post-marketing, but no cases have been described.

Methods

We describe two patients that reported temporary hair loss and review the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).

Results

The first patient experienced alopecia within three months of starting erenumab, which did not improve with ongoing use or transition to fremanezumab. The second patient reported alopecia within two weeks of starting erenumab, which continued after transition to galcanezumab; months later, there was also recurrent hair loss within one month of starting fremanzeumab. According to FAERS (last accessed 18 August 2022), alopecia was reported most with erenumab (1158), followed by galcanezumab (554), fremanezumab (175), eptinezumab (23), rimegepant (26), ubrogepant (4), and atogepant (3).

Conclusion

Most events were reported in women and non-serious. The potential mechanism of alopecia with drugs targeting calcitonin gene-related peptide or its receptor possibly includes disruptions in the microvascular circulation and other homeostatic mechanisms.

### Spectrum and impact of reported side effects of omalizumab in patients with chronic urticaria: a long-term multicentre real-world study [^112BPYMz]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

While no new notably prevalent side effects were reported, hair loss was reported by 2.9% of patients. Hair loss was never reported in RCTs before and has only been described in eight CU and one asthma patient treated with omalizumab, with physical examination showing telogen effluvium (n = 3) or alopecia areata (n = 2). Unfortunately, due to the retrospective design of this study, the type of hair loss could not be specified. While hair loss was transient in most cases described in literature, we observed in the present study that it led to treatment adjustment in 21.1% of patients, indicating a relatively high burden of this side effect. Although it is speculated that omalizumab might induce hair loss, it is important to consider other potential causes such as infections, anaemia, or concomitant thyroid disease, which were not investigated in all patients with hair loss. Regardless, awareness of this specific side effect is important, as hair loss complaints may affect patients' quality of life on top of the CU symptoms.

Interestingly, we observed that patients reporting side effects had worse disease control before the initiation of omalizumab treatment, were less often fast responders, more often required higher dosages, and more often had partial/non‐response to omalizumab at the end of treatment. It is important to note that a causal relationship cannot be determined, as the timing of reported side effects in relation to omalizumab up‐dosing and response is unknown, and treatment duration was variable per patient. However, altogether, these results may suggest a potential association between the reporting of side effects and (a tendency towards) insufficient omalizumab response. This finding might partially be attributed to the nocebo effect. It is possible that patients with insufficient treatment response tend to experience and report more side effects due to a perceived negative association with the drug, which has been described previously in several placebo‐controlled trials. However, it is unknown whether patients with good response experience side effects less often or do not feel the need to address this. Nonetheless, it is important to be aware of the association between reported side effects and insufficient omalizumab response, as these patients may suffer from a double burden: uncontrolled CU symptoms and side effects.

### Alopecia areata [^116R5y4G]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2025). High credibility.

Alopecia areata is a common cause of non-scaring autoimmune hair loss, associated with substantial psychosocial burden. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease in which loss of immune privilege in hair follicles leads to local hair follicle-associated inflammation. A chronic disease with uncertain course that is estimated to affect 2% of people over their lifetime, alopecia areata can present with a range of clinical features, from a single small round patch of hair loss to full scalp and body hair loss, and is associated with atopic, autoimmune and psychological comorbidities. Alopecia areata also has a major negative impact on quality of life, with a greater mental burden than physical burden. Since the 2010s, advances in understanding of disease pathogenesis have led to the identification of inflammatory pathways that can be successfully inhibited to produce substantial clinical responses. The therapeutic landscape has been transformed, with FDA approval of the first treatment for adults with severe alopecia areata in 2022 and for adolescents with severe alopecia areata in 2023, with multiple investigational treatments currently in phase II and phase III clinical trials.

### Favourable effect of a' second hit' after 13 weeks in early RA non-responders: the amsterdam COBRA Treat-to-target randomized trial [^115NCShH]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Adverse events

Adverse events (AEs) were frequent: in 26 weeks, a total of 699 AEs were observed in the 150 high-risk patients (Table 4) and 113 in the 40 low-risk patients (Supplementary Table S2, available at Rheumatology online): a mean of 4.7 and 2.8 per patient, respectively. SAEs were only reported in 8 high-risk and 1 low-risk patient in the first 13 weeks, and in 1 high-risk responder, but none were reported in randomized patients. All SAEs were related to hospital admission (Table 4; Supplementary Table S2, available at Rheumatology online).

Table 4.
(Serious) adverse events [(S)AEs] in the high-risk group (worsening of RA): before and after randomization (weeks 0–13, respectively 14–26), and in patients who were excluded from the week 26 analyses. All patients with a SAE were admitted to the hospital

In the high-risk group, CNS-related side effects, flushes, weight gain, fatigue, and hair loss occurred more frequently than in the low-risk group: no difference was found in cardiovascular events and infections (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4, available at Rheumatology online). After randomization, in the high-risk group intensification resulted in more AEs than continuation: mean AEs per patient 3.7 vs 2.4 (P < 0.01). In the small low-risk group, intensification resulted in less AEs than continuation: mean per patient 1.3 vs 2.9 (P = not significant).

Violations

In the first 13 weeks, 27 treatment violations occurred in the high-risk group (18%) and 8 in the low-risk group (20%; Supplementary Tables S5 and S6, available at Rheumatology online). Of all patients with violations, 8 high-risk patients and 4 low-risk patients were non-responders and subsequently randomized. After randomization, 18 high-risk patients (58%) had protocol violations related to the intensity of the study treatment, 11 in the intensification group and 7 in the continuation group (Supplementary Table S5, available at Rheumatology online). In the low-risk group, 8 patients (53%) had protocol violations related to the intensity of the study treatment, 4 in the intensification group and 4 in the continuation group (Supplementary Table S5, available at Rheumatology online).

### Drug-induced alopecia after dupilumab therapy [^11415qT1]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dupilumab is a selectively immunosuppressive biologic therapy that treats chronic moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis through inhibiting signaling transmission of interleukins (IL) 4 and 13. It is often prescribed when patients do not respond to or cannot tolerate conventional topical or systemic therapies. Most commonly reported side effects include injection site reactions, eye and eyelid inflammation, and nasopharyngitis. This case report highlights a patient who experienced drug-induced alopecia at 18 weeks on dupilumab.

### Dermatologic events from EGFR inhibitors: the issue of the missing patient voice [^115JV1Fk]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

(3) Provide insights into acceptance of (severe) skin toxicities compared with other AEs

Because studies have focused on dAEs, the impact of these events on QOL compared with that of other AEs has been insufficiently investigated. The same concern applies to patient acceptance of dAEs compared with other AEs. Such information could be quite easily gathered, for example, through paired-comparison methodologies, with the patient asked to select the most bothersome AE from two options, or to select one therapy among several treatment options that differ only regarding their AEs (e.g. severe skin rash vs hair loss vs fatigue/tiredness vs nausea/vomiting). To get valid results, it will be important to conduct such a survey with patients with cancer who have been treated with EGFR inhibitors and who already experienced dAEs. Conducting the same exercise with treating physicians would provide insights about differences between physicians' and patients' perception of the burden of AEs. For example, physicians observing dAEs with different grades among many patients might overestimate the bothersome impact of dAEs compared with patients.

Acitretin in psoriasis — use context, teratogenicity, and dosing are outlined: Of the systemic therapies, acitretin is the least effective as monotherapy and is therefore often used in conjunction with ultraviolet (UV) B or psoralen plus UVA (PUVA) phototherapy, and because acitretin is nonimmunosuppressive, it has also been used in combination with biologic therapies. Acitretin's major side effect is teratogenicity, limiting use to male and female patients of nonchildbearing potential. At high doses, it may cause significant mucocutaneous effects with hair loss; although it can occasionally be dosed at 50 mg daily, most clinicians use doses between 10 and 25 mg per day. To minimize cumulative organ toxicity, rotational therapy was developed so patients could rotate among agents or to phototherapy or photochemotherapy, and with the advent of biologic therapies, rotational therapy is less commonly used.

Hair changes with EGFRI therapy — patterns and management: Reported changes include trichomegaly, hypertrichosis, and scalp hair changes from brittleness and slowed growth to alopecia; nonscarring alopecia occurs after 2–3 months of therapy and may progress to diffuse alopecia with prolonged therapy and may resolve spontaneously in some patients, generally resolving after discontinuation though regrowth quality may vary. No interventions to reduce or prevent nonscarring alopecia in these patients have been published, and recommended interventions are supportive, while minoxidil has been found effective for treating non-scarring alopecia in the general patient population with males' subjective increased hair growth statistically significant for both the 2% and 5%.

### Alopecia areata after denosumab treatment for osteoporosis [^113ZQBTo]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Perhaps both mechanisms suggested participate in our case; the autoimmune mechanism led to AA and the absence of RANK stimulation prevented new anagen initiation leading to the persistent disease course. Complete clinical remission of scalp psoriasis observed in our case raises a thought about testing the effect of RANK inhibitors on psoriasis. According to published records, side effects associated with denosumab include musculoskeletal pain, arthralgia, cystitis, and nasopharyngitis. Regarding the impact of denosumab on hair, in the phase 1 trial hair loss was observed in 11% of Japanese women treated for breast cancer–related bone metastases. However, the study does not specify the type of hair loss, and all participants received concurrent chemotherapy or hormonal therapy. Therefore, hair loss may not have been related to treatment with denosumab. So far, we did not find previous reports of AA after treatment with denosumab. Physicians treating their patients with different biologic medications should be aware of potential paradoxical autoimmune side effects including the development of AA.

### Using patient preference to inform ritlecitinib dose selection for alopecia areata treatment [^113wWipY]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

EU‐ and less risk‐tolerant US‐patient samples accepted a relatively high level of any combination of 3‐year risks in exchange for the increase in benefit of ritlecitinib 50 mg over 30 mg, and this exceeded the difference in risk between the two doses in multiple scenario analyses. Therefore, the incremental net benefit of the 50‐mg dose compared with the 30‐mg dose was positive.

These results are not surprising given that AA‐associated hair loss has a major impact on patient identity and mental health. AA is associated with reduced QoL and a large psychosocial burden; patients often report stigma in their daily lives. Because of this burden, patients place high value on treatments that can induce hair growth and are willing to accept serious potential risks in exchange. The absolute percent increase in risk that patients were willing to tolerate in exchange for the increase in benefit associated with increasing ritlecitinib dose from 30 mg to 50 mg was greater than any estimated increase in actual 3‐year risk between the two doses. Specifically, adult patients with AA were willing to accept increases in safety risks of serious infection, cancer, and thromboembolism with a higher dose of ritlecitinib (50 mg over 30 mg) for increased probabilities of scalp, eyebrow, and eyelash hair regrowth. This study demonstrates that patient preference data can inform optimal treatment dose selection to support patient‐centric medicinal product development decisions, regulatory benefit–risk assessment, and physician and patient shared decision‐making.

### Alopecia areata as an immune-related adverse event of immune checkpoint inhibitors: a review [^11478iYE]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) improve the ability of the immune system to target cancer cells by blocking signaling through either the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death (PD-1) receptor, or its ligand (PD-L1). They have been found to cause a variety of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) including a form of nonscarring alopecia that resembles alopecia areata (AA) in presentation and histology. Clinical features of ICI-induced AA are poorly described. We queried the Pubmed database for cases of AA secondary to ICI use reporting on extent of hair loss, treatments attempted, alopecia outcome, and time of follow-up with 13 cases identified. Although most patients had localized hair loss with subsequent regrowth, four of them experienced extensive and persistent AA, lasting up to a year. All but one patient continued ICI after the onset of hair loss. Many used topical corticosteroids with varying outcomes. Possible prognostic factors for severe and persistent disease may include young age and male sex. However, the low number of reported cases limits the generalizability of these findings. Tumor response was positive in every case of immune-induced AA where it was reported. Further investigation will be needed to better characterize clinical features of this irAE, risk factors for persistent disease, and determine its optimal management.

### Ivarmacitinib for the treatment of adults with severe alopecia areata: results from a phase 3 trial [^111CJn6t]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Ivarmacitinib, a selective Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitor, demonstrated efficacy in a phase 2 trial for moderate-to-severe alopecia areata (AA).

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ivarmacitinib in adults with severe AA (≥ 50% scalp hair loss, including alopecia totalis/universalis).

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial, 330 patients were assigned (1:1:1) to ivarmacitinib 4 mg, 8 mg, or placebo once daily for 24 weeks. Placebo recipients were re-randomized to ivarmacitinib for a 28-week extension. The primary endpoint was the proportion achieving a Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score ≤ 20 at Week 24.

Results

At Week 24, SALT ≤ 20 was achieved by 34.9% (4 mg), 40.6% (8 mg), and 9.0% (placebo). Absolute differences versus placebo were 25.6% (95% CI: 15.4–35.7) for 4 mg and 31.6% (21.5–41.8) for 8 mg (both p < 0.0001). Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 77.1%, 84.7%, and 75.5% of patients, respectively; most were mild or moderate. No deaths, major cardiovascular events, or thromboembolic events were reported.

Limitation

No active comparator was used.

Conclusion

Once-daily ivarmacitinib 4 mg or 8 mg resulted in meaningful hair regrowth and demonstrated an acceptable safety profile in patients with severe AA.

### Alopecia areata: new treatment options including Janus kinase inhibitors [^115UJE2T]. Dermatologic Clinics (2021). Medium credibility.

Alopecia areata (AA) is a chronic, relapsing, autoimmune disorder characterized by patchy nonscaring hair loss. Although the pathogenesis of alopecia areata is not yet completely elucidated, loss of immune privilege in anagen stage hair follicles is widely accepted to play a key role. Several cytokines that depend on Janus kinase signaling have been identified to be involved in AA, including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7, IL-15, IL-21, and interferon-γ, making Janus kinase inhibitors an attractive therapeutic target. Available information indicates that about 70% of patients with AA experience significant regrowth, but interruption of treatment is associated with disease recurrence.

Background

Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune form of hair loss with limited treatments.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Janus kinase inhibitors ritlecitinib and brepocitinib in patients who have AA with ≥ 50% scalp hair loss.

Methods

Patients were randomized to once-daily ritlecitinib, brepocitinib, or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was a 24-week change from baseline in the Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score. The key secondary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving 30% improvement in SALT score (SALT 30).

Results

The ritlecitinib, brepocitinib, and placebo groups included 48, 47, and 47 patients, respectively. At week 24, least-squares mean difference from placebo in SALT score change from baseline was 31.1 (95% confidence interval, 18.8–43.5) for ritlecitinib and 49.2 (95% CI, 36.6–61.7) for brepocitinib (P < .0001 for both comparisons with placebo). SALT 30 was achieved by 50% (90% CI, 38%-62%) of patients receiving ritlecitinib, 64% (90% CI, 51%-75%) receiving brepocitinib, and 2% (90% CI, 0%-9%) receiving placebo. Two patients experienced a serious adverse event (rhabdomyolysis) in the brepocitinib group only.

Limitations

Only a single-dosage regimen of each study drug was included.

Conclusion

Treatment with ritlecitinib or brepocitinib for 24 weeks was efficacious and generally well tolerated.

Other safety findings

Malignancies occurred in 22 patients (1.9%; 0.6 events per 100 PY). The most common malignancies (occurring in > 1 patient) were basal cell carcinoma (n = 4; 0.4%), malignant melanoma (n = 3; 0.3%) and breast cancer (n = 2; 0.2%). There were five confirmed cases of gastrointestinal perforation (0.1 events per 100 PY): two upper and three lower (online supplementary table 3). Lipid elevations were reported in 149 patients treated with any dose of sarilumab (13.1%; 5.6 events per 100 PY) and included increased levels of total cholesterol (n = 15; 1.3%; 0.5 events per 100 PY), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (n = 12; 1%; 0.4 events per 100 PY) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (n = 2; 0.2%; < 0.1 events per 100 PY). There were 13 MACE (1.1%; 0.3 events per 100 PY), which consisted of cardiovascular death (n = 5), myocardial infarction (n = 4) and stroke (n = 4). Thromboembolic events (as reported by the investigators and evaluated post hoc; not a prespecified AESI) occurred at a rate of 0.9 per 100 PY.

Personalised medicine is a key goal across medical specialties today: using biomarkers and knowledge of pathophysiology to ensure the right patients get the right treatment. This becomes more challenging when patients have more than one disease requiring a targeted treatment. Autoimmune diseases commonly co-occur, and thus, multidisciplinary working is important in rheumatology. We present a case where a patient with a new diagnosis of alopecia areata on a background of rheumatoid arthritis was successfully treated with baricitinib monotherapy, with improvement in both conditions.

2.4 Dosage Recommendations in Alopecia Areata

The recommended dosage of OLUMIANT is 2 mg once daily orally, with or without food. Increase to 4 mg once daily if the response to treatment is not adequate.

For patients with nearly complete or complete scalp hair loss, with or without substantial eyelash or eyebrow hair loss, consider treating with 4 mg once daily, with or without food.

Once patients achieve an adequate response to treatment with 4 mg, decrease the dosage to 2 mg once daily.

2.5 Dosage Modifications Due to Infections, Cytopenias and Anemia

Rheumatoid Arthritis and Alopecia Areata

Avoid use of OLUMIANT in patients with active, serious or opportunistic infection, including localized infections. If a patient develops a serious infection hold treatment with OLUMIANT until the infection is controlled [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Dosage modifications for patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata and cytopenias or anemia are described in Table 1.

COVID-19

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of new infections during treatment with OLUMIANT. The risks and benefits of treatment with OLUMIANT in COVID-19 patients with other concurrent infections should be considered [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Dosage modifications for patients with COVID-19 and cytopenias are described in Table 2.

### Treatments for alopecia areata: a network meta-analysis [^117PEnwN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease leading to nonscarring hair loss on the scalp or body. There are different treatments including immunosuppressants, hair growth stimulants, and contact immunotherapy.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of the treatments for alopecia areata (AA), alopecia totalis (AT), and alopecia universalis (AU) in children and adults.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP were searched up to July 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated classical immunosuppressants, biologics, small molecule inhibitors, contact immunotherapy, hair growth stimulants, and other therapies in paediatric and adult populations with AA.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard procedures expected by Cochrane including assessment of risks of bias using RoB2 and the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. The primary outcomes were short-term hair regrowth ≥ 75% (between 12 and 26 weeks of follow-up), and incidence of serious adverse events. The secondary outcomes were long-term hair regrowth ≥ 75% (greater than 26 weeks of follow-up) and health-related quality of life. We could not perform a network meta-analysis as very few trials compared the same treatments. We presented direct comparisons and made a narrative description of the findings.

Main Results

We included 63 studies that tested 47 different treatments in 4817 randomised participants. All trials used a parallel-group design except one that used a cross-over design. The mean sample size was 78 participants. All trials recruited outpatients from dermatology clinics. Participants were between 2 and 74 years old. The trials included patients with AA (n = 25), AT (n = 1), AU (n = 1), mixed cases (n = 31), and unclear types of alopecia (n = 4). Thirty-three out of 63 studies (52.3%) reported the proportion of participants achieving short-term hair regrowth ≥ 75% (between 12 and 26 weeks). Forty-seven studies (74.6%) reported serious adverse events and only one study (1.5%) reported health-related quality of life. Five studies (7.9%) reported the proportion of participants with long-term hair regrowth ≥ 75% (greater than 26 weeks). Amongst the variety of interventions found, we prioritised some groups of interventions for their relevance to clinical practice: systemic therapies (classical immunosuppressants, biologics, and small molecule inhibitors), and local therapies (intralesional corticosteroids, topical small molecule inhibitors, contact immunotherapy, hair growth stimulants and cryotherapy). Considering only the prioritised interventions, 14 studies from 12 comparisons reported short-term hair regrowth ≥ 75% and 22 studies from 10 comparisons reported serious adverse events (18 reported zero events and 4 reported at least one). One study (1 comparison) reported quality of life, and two studies (1 comparison) reported long-term hair regrowth ≥ 75%. For the main outcome of short-term hair regrowth ≥ 75%, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of oral prednisolone or cyclosporine versus placebo (RR 4.68, 95% CI 0.57 to 38.27; 79 participants; 2 studies; very low-certainty evidence), intralesional betamethasone or triamcinolone versus placebo (RR 13.84, 95% CI 0.87 to 219.76; 231 participants; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence), oral ruxolitinib versus oral tofacitinib (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.52; 80 participants; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence), diphencyprone or squaric acid dibutil ester versus placebo (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.71; 99 participants; 1 study; very-low-certainty evidence), diphencyprone or squaric acid dibutyl ester versus topical minoxidil (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.71; 99 participants; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence), diphencyprone plus topical minoxidil versus diphencyprone (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.13 to 3.44; 30 participants; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence), topical minoxidil 1% and 2% versus placebo (RR 2.31, 95% CI 1.34 to 3.96; 202 participants; 2 studies; very low-certainty evidence) and cryotherapy versus fractional CO2 laser (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.86; 80 participants; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests oral betamethasone may increase short-term hair regrowth ≥ 75% compared to prednisolone or azathioprine (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.88; 80 participants; 2 studies; low-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference between subcutaneous dupilumab and placebo in short-term hair regrowth ≥ 75% (RR 3.59, 95% CI 0.19 to 66.22; 60 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence) as well as between topical ruxolitinib and placebo (RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.25 to 100.89; 78 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence). However, baricitinib results in an increase in short-term hair regrowth ≥ 75% when compared to placebo (RR 7.54, 95% CI 3.90 to 14.58; 1200 participants; 2 studies; high-certainty evidence). For the incidence of serious adverse events, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of topical ruxolitinib versus placebo (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.94; 78 participants; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). Baricitinib and apremilast may result in little to no difference in the incidence of serious adverse events versus placebo (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.60 to 3.60; 1224 participants; 3 studies; low-certainty evidence). The same result is observed for subcutaneous dupilumab compared to placebo (RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.07 to 36.11; 60 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence). For health-related quality of life, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of oral cyclosporine compared to placebo (MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.07; very low-certainty evidence). Baricitinib results in an increase in long-term hair regrowth ≥ 75% compared to placebo (RR 8.49, 95% CI 4.70 to 15.34; 1200 participants; 2 studies; high-certainty evidence). Regarding the risk of bias, the most relevant issues were the lack of details about randomisation and allocation concealment, the limited efforts to keep patients and assessors unaware of the assigned intervention, and losses to follow-up.

Authors' Conclusions

We found that treatment with baricitinib results in an increase in short- and long-term hair regrowth compared to placebo. Although we found inconclusive results for the risk of serious adverse effects with baricitinib, the reported small incidence of serious adverse events in the baricitinib arm should be balanced with the expected benefits. We also found that the impact of other treatments on hair regrowth is very uncertain. Evidence for health-related quality of life is still scant.

### Effective treatment of alopecia universalis with oral upadacitinib [^116nFFau]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alopecia areata (AA) is a noncicatricial form of hair loss. While reversible, AA is characterized by substantial disease burden and psychosocial impairment. Patients currently have no curative therapies to effectively treat their physical and mental concerns. Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKIs) have been showing positive results in several AA trials. Upadacitinib is a selective JAK-1 inhibitor used to treat moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis unresponsive to first-line therapies.

### Using patient preference to inform ritlecitinib dose selection for alopecia areata treatment [^113WNRET]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

The preference survey was administered to adult patients (n = 201) with physician‐confirmed ≥ 50% scalp hair loss due to AA in the United States (n = 62) and the EU (n = 139). As previously reported, the median age of adult respondents was 39 years (interquartile range [IQR], 29–52 years). A total of 111 (55%) respondents had an AA diagnosis for > 5 years, and 188 (94%) respondents reported moderate to complete scalp hair loss.

In the ALLEGRO‐2b/3 study, the observed efficacy benefit of ritlecitinib 50 mg exceeded the efficacy benefit of 30 mg. At week 24, 23% of participants who received 50 mg achieved response (SALT score ≤ 20), compared with 14.3% of participants who received 30 mg (Table S1). Similarly, a greater proportion of patients who received 50 mg achieved EBA or ELA responses at week 24 compared with those who received 30 mg (EBA response: 29.0% vs 16.7%; ELA response: 28.9% vs 26.1%).

### Sustained hair regrowth with continued ritlecitinib treatment through week 48 in patients with alopecia areata with or without early target responses: post hoc analysis of the ALLEGRO phase 2b / 3 trial [^116Nz7Wi]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Few treatments for alopecia areata have demonstrated sustained efficacy.

Objective

Evaluate the efficacy and safety of continued ritlecitinib treatment to week 48 in patients with alopecia areata with or without target efficacy responses at week 24.

Methods

Patients aged ≥ 12 years received daily ritlecitinib (± 4-week loading dose): 200/50 mg, 200/30 mg, 50 mg, or 30 mg. Patients with clinical response at week 24, based on a Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score ≤ 20 and ≤ 10, were evaluated for sustained response through week 48. Nonresponders at week 24 were assessed for response through week 48.

Results

Among ritlecitinib-treated patients with SALT score ≤ 20 and ≤ 10 responses at week 24, ≥ 85% and ≥ 68%, respectively, sustained these responses through week 48. Of those with a SALT score > 20 at week 24, 22% to 34% achieved a SALT score ≤ 20 at week 48. Of those with a SALT score > 10 at week 24, 20% to 26% achieved a SALT score ≤ 10 at week 48. Safety was similar across subgroups.

Limitations

Small sample size.

Conclusion

Hair regrowth was sustained through week 48 in patients with response at week 24. Up to one-third of patients who did not meet target efficacy at week 24 achieved response with continued ritlecitinib treatment.

### Remission of alopecia universalis in a patient with atopic dermatitis treated with dupilumab [^115znyxJ]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Patients with AD are at increased risk of AA, with reported odds ratios ranging from 2.6 to 26.3 compared with control groups based on retrospective data and meta-analysis studies. Similarly, patients with early-onset alopecia or severe alopecia have higher rates of AD. AD is primarily driven by Th2 pathway cytokines including IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-31. Recent studies in patients with AA have found both increased circulating plasma and lesional Th1 cytokines, such as interferon-γ and IL-2, along with elevated IL-13 and IL-17, pointing to a multifactorial autoinflammatory pathogenesis. The linked pathway between AD and AA via the Th2 cytokine IL-13 and the immunomodulatory effect of dupilumab may explain our patient's hair regrowth. This finding may be a promising avenue for future therapies. However, more investigation is required to further identify patients with AA who may benefit from IL-4 and IL-13 inhibition, as there has been 1 case report of a patient having AA after initiation of dupilumab, perhaps by the potentiation of a stronger Th1 response. The difference in response time to hair regrowth is also interesting to note, as our patient had a delay of 6 months before any growth compared with patients in prior case reports who noted hair growth at 6 to 12 weeks. Clinical trials studying dupilumab for AA with and without concomitant AD are currently underway.

### Scarring alopecia as an unexpected consequence of immune checkpoint inhibition [^111tSFCd]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

There is uncertainty about the relationship between the use of PD-1 inhibitors and the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The expression of PD-1 and its ligands are dysregulated in lupus; however, the exact repercussions of this dysregulation are not completely understood. A 2019 analysis of the FDA adverse events reporting system for ICIs found that among 4870 reported rheumatic adverse events, 18 cases of SLE were reported, 4 of which were suspected to be associated with pembrolizumab. Ceccarelli et al reported a case of pembrolizumab-induced SLE that started 2 weeks after initiating pembrolizumab for the treatment of lung microcitoma. The patient had a remote history of alopecia areata and developed symmetric polyarthritis, a subacute annular cutaneous rash on her face, cleavage, arms and back. Other lab findings were significant for a positive ANA and hypocomplementemia. Scarring hair loss was not reported amongst the clinical or pathologic exam findings. These findings highlight the potential of anti-PD1 treatment to trigger underlying subclinical autoimmunity, leading to the development of immune-related adverse events with ICI use.

The full spectrum of cutaneous adverse effects caused by ICIs has not been elucidated. This case illustrates the potential development of scarring alopecia with the use of PD-1 inhibitors, specifically pembrolizumab. Early evaluation and biopsy when a patient experiences hair loss in an unusual manner can provide additional clues toward the pathogenesis of alopecias due to ICIs. This can, in turn, help us understand the pathogenesis of alopecias as a whole.

Interleukin-6 inhibitors — sarilumab when tocilizumab is not available: When tocilizumab is not available, for patients who would otherwise qualify for tocilizumab, the IDSA guideline panel suggests sarilumab in addition to standard of care (i.e., steroids) rather than standard of care alone. (Conditional recommendation†, Very low certainty of evidence). Patients, particularly those who respond to steroids alone, who put a high value on avoiding possible adverse events of sarilumab and a low value on the uncertain mortality reduction, would reasonably decline sarilumab.

### Insights from immuno-oncology: the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer statement on access to IL-6-targeting therapies for COVID-19 [^112opD2z]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

One possibility is to encourage the use of IL-6 or IL-6-receptor (IL-6R) blocking antibodies like tocilizumab (Actemra TM, Roche-Genentech), sarilumab (Kevzara TM, Regeneron) and siltuximab (Sylvant TM, EUSA Pharma) that are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for various conditions, including rheumatological disease and the lymphoproliferative disorder Castleman's syndrome. These agents could be used on easily and immediately available compassionate use protocols that could be approved on an emergency basis by all institutional review boards (IRBs) around the world for critically ill patients with COVID-19-induced hypoxia. Tocilizumab also is already FDA approved to manage cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in patients receiving chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy. In addition, tocilizumab has been shown to reduce toxicity in patients treated with ICIs who were steroid refractory, and has been added to the ICI agents ipilimumab and nivolumab in an ongoing US phase II study (NCT03999749) to ameliorate immune-related toxicity. In Castleman's disease, a lymphoproliferative disorder caused by Kaposi's Sarcoma Herpesvirus, a pathogen that produces viral IL-6, tocilizumab has been shown to reduce viral loads. Tocilizumab is also being explored as a potential supportive care measure for the management of CRS in patients with cancer treated with a number of CD3-based bispecific molecules. Now, data from the frontlines of the pandemic indicates that the agent may offer lifesaving benefit for COVID-19 patients with respiratory distress.

### Alopecia areata after dupilumab for atopic dermatitis [^115Ah3Qk]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

We report a temporal relationship between dupilumab and the subsequent development of AA. Of course, temporal cannot be interpreted as causal; however, we cannot rule out this possibility. Reports of AA in patients on dupilumab therapy are absent in the existing medical literature. AA is commonly associated with atopic dermatitis. AD is primarily a type 2 T helper (Th2)-driven disease with increased interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-31. The pathogenesis of AA is not completely understood, but several studies found a heterogeneous process involving T-cell autoantigens, type 1 T helper (Th1)/interferon-γ, Th2, PDE4, IL-23, and IL-9. Because of the similar Th2 cytokine profile between AA and AD, dupilumab may actually be of clinical utility in AA and AD. Yet, the involvement of other immune system mediators, such as Th1, combined with the downregulation of Th2 pathways, may amplify the Th1 pathway and promote the development of AA with dupilumab use. As dupilumab moves into phase IV monitoring, clinicians will need to be aware of any potential adverse reactions that may arise. Despite the associated complication of AA, our patient remains on therapy satisfied with the outcome dupilumab provides and reports overall improved quality of life.

### Shedding light on therapeutics in alopecia and their relevance to COVID-19 [^114vGh4f]. Clinics in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

As of July 9, 2020, there were more than 12 million confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across the globe, with more than 550,000 deaths. Many European countries, including Belgium, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain, have had the highest numbers of fatalities per capita. This indicates the potential for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus to overwhelm even the most advanced health care systems despite extreme societal interventions. Since its emergence, SARS-CoV-2 has disseminated across the globe, affecting the structure of global societies, infrastructure, and economies. Patients with alopecia are a diverse group who, for various indications, are prescribed a number of antimicrobials and antiandrogen treatments in addition to immunomodulatory therapies such as hydroxychloroquine, oral corticosteroids, and a range of broad immunosuppressants. These drugs are being scrutinized for their capacity to potentially affect SARS-CoV-2 outcomes. We examine these treatments and highlight the critical role that patient registries will play in generating real-world evidence to assess their impact on COVID-19 outcomes.

### Effect of tocilizumab, sarilumab, and baricitinib on mortality among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 treated with corticosteroids: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113sX7iC]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Randomized controlled trials (RCT) established the mortality reduction by tocilizumab (Actemra), baricitinib (Olumiant), and sarilumab (Kevzara) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. However, uncertainty remains about which treatment performs best in patients receiving corticosteroids.

Objectives

To estimate probabilities of noninferiority between baricitinib and sarilumab compared to tocilizumab in patients treated with corticosteroids.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and MedRxiv.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Eligible RCTs assigning hospitalized adults with COVID-19 treated with corticosteroids to tocilizumab or baricitinib or sarilumab versus standard of care or placebo (control).

Methods

Reviewers independently abstracted published data and assessed study quality with the Risk of Bias 2 tool. Unpublished data, if required, were requested from authors of included studies. The outcome of interest was all-cause mortality at 28 days.

Participants

Twenty-seven RCTs with 13 549 patients were included. Overall, the risk of bias was low. Bayesian pairwise meta-analyses were used to aggregate results of each treatment versus control. The average odds ratio for mortality was 0.78 (95% credible interval [CrI]: 0.65, 0.94) for tocilizumab; 0.78 (95% CrI: 0.56, 1.03) for baricitinib; and 0.91 (95% CrI: 0.60, 1.40) for sarilumab. The certainty of evidence (GRADE) ranged from moderate to low. Bayesian meta-regressions with multiple priors were used to estimate probabilities of noninferiority (margin of 13% greater effect by tocilizumab). Compared to tocilizumab, there were ≤ 94% and 90% probabilities of noninferiority with baricitinib and sarilumab, respectively.

Results

All but two studies included data with only indirect evidence for the comparison of interest.

Conclusions

Among hospitalized COVID-19 treated with corticosteroids, there are high probabilities that both baricitinib and sarilumab are associated with similar mortality reductions in comparison to tocilizumab.

### Ixekizumab-induced alopecia areata [^114BPa2n]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our patient with plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis on the interleukin (IL)-17A inhibitor ixekizumab had AA, which resolved after discontinuation of the drug. This observation was unexpected, as reports of elevated intralesional and serum IL-17 levels in AA patients have led to the investigation of IL-17A inhibitors as a potential therapy in the disease, although the results to date have not been promising. Although there have not been previous reports of ixekizumab causing AA, there have been 2 reports involving the other IL-17A inhibitors, secukinumab and brodalumab. Apart from TNF-α inhibitors, the only other reports of AA developing in patients on biologics are 3 reports of patients taking ustekinumab for plaque psoriasis. In these reports, however, the patients were not trialed off the drug to observe for hair regrowth, so it is not possible to confirm whether ustekinumab was the direct cause of their hair loss (Table I).

Table I
Cases of AA induced by biologic therapies for plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (excluding TNF-α inhibitors)

Over the course of his treatment, our patient received 2 TNF-α inhibitors, an IL-12/23 inhibitor, and two IL-23 inhibitors and did not experience AA while on any of these medications. It may be possible that he did not take these drugs long enough to experience AA, as he took ixekizumab for 13 months prior to AA development. From the few existing reports, it is difficult to determine the impact of treatment duration on this reaction. However, in at least two previous reports, patients recovered after switching to a different biologic, and in one case the patient recovered after switching to a different drug with the same target (secukinumab to brodalumab). Therefore, it seems that AA induced by biologics may be a drug-specific, rather than a target-specific mechanism. As an increasing number of patients are being prescribed biologics for psoriasis, arthritis, and other conditions, it is important to understand the molecular basis of how these drugs can cause AA and the factors that put patients at risk for this side effect.

A. Topical clobetasol solution, applied twice daily for 6 months – Incorrect. Clobetasol is a high-potency steroid. Prolonged consistent use can result in atrophy and hypopigmentation of the affected area.
B. Topical pimecrolimus 1% cream, applied twice daily for 6 months – Incorrect. There is no evidence of benefit for topical calcineurin inhibitors in the treatment of alopecia areata.
C. Intralesional triamcinolone acetonide, 2.5 to 10 mg/mL, in serial injections every 4 to 6 weeks – Correct. Intralesional corticosteroids, in a concentration of 2.5 to 10 mg/mL, are considered first-line therapy for localized alopecia areata in adults. A concentration of 10 mg/mL with a maximum total of 2 milliliters has been used in the treatment of alopecia areata in treatments 4 to 6 weeks apart. Other experts have used concentrations of triamcinolone acetonide in the range of 2.5 to 10 mg/mL, recommending a maximum volume of 3 milliliters on the scalp in 1 visit.
D. Oral baricitinib at a dose of 2 milligrams once daily – Incorrect. Oral baricitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor approved for adults with severe alopecia areata. In clinical trials of baricitinib, patients with severe alopecia areata, defined as 50% or greater scalp hair loss, demonstrated improvement in hair regrowth after taking 2 milligrams of the medicine daily over a period of 36 weeks. This patient had localized, not severe, alopecia areata. In addition, this patient's history of malignancy may have precluded him from treatment with an oral Janus kinase inhibitor because of its immunosuppressive effects.
E. Oral ritlecitinib at a dose of 50 milligrams once daily – Incorrect. Oral ritlecitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor recently approved for adults and adolescents (age 12 and over) with severe alopecia. Given this patient's localized disease and history of malignancy, oral ritlecitinib would not be the most appropriate initial therapy.

### Two phase 3 trials of baricitinib for alopecia areata [^111xrgNV]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Alopecia areata is an autoimmune condition characterized by rapid hair loss in the scalp, eyebrows, and eyelashes, for which treatments are limited. Baricitinib, an oral, selective, reversible inhibitor of Janus kinases 1 and 2, may interrupt cytokine signaling implicated in the pathogenesis of alopecia areata.

Methods

We conducted two randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials (BRAVE-AA1 and BRAVE-AA2) involving adults with severe alopecia areata with a Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score of 50 or higher (range, 0 [no scalp hair loss] to 100 [complete scalp hair loss]). Patients were randomly assigned in a 3:2:2 ratio to receive once-daily baricitinib at a dose of 4 mg, baricitinib at a dose of 2 mg, or placebo. The primary outcome was a SALT score of 20 or less at week 36.

Results

We enrolled 654 patients in the BRAVE-AA1 trial and 546 in the BRAVE-AA2 trial. The estimated percentage of patients with a SALT score of 20 or less at week 36 was 38.8% with 4-mg baricitinib, 22.8% with 2-mg baricitinib, and 6.2% with placebo in BRAVE-AA1 and 35.9%, 19.4%, and 3.3%, respectively, in BRAVE-AA2. In BRAVE-AA1, the difference between 4-mg baricitinib and placebo was 32.6 percentage points (95% confidence interval, 25.6 to 39.5), and the difference between 2-mg baricitinib and placebo was 16.6 percentage points (95% CI, 9.5 to 23.8) (P < 0.001 for each dose vs. placebo). In BRAVE-AA2, the corresponding values were 32.6 percentage points (95% CI, 25.6 to 39.6) and 16.1 percentage points (95% CI, 9.1 to 23.2) (P < 0.001 for each dose vs. placebo). Secondary outcomes for baricitinib at a dose of 4 mg but not at a dose of 2 mg generally favored baricitinib over placebo. Acne, elevated levels of creatine kinase, and increased levels of low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were more common with baricitinib than with placebo.

Conclusions

In two phase 3 trials involving patients with severe alopecia areata, oral baricitinib was superior to placebo with respect to hair regrowth at 36 weeks. Longer trials are required to assess the efficacy and safety of baricitinib for alopecia areata.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of sarilumab plus methotrexate on disease activity, physical function and radiographic progression: 5 years of sarilumab plus methotrexate treatment [^111yU2fc]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The safety and efficacy of sarilumab 200 mg and 150 mg plus MTX were previously demonstrated in MTX-IR patients with moderately to severely active RA in the 52-week double-blind study. Results from this 5-year analysis of the open-label extension study confirm the long-term safety and efficacy of sarilumab in this group of patients.

The safety profile of sarilumab was stable over 5 years of follow-up and observations were generally consistent, not only with those in the randomised portion of the study but also with other studies in the sarilumab RA clinical programme. In addition, the safety findings are consistent with the anticipated safety profile of IL-6 blockade. No new safety signals emerged and the most common AEs were injection-site erythema, neutropenia, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infections and increased ALT. Occurrence of injection-site reactions was common (21.6 events per 100 PY) but consistent with long-term data for subcutaneous tocilizumab (26.1 events per 100 PY), another IL-6 receptor antagonist. Neutropenia was also common with sarilumab treatment, which is consistent with the phase III clinical trials of sarilumab and with this class of therapy. However, despite neutropenia occurring at a rate of 12.8 events per 100 PY at any sarilumab dose, the infection rate reported in these patients was low, which suggests that neutropenia related to sarilumab treatment is not associated with an increased risk of infection. Furthermore, the last ANC recorded before onset of infection or serious infection was normal in the majority of cases. These results are consistent with a post hoc analysis of three sarilumab phase III trials and patients entering the open-label extensions of two of these trials. The post hoc analysis also found that the majority of patients in the randomised controlled trials and open-label extensions who temporarily discontinued treatment with sarilumab due to low ANC were able to continue or reinitiate sarilumab with no apparent clinically meaningful impact on long-term efficacy or safety. Published data suggest that patients with RA are at a twofold higher risk of herpes zoster infection than individuals without RA, but the reported rate was low in the open-label extension (0.5 events per 100 PY) and comparable to the general population (0.3–0.5 events per 100 PY). While the absolute incidence of AEs was lower in the patients initially randomised to sarilumab 150 mg than those receiving the 200 mg dose, the exposure-adjusted incidence rates were higher. This result should be interpreted with caution, due to the limited duration of exposure in the sarilumab 150 mg group and the relatively small number of events. Furthermore, the absolute incidence of AEs in the double-blind phase was lower in patients randomised to sarilumab 150 mg than those randomised to sarilumab 200 mg. No increases in rates of AEs or SAEs were observed with increasing exposure duration and the incidence rates of AEs and laboratory abnormalities generally remained stable when analysed over time by 6-month interval. Furthermore, the incidences of injection-site reactions and ALT > 3× ULN declined over time.

### COVID-19 clinical trials: a primer for the cardiovascular and cardio-oncology communities [^111rBKrA]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2020). Medium credibility.

A number of additional immunomodulatory agents are also currently being evaluated, including the interleukin (IL)-6 inhibitor, tocilizumab, and glucocorticosteroids (Tables 4 and 5), given the cytokine storm syndrome that has been observed in subgroups with severe COVID-19 with increased levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, and additional inflammatory cytokines. One meta-analysis suggested that the mean IL-6 levels were 2.9-fold (95% CI: 1.17 to 7.19-fold) greater in patients with complicated compared with noncomplicated COVID-19. Tocilizumab (Actemra, Genentech) is FDA-approved for the treatment of severe cytokine release syndrome in patients treated with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy and is also approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds the IL-6 receptor, both the membrane-bound and soluble forms, thus inhibiting both classic and trans-IL-6 downstream signaling. Similarly, the IL-6 humanized murine chimeric monoclonal antibody siltuximab, although not FDA-approved for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome, has also been used in the treatment of cytokine release syndrome and is also being studied as a potential therapy in severe COVID-19 infections. Siltuximab (Sylvant, Janssen Biotech Inc. Horsham, Pennsylvania) binds directly to IL-6 and prevents the activation of immune effector cells. Sarilumab (Kevzara, Sanofi US, Bridgewater, New Jersey) is a human monoclonal antibody against the IL-6 receptor that was developed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis that is also being evaluated for severe COVID-19.

There are no systematically obtained clinical data yet that support a benefit to the use of steroids, and some reports have suggested a possible detriment with delayed viral clearance and increased risk of infection with MERS and SARS, although the role of steroids in COVID-19 is an area of active investigation (Table 4).

### Lessons from TNF-α inhibitor-induced alopecia areata: does TNF-α operate as a hair follicle immune privilege guardian under inflammatory conditions? [^116XFj16]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) signaling with inhibitors (TNFi) like infliximab, adalimumab, or etanercept has become a staple of dermatological and rheumatological therapy. Intriguingly, a sizeable minority of patients under TNFi therapy develop alopecia areata (AA), the most common inflammatory hair loss disease, at a higher prevalence than the general population. This appears paradoxical, since the pro-inflammatory Th1 cytokine TNF-α, inhibits hair follicle (HF) growth, but encourages one to reconsider the as yet under-investigated roles of TNF-α in human HF physiology. Because AA only affects HFs whose immune privilege (IP) has collapsed, the occurrence of AA under TNFi therapy raises the question if inhibiting TNF-a signaling could be detrimental to the maintenance of HF IP. Here, we probe this question by exploring lesser-known aspects of TNF-α biology, notably within the context of skin inflammation. We hypothesize that, under inflammatory conditions, TNF-α exerts underappreciated functions as a HF IP guardian, e.g., by stimulating perifollicular immunoinhibitory cells and suppressing IFN-α secretion. Thus, TNFi may weaken HF IP and facilitate the onset of AA. We delineate how this provocative hypothesis can be tested experimentally, and why it is both biologically and clinically important to do so.

Dose Modifications

Dose modification in the event of dermatologic adverse events should be performed as recommended in the relevant package insert.

Unless otherwise recommended, treatment should be continued in cases of grade 1 and 2 adverse events and interrupted for grade 3 adverse events. When dermatologic events improve to grade ≤ 1, a rechallenge at a reduced dose is recommended.

### Cytokine-pathway blockers worsen mycosis fungoides masquerading as psoriasis [^111iJfub]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Although psoriasis and MF might coexist, it does not seem to be the case in our patient as retrospective TCR clonality analysis revealed the presence of the same clone in all of the previous skin biopsies.

Two years after disease onset, our patient developed hair loss manifestations. Alopecia is reported in approximately 2.5% of CTCL patients with one-third of the cases developing alopecia areata-like patchy hair loss and two-thirds manifesting with alopecia within CTCL lesion. Alopecia areata has been recently reported as a comorbidity associated with MF, nevertheless the possibility of misdiagnosis of folliculotropic MF as alopecia areata has also been discussed. Although scalp lesions were not biopsied in our patient, the clinical findings in this context were consistent with alopecia areata-like lesions in the context of folliculotropic MF.

In summary, we report disease progression of MF misdiagnosed as psoriasis, and heavily pretreated with multiple cytokine blocking biologics. Atypical skin lesions can sometimes pose a diagnostic challenge, and assessment by dermatologists with specific expertise in MF can provide valuable insights. While psoriasiform dermatitis is common, the nuances that differentiate it from early-stage MF may require specialized knowledge. Given the potential for overlap and the significance of an accurate diagnosis, seeking the expertise of an MF specialist for the histopathology review can contribute to a more precise and reliable assessment.

### Dermatologic events from EGFR inhibitors: the issue of the missing patient voice [^113q8qdR]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

In recent years, several agents have been developed that inhibit the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which plays a central role in growth of certain cancers. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; e.g. cetuximab, panitumumab, necitumumab) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs; e.g. erlotinib, gefitinib, lapatinib, afatinib) blocking different EGFR targets are therefore an indispensable part of cancer treatment. EGFR inhibitors are used to treat advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (afatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, necitumumab), pancreatic cancer (erlotinib), breast cancer (lapatinib), colon cancer (cetuximab, panitumumab), and head and neck cancer (cetuximab). Compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy with taxanes, fluoropyrimidines, and platinum compounds that are known to be associated with multiple adverse events (AEs) such as fatigue, pain, nausea and emesis, hematologic toxicity, and neuropathy, EGFR inhibitors may have a lower impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL). However, due to the role of EGFR in skin biology, all EGFR inhibitors are associated with a variety of dermatologic AEs (dAEs), e.g. acneiform (papulopustular) rash, hair changes (hair loss, facial hypertrichosis, eyelash trichomegaly), pruritus, mucositis, xerosis and fissures, and paronychia (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Dermatologic adverse events associated with EGFR inhibitors: a paronychia, b xerosis, and c acneiform rash

Due to increased incidence of dAEs associated with targeted cancer therapies, a large volume of publications have focused on these toxicities. To get an overview of the current research status and to identify knowledge gaps, this article summarizes the main findings on this topic. It is noteworthy that the severity of patients' AEs, including those of the skin, does not necessarily correlate with the amount to which patients are actually distressed. This requires a special focus on patient-reported outcomes and patients' HRQOL as part of this literature analysis.

IDSA COVID-19 Recommendation 12 — When tocilizumab is not available for patients who would otherwise qualify for tocilizumab, the IDSA guideline panel suggests sarilumab in addition to standard of care (i.e., steroids) rather than standard of care alone (Conditional recommendation†, Very low certainty of evidence). A remark states that patients, particularly those who respond to steroids alone, who put a high value on avoiding possible adverse events of sarilumab and a low value on the uncertain mortality reduction, would reasonably decline sarilumab.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of EGFR inhibitor-associated dermatologic toxicities [^116wQj8c]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (EGFRI) produce various dermatologic side effects in the majority of patients, and guidelines are crucial for the prevention and treatment of these untoward events. The purpose of this panel was to develop evidence-based recommendations for EGFRI-associated dermatologic toxicities.

Methods

A multinational, interdisciplinary panel of experts in supportive care in cancer reviewed pertinent studies using established criteria in order to develop first-generation recommendations for EGFRI-associated dermatologic toxicities.

Results

Prophylactic and reactive recommendations for papulopustular (acneiform) rash, hair changes, radiation dermatitis, pruritus, mucositis, xerosis/fissures, and paronychia are presented, as well as general dermatologic recommendations when possible.

Conclusion

Prevention and management of EGFRI-related dermatologic toxicities is critical to maintain patients' health-related quality of life and dose intensity of antineoplastic regimens. More rigorous investigation of these toxicities is warranted to improve preventive and treatment strategies.

### Treatment efficacy and methotrexate-related toxicity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving methotrexate in combination with adalimumab [^117LPn41]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Patients and studies

This post hoc analysis included data from two double-blind RCTs in patients with RA: CONCERTO (NCT01185301, post-results) was a phase III trial of ADA in patients with early RA who were biologic DMARD-naive and MTX-naïve. Patients were randomised to initiate treatment with open-label, subcutaneous ADA in combination with concurrent, double-blind, oral MTX at 2.5, 5, 10 or 20 mg/week for 26 weeks.

MUSICA (NCT01185288) was a phase IV trial of ADA in patients with moderate-to-severe RA and an inadequate response to MTX. Patients receiving ≥ 15 mg/week MTX for ≥ 12 weeks prior to the study were randomised to initiate treatment with open-label, subcutaneous ADA in combination with double-blind, oral MTX at 7.5 or 20 mg/week for 24 weeks.

Clinical assessments and statistical analysis

The efficacy of initiated ADA plus concomitant MTX treatment and MTX-related toxicity are reported by observed rates without imputation. Efficacy was assessed by a 50% improvement in the ACR core set of variables (ACR50 response rate at baseline and weeks 4, 12, 16, 20 and 24/26 (for MUSICA and CONCERTO, respectively)). For this analysis, we only considered information on patient-reported MTX-related toxicity, collected at each visit and assessed by the investigators, on the following 18 prespecified MTX-related AEs in the MTX product label: abnormal hair loss, abnormal sweating, chronic dry cough, conjunctivitis, dizziness, excessive fatigue/malaise, fever and/or chills, infection, nausea and/or vomiting, nose bleed, oral ulcers, skin pigment changes, skin rash/hives, stomach discomfort, tinnitus, unexplained visual changes, unexplained diarrhoea and unintended weight loss.

Data on other common AEs (not prespecified in the MTX label), such as thrombocytopaenia, neutropaenia and abnormal liver function tests (LFT), were reported if the investigator considered them clinically relevant based on the central laboratory reports.

Logistic regression modelling was performed to determine the association of the development of MTX-related toxicity with baseline characteristics, including age, gender, 28 Joint Disease Activity Score based on C reactive protein (DAS28(CRP)) score, rheumatoid factor (RF), RA duration, MTX treatment dose and prior MTX dosage (for MUSICA only).

### Alopecia universalis: never give up? [^111Awvf4]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Oral Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) have demonstrated significant promise in hair regrowth for severe alopecia areata. Baricitinib and ritlecitinib are two medications within this class that have been FDA-approved in recent years, with data supporting treatment response over the course of a few months.

Case Presentation

We present the case of a 28-year-old female with alopecia universalis and a Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) of 100%, who failed 1 year of baricitinib therapy and was switched to ritlecitinib. She experienced regrowth of vellus hairs on the scalp and some eyebrow hair after 6 months of therapy and subsequent robust growth of terminal hair after 1 year of ritlecitinib and 2 total years of total JAKi therapy. The patient also had regrowth of the eyelashes, eyebrows, and resolution of nail pitting.

Conclusion

The authors aim to report this case to highlight the success of prolonged JAKi therapy for patients with severe refractory alopecia areata and the success of JAKi therapy after failure of a prior JAKi. Dermatologists should consider longer courses of these medications and switching within the class for patients who experience poor response with initial agents.

Clinical Question

Which interventions are effective and safe for treating female pattern hair loss (FPHL)?

Bottom Line

There was low- to moderate-quality evidence that topical minoxidil (2% and 5%) was associated with improvements in FPHL. There was low-quality evidence that finasteride was no more effective than placebo. There were inconsistent results from studies that laser devices were effective, but total hair count increased compared with baseline (moderate- to low-quality evidence). Most treatments were not associated with higher adverse event rates than placebo.

### Alopecia universalis successfully treated with adalimumab [^115nR6sU]. JAMA Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

IMPORTANCE Alopecia universalis is an uncommon form of alopecia areata (AA) involving hair loss over the entire scalp and body and is often difficult to treat. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)inhibitors have been largely unsuccessful in treating AA and have been reported to induce or worsen AA in patients. We report herein a case of alopecia universalis successfully treated with adalimumab and discuss the possible mechanism.OBSERVATIONS A woman in her 30s with alopecia universalis, refractory to multiple treatment modalities, was successfully treated with adalimumab.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Tumor necrosis factor has multiple important roles in the pathogenesis of AA, and its interplay with other cytokines, specifically interferons, may be responsible for the development of AA in patients treated with TNF inhibitors. Pharmacogenetics and the inherent physiologic levels of TNF may explain why TNF inhibitors cause AA in some individuals, while treating AA in others. These conclusions warrant further investigation on this subject.
