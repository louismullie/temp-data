## Question

What level of ceruloplasmin is suggestive of Wilson disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what ceruloplasmin level is suggestive of Wilson disease and how to interpret it in clinical context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology linking ceruloplasmin to Wilson disease. Then, I should verify adult and pediatric diagnostic thresholds and how they differ. Next, I will examine assay-related issues and the Leipzig scoring framework. After that, I need to consider special populations and confounders that can lower or raise ceruloplasmin. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and state a clear answer with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology so I don't jump to conclusions: Wilson disease impairs ATP7B-mediated copper trafficking, which reduces holoceruloplasmin formation and leads to low circulating ceruloplasmin in most patients, although a normal ceruloplasmin does not exclude the diagnosis, so I need to keep that in mind as I interpret values [^112Bnqzp] [^113dVjty].

> Now, I should verify adult thresholds. Wait, let me double-check the AASLD guidance: an extremely low ceruloplasmin less than 5 mg/dL is highly suggestive of Wilson disease, whereas a value below the usual lower limit of normal, typically around 20 mg/dL, is consistent with Wilson disease but less specific, and importantly, a normal ceruloplasmin does not rule out Wilson disease, so I must not anchor on a single value [^113dVjty] [^1163bbjS]. I should also note that in the Leipzig scoring system, ceruloplasmin 10–20 mg/dL scores 1 point and less than 10 mg/dL scores 2 points, reinforcing that lower values carry more diagnostic weight [^1164CchP] [^112XXQvu].

> Next, I will examine pediatric data because children are not simply small adults. Hold on, I should verify the optimal cutoff: a large pediatric cohort found that a ceruloplasmin less than 16.8 mg/dL maximized diagnostic accuracy with sensitivity around 96% and specificity around 94%, outperforming the conventional 20 mg/dL threshold, which had higher sensitivity but lower specificity, so in children older than 6 months, less than 16.8 mg/dL is a pragmatic threshold to use [^116ZozfH] [^116gy73j]. But wait, what if the child is under 6 months? I need to ensure I account for physiologic immaturity: ceruloplasmin is normally very low in early infancy, so values under 20 mg/dL can be physiologic and should be interpreted cautiously in that age group [^113wq7gC].

> I will now examine assay-related issues because they can mislead interpretation. Let me consider the difference between immunologic and enzymatic assays: immunologic methods measure total protein including inactive apo-ceruloplasmin and can overestimate functional holoceruloplasmin, whereas enzymatic oxidase activity better reflects functional copper incorporation; enzymatic assays can improve specificity and may perform better in difficult contexts, so if available, they can refine diagnosis, but I should confirm local availability and method before relying on them [^112V74X8] [^113wq7gC].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic framework so I don't overinterpret a single test. The Leipzig score integrates ceruloplasmin, urinary copper, hepatic copper, Kayser-Fleischer rings, and genetics, with a total score of 4 or more indicating Wilson disease is highly likely; this means ceruloplasmin contributes points but cannot establish the diagnosis in isolation, so I need to check urinary copper, consider liver copper if needed, and pursue ATP7B testing when results are equivocal [^1164CchP] [^112XXQvu] [^111bqZJE]. I should confirm that AASLD and EASL recommend obtaining ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urinary copper as first-line tests in suspected Wilson disease, with hepatic copper quantification and genetics as confirmatory steps when necessary [^114dojsC] [^116YFGQ9] [^1155BFdt].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a low value being pathognomonic; I need to check for confounders that lower ceruloplasmin. Severe chronic liver disease, protein-losing enteropathy or nephrotic syndrome, absolute copper deficiency, after bariatric surgery, and chronic high-dose zinc can all reduce ceruloplasmin, so I should correlate with clinical context and, when uncertain, proceed to urinary copper and, if needed, hepatic copper or genetics rather than assuming Wilson disease solely from a low ceruloplasmin [^113wq7gC].

> But wait, what if ceruloplasmin is normal or high; does that exclude Wilson disease? I should double-check: ceruloplasmin is an acute-phase reactant and can be elevated with inflammation, pregnancy, or estrogen therapy, and a meaningful minority of Wilson disease patients have normal ceruloplasmin, so a normal value cannot be used to rule out Wilson disease, especially in acute liver failure or when clinical suspicion is high [^113wq7gC] [^113dVjty] [^116bNxjf].

> I will now examine special populations where interpretation is tricky. In acute liver failure, conventional ceruloplasmin performs poorly, with very low sensitivity in some series, so I should rely more on an AP:TB ratio less than 4, an AST:ALT ratio greater than 2.2, markedly elevated serum copper, and very high urinary copper, and consider exchangeable copper or relative exchangeable copper if available, rather than ceruloplasmin alone, to avoid missing Wilson disease in this life-threatening scenario [^114TdZxs] [^11689F2h] [^112JPn38]. In asymptomatic children or those detected by family screening, ceruloplasmin can be low but occasionally near-normal, so I should confirm with urinary copper and genetics when suspicion persists despite borderline values [^116MQduV].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach so I don't miss anything. First, I should confirm pretest probability based on age, liver test pattern, neurologic or psychiatric features, and family history, and avoid indiscriminate testing in low-risk populations to minimize false positives and resource waste [^1113LRkC] [^111SUkaP]. Then, I should obtain ceruloplasmin and a basal 24-hour urinary copper, using pediatric-specific thresholds in children and integrating results into the Leipzig score; if ceruloplasmin is less than 5 mg/dL, I should have a very high suspicion and expedite confirmatory testing, whereas if it is 10–20 mg/dL, I should proceed with additional data before concluding Wilson disease [^113dVjty] [^116YFGQ9] [^1164CchP]. Finally, I should consider hepatic copper quantification and ATP7B genetic testing when results are equivocal, and remember that normal ceruloplasmin does not exclude Wilson disease when clinical suspicion remains high [^1155BFdt] [^113dVjty].

> Putting this together, I should state the answer clearly while preserving the caveats. In adults, an extremely low ceruloplasmin less than 5 mg/dL is highly suggestive of Wilson disease, while values below about 20 mg/dL are consistent with Wilson disease but less specific, and a normal value does not exclude the diagnosis. In children older than 6 months, less than 16.8 mg/dL provides the best diagnostic accuracy, and in early infancy under 6 months, low values may be physiologic and require cautious interpretation with confirmatory testing [^113dVjty] [^116ZozfH] [^113wq7gC].

---

A ceruloplasmin level **< 20 mg/dL** is considered low and suggestive of Wilson disease, but it is not diagnostic on its own [^113wq7gC]. Levels **< 10 mg/dL** are highly specific and strongly suggest Wilson disease, whereas levels **< 5 mg/dL** are especially specific and warrant urgent evaluation [^112u1Uwx] [^113dVjty]. However, **normal ceruloplasmin does not exclude Wilson disease** because 5–10% of patients have normal levels, particularly in acute liver failure or as carriers [^113wq7gC] [^114TdZxs]. Always confirm with 24-hour urinary copper, slit-lamp exam for Kayser-Fleischer rings, and ATP7B genetic testing when suspicion remains [^116YFGQ9] [^114dojsC].

---

## Normal ceruloplasmin levels

Normal adult ceruloplasmin levels typically range from **20 to 40 mg/dL** [^notfound]. Levels may be higher in **pregnancy**, with **estrogen therapy**, or in **inflammatory states** because ceruloplasmin is an acute-phase reactant [^113wq7gC].

---

## Ceruloplasmin levels in Wilson disease

In Wilson disease, ceruloplasmin is typically low due to **impaired copper incorporation** into the protein [^112Bnqzp]. The degree of reduction varies with disease severity, genetic mutations, and clinical presentation [^113uZ1Gw] [^113rrPis].

---

## Ceruloplasmin thresholds suggestive of Wilson disease

| **Ceruloplasmin level** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|
| < 20 mg/dL | Low and suggestive of Wilson disease, but not diagnostic [^112u1Uwx] |
| < 10 mg/dL | Highly specific and strongly suggestive of Wilson disease [^112u1Uwx] |
| < 5 mg/dL | Extremely low and highly specific for Wilson disease [^113dVjty] |

---

These thresholds are **useful for initial screening** but must be interpreted in clinical context and alongside other diagnostic tests [^114WpeTG].

---

## Limitations of ceruloplasmin as a diagnostic test

While low ceruloplasmin is suggestive of Wilson disease, it is **not diagnostic on its own** [^113ZpQ3Y]. Limitations include:

- **False positives**: Low ceruloplasmin can occur in other conditions such as aceruloplasminemia, severe liver disease, malnutrition, and protein-losing enteropathies [^113wq7gC] [^113SjyVk].
- **False negatives**: Normal ceruloplasmin levels can occur in 5–10% of Wilson disease patients, particularly in acute liver failure or in carriers [^113wq7gC] [^113ZpQ3Y].
- **Assay variability**: Different laboratory methods (immunological vs. enzymatic) can yield varying results, affecting diagnostic accuracy [^112V74X8] [^114WpeTG].

---

## Additional diagnostic tests for Wilson disease

Given the limitations of ceruloplasmin alone, **additional tests are recommended**:

- **24-hour urinary copper excretion**: Typically elevated (> 100 µg/24h in symptomatic patients; > 40 µg/24h in asymptomatic or pediatric patients) [^113AudPD].
- **Slit-lamp examination**: Detection of Kayser-Fleischer rings (copper deposits in the cornea) [^114dojsC].
- **ATP7B genetic testing**: Identification of pathogenic mutations in the ATP7B gene [^111bqZJE].
- **Liver biopsy**: Quantitative hepatic copper content > 250 µg/g dry weight is highly suggestive of Wilson disease [^1155BFdt].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) emphasize that **ceruloplasmin alone is insufficient** for diagnosing Wilson disease [^113dVjty] [^116YFGQ9]. They recommend a **comprehensive approach**, integrating clinical presentation, laboratory tests, and genetic analysis [^114dojsC].

---

## Summary of key points

- **Low ceruloplasmin**: < 20 mg/dL is suggestive of Wilson disease but not diagnostic [^112u1Uwx].
- **Highly specific**: < 10 mg/dL is highly specific and strongly suggestive of Wilson disease [^112u1Uwx].
- **Extremely low**: < 5 mg/dL is extremely specific and warrants urgent evaluation [^notfound].
- **Normal levels**: Do not exclude Wilson disease; 5–10% of patients have normal ceruloplasmin [^notfound].
- **Confirmatory tests**: 24-hour urinary copper, slit-lamp exam, and ATP7B genetic testing are essential for definitive diagnosis [^114dojsC].

---

A ceruloplasmin level **< 20 mg/dL** is suggestive of Wilson disease, but diagnosis requires **confirmatory testing** and clinical correlation [^113ZpQ3Y].

Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version 25; SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA) and GraphPad Prism (version 7.0; GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California, USA). Continuous quantitative variables (age, serum Ceruloplasmin) were expressed as the means and standard deviations (SD). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for assessment of diagnostic accuracy. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the corresponding area under the curve (AUC) were used to determine the optimal cutoff value of serum ceruloplasmin for diagnosis of WD. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Copper is an essential nutrient which serves as a cofactor for serum ceruloplasmin, an oxidase necessary for proper formation of the iron carrier protein, transferrin. Copper also helps maintain normal rates of red and white blood cell formation.

Providing copper during TPN helps prevent development of the following deficiency symptoms: Leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, depressed ceruloplasmin levels, impaired transferrin formation, secondary iron deficiency and osteoporosis.

Normal serum copper values range from 80 to 163 mcg/dl (mean, approximately 110 mcg/dl). The serum copper level at which deficiency symptoms appear is not precisely defined. A serum value of 9 mcg copper/dl was reported for one TPN patient who received no copper. The daily turnover of copper through ceruloplasmin is approximately 0.5 mg. Excretion of copper is through the bile (80%), directly through the intestinal wall (16%) and in urine (4%).

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1122RDkF]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Wilson disease evaluation — patients with persistently elevated AST/ALT should undergo initial serum ceruloplasmin testing; "Screening should be considered in all patients with persistently elevated AST/ALT levels, and consists of serum ceruloplasmin testing (56)". If ceruloplasmin is low, "confirmatory testing should be pursued including 24-h urine copper and/or serum copper levels, slit-lamp eye examination to identify pathognomonic Kayser-Fleischer rings, and possible liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis, stage liver fibrosis, and quantify hepatic copper overload to guide management". Molecular testing can be used when needed, as "Molecular genetic analyses for the ATP7B mutation can be pursued in cases of diagnostic uncertainty", and genetic heterogeneity is noted: "Over 32 different mutations of the Wilsons gene have now been identified and unlike hemochromatosis, there is no predominant mutation".

### Wilson disease in children: analysis of 57 cases [^116EbsTs]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Wilson disease (WD) has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Affected children may be entirely asymptomatic and the diagnosis problematic. Herein we present the clinical and laboratory characteristics of 57 children with WD and point out the diagnostic difficulties in a pediatric population.

Patients and Methods

Clinical and laboratory data were collected from 57 consecutive children with WD. Evaluation included detailed physical examination, conventional laboratory testing, genetic analysis, and liver biopsy.

Results

The mean age at diagnosis was 9.27 ± 3.62 years (range 4 months-18 years). Twenty patients were symptomatic, 19 were referred because of abnormal liver function test results and/or hepatomegaly, and 18 received their diagnoses after family screening. Twenty-two patients had both Kayser-Fleischer ring and decreased serum ceruloplasmin levels, 13 had urinary copper excretion after penicillamine challenge > 1600 microg/24 hours, and 3 had liver copper content > 250 microg/g dry weight. Of the remaining 19 patients, 17 had both low serum ceruloplasmin ≤ 20 mg/dL and increased urinary copper excretion, > 75 microg/24 hours before, or > 1000 microg/24 hours after penicillamine challenge. In 2 patients with equivocal cases who had serum ceruloplasmin 26 mg/dL, the diagnosis was confirmed by genetic analysis. No correlation was found between specific mutations and the disease phenotypic expression. Chelating therapy was well tolerated, and the outcome was satisfactory.

Conclusions

WD in children may be obscure and requires extensive investigation to establish the diagnosis. Genetic analysis is needed in equivocal cases.

### Wilson's disease in sardinian population: the experience of a pediatric referral center [^112TUpqK]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Wilson's disease (WD) in children and adolescents is predominantly asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic. The symptoms are nonspecific and difficult to distinguish from other hepatic or neuropsychiatric disorders. In this study, we present the experience of a pediatric referral center for WD diagnosis and treatment.

Patients and Methods

We retrospectively analyzed clinical and laboratory data from 99 patients with WD of Sardinian origin, including physical examination, laboratory biochemical testing, liver biopsy, and genetic analysis.

Results

Patients were prevalently oligo-symptomatic or asymptomatic. The median age of diagnosis was 8.78 years. Ceruloplasmin values were lower than normal values in all analyzed patients. Twenty-four-hour urinary copper levels were higher than 40 μg/24-h in 92/96 patients. In all analyzed patients with the exception of one, liver copper was higher than 250μg/g of dry weight but all had > 75μg/g of dry weight. Statistical analysis showed correlation between the age at diagnosis, serum copper, and 24-h urinary copper. Correlation was also found between serum copper and 24-h urinary copper. Molecular analysis of ATP7B gene allowed complete characterization in all the analyzed patients.

Conclusion

A high index of clinical suspicion and biochemical tests including liver tests, serum ceruloplasmin, and basal 24-h urinary copper excretion and genotype determination are key to WD diagnosis. The long experience that a referral center for WD possesses is an important factor in making WD diagnosis a more accurate process. Studies in animal models on WD could be used as a guide to further investigate the molecular mechanisms that regulate copper metabolism and influence the natural history of WD.

Serum ceruloplasmin levels in WD patients with R778L in the ATP7B gene

Of the 317 WD patients, 313 had genetic testing for pathogenic mutations in the ATP7B gene, with 307 bi-allelic mutations and 6 one allelic mutation. Through family screening, 21 heterozygotes and 12 wild type siblings were identified. All wild type siblings were healthy and included in healthy controls. All heterozygotes were healthy without liver dysfunction. The mean level of serum ceruloplasmin in heterozygotes was (25.6 ± 5.9 mg/dL), significantly lower than that of healthy controls (30.7 ± 7.8 mg/dL, p < 0.05), but much higher than WD patients (5.7 ± 4.7 mg/dL, p < 0.001) (Fig. 1).

Among 313 WD patients, the most frequent mutation in the ATP7B gene was R778L, identified in 33.9% (106 patients) of 313 WD patients (Table 4). Of the 313 WD patients, 9 carried bi-allelic R778L mutations (R778L homozygotes), 97 had one allelic mutation of R778L together with one allelic mutation other than R778L (R778L heterozygotes) and 207 had none of R778L (No R778L). The patients with R778L homozygotes had the lowest level of serum ceruloplasmin (2.3 ± 0.5 mg/dL) and significantly lower than that of WD children without R778L (6.2 ± 4.8 mg/dL) (p < 0.05).

### Wilson's disease | NEJM resident 360… [^111YDGkM]. resident360.nejm.org (2023). Medium credibility.

A: ATP7B, on chromosome 13q14, is the only gene with mutations that are associated with Wilson's disease. The gene product ATP7B is a multifunctional, intracellular P 1-type ATPase, found mainly in the liver. In Wilson's disease, functional ATP7B is decreased or absent, and excessive copper accumulates in hepatocytes. As copper-induced liver injury progresses, extrahepatic sites — notably, the central nervous system — are affected. Q: Is the diagnosis of Wilson's disease based on a low serum ceruloplasmin level alone. A: The clinical diagnosis of Wilson's disease involves a detailed medical history taking and physical examination focused on liver, neurologic, and psychiatric disease. Laboratory assessment includes liver biochemical and serum ceruloplasmin levels and basal 24-hour urinary copper excretion. The serum ceruloplasmin level alone is not adequate for diagnosis, although a very low level strongly suggests Wilson's disease.

The ceruloplasmin level can be normal in Wilson's disease, although a normal value is uncommon. A: Hepatic Wilson's disease, which tends to develop earlier than neuropsychiatric Wilson's disease, ranges from mild liver disease to cirrhosis; in children, fatty liver is common. Infrequently, Wilson's disease manifests as acute liver failure. In patients with Wilson's disease, neurologic movement disorders involve either increased movement, with tremor or dystonia, or decreased movement, resembling parkinsonian rigidity. Tremors, poor coordination, and loss of fine motor control may occur early. Dysarthria is often the first prominent symptom. Drooling and difficulty swallowing indicate pseudobulbar involvement. In general, cognitive function is intact; however, subtle deficits in executive ability or integrative capabilities may occur. Clumsiness, loss of athletic skills, or deterioration in school performance may be initial features in adolescents.

Psychiatric Wilson's disease is highly variable, although depression is common. Kayser–Fleischer rings are the main ophthalmologic sign. Other manifestations include renal, cardiac, musculoskeletal, and endocrine conditions. Wilson's disease can manifest at any age, although usually before the age of 50 years; older age does not rule it out.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for Wilson's disease, more specifically with respect to indications for testing, family relatives, EASL/ERN-Rare Liver 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urinary copper excretion measurements, and relative exchangeable copper if available, in siblings and first-degree relatives (parents and offspring of an index case). Evaluate clinical symptoms and obtain liver tests.

### Assessment of the diagnostic value of serum ceruloplasmin for Wilson's disease in children [^116ZozfH]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Serum ceruloplasmin is one of the major diagnostic parameters for Wilson's disease (WD). Age and gender difference of serum ceruloplasmin remain controversy. This study aims to assess diagnostic value of serum ceruloplasmin level for WD in children up to age of 15 years.

Methods

Serum ceruloplasmin levels were measured in 317 WD patients, 21 heterozygotes, 372 healthy control children and 154 non-WD patients with other liver diseases. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the diagnostic accuracy of serum ceruloplasmin for WD in children.

Results

Among healthy controls, serum ceruloplasmin level was slightly low in the infants younger than 6 months, and then maintained from 26 to 33 mg/dl after age of 6 months. A total of 8.1% of healthy children had levels of serum ceruloplasmin < 20 mg/dL. Serum ceruloplasmin level was 5.7 ± 4.7 mg/dl in WD patients, and 25.6 ± 5.9 mg/dl in heterozygous carriers. Only 1.9% of WD patients had serum ceruloplasmin levels > 20 mg/dL. Serum ceruloplasmin levels had gender difference, being higher in healthy boys than healthy girls, and higher in asymptomatic WD boys than asymptomatic WD girls (p < 0.01, p < 0.05). Serum ceruloplasmin levels also presented genotypic difference. WD patients with R778L homozygotes exhibited lower levels of serum ceruloplasmin than the patients without R778L (p < 0.05). The ROC curve revealed that serum ceruloplasmin level, at a cutoff value of 16.8 mg/dL, had the highest AUC value (0.990) with a sensitivity of 95.9% and a specificity of 93.6%.

Conclusions

Serum ceruloplasmin is one of sensitive diagnostic biomarkers for WD in children. Gender and genotypic difference of serum ceruloplasmin level should be considered. The cutoff value of serum ceruloplasmin level < 16.8 mg/dL may provide the highest accuracy for diagnosis of WD in children.

### Penicillamine (Depen) [^116p3PL5]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS

DEPEN is indicated in the treatment of Wilson's disease, cystinuria, and in patients with severe, active rheumatoid arthritis who have failed to respond to an adequate trial of conventional therapy. Available evidence suggests that DEPEN is not of value in ankylosing spondylitis.

Wilson's Disease - Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) results from the interaction of an inherited defect and an abnormality in copper metabolism. The metabolic defect, which is the consequence of the autosomal inheritance of one abnormal gene from each parent, manifests itself in a greater positive copper balance than normal. As a result, copper is deposited in several organs and appears eventually to produce pathologic effects most prominently seen in the brain, where degeneration is widespread; in the liver, where fatty infiltration, inflammation, and hepatocellular damage progress to postnecrotic cirrhosis; in the kidney, where tubular and glomerular dysfunction results; and in the eye, where characteristic corneal copper deposits are known as Kayser-Fleischer rings.

Two types of patients require treatment for Wilson's disease: (1) the symptomatic, and (2) the asymptomatic in whom it can be assumed the disease will develop in the future if the patient is not treated.

Diagnosis, suspected on the basis of family or individual history, physical examination, or a low serum concentration of ceruloplasmin*, is confirmed by the demonstration of Kayser-Fleischer rings or, particularly in the asymptomatic patient, by the quantitative demonstration in a liver biopsy specimen of a concentration of copper in excess of 250 mcg/g dry weight.

### Causes and evaluation of mildly elevated liver transaminase levels [^113Yditq]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Mild elevations in levels of the liver enzymes alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase are commonly discovered in asymptomatic patients in primary care. Evidence to guide the diagnostic workup is limited. If the history and physical examination do not suggest a cause, a stepwise evaluation should be initiated based on the prevalence of diseases that cause mild elevations in transaminase levels. The most common cause is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which can affect up to 30 percent of the population. Other common causes include alcoholic liver disease, medication-associated liver injury, viral hepatitis (hepatitis B and C), and hemochromatosis. Less common causes include α(1)-antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, and Wilson disease. Extrahepatic conditions (e.g., thyroid disorders, celiac disease, hemolysis, muscle disorders) can also cause elevated liver transaminase levels. Initial testing should include a fasting lipid profile; measurement of glucose, serum iron, and ferritin; total iron-binding capacity; and hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody testing. If test results are normal, a trial of lifestyle modification with observation or further testing for less common causes is appropriate. Additional testing may include ultrasonography; measurement of α(1)-antitrypsin and ceruloplasmin; serum protein electrophoresis; and antinuclear antibody, smooth muscle antibody, and liver/kidney microsomal antibody type 1 testing. Referral for further evaluation and possible liver biopsy is recommended if transaminase levels remain elevated for six months or more.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^111s29VH]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Chelation therapy treatment targets in Wilson disease (WD) — Adequacy of treatment is monitored by clinical and biochemical improvement and by measuring 24-h urinary copper excretion on treatment, which is highest immediately after starting treatment, when it may exceed 1000–2000 μg/24 h. With chronic (maintenance) treatment, urinary copper excretion should be approximately 200–500 μg/24 h (3–8 μmol/24 h), and serum NCC shows normalization with effective treatment. Values of 24-h urinary copper excretion > 500 μg/24 h in treated patients previously excreting 200–500 μg/24 h suggest nonadherence to medication or excessive liberalization of dietary copper; urinary copper excretion < 100 μg/24 h may signal overtreatment, particularly when serum copper and CuEXC are very low, as is the NCC (typically ≤ 5 μg/dl). In those nonadherent to D-penicillamine therapy, serum copper and CuEXC are elevated, and NCC may be elevated (> 25 μg/dl). With D-penicillamine treatment, serum ceruloplasmin may decrease and remain low or increase during chronic treatment, whereas a decrease in chronically treated patients may indicate overtreatment and is often associated with neutropenia, sideroblastic anemia, and hemosiderosis.

### Wilson's disease in the merck manual: corrections… [^1171YUzk]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Berkow R. Wilson's Disease in The Merck Manual: Corrections. JAMA. 1988; 259: 2997–2998. doi: 10.1001/jama.1988.03720200019018 To the Editor. — It has been brought to our attention that there is incorrect information about Wilson's disease in the new 15th edition of The Merck Manual, particularly regarding diagnosis and treatment. Wilson's disease, transmitted in an autosomal recessive fashion, is always fatal unless it is diagnosed and an appropriate lifelong therapeutic regimen instituted before progressive and irreversible pathology of the liver or brain develops. 1Concerning diagnosis, a normal ceruloplasmin level is 200 to 500 mg/L, not 150 to 400 mg/L. A concentration of hepatic copper greater than 250 μg/g dry weight is absolutely diagnostic if, and only if, the serum ceruloplasmin concentration is less than 200 mg/L.

About 4% of patients with Wilson's disease have ceruloplasmin concentrations greater than 200 mg/L. Diagnosing Wilson's disease in these patients Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

Materials and methods

Study subjects

A total of 317 children with WD diagnosed at Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center (GWCMC) from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2020 were enrolled in this study (n = 317). The diagnosis of all 317 WD patients were established on a total of score of four or more points according to the consensus for WD. These patients were categorized into three groups based on clinical manifestations at diagnosis: (1) Asymptomatic WD, including 236 of whom presented with isolated elevation of serum aminotransferases through occasional tests and 25 diagnosed through family screening (n = 261); (2) WD with acute liver failure (n = 15); (3) other types of WD, including acute hepatitis, chronic hepatic disease, neurological disease, renal disease and purpura (n = 41).

Heterozygous group (n = 21) included unaffected siblings carrying one pathogenic mutation in the ATP7B gene. Non-WD patients were represented by pediatric patients of GWCMC with exclusion of WD, including acute liver failure by infection or acetaminophen (n = 20), viral hepatitis (n = 38) and nephrotic syndrome (n = 96). Data of the patients with non-WD diseases were retrieved from database of clinical lab in GWCMC.

Healthy controls (n = 372) included 360 children who came for routine physical examination and 12 wild-type siblings of WD patients. Blood samples in healthy controls were originally collected for liver function test and then used for further measurement of serum ceruloplasmin. This study was approved by the ethical clinical research committee of Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, and appropriate informed consents were obtained parental permission for all participants.

Biochemical and genetic analysis

The clinical variables of WD patients and their siblings, including age, sex, family history, clinical manifestations, and physical examinations, were collected from participant medical history and chart record at diagnosis. Serum ceruloplasmin levels were measured by immunonephelometry using the Beckman Coulter Immage 800 with standard reagents (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA).

Genetic analyses for the ATP7B gene mutation were performed in all WD patients and their siblings. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples. DNA sequencing was applied to the entire coding regions of exons 1–21 of the ATP7B gene with adjoining intron boundaries. The exported sequences were aligned and inspected with the reference sequence using DNAMAN software.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Wilson's disease, more specifically with respect to serum ceruloplasmin and urinary copper excretion, AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend to obtain serum ceruloplasmin (and serum copper in selected cases) and basal 24-hour urinary copper excretion measurement in patients with suspected WD.

### Urinary copper excretion before and after oral intake of D-penicillamine in parents of patients with Wilson's disease [^1168xqRc]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary copper excretion higher than 100 μg/24 h is useful for diagnosing Wilson's disease. d-Penicillamine challenge test may produce higher levels than 1400 μg/24 h, allowing for better diagnostic accuracy. This study investigated whether heterozygotes reach this value and compared copper serum levels, ceruloplasmin, and urinary copper excretion before and after administering d-penicillamine to the parents of Wilson's disease patients.

Methods

Fifty parents of adult patients were enrolled to obtain copper serum levels and ceruloplasmin along with 24-h urinary copper excretion before and after administering 1g d-penicillamine.

Results

Serum ceruloplasmin and copper levels were significantly lower in fathers than in mothers (mean 21.8×27.8 mg%; 71.4×88.0 μg%; p ≤ 0.001). The mean of basal 24-h urinary copper excretion was higher in fathers (26.2×18.7 μg/24 h, p = 0.01), but did not differ between the genders after d-penicillamine (521.7×525.3, range 31.6–1085.1 μg/24h, p = 0.8).

Conclusions

The mean values of serum copper, ceruloplasmin, and basal urinary copper excretion were different between males and females. The current diagnostic threshold of 24-h urinary copper excretion after d-penicillamine was not reached by heterozygotes. The increased urinary copper excretion after d-penicillamine challenge was much higher than fivefold the upper limit of normal urinary copper excretion in the majority of heterozygotes and should not be taken into account when diagnosing Wilson's disease.

Serum ceruloplasmin levels in non-WD patients with renal or hepatic diseases

Serum ceruloplasmin level was measured in 154 patients with non-WD diseases, including acute liver failure, viral hepatitis and nephrotic syndrome. The mean age of these non-WD patients was 4.9 ± 3.7 years (ranging from 1 month – 15.3 years) (Table 3). All non-WD patients had serum ceruloplasmin level > 20 mg/dL, with the mean level of serum ceruloplasmin (28.6 ± 11.8 mg/dL) much higher than that in WD patients (p < 0.001), but lower than healthy controls (p < 0.001).

### Normal ceruloplasmin in Wilson's disease… [^116bNxjf]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Deficiency of ceruloplasmin, a copper-binding α2-globulin, is considered to be a primary feature of Wilson's disease, or hepatolenticular degeneration. 1, 2 In almost all instances of this disease this protein is present in small amounts averaging 10 mg/100 ml, whereas the normal is about 30 mg. However, there have been a number of cases reported in which ceruloplasmin has been found to be within the normal range. For this reason the pathogenic role of ceruloplasmin deficiency in this disorder has been questioned by Rosenoer3 in presenting such a case, a 14-year-old girl with neurologic dysfunction but no symptoms referable to the liver. The patients of Enger4 and Sass Kortsak5 demonstrated cirrhosis, Kayser-Fleischer rings, and cupriuria, but no neurologic defects; these too had normal ceruloplasmin. In Walshe's6 cases only the liver defects of the disease were found in one while another: 371–376.

### Assessment of the diagnostic value of serum ceruloplasmin for Wilson's disease in children [^112Y5sEh]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

The ROC curve has been used to investigate the optimal cutoff value of serum ceruloplasmin for early diagnosis of WD. It is controversial for optimal cutoff value of serum ceruloplasmin levels for diagnosis of WD, which is from 11.5 mg/dL to 20 mg/dL. It has been reported that in the patients with acute liver failure, the conventional cutoff of serum ceruloplasmin level at 20 mg/dL only provided a diagnostic sensitivity of 21% and specificity of 84% for WD. However, most of these studies had some degrees of bias in patient population, with either very few amount of pediatric WD patients or too much more WD patients with neurological symptoms, therefore may not provide an optimal cutoff value in children. In the present study, the ROC curve analyses showed the optimal cutoff value of serum ceruloplasmin is 16.85 mg/dL, with a sensitivity of 95.9% and specificity of 93.6% for diagnosis of WD in children. Using the conventional cutoff value of serum ceruloplasmin 20 mg/dL, the sensitivity is 98.1% and a specificity is 86.5%. Our finding was consistent with that in another Chinese study for WD adult patients, indicating that the threshold of serum ceruloplasmin of 16.8 mg/dL may be more accurate and favor higher specialty for diagnosis of WD in children as well as adults.

### Concordance rates of Wilson's disease phenotype among siblings [^117EMwHG]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Subjects

After obtaining approval from the bioethical committee, index cases (ICs) and their siblings with a confirmed diagnosis of WD and full clinical information (described below) were identified from our registry of 609 patients. All of them underwent clinical investigation and received a diagnosis of WD at the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology in Warsaw. Diagnosis was based on clinical features, the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, serum ceruloplasmin and copper levels, and 24-h urine copper concentration. In most cases, DNA analysis was performed and APT7B mutations were identified according to the method described below.

The following data were included in the analysis:
age at symptoms onset (first clinical signs strongly suggestive of WD in symptomatic patients)
clinical signs at onset: hepatic or neurological
age at diagnosis
biochemical parameters at diagnosis, including serum ceruloplasmin, serum copper, and copper concentration in a 24-h urine sample
mutation status of the carrier

All ICs were divided into two main groups based on their initial predominant symptoms of WD (i.e. hepatic or neurological) according to the phenotypic classification of Wilson's disease proposed by Ferenci et al in. Siblings were similarly grouped or recognized as presymptomatic (i.e. without signs, symptoms, or laboratory findings suggestive of WD) prior to diagnosis. Hepatic signs and symptoms included abdominal pain, jaundice, ascites, acute/chronic liver failure, hemostatic disturbance, history of hemolytic anemia, and abnormal liver tests. Neurological signs and symptoms included tremor, dystonia, speech, facial expression, gait disturbances, and ataxia, as well as neuropsychiatric disturbances like mood, emotional and behavioral control imbalance, and frank psychosis.

Dividing main groups of patients into subgroups according to the mutation status of the ICs and siblings resulted in patient populations that were too small for genotype-phenotype analysis. Therefore, only basic genetic data was analyzed by subgroup.

Laboratory examinations

Serum ceruloplasmin levels were measured using the improved colorimetric enzymatic assay developed by Ravin. Serum copper concentration and 24-h urinary copper excretion were measured using flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). ATP7B genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and/or direct ATP7B gene sequencing, as described previously (Gromadzka et al).

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^111E19aA]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Specific diagnostic challenges — nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): Hepatic steatosis in WD may be as severe as in NAFLD and children may have extensive steatosis without prominent hepatic inflammation; WD may also show histological features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) including Mallory–Denk bodies. Differentiation from NAFLD may be possible via basal 24-h urinary copper excretion, which is low in NAFLD, and by hepatic copper determination, as hepatic parenchymal copper content is strikingly low in NAFLD compared with WD. Serum ceruloplasmin may run toward low-normal in NAFLD but rarely reaches subnormal or WD-suggestive levels, and concurrence of NAFLD and WD may become more common with increasing obesity.

### Performance of relative exchangeable copper for the diagnosis of Wilson disease in acute liver failure [^113tLamh]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

The calculated non‐ceruloplasmin‐bound copper (NCC) has been historically used to monitor the evolution of WD, but it has never been validated for diagnosis. Several limitations have been raised against the utilisation of this method, particularly its dependence on the method employed for the ceruloplasmin determination, which can sometimes lead to negative and hard‐to‐interpret values.

A different assay to directly determine the NCC is known as the exchangeable copper (CuEXC) and represents the labile portion of copper bound to albumin and other peptides but not to ceruloplasmin.

The ratio of the CuEXC to total serum copper is known as Relative exchangeable copper (REC). The REC has demonstrated its utility in the diagnosis of WD. In a previous study, we reported that both the sensitivity and specificity of the REC for the diagnosis of WD were 100%, comparing cohorts of adults and children with WD with other hepatic diseases in a chronic and stable setting, thus not including any case of ALF. The present study aims to evaluate the performance of the REC in diagnosing WD in ALF.

### Screening for Wilson disease in acute liver failure: a comparison of currently available diagnostic tests [^114TdZxs]. Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Acute liver failure (ALF) due to Wilson disease (WD) is invariably fatal without emergency liver transplantation. Therefore, rapid diagnosis of WD should aid prompt transplant listing. To identify the best method for diagnosis of ALF due to WD (ALF-WD), data and serum were collected from 140 ALF patients (16 with WD), 29 with other chronic liver diseases and 17 with treated chronic WD. Ceruloplasmin (Cp) was measured by both oxidase activity and nephelometry and serum copper levels by atomic absorption spectroscopy. In patients with ALF, a serum Cp < 20 mg/dL by the oxidase method provided a diagnostic sensitivity of 21% and specificity of 84% while, by nephelometry, a sensitivity of 56% and specificity of 63%. Serum copper levels exceeded 200 microg/dL in all ALF-WD patients measured (13/16), but were also elevated in non-WD ALF. An alkaline phosphatase (AP) to total bilirubin (TB) ratio < 4 yielded a sensitivity of 94%, specificity of 96%, and a likelihood ratio of 23 for diagnosing fulminant WD. In addition, an AST:ALT ratio > 2.2 yielded a sensitivity of 94%, a specificity of 86%, and a likelihood ratio of 7 for diagnosing fulminant WD. Combining the tests provided a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 100%.

Conclusion

Conventional WD testing utilizing serum ceruloplasmin and/or serum copper levels are less sensitive and specific in identifying patients with ALF-WD than other available tests. More readily available laboratory tests including alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin and serum aminotransferases by contrast provides the most rapid and accurate method for diagnosis of ALF due to WD.

### Wilson disease: a diagnostic challenge in a patient with alcoholic liver disease [^115chJGh]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 32-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis presented with worsening abdominal distension and jaundice. He was diagnosed with cirrhosis 2years prior after a hospitalisation for acute liver failure, during which viral, autoimmune and metabolic workup was unrevealing. Heavy alcohol consumption was his only obvious risk factor for liver disease, so his decompensation was attributed to alcohol. At the present time, he was admitted with acute-on-chronic liver failure and acute renal failure. The severity of his presentation and the disproportionately mild elevation in alkaline phosphatase relative to his hyperbilirubinaemia prompted repeating a ceruloplasmin level, which, though previously normal, was now low, and eventually led to a diagnosis of Wilson disease (WD) with concomitant alcoholic liver disease. Clinicians must recognise limitations in ceruloplasmin and copper levels when screening for WD and maintain suspicion for WD in young patients, even if there is an already established aetiology of liver disease.

### Decision pop-up tool to alter ceruloplasmin ordering patterns… [^1113LRkC]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

Guidelines suggest testing for Wilson disease with ceruloplasmin blood levels after excluding common liver diseases and, given the rarity of late-onset Wilson disease, recommends rarely testing patients older than 55 years. 4 We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the effect of a decision support tool on ceruloplasmin use by measuring use rates 7 months before and 7 months after implementing an electronic pop-up in electronic medical record system at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The study reviewed records from October 1, 2013, through November 27, 2014. The secondary outcome was the number of orders made for patients older than 55 years. Ceruloplasmin values lower than 20 mg/dL were considered positive for Wilson disease. 4 Diagnoses were determined from confirmatory testing of urine or hepatic copper levels. α1-Antitrypsin levels are often ordered to evaluate liver disease. 2 As such, we were able to compare trends in ceruloplasmin use with α1-antitrypsin use.

There was no reduction in the rate of α1-antitrypsin orders: 449 before and 418 after. Compared with α1-antitrypsin orders, the RR of ceruloplasmin orders decreased from 1. 00 before implementation to
0. 53 after implementation. No new diagnoses of Wilson disease were made during the study period; all results that had tested positive for ceruloplasmin had negative confirmatory urine or hepatitic test results. In this prospective trial, the decision support tool was associated with a reduction in ceruloplasmin overutilization. The findings from our study could inform programs to reduce the number of orders for nondirected tests in other common clinical scenarios, including antibody tests for rheumatotic or infectious diseases or routine blood tests for routine daily blood tests for inpatients. Our results may not be generalizable to centers with other approaches to liver disease.

Further study is needed to extend this intervention into systematic changes including reflex testing of rare conditions after common diseases have been excluded or restricting testing options for clinicians. In summary, a simple decision support tool that interrupts workflow can reduce overtesting. A pop-up screen intervention can be used for other conditions for which nondirected testing is common.

### Is low serum tocopherol in Wilson's disease a significant symptom? [^111iDECR]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Free radical mediated injury is increasingly recognized in many metabolic diseases including Wilson's disease (WD). Use of antioxidants as an adjunctive therapy in WD may have therapeutic significance.

Aim

The aim of the study was to correlate serum levels of tocopherols with serum copper and ceruloplasmin and clinical status of these patients.

Methods

Serum levels of tocopherol of were measured spectrophotometrically using the Emmerie-Engel reaction in 34 patients from a large cohort of WD being followed up at a tertiary care center.

Results

Majority of patients were male (M/F = 23:11). The mean serum copper was 43.6 ± 26.2 microg/dl (range = 10–121 microg/dl) and serum ceruloplasmin was 5.6 ± 5.5 mg/dl (range = 0–30 mg/dl). The mean serum tocopherol level was 0.68 ± 0.18 mg/dl (range = 0.23–1.14 mg/dl) and compared to the control (1.07 ± 0.17 mg/dl), nearly 59% of patients had decreased levels (p < 0.001). No significant correlation was noted between low serum tocopherol levels and serum copper levels, Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) scores and CHU staging. However, serum tocopherol levels were lower in patients with relatively short duration of treatment (7.8 years vs. 12.4 years).

Conclusion

Decreased levels of serum tocopherol were detected in 59% of patients compared to controls. However, low tocopherol levels did not correlate with clinical status or biochemical parameters of WD, except for relatively shorter duration of treatment. Further studies, especially in newly diagnosed patients, need to be done to validate the role of low tocopherol levels in Wilson's disease.

### Long-term urinary copper excretion on chelation therapy in children with Wilson disease [^112fZATD]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

In Wilson disease (WD), 24-hour urinary copper excretion (UCE) is recommended to be used for diagnosis. It may be a useful tool to assess the efficacy of treatment during follow-up; however, there are limited data regarding the cutoff value of 24-hour UCE during follow-up in children. Therefore, we aim to evaluate the clinical use of 24-hour UCE during follow-up in children with WD.

Patients and Methods

Medical records of children diagnosed with WD at Kings' College Hospital from 2005 to 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. The UCE, serum copper, and ceruloplasmin levels, tested during follow-up, were statistically analyzed.

Results

Over the median duration of 7 years (range 1.4–14.4), 28 patients (age ranged 3.8–17.3 years) had UCE tests during follow-up. Of those, 21 patients had at least one 24-hour UCE test and 7 children had only spot UCE tests. In comparison with the level of 24-hour UCE collected at the first visit after penicillamine challenge test, the median excretion rate was significantly reduced over the follow-up period (P < 0.001), from 26.2 to 8.9μmol/day following 1–2 years of therapy (P = 0.15), then reduced significantly to 2.2μmol/day after 3–4 years (P = 0.009), and 5.6μmol/day at > 5 years of follow-up (P = 0.003).

Conclusions

Our study suggests that within 1 year of treatment, the level of nonceruloplasmin-bound copper concentration (NCC) drops to < 0.8μmol/L. In the absence of progressive liver disease or signs of copper deficiency, 24-hour UCE decreases to ≤ 8μmol/day and < 6μmol/day after 1 and 5 years of treatment, respectively.

### Assessment of the diagnostic value of serum ceruloplasmin for Wilson's disease in children [^1119H7ka]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene. The ATP7B protein is a copper-transporting ATPase expressed predominantly in the liver and to a lesser extent in most other tissues. Mutations in the ATP7B gene lead to failure of copper transport from hepatocytes into bile, resulting in Wilson disease, a copper toxicity disorder characterized by a dramatic build-up of intracellular hepatic copper with subsequent hepatic and neurological abnormalities. If WD is not recognized and treated early, hepatic and neurologic damage may be rapid and fatal. Therefore, early diagnosis is crucial to prevent the progression of the disease and to approach a good outcome of WD.

Ferenci et al. proposed a conventional diagnostic scoring system for WD, including low serum ceruloplasmin levels, elevated urinary copper excretion, KF ring, liver copper content and genetic findings. Socha et al. further published a position paper of specific diagnostic criteria for WD in children. With the application of Ferenci scoring system, WD can be identified and diagnosed easily when the patients present with typical symptoms. However, the diagnosis of WD is not easy in asymptomatic children who presented with no clinical manifestation but isolated elevation of serum aminotransferases, and in patients in the situation of acute liver failure.

Ceruloplasmin is the main copper-carrying protein in blood. With the defect of copper transportation, non-copper bound apo-ceruloplasmin is rapidly degraded. Serum ceruloplasmin level is typically decreased in most of WD patients, but not in all of them. On the other hand, serum ceruloplasmin level may vary with age, change with inflammation or estrogen, and decrease in some ATP7B heterozygous carriers or in other conditions with liver or renal disease. According to the diagnostic consensus, serum ceruloplasmin level < 20 mg/dL is conventionally considered as one of the major diagnostic thresholds for WD. Socha et al. suggested that WD should be highly suspected with serum ceruloplasmin level < 10 mg/dl in children. Although serum ceruloplasmin is never alone criteria for the diagnosis of WD, it is one of the major diagnostic parameters for reflecting abnormal copper metabolism. There have been few studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of serum ceruloplasmin in WD children. Therefore, it is important to establish the age and gender specific reference of serum ceruloplasmin levels in healthy children, and evaluate the diagnostic criteria of serum ceruloplasmin level for WD during early childhood.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Wilson's disease, more specifically with respect to serum ceruloplasmin and urinary copper excretion, AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that basal 24-hour urinary excretion of copper in WD is typically > 100 mcg/24 hours in symptomatic patients, but a lower reference value of > 40 mcg/24 hours may indicate WD in asymptomatic patients or pediatric patients, and therefore requires clinical correlation and further investigation.

Guidance statements 21–22 — regular monitoring in Wilson disease specifies that liver biochemistries and international normalized ratio (INR), complete blood count, routine urinalysis (especially with D-penicillamine or trientine), and physical examination should be performed regularly, at least twice per year, and patients receiving chelation require ongoing complete blood count and urinalysis. The 24-h urinary copper excretion while on medication, or after a temporary period (48 h) off D-penicillamine or trientine, should be measured yearly and more frequently if adherence is questioned or dosage is adjusted, and serum copper and ceruloplasmin may be trended because very high or very low serum copper, or serum copper disproportionately high for simultaneous serum ceruloplasmin, may disclose exogenous copper intake or total-body depletion.

Serum ceruloplasmin — diagnostic performance and cutoffs: Serum ceruloplasmin concentrations below 20, 14, and 10 mg/dl showed positive predictive values of 48.3%, 100%, and 100%, respectively, and negative predictive values of 98.7%, 97.1%, and 91.9%; a serum ceruloplasmin threshold of 14 mg/dl, measured immunologically, achieved 100% sensitivity and specificity in the validation group, and all simple heterozygotes with subnormal serum ceruloplasmin had values > 14 mg/dl. In the Leipzig score the informative cutoff is 10 mg/dl, and some regard serum ceruloplasmin < 5 mg/dl as highly informative for the diagnosis of Wilson disease (WD).

### Assessment of the diagnostic value of serum ceruloplasmin for Wilson's disease in children [^1112KpbB]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Serum ceruloplasmin in healthy children

Serum ceruloplasmin levels were measured in 372 healthy children from the age of newborn to 15 years. Of these participants, 218 (58.6%) were boys, with a mean age of 6.8 ± 4.2 years and 154 (41.4%) were girls, with a mean age of 6.2 ± 3.8 years. The mean level of serum ceruloplasmin in these healthy controls was 30.7 ± 7.8 mg/dL. Among them, 30(8.1%) had serum ceruloplasmin level < 20 mg/dL, whereas 13 (3.5%) had the level < 15 mg/dL.

Age specific reference value of serum ceruloplasmin level was analyzed (Table 1 and Fig. 1). These healthy children were partitioned into 16 age subgroups. Serum ceruloplasmin was at the lowest level (25.5 ± 10.1 mg/dL) in children younger than 6 months, then rapidly increased to 33.0 ± 9.3 mg/dL by the age of 1 year, and maintained from 26 to 33 mg/dl after age of 6 months. There was no age specific difference of serum ceruloplasmin levels in healthy children (p > 0.05).

Cp, ceruloplasmin; 0–5, 5–10, 10–15, 15–20 and ≥ 20 represented the ranges of serum ceruloplasmin (mg/dL); Number represented the number of the children with specific range of serum ceruloplasmin

Fig. 1
Gender difference of serum ceruloplasmin was analyzed among healthy children, WD patients and heterozygotes. A There were no significant gender differences of serum ceruloplasmin levels intra each age subgroup among WD patients and among healthy children. B Serum ceruloplasmin level was higher in boys than girls among healthy children (p < 0.01) and also among WD patients (p < 0.05). The mean levels of serum ceruloplasmin in WD patients were much lower than that in healthy controls and heterozygotes

Wilson disease — monitoring and adherence assessment during therapy includes targeted examination, history, and laboratory surveillance. Physical examination should look for evidence of liver disease and neurological symptoms; for patients on D-penicillamine, cutaneous changes should be sought, and history should include questioning about psychiatric symptoms, especially depression. Repeat examination for KF rings should be performed if there is a question of adherence. Laboratory testing at baseline and over time should include liver biochemistries, tests of hepatic synthetic function, total blood count, indices of copper metabolism (including 24-h urinary copper excretion), and routine urinalysis for those on chelation therapy. Estimated NCC may provide the best guide to treatment efficacy but may be incalculable if either parameter is below the laboratory detection limit. Evidence of nonadherence includes clinical worsening, elevation of liver tests, and increased urinary copper excretion; hepatic deterioration may follow. Disproportionately low urinary copper excretion on chelation relative to steady state values can indicate overtreatment and is often accompanied by lower serum ceruloplasmin and serum copper and therefore lower NCC; neutropenia, anemia, and hyperferritinemia can also be present. Recently stopped chelation therapy or subtherapeutic dosages may also yield low 24-h urinary copper excretion, but typically with elevated NCC or CuEXC or increased serum copper. In patients taking zinc, adherence can be checked by measuring serum zinc or 24-h urinary zinc excretion.

Ceruloplasmin — interpretation for Wilson disease states that this 132-kDa glycoprotein contains six copper atoms per molecule and copper within ceruloplasmin accounts for 90% of circulating copper. Serum ceruloplasmin is an acute-phase reactant and is elevated by acute inflammation and by hyperestrogenemia in pregnancy, estrogen supplementation, and use of some oral contraceptive pills. Physiologically, levels are very low in early infancy to the age of 6 months, peak in early childhood at approximately 30–50 mg/dl, then settle to the adult range. In Wilson disease, serum ceruloplasmin is decreased in most patients, but a value within the normal range does not exclude the diagnosis. A level typically below the laboratory determined lower level of normal (usually approximately 20 mg/dl) has been considered consistent with Wilson disease, and diagnostic if associated with KF rings. Other disorders associated with low ceruloplasmin include nonselective renal protein loss, protein-losing enteropathy, severe chronic liver disease with global hepatic synthetic defect, absolute copper deficiency, after gastric or bariatric surgery, and chronic ingestion of zinc in excess. As a screening or diagnostic test, serum ceruloplasmin has major limitations and may be particularly uninformative diagnostically in children.

### Concordance rates of Wilson's disease phenotype among siblings [^112KdhRa]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the functional disruption of adenosine triphosphatase 7B (ATP7B), which results in positive copper balance. Although the primary manifestations of the disease are hepatic or neurological in scope, the factors that cause a very diverse picture of WD are not well researched. We compared the first clinical presentation, ages of onset and diagnosis, copper metabolism parameters, and ceruloplasmin levels between index cases (ICs) and their siblings. We examined 73 ICs and 95 siblings from 73 families, including a total of 168 patients with biochemical and genetically confirmed WD diagnoses. We observed an 86% concordance rate of primary clinical symptoms among ICs with hepatic symptoms and their siblings. There was 66% concordance among ICs with neurological symptoms and their siblings. No differences regarding age at onset of symptoms or copper metabolism parameters at diagnosis were identified between hepatic ICs and their siblings. The age at symptom onset did not differ between neurological ICs and their siblings, although ICs presented lower ceruloplasmin and serum copper levels. These results demonstrate a high intra-familial concordance of the clinical and biochemical presentation of WD, suggesting that similar factors shared within the same families strongly influence the disease presentation.

### Pilot study of mass screening for Wilson's disease in Korea [^112yVmci]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism with copper accumulation in the liver as well as in the central nervous system. Treatment of WD includes oral chelating agents and diet and it is effective. However, once irreversible damage has occurred, the effect of treatment is diminished and the patient's quality of life is compromised. It is estimated that at least half of the patients with WD remain undiagnosed and die of untreated disease. Early detection of patients presymptomatically has been hampered by the lack of effective methods for mass screening. Recently, a sandwich ELISA method for ceruloplasmin measurement in blood spots was developed. We have used this method to analyze blood specimens collected on filter paper from 3667 children aged 3 months-15 years. The mean value of ceruloplasmin was 30.5 ± 9.5 mg/dL. Among these children, we identified one WD case, a 32-month-old boy with markedly reduced ceruloplasmin concentration (2.3 mg/dL). Measurement of CP level in dried blood spot sample is proposed as a reliable method for population screening of WD.

### Wilson's disease and other neurological copper disorders [^1147L3JA]. The Lancet: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

The copper metabolism disorder Wilson's disease was first defined in 1912. Wilson's disease can present with hepatic and neurological deficits, including dystonia and parkinsonism. Early-onset presentations in infancy and late-onset manifestations in adults older than 70 years of age are now well recognised. Direct genetic testing for ATP7B mutations are increasingly available to confirm the clinical diagnosis of Wilson's disease, and results from biochemical and genetic prevalence studies suggest that Wilson's disease might be much more common than previously estimated. Early diagnosis of Wilson's disease is crucial to ensure that patients can be started on adequate treatment, but uncertainty remains about the best possible choice of medication. Furthermore, Wilson's disease needs to be differentiated from other conditions that also present clinically with hepatolenticular degeneration or share biochemical abnormalities with Wilson's disease, such as reduced serum ceruloplasmin concentrations. Disordered copper metabolism is also associated with other neurological conditions, including a subtype of axonal neuropathy due to ATP7A mutations and the late-onset neurodegenerative disorders Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

### Serum ceruloplasmin oxidase activity is a sensitive and highly specific diagnostic marker for Wilson's disease [^112V74X8]. Journal of Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

A low serum ceruloplasmin concentration is considered diagnostic for Wilson's disease. We aimed to evaluate an enzymatic test for ceruloplasmin oxidase activity and to compare it with the routinely used immunological ceruloplasmin measurement.

Methods

Serum ceruloplasmin was measured enzymatically with o-dianisidine dihydrochloride as substrate and immunologically. 110 Wilson's disease patients, 52 healthy controls, and 51 patients with impaired liver function not due to Wilson's disease were analyzed. Assay performance was tested by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, McNemar test, and Spearman's rank correlation.

Results

The greatest sum of sensitivity and specificity was seen for the enzymatic ceruloplasmin assay at a cut-off point of 55 U/L (93.6% and 100%, respectively) and for the immunologic assay at a cut-off point of 0.19 g/L (93.6% and 78.8%, respectively). For healthy controls, the differences in specificity between both assays were statistically significant (McNemar, p = 0.02). When additionally including patients with impaired liver function into the control group the specificity declined to 84.5% for the enzymatic assay and to 68.9% for the immunologic assay. The correlation between the enzymatic and immunologic assay was high in healthy controls (r = 0.94), but weaker in Wilson's disease patients (r = 0.70) and patients with impaired liver function not due to Wilson's disease (r = 0.65).

Conclusions

For the enzymatic assay the best cut-off point for predicting Wilson's disease was estimated to be 55 U/L. Our data suggest that the enzymatic ceruloplasmin assay is superior to the immunologic assay in diagnosing Wilson's disease and should become the preferred method.

### Present situation of biomarkers for copper status [^116Ctfqu]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Serum or plasma copper and ceruloplasmin concentrations are the most widely used laboratory indicators to evaluate copper status. Both indicators are decreased in moderate or severe copper deficiency. The activity of several cuproenzymes is decreased in mild copper deficiency. However, their use is limited by the nonexistence of standardized assays and high interindividual variability and because some of these indicators are affected by other conditions. Recently, it was shown that the protein expression of the copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS) is increased in erythrocytes of rodents with mild copper deficiency. However, no traditional laboratory indicators have been identified as potential early markers of copper excess. It is possible that the biomarkers studied so far are not sensitive enough to detect an increase in body copper before the appearance of functional or clinical effects or that the homeostatic mechanisms are so strong that no significant changes in body copper occur with mild-to-moderate copper exposure. The identification of appropriate biomarkers for early detection of an increase in body copper represents a major challenge for further research, and the development of new approaches, such as network biology, allows us to search and propose new candidates to be studied. Recently, we found that CCS mRNA abundance in mononuclear blood cells significantly decreased after copper supplementation. The usefulness of this indicator to detect an increase in body copper should be assessed in clinical trials.

### Biomarkers for diagnosis of Wilson's disease [^114WpeTG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Wilson's disease, first described by Samuel Wilson in 1912, is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder resulting from mutations in the ATP7B gene. The disease develops as a consequence of copper accumulating in affected tissues. There is no gold standard for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, which is often delayed due to the non-specific clinical features and the need for a combination of clinical and laboratory tests for diagnosis. This delay may in turn affect clinical outcome and has implications for other family members in terms of diagnosis. The Leipzig criteria were established to help standardise diagnosis and management. However, it should be emphasised that these criteria date from 2003, and many of these have not been formally evaluated; this review examines the evidence behind biochemical testing for Wilson's disease.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of three biochemical tests at specified cut-off levels for Wilson's disease. The index tests covered by this Cochrane Review are caeruloplasmin, 24-hour urinary copper and hepatic copper content. These tests were evaluated in those with suspected Wilson's disease and appropriate controls (either healthy or those with chronic liver disease other than Wilson's). In the absence of a gold standard for diagnosing Wilson's disease, we have used the Leipzig criteria as a clinical reference standard. To investigate whether index tests should be performed in all individuals who have been recommended for testing for Wilson's disease, or whether these tests should be limited to subgroups of individuals.

Search Methods

We identified studies by extensive searching of, e.g. the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, the Web of Science and clinical trial registries (29 May 2019). Date of the most recent search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Inborn Errors of Metabolism Register: 29 May 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included prospective and retrospective cohort studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of an index test using the Leipzig criteria as a clinical reference standard for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently reviewed and extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of each included study using the QUADAS-2 tool. We had planned to undertake meta-analyses of the sensitivity, specificity at relevant cut-offs for each of the biochemical tests for Wilson's, however, due to differences in the methods used for each biochemical index test, it was not possible to combine the results in meta-analyses and hence these are described narratively.

Main Results

Eight studies, involving 5699 participants (which included 1009 diagnosed with Wilson's disease) were eligible for inclusion in the review. Three studies involved children only, one adults only and the four remaining studies involved both children and adults. Two evaluated participants with hepatic signs and six with a combination of hepatic and neurological signs and symptoms of Wilson's disease, as well as pre-symptomatic individuals. The studies were of variable methodological quality; with high risk if bias for participant selection and the reference standard used being of greatest methodological concern. Key differences between studies include differences in assay methodology, different cut-off values for diagnostic thresholds, different age and ethnicity groups. Concerns around study design imply that diagnostic accuracy figures may not transfer to populations outside of the relevant study.

Index Test

caeruloplasmin Five studies evaluated various thresholds of caeruloplasmin (4281 participants, of which 541 had WD). For caeruloplasmin a cut-off of 0.2 g/L as in the Leipzig criteria achieved a sensitivity of 77.1% to 99%, with variable specificity of 55.9% to 82.8%. Using the cut-off of 0.1 g/L of the Leipzig criteria seemed to lower the sensitivity overall, 65% to 78.9%, while increasing the specificity to 96.6% to 100%.

Index Test

hepatic copper Four studies evaluated various thresholds of hepatic copper (1150 participants, of which 367 had WD). The hepatic copper cut-off of 4 μmol/g used in the Leipzig criteria achieved a sensitivity of 65.7% to 94.4%, with a variable specificity of 52.2% to 98.6%.

Index Test

24-hour urinary copper Three studies evaluated various thresholds of 24-hour urinary copper (268 participants, of which 101 had WD). For 24-hour urinary copper, a cut-off of 0.64 to 1.6 μmol/24 hours used in the Leipzig criteria achieved a variable sensitivity of 50.0% to 80.0%, with a specificity of 75.6% to 98.3%.

Authors' Conclusions

The cut-offs used for caeruloplasmin, 24-hour urinary copper and hepatic copper for diagnosing Wilson's disease are method-dependent and require validation in the population in which such index tests are going to be used. Binary cut-offs and use of single-test strategies to rule Wilson's disease in or out is not supported by the evidence in this review. There is insufficient evidence to inform testing in specific subgroups, defined by age, ethnicity or clinical subgroups.

### Assessment of the diagnostic value of serum ceruloplasmin for Wilson's disease in children [^1162GEGu]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Serum ceruloplasmin is one of the major diagnostic parameters for Wilson's disease (WD). Age and gender difference of serum ceruloplasmin remain controversy. This study aims to assess diagnostic value of serum ceruloplasmin level for WD in children up to age of 15 years.

Methods

Serum ceruloplasmin levels were measured in 317 WD patients, 21 heterozygotes, 372 healthy control children and 154 non-WD patients with other liver diseases. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the diagnostic accuracy of serum ceruloplasmin for WD in children.

Results

Among healthy controls, serum ceruloplasmin level was slightly low in the infants younger than 6 months, and then maintained from 26 to 33 mg/dl after age of 6 months. A total of 8.1% of healthy children had levels of serum ceruloplasmin < 20 mg/dL. Serum ceruloplasmin level was 5.7 ± 4.7 mg/dl in WD patients, and 25.6 ± 5.9 mg/dl in heterozygous carriers. Only 1.9% of WD patients had serum ceruloplasmin levels > 20 mg/dL. Serum ceruloplasmin levels had gender difference, being higher in healthy boys than healthy girls, and higher in asymptomatic WD boys than asymptomatic WD girls (p < 0.01, p < 0.05). Serum ceruloplasmin levels also presented genotypic difference. WD patients with R778L homozygotes exhibited lower levels of serum ceruloplasmin than the patients without R778L (p < 0.05). The ROC curve revealed that serum ceruloplasmin level, at a cutoff value of 16.8 mg/dL, had the highest AUC value (0.990) with a sensitivity of 95.9% and a specificity of 93.6%.

Conclusions

Serum ceruloplasmin is one of sensitive diagnostic biomarkers for WD in children. Gender and genotypic difference of serum ceruloplasmin level should be considered. The cutoff value of serum ceruloplasmin level < 16.8 mg/dL may provide the highest accuracy for diagnosis of WD in children.

### Diagnosis and phenotypic classification of Wilson disease [^112XXQvu]. Liver International (2003). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Ferenci scoring system for Wilson's disease" for Wilson's disease.

The Ferenci scoring system is a clinical calculator specifically designed for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, a rare inherited disorder that causes copper to accumulate in the liver, brain, and other vital organs. This scoring system is based on a combination of clinical, biochemical, and genetic parameters, including the presence of K-F rings, neurological symptoms, serum ceruloplasmin levels, hepatic copper content, and ATP7B mutation analysis.

The Ferenci scoring system is used to establish a diagnosis of Wilson's disease in patients presenting with liver disease, neurological symptoms, or psychiatric disturbances, especially when these symptoms are unexplained or when there is a family history of Wilson's disease. It is particularly useful in cases where the diagnosis is uncertain based on initial testing.

The scoring system is not applicable to asymptomatic patients or those without any clinical or biochemical evidence suggestive of Wilson's disease. It should also not be used in isolation but in conjunction with other diagnostic tests and clinical judgment.

The Ferenci scoring system evaluates the likelihood of Wilson's Disease (WD) using specific clinical and genetic indicators. Each input corresponds to a particular sign or symptom associated with Wilson's Disease, and each option carries a specific score. This score helps determine the probability of the disease being present.

Here's how the scoring is structured:

- **Kayser-Fleischer rings**:

- Absent = 0
- Present = 2

- **Neuropsychiatric symptoms suggestive of Wilson's Disease**:

- Absent = 0
- Present = 2

- **Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia**:

- Absent = 0
- Present = 1

- **Urinary copper (in the absence of acute hepatitis)**:
- Normal = 0
- 1–2x upper limit of normal = 1
- > 2x upper limit of normal = 2
- Normal, but > 5x upper limit of normal after challenge with 2 x 0.5 g D-penicillamine = 2

- **Liver copper quantitative**:

- Normal = 1
- Up to 5x upper limit of normal = 1
- > 5x upper limit of normal = 2

- Rhodanine-positive hepatocytes (only if quantitative copper measurement is not available):
- Absent = 0
- Present = 1

- Serum ceruloplasmin (normal: > 20 mg/dL):
- Normal = 0
- 10–20 mg/dL = 1
- < 10 mg/dL = 2

- **Mutation analysis**:

- Disease-causing mutations on both chromosomes = 4
- Disease-causing mutations on one chromosome = 1
- No disease-causing mutation detected = 0

After collecting the responses and converting them into scores, you sum these scores to get the total. This total score then leads to an interpretation about the likelihood of Wilson's Disease:

- A score of 4 or more suggests that a diagnosis of WD is highly likely.
- A score of 2 or 3 indicates that WD is probable.
- A score of 1 or less suggests that WD is unlikely.

This scoring system integrates both clinical symptoms and genetic findings to provide a comprehensive assessment of the risk of Wilson's Disease. The calculated score and its interpretation guide clinicians in their diagnostic considerations.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for Wilson's disease, more specifically with respect to liver biopsy, AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that hepatic parenchymal copper content > 250 mcg/g dry weight occurs in most patients, while a lower content still above normal occurs less frequently but should prompt another confirmatory testing. Exclude WD in case of normal hepatic copper content (< 50 mcg/g dry weight) in untreated patients.

### Assessment of the diagnostic value of serum ceruloplasmin for Wilson's disease in children [^113uZ1Gw]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Age specific difference of serum ceruloplasmin level in WD patients was analyzed (Table 1 and Fig. 1). The youngest WD patient was a 7-month-old girl diagnosed through family screening. She was asymptomatic with low serum ceruloplasmin of 4 mg/dL but normal liver function. Among 317 WD patients, the mean level of serum ceruloplasmin varied in different age subgroups. No age specific difference of serum ceruloplasmin level was shown (p > 0.05).

Gender specific difference of serum ceruloplasmin level in WD patients was also analyzed. Of the 317 WD patients, the mean age of boys was 6.2 ± 2.8 years, and that of girls was 5.9 ± 2.9 years. There was no significant gender difference of serum ceruloplasmin among 317 WD patients and inside each age subgroup (Fig. 1). However, among 261 (82.3%) asymptomatic WD patients, serum ceruloplasmin level in 164 boys (6.0 ± 5.1 mg/dL) was significantly higher than that in 97 girls (4.6 ± 3.7 mg/dL) (p < 0.05), exhibiting similar trend with that in healthy children.

The association between clinical manifestation and the level of serum ceruloplasmin in WD patients was analyzed (Table 2). Of 261 asymptomatic WD children, serum ceruloplasmin was significantly lower and the age at diagnosis was much younger while compared with 56 WD children with various clinical symptoms and signs (p < 0.05, p < 0.001). Of 15 WD children with acute liver failure, serum ceruloplasmin was significantly higher and the age at diagnosis was much older while compared with 302 WD children without acute liver failure (p < 0.01, p < 0.001). None of WD patients with acute liver failure had serum ceruloplasmin level > 20 mg/dL.

Diagnostic accuracy of serum ceruloplasmin in Wilson's disease

The ROC curves were constructed by using the data of 317 WD patients, 21 heterozygotes, 372 healthy controls and 154 non-WD patients with renal or hepatic disease. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the conventional cutoff value of 20 mg/dL gave a sensitivity of 98.1% and a specificity of 86.5%, with 63 false positives and 6 false negative. The positive and negative predictive values were 80.8% and 98.7%, respectively. The ROC curve analysis indicated that the cutoff value of serum ceruloplasmin level of 16.85 mg/dL provided the highest AUC value of 0.990 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.985–0.995), with a sensitivity of 95.9% and specificity of 93.6%. The positive and negative predictive values of serum ceruloplasmin level of 16.85 mg/dL were 89.7% and 97.5%, respectively.

### The overuse of serum ceruloplasmin measurement [^111SUkaP]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Wilson disease is rare, found in 3 of 100,000 people (0.03%). Ceruloplasmin is often ordered to evaluate liver enzyme elevations. Because Wilson disease often presents before middle-age, the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease recommends screening patients between the ages of 3 and 55 years with liver abnormalities of uncertain cause. We evaluate guideline adherence and the clinical and economic impact of current clinical use of ceruloplasmin.

Methods

We reviewed all ceruloplasmin measurements at a clinical laboratory that serves a large primary care network, specialty clinics, and a 600-bed tertiary referral center between January 1, 2003, and December 12, 2011.

Results

Ceruloplasmin was measured 5325 times in 5023 unique patients, resulting in 8 (0.16%) new Wilson disease diagnoses. Ceruloplasmin's positive predictive value was 8.4% (95% confidence interval, 7.7–9.3) and false-positive rate was 98.1% (95% confidence interval, 96.2–99.1). A total of 1109 ceruloplasmin levels (20.8%) were ordered in the 1066 patients aged more than 55 years (none with Wilson disease). A "shotgun" approach to liver disease diagnosis was found: Ceruloplasmin was ordered on the same day as hepatitis B (81.0%), hepatitis C (76.0%), autoimmune hepatitis (75.1%), and hemochromatosis (73.1%). Of 424 positive ceruloplasmin results, 91% were not pursued further.

Conclusions

Guideline adherence restricts ceruloplasmin use to a population with a higher pre-test probability of Wilson disease: patients with chronic liver disease aged 3 to 55 years who have been tested for common causes of liver disease. The majority of the serum ceruloplasmin was measured in patients not indicated by the guidelines, resulting in poor test performance and wasted healthcare resources. Our data on ceruloplasmin use could serve as a touchstone for broader discussions on rational clinical decision making.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1163bbjS]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Serum copper and non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC) — definition, calculation, limitations, and alternative assays: Total serum copper (90% of which is nonexchangeable copper within ceruloplasmin) in WD is usually below normal levels, decreased in proportion to the level of ceruloplasmin in the circulation, and with decreased ceruloplasmin during liver injury indicates increased non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC), which is exchangeable and thus bioavailable. As the amount of copper associated with ceruloplasmin is approximately 3.15 μg of copper per milligram of ceruloplasmin, the NCC is the difference between the serum copper concentration in micrograms per deciliter and 3.15 times the serum ceruloplasmin concentration in milligrams per deciliter; NCC is > 25 μg/dl in most untreated patients (expected normal range 10–15 μg/dl), and in ALF due to WD, serum copper is markedly elevated (usually > 200 μg/dl) with NCC likewise elevated. Calculated NCC utilizing ceruloplasmin measured immunologically is inherently flawed because immunologic serum ceruloplasmin overestimates holoceruloplasmin and estimated NCC may yield a zero or negative number and thus be uninterpretable. Alternative approaches include examination of the lower molecular weight fraction below 30-kDa cutoff by centrifugal ultrafiltration and determination of "exchangeable copper" (CuEXC), with the "relative exchangeable copper" (REC) cutoff set at 18.5% distinguishing WD from simple heterozygotes, normal individuals, and various chronic liver diseases; further validation is warranted.

Radiocopper study — this test is based on decreased incorporation of radiocopper into ceruloplasmin in Wilson disease (WD), with failure of incorporation occurring in all patients with WD but rarely in nonaffected carriers; despite logistical challenges, advances have improved diagnostic accuracy and expanded use. It may be useful when the genotype is difficult to evaluate or includes a variant of unknown significance, whereas copper-65 methodology is less effective for distinguishing heterozygote carriers from individuals with WD and is not routinely available.

Wilson disease (WD) — pathophysiology and epidemiology — is defined by impaired ATP7B-mediated copper handling in hepatocytes where absent or impaired function decreases biliary excretion causing toxic hepatic copper accumulation and, when storage is exceeded, copper deposits in extrahepatic organs including the brain, kidneys, and cornea; loss of ATP7B also diminishes incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin leading to low circulating ceruloplasmin. Dietary context notes that the average diet contains 2–5 mg/day of copper and the recommended intake is 0.9 mg/day. WD occurs worldwide with prevalence estimated at approximately 30 per million population.

Wilson disease (WD) neurological presentation — Leipzig diagnostic scoring and baseline testing are specified for patients with a neurological disorder with or without Kayser–Fleischer (KF) rings, and baseline testing consists of serum ceruloplasmin (CPN), basal 24-h urinary copper (Cu), and slit-lamp examination or optical tomography, with the minimum upper limit of normal (ULN) for basal 24-h urinary Cu taken as 40 μg/24 h. Genetic testing is defined as analyzing ATP7B sequence and establishing the presence on each allele of a disease-associated mutation. Numbers in parentheses correspond to the Leipzig score, where a sum of ≥ 4 indicates that WD is highly likely. Points are assigned as follows: CPN (mg/dl) normal ≥ 20 = 0, 10–20 = 1, < 10 = 2; KF rings present = 2, absent = 0; basal 24-h urinary Cu (μg/24 h) < ULN = 0, 1–2× ULN = 1, > 2× ULN = 2; liver Cu (μg/g dry wt liver) > 5× ULN = 2, 50–250 = 1, < 50 = −1; and genetic testing two disease-associated mutations = 4 or one disease-associated mutation = 1. A terminal algorithm outcome explicitly states "Diagnosis of WD established; evaluation for liver disease recommended; genetic testing for confirmation".

American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) acute liver failure — Recommendation 1 addresses testing for Wilson's disease in patients presenting with acute liver failure (ALF) and states the AGA "suggests against routinely testing all patients for Wilson's disease", with a "Conditional recommendation; very low quality of evidence". In settings of high clinical suspicion, testing "can be considered", recognizing "the low positive predictive value", and that ALF management "would not be altered", while detection enables "appropriate post-transplantation management and screening of the patient's family members". Common diagnostic tests include "serum ceruloplasmin, serum and hepatic copper assessment, and 24-hour urine collection for copper", but the tests have "high false-positive and false-negative rates", and ALF-specific diagnostic accuracy data are limited. One study reported serum copper threshold performance: "sensitivity of serum copper greater than 200 ug/dL was 75% and specificity was 96%". Given the "very low prevalence in the ALF population", testing "would have a high negative predictive value but a low positive predictive value".

### Concordance rates of Wilson's disease phenotype among siblings [^1148E4GQ]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the functional disruption of adenosine triphosphatase 7B (ATP7B), which results in positive copper balance. Although the primary manifestations of the disease are hepatic or neurological in scope, the factors that cause a very diverse picture of WD are not well researched. We compared the first clinical presentation, ages of onset and diagnosis, copper metabolism parameters, and ceruloplasmin levels between index cases (ICs) and their siblings. We examined 73 ICs and 95 siblings from 73 families, including a total of 168 patients with biochemical and genetically confirmed WD diagnoses. We observed an 86% concordance rate of primary clinical symptoms among ICs with hepatic symptoms and their siblings. There was 66% concordance among ICs with neurological symptoms and their siblings. No differences regarding age at onset of symptoms or copper metabolism parameters at diagnosis were identified between hepatic ICs and their siblings. The age at symptom onset did not differ between neurological ICs and their siblings, although ICs presented lower ceruloplasmin and serum copper levels. These results demonstrate a high intra-familial concordance of the clinical and biochemical presentation of WD, suggesting that similar factors shared within the same families strongly influence the disease presentation.

### EASL-ERN clinical practice guidelines on Wilson's disease [^114riHm4]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism which affects the liver, brain and other organs. Diagnosis is based on: clinical features; biochemical tests, including plasma ceruloplasmin concentration, 24-h urinary copper excretion, copper content in the liver; and molecular analysis. Leipzig score and additionally relative exchangeable copper determination are recommended for diagnosis. Pharmacological therapy comprises chelating agents (penicillamine, trientine) and zinc salts, while only chelators are recommended for significant liver disease. Monitoring is based on clinical symptoms, liver tests and copper metabolism (urinary copper excretion, exchangeable copper) to detect poor compliance and over/under-treatment. Acute liver failure is challenging as making a diagnosis is difficult and pharmacological therapy may not be sufficient to save life. Liver transplantation has a well-defined role in Wilsonian acute hepatic failure but may also be considered in neurological disease.

### Truncating mutations in the Wilson disease gene ATP7B are associated with very low serum ceruloplasmin oxidase activity and an early onset of Wilson disease [^115fgeyy]. BMC Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Mutations in the gene ATP7B cause Wilson disease, a copper storage disorder with a high phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. We aimed to evaluate whether 'severe' protein-truncating ATP7B mutations (SMs) are associated with low serum ceruloplasmin oxidase activities and an early age of onset when compared to missense mutations (MMs).

Methods

The clinical phenotype of 59 genetically confirmed WD patients was analyzed retrospectively. Serum ceruloplasmin was measured by its oxidase activity with o-dianisidine dihydrochloride as substrate and immunologically.

Results

Thirty-nine patients had two MMs, 15 had the genotype SM/MM, and 5 patients had two SMs on their ATP7B alleles. Enzymatic and immunologic serum ceruloplasmin levels differed significantly between the three groups (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively). The lowest levels were measured in patients with two SMs (0.0 U/L; IQR, 0.0–0.0 U/L and 0.02 g/L; IQR, 0.01–0.02 g/L, respectively) and the highest in patients with two MMs (17.8 U/L; IQR, 5.8–35.1 U/L and 0.11 g/L; IQR,0.10–0.17 g/L, respectively). The age of onset was also significantly different between the three patient groups (P < 0.05), with SM/SM patients showing the earliest onset (13 years; IQR, 9–13 years) and patients with two MMs showing the latest onset (22 years; IQR, 14–27 years). By ROC curve analysis a ceruloplasmin oxidase level ≤ 5 U/L can predict the presence of at least one SM with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 79.5%.

Conclusions

In our German study cohort truncating ATP7B mutations were associated with lower ceruloplasmin serum oxidase levels and an earlier age of onset when compared to MMs. Measurement of serum ceruloplasmin oxidase might help to predict presence of truncating ATP7B mutations and might facilitate the mutation analysis.

### Assessment of the diagnostic value of serum ceruloplasmin for Wilson's disease in children [^113rrPis]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Genotypic difference of serum ceruloplasmin was also investigated in this study. The genotype of the ATP7B gene was associated with the level of serum ceruloplasmin (Table 4). The patients with the genotype of R778L homozygotes had much lower serum ceruloplasmin level (2.3 ± 0.5 mg/dL) than the patients without R778L (6.2 ± 4.8 mg/dL) (p < 0.05). Previous study reported that R778L homozygotes are associated with lower level of serum ceruloplasmin and the early onset of WD with hepatic presentation. Other study reported that truncating mutations in the ATP7B gene are also associated with very low serum ceruloplasmin level and an early onset of WD. Nicastro et al. reported the potential impact of some genotypes on serum levels of ceruloplasmin in WD patients Taken together, genotype in the ATP7B gene is associated with onset of WD and the level of serum ceruloplasmin. Our study further revealed R778L homozygotes may cause decreased serum ceruloplasmin and hepatic damage at very early age.

In conclusion, serum ceruloplasmin level is one of sensitive biomarkers for early diagnosis of WD in children older than 6 months. Gender and genetic difference of serum ceruloplasmin should be considered at diagnosis and treatment for WD patients. The cutoff value of serum ceruloplasmin level at 16.8 mg/dL may provide the highest accuracy for diagnosis of WD.

### Neurological Wilson's disease without hepatic involvement in an adolescent female [^111S1jcR]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

A female adolescent presented with a 9month history of progressive involuntary movements, initially manifesting as finger tremors and evolving into flinging motions of the extremities, resulting in an inability to walk over the last 4 months. Concurrently, she developed dysarthria. Neurologically, she exhibited normal power, rigidity and brisk deep tendon reflexes, with a downgoing plantar reflex. Contrast-enhanced MRI revealed hyperintensity in bilateral caudate lobes, basal ganglia and pons, indicative of Wilson's disease. Liver function tests and ultrasound were normal while Kayser-Fleischer rings were confirmed by slit lamp examination. Serum ceruloplasmin was low, 24-hour urine copper was elevated (125.5 mcg) and whole exome sequencing identified a heterozygous ATP7B mutation, confirming the diagnosis. Isolated neurological involvement without hepatic involvement is an extremely rare presentation and needs clinical expertise to delineate Wilson's disease as a possible aetiology.

Wilson disease — treatment targets and copper monitoring during chelation are defined by urinary copper metrics: Adequacy of treatment is judged by clinical and biochemical improvement and subsequent stability and by measuring 24 h urinary copper excretion on treatment. Urinary copper excretion upon initiation of treatment is often > 1000 µg/24 h and decreases over time on treatment to approximately 3–10 times the upper limit of normal for urinary copper excretion (typically approximately 150–500 µg/24 h). Generally, with nonadherence to therapy over time, urinary copper rises. Values of urinary copper excretion < 100 µg/24 h may indicate some degree of copper deficiency due to overtreatment, in which case serum copper is expected to be lower than pretreatment values, reversible sideroblastic anemia and neutropenia may be present, and overtreatment can result in hepatic iron overload. In contrast, when urinary copper excretion accompanies nonadherence, serum copper increases, reflecting increased NCC.

Diagnostic testing — modalities and typical versus challenging presentations in Wilson disease (WD): Evaluation tools include recognition of KF rings, identification of low serum ceruloplasmin concentration in most patients, and measurement of copper concentration in percutaneous liver biopsy specimens, with genotype analysis by direct examination for disease-specific ATP7B mutations, including by whole-exome/genome sequencing. Patients with cirrhosis, neurological manifestations, and KF rings are easily diagnosed as having WD, and patients presenting with liver disease who were 5–40 years-old and had low serum ceruloplasmin and KF rings were regarded as having textbook WD. However, approximately 50% of patients presenting with liver disease lack two of these criteria and pose a diagnostic challenge.

### Assessment of the diagnostic value of serum ceruloplasmin for Wilson's disease in children [^117GfBAx]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

To define the accuracy of serum ceruloplasmin levels for the patients with acute liver failure, the ROC curve was constructed by using the data of 15 WD patients and 20 non-WD patients with acute liver failure. The area under the curve was 0.952 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.885–1). The ROC curve indicated that the cutoff value of serum ceruloplasmin level of 16 mg/dL gave the highest diagnostic accuracy for WD in the patients with acute liver failure (Fig. 2 B).

To further define the accuracy of serum ceruloplasmin for diagnosis of WD in the patients with elevated aminotransferases, the ROC curve was constructed by using the data of 256 asymptomatic WD patients with isolated elevated aminotransferases and 38 non-WD patients with viral hepatitis. The area under the curve was 0.994 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.988–1). The ROC curve suggested that the cutoff value of serum ceruloplasmin level of 16.85 mg/dL gave the highest diagnostic accuracy for WD with elevated aminotransferases (Fig. 2 C).

As shown in Fig. 2 D-F, the mean level of serum ceruloplasmin of 317 WD patients was 5.7 ± 4.7 mg/dL, significantly lower than that in all of 547 non-WD children (6.0 ± 4.0 mg/dL) (p < 0.001). For the patients with acute liver failure, the mean level of serum ceruloplasmin in WD patients (9.3 ± 4.7 mg/dL) was lower than that in non-WD patients (29.7 ± 14.3 mg/dL) (p < 0.001). In the situation with elevated aminotransferases, the mean level of serum ceruloplasmin in the 249 asymptomatic WD patients (5.5 ± 4.7 mg/dL) was significantly lower than that in the 38 patients with viral hepatitis (32.5 ± 7.9 mg/dL) (p < 0.001).

Discussion

The present study recruited the largest number of pediatric WD cases with 317 patients and 372 healthy children for study of age and gender specific serum ceruloplasmin levels. Our results were consistent with previous reports, indicating that serum ceruloplasmin is not suitable for newborn screening. However, the present study indicated serum ceruloplasmin level may be one of sensitive biomarkers for diagnosis of WD children older than 6 months.

It is interesting to find healthy boys had significantly higher level of serum ceruloplasmin than the girls, so did in asymptomatic WD patients (Fig. 1). Previous study indicated that serum ceruloplasmin has no gender difference except being higher in girls during puberty due to estrogen stimulation. Our study provided very different findings in both healthy children and asymptomatic WD patients based on a large cohort of pediatric WD patients and healthy controls. Gender difference of serum ceruloplasmin should be considered at diagnosis of WD in childhood, and further investigation is needed.

It has been well known that diagnosis of WD is difficult in the asymptomatic children, and in the patients with acute liver failure. Serum ceruloplasmin is one of the major diagnostic criteria, however, it has been reported that only 85% of the asymptomatic WD had diagnostic ceruloplasmin levels. With 261 asymptomatic WD children (82.3% of 317 WD patients), this study assessed the diagnostic value of serum ceruloplasmin for WD and presented different finding. Serum ceruloplasmin was generally much lower in WD patients than healthy children, and only 6 asymptomatic WD children of all (6/261, 2.3%) had normal level of serum ceruloplasmin (> 20 mg/dL). Consistent with the reports from other studies from China and South Korea, our findings indicates that decreased level of serum ceruloplasmin is strongly reflecting the abnormality of copper metabolism and the potential diagnosis of WD. Another 13 WD patients in our study had serum ceruloplasmin between 15 and 20 mg/dL, 3 of whom presented with acute liver failure, indicating serum ceruloplasmin is not a sensitive biomarker for WD in the situation of acute liver failure. Some studies from Europe reported that about 30% of European WD patients had serum ceruloplasmin level > 20 mg/dL. The racial difference might be the cause for the difference in serum ceruloplasmin levels, and smaller subject number of those studies may also be a reason.

Gender specific reference value of serum ceruloplasmin was also analyzed in these children (Table 1 and Fig. 1). The mean level of serum ceruloplasmin in healthy boys and girls were 31.8 ± 7.7 mg/dL and 29.2 ± 7.6 mg/dL respectively, exhibiting statistically significant gender difference (p < 0.01). While analyzing gender difference in each age subgroup, serum ceruloplasmin also exhibited higher level in boys than girls, but there was no significance with the exception of 8- year subgroup (p > 0.05).

Serum ceruloplasmin levels in children with Wilson's disease

As shown in Table 1, a total of 317 children were diagnosed as WD in GWCMC in last 11 years, 200 (63.1%) boys and 117 (36.9%) girls. The ratio of male to female in WD patients was 1.7:1. At diagnosis, the mean age of these patients was 6.1 ± 2.8 years (ranging 0.6 to 15.0 years). The mean level of serum ceruloplasmin in WD patients was 5.7 ± 4.7 mg/dL, which was significantly lower than that in healthy control subjects (p < 0.001). A total of 13 WD patients had serum ceruloplasmin between 15 and 20 mg/dL, 3 of whom presented with acute liver failure and 10 were asymptomatic (Additional file 1: Table S1). A total of 6 (1.9%) in 317 WD patients had normal value of serum ceruloplasmin > 20 mg/dL, all of whom were asymptomatic (6/261, 2.3%).

### Performance of relative exchangeable copper for the diagnosis of Wilson disease in acute liver failure [^114rpjYr]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

There were significant differences in all the parameters of copper metabolism: serum copper, ceruloplasmin levels, 24 h urinary copper excretion (24 h UCE), exchangeable copper, and REC (Table 1).

The performance for the diagnosis of WD of all the test parameters and scores is shown in Table 2.

TABLE 2
Comparison of screening tests for WD in ALF.

Concerning the ceruloplasmin (Cp) levels, no WD patient had a value > 0.20 g/L, and three (27.3%) had values between 0.10 and 0.20 g/L; all the rest (72.7%) have values < 0.10 g/L. In the non‐WD group, 6/22 (27.3%) patients had Cp values < 0.20 g/L, 5 (22.7%) between 0.10 and 0.20 g/L, and one (4.5%) < 0.10 g/L. Serum Cp < 0.20 g/L had a sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) for the diagnosis of WD of 100% and 72.7%, respectively (Table 2).

24 h UCE levels were available for 23 patients (11 WD/12 non‐WD). 24 h UCE levels were significantly higher in the WD group, 16.9 [6.6–34.8] μmol/24 h versus 1.5 [0.6–3.7] μmol/24 h (p < 0.05). All the patients in the WD group had values > 1.6 μmol/24 h, and 6/12 (50%) patients of the non‐WD group had values > 1.6 μmol/24 h, range 2.9–17.5 μmol/24 h. Using a cut‐off of 5.29 μmol/24 h, the Se was 90.9% and Sp 84.6% (AUC 0.91 p < 0.001; Table 2).

### Iron accumulation in the liver of male patients with Wilson's disease [^111byuC1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

There is accumulating evidence that ceruloplasmin, a copper protein with ferroxidase activity, plays an important role in iron metabolism. The genetic disorder, aceruloplasminemia, can lead to tissue storage of iron as in hemochromatosis. Because most patients with Wilson's disease, a genetic copper toxicosis, have hypoceruloplasminemia, some could be affected by iron overload.

Methods

Four male patients with Wilson's disease were enrolled in this study of pre- and post-treatment iron metabolism.

Results

Pretreatment copper contents of the liver were high in all four male patients studied as diagnostic of Wilson's disease. Genetic analysis supported their clinical diagnosis of Wilson's disease without a background of hemochromatosis. Pretreatment serum ceruloplasmin levels were < 20 mg/dl in all four patients. A standard penicillamine treatment for 3–8.5 yr further decreased their serum ceruloplasmin levels. Post-treatment serum ferroxidase activity was low as was the serum ceruloplasmin protein. Copper contents in the liver decreased after treatment in all subjects. In contrast, nonheme iron in the liver increased during treatment. Pretreatment liver specimens were positive for histochemical iron in two patients, and post-treatment specimens were positive in all four patients. In two patients, serum aminotransferase levels rebounded with elevation of serum ferritin concentration during the treatment period. Subsequent iron reduction by phlebotomy ameliorated their biochemical liver damage.

Conclusion

Iron overload related to hypoceruloplasminemia may be clinically important, particularly in male patients with Wilson's disease.

Background

Clinical presentations of Wilson's disease (WD) in childhood ranges from asymptomatic liver disease to cirrhosis or acute liver failure, whereas neurological and psychiatric symptoms are rare. The basic diagnostic approach includes serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urinary copper excretion. Final diagnosis of WD can be established using a diagnostic scoring system based on symptoms, biochemical tests assessing copper metabolism, and molecular analysis of mutations in the ATP7B gene. Pharmacological treatment is life-long and aims at removal of copper excess by chelating agents as D-penicillamine, trientine, or inhibition of intestinal copper absorption with zinc salts. Acute liver failure often requires liver transplantation. This publication aims to provide recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of WD in children.

Methods

Questions addressing the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of WD in children were formulated by a core group of ESPGHAN members. A systematic literature search on WD using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database from 1990 to 2016 was performed focusing on prospective and retrospective studies in children. Quality of evidence was assessed according to the GRADE system. Expert opinion supported recommendations where the evidence was regarded as weak. The ESPGHAN core group and ESPGHAN Hepatology Committee members voted on each recommendation, using the nominal voting technique.

### New mutation of the ceruloplasmin gene in the case of a neurologically asymptomatic patient with microcytic anaemia, obesity and supposed Wilson's disease [^114z6yS2]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Aceruloplasminaemia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the ceruloplasmin gene linked to the accumulation of iron in an organism, mainly in the liver, brain, retina and pancreas. It is clinically manifested by retinal degeneration, diabetes mellitus, microcytic anaemia and neurological symptomatology. The diagnosis of aceruloplasminaemia is often not confirmed before the origin of irreversible neurological symptomatology.

In our report, we describe the case of a patient with aceruloplasminaemia, which was identified in an early, neurologically asymptomatic stage while searching for the cause of chronic hepatopathy with low values of serum ceruloplasmin with originally supposed Wilson's disease.

### Wilson's disease in an adult asymptomatic patient: a potential role for modifying factors of copper metabolism [^115Husvu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

In conclusion, this case adds more information about the natural history of WD and suggests that WD is a challenge even in particular contexts such as family screening. This is particularly true in asymptomatic patients including the pediatric age group and in adults with asymptomatic increase in liver tests. In these patients, the presence of normal values of some of the copper metabolism tests decreases the accuracy of the Leipzig score. Thus, the use of genetic testing becomes imperative in the diagnosis of WD. Genetic testing of the entire ATP7B gene should be conducted in cases of relatives of WD patients with minimal alterations of copper metabolism in tests such as ceruloplasmin and signs such as steatosis, even in overweight patients.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Wilson's disease, more specifically with respect to serum ceruloplasmin and urinary copper excretion, AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that an extremely low serum ceruloplasmin level (< 5 mg/dL) more strongly suggests a diagnosis of WD than modestly subnormal levels, but serum ceruloplasmin by itself is insufficient for making a diagnosis of WD. Do not exclude WD based on normal serum ceruloplasmin levels.

### Role for biochemical assays and Kayser-Fleischer rings in diagnosis of Wilson's disease [^115oXg7k]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder that impairs copper homeostasis and is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in ATP7B, which encodes a copper-transporting P-type ATPase. Patients have variable clinical manifestations and laboratory test results, resulting in diagnostic dilemmas. We aimed to identify factors associated with symptoms and features of Wilson disease from a large cohort, over 15 years.

Methods

We collected data from 715 patients (529 with symptoms, 146 without symptoms, and 40 uncategorized) and a genetic confirmation of Wilson's disease (mean age of diagnosis, 18.84 years), recruited from 3 hospitals in China from 2004 through 2019. We analyzed clinical data along with serum levels of ceruloplasmin (available from 636 patients), 24-hr urinary copper excretion (collected from 131 patients), Kayser-Fleisher rings (copper accumulation in eyes, with neurologic data from 355 patients), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities. Differences among the groups were analyzed using 1-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey multiple comparison test.

Results

Of the 529 patients with symptoms, 121 had hepatic features, 355 had neurologic features, 28 had osteomuscular features (premature osteoarthritis, skeletal deformities, and pathological bone fractures), and 25 had psychiatric symptoms. Age of onset was significantly younger in patients with hepatic (16.94 ± 1.03 years; p = 0.0105) or osteomuscular features (13 ± 1.33 years; p = 0.0001) than patients with neurological features (19.48 ± 0.46 years). Serum levels of ceruloplasmin differed among asymptomatic patients and patients with osteomuscular or neurologic symptoms of Wilson disease. Serum levels of ceruloplasmin ranged from 18.93 mg/L to approximately 120.00 mg/L (quantiles of 0.025 to approximately 0.975). Fifty-one of 131 patients (39%) had urinary copper excretion levels below 100 μg/24 hr; there was significant variation in levels of urinary copper excretion between patients older than 14 years vs 14 years or younger. Of the 355 patients with neurologic features, 244 patients (69%) had abnormal findings from MRI and Kayser-Fleisher rings; only 1 patient with abnormal findings from brain MRI was negative for Kayser-Fleisher rings.

Conclusions

Serum level of ceruloplasmin, 24-hour urinary copper excretion, and Kayser-Fleisher rings can be used to identify patients who might have Wilson disease. Patients with serum levels of ceruloplasmin below 120 mg/L and children with urinary copper excretion above 40 μg should undergo genetic testing for Wilson's disease. Patients with movement disorders and brain MRI abnormalities without Kayser-Fleisher rings are not likely to have Wilson disease.

Wilson disease — zinc adherence and monitoring: Adherence to long-term zinc therapy can be challenging because the three-times-daily dosing must be strictly away from meals, and clinical monitoring needs to be stringent. Rise in serum aminotransferases may be an early sign of poor adherence or treatment failure, increased 24-h urinary copper excretion suggests poor adherence or increased dietary copper intake, and urinary zinc can be checked for adherence with target values of > 1–2 mg/24 h.

### Cupric chloride (Copper) [^116eDy8e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Copper is an essential nutrient which serves as a cofactor for serum ceruloplasmin, an oxidase necessary for proper formation of the iron carrier protein, transferrin. Copper also helps maintain normal rates of red and white blood cell formation.

Providing copper during TPN helps prevent development of the following deficiency symptoms: Leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, depressed ceruloplasmin levels, impaired transferrin formation, secondary iron deficiency and osteoporosis.

Normal serum copper values range from 80 to 163 mcg/dl (mean, approximately 110 mcg/dl). The serum copper level at which deficiency symptoms appear is not precisely defined.

In the plasma, about 7% of copper is bound to albumin and amino acids. In the liver, about 93% of copper is bound to ceruloplasmin and released to the serum. The daily turnover of copper through ceruloplasmin is approximately 0.5 mg. Copper is primarily excreted through the bile and into the gastrointestinal tract where it is not reabsorbed. Copper is also eliminated through the kidneys.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^114e3RAH]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — metabolic, alcohol‑related, and genetic evaluations for abnormal liver chemistries include NAFLD screening, alcohol risk thresholds, and targeted tests for hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha‑1‑antitrypsin deficiency. Patients with elevated BMI and metabolic syndrome features with mild ALT elevations should undergo ultrasound screening for NAFLD. Women consuming more than 140 g per week or men consuming more than 210 g per week who present with AST > ALT are considered at risk for alcoholic liver disease and should be counseled for cessation. In the absence of acute hepatitis, test for hereditary hemochromatosis with iron level, transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin; perform HFE mutation analysis when transferrin saturation > 45% and/or ferritin is elevated. Evaluate for autoimmune liver disease with ANA, ASMA, and globulin level. Screen for Wilson's disease with serum ceruloplasmin and, if low, confirm with 24‑h urinary copper and slit‑lamp exam for Kayser–Fleischer rings. Screen for alpha‑1‑antitrypsin deficiency with alpha‑1‑antitrypsin phenotype. All cited as Strong recommendation, very low level of evidence.

Specific diagnostic challenges — congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs): In some CDGs, serum ceruloplasmin is low and liver biochemistries abnormal; hepatic copper concentrations are moderately elevated, typically > 50 but < 250 μg/g dry weight tissue, while basal 24-h urinary copper excretion is normal, and phosphoglucomutase 1 deficiency (PGM1-CDG) produces this clinical picture.

### Prognostic value of elevated serum ceruloplasmin levels in patients with heart failure [^113k6ynm]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Ceruloplasmin (Cp) is a copper-binding acute-phase protein that is increased in inflammatory states and deficient in Wilson's disease. Recent studies demonstrate that increased levels of Cp are associated with increased risk of developing heart failure. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that serum Cp provides incremental and independent prediction of survival in stable patients with heart failure.

Methods and Results

We measured serum Cp levels in 890 patients with stable heart failure undergoing elective cardiac evaluation that included coronary angiography. We examined the role of Cp levels in predicting survival over 5 years of follow-up. Mean Cp level was 26.6 ± 6.9 mg/dL and demonstrated relatively weak correlation with B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP; r = 0.187; P < .001). Increased Cp levels were associated with increased 5-year all-cause mortality (quartile [Q] 4 vs Q1 hazard ratio [HR] 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4–2.8; P < .001). When controlled for coronary disease traditional risk factors, creatinine clearance, dialysis, body mass index, medications, history of myocardial infarction, BNP, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), heart rate, QRS duration, left bundle branch blockage, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement, higher Cp remained an independent predictor of increased mortality (Q4 vs Q1 HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1–2.6; P < .05). Model quality was improved with addition of Cp to the aforementioned covariables (net reclassification improvement of 9.3%; P < .001).

Conclusions

Ceruloplasmin is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure. Measurement of Cp may help to identify patients at heightened mortality risk.

Wilson disease — zinc treatment targets and overtreatment: Adequacy of zinc treatment is assessed by 24-h urinary copper excretion, which should be < 100 μg (< 1.6 μmol)/24 h on stable treatment; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization may be a good marker and correlates with maintaining 24-h urinary copper below 100 μg/24 h, and elevated NCC normalizes with effective treatment. Overtreatment is suspected when urinary copper is very low (< 20 μg [< 0.3 μmol]/24 h) with low serum copper and lower ceruloplasmin, necessitating dose reduction or brief interruption if other hematologic or neurologic side effects occur; neurological changes are uncommon but may develop when depletion is severe and prolonged, usually after 5–15 years or more of treatment.

### Understanding and reducing ceruloplasmin overuse with a decision support intervention for liver disease evaluation [^116RASbV]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Over-testing is a source of significant health care costs, both in terms of dollars spent and the false positives generated. Clinicians frequently test patients with elevated liver enzymes (a common problem) for Wilson disease (a rare disease) using a ceruloplasmin level.

Methods

We performed a prospective pre-post study between October 2013 and November 2014. We deployed a pop-up screen in our provider order entry system to present clinicians with the guidelines for and test characteristics of ceruloplasmin use. Outcomes included rate ratios for test utilization. Indications for inpatient orders were provided by ordering clinicians and reviewed.

Results

Ceruloplasmin was ordered 448 and 219 times in the pre- and postintervention periods, respectively. Rate ratios for orders from gastroenterologists and general internists were 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.40–0.59, and 0.31; 95% CI, 0.20–0.50, respectively (P < .0001, for both). Following the intervention, there was an 82% and 40% decrease in orders by internists in the outpatient and inpatient settings, respectively. Tests of confirmation (necessary for positive ceruloplasmins) were more common in the group tested following the intervention, risk ratio 1.80; 95% CI, 1.04–3.08; p = 0.02. Of the residual ceruloplasmin orders by inpatient internists after the intervention, 75% (18/24) were recommended by hepatology consultants.

Conclusion

The optimal intervention for the reduction of over-testing should include automated changes to the ordering system combined with efforts to change testing culture through education.
