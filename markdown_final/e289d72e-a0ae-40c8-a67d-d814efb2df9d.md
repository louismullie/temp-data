## Question

Ketonuria

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about ketonuria: its definition, physiology, clinical contexts, measurement methods, limitations, interpretation, and a practical diagnostic approach. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what ketonuria represents biochemically and physiologically. Then, I should categorize the major clinical contexts where ketonuria appears. Next, I will compare urine and blood ketone assays and their pitfalls. After that, I need to outline how to interpret results in practice. Finally, I will synthesize a diagnostic algorithm and special-population considerations, while double-checking for common pitfalls and exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical basis. Ketonuria refers to urinary excretion of ketone bodies — acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone — generated when insulin deficiency or carbohydrate restriction drives increased fatty acid oxidation and hepatic ketogenesis, producing acetyl-CoA that is shunted into ketone synthesis when TCA cycle flux is constrained by low oxaloacetate or high glucagon, a hallmark pathway in DKA pathophysiology [^111itEwi] [^114Y6xhZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — ketogenesis can occur in several non-DKA states too. I should categorize the major contexts where ketonuria is encountered: diabetic ketoacidosis (hyperglycemic or euglycemic), starvation/carbohydrate-restricted states including ketogenic diets, pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting, critical illness and perioperative settings, alcohol-related ketoacidosis, and inborn errors of metabolism where β-oxidation defects can paradoxically show ketonuria with hypoglycemia, so I need to keep these in mind before attributing all ketonuria to insulin deficiency [^113KospR] [^114EzAFr] [^111CvyBH] [^113JgakT] [^112xoiu6].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic value of urine versus blood testing. Urine dipsticks detect acetoacetate (and variably acetone with some brands) but not β-hydroxybutyrate, which predominates in DKA; thus, during treatment, β-OHB declines while acetoacetate rises, creating a paradoxical urine "worsening" even as the patient improves, and timing of urine relative to last void blunts sensitivity for early detection; conversely, capillary or serum β-OHB directly reflects current ketonemia and aligns with severity and treatment response [^11423GKR] [^116bcBjA] [^111N7noh].

> I should double-check the evidence-based cutoffs and test performance. The ADA defines DKA when β-OHB is ≥ 3.0 mmol/L or urine ketones are at least 2+ together with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis; importantly, point-of-care β-OHB at > 1.5–2.0 mmol/L shows excellent sensitivity and markedly better specificity than urine dipsticks in ED cohorts, substantially reducing unnecessary workups, and the negative predictive value of a normal β-OHB is very high, supporting its use for triage [^114srPLa] [^117PnUxn] [^116sN1Mz].

> But wait, what if urine ketones are negative — does that exclude DKA? I need to ensure I don't overstate this. Guidelines emphasize not ruling out DKA solely on a negative urine ketone, especially in early or euglycemic presentations; β-OHB testing should be prioritized when available, and anion gap and pH remain critical if ketones are unavailable, particularly in patients on SGLT2 inhibitors who may present with euglycemic DKA [^113eLXyY] [^113KospR] [^114ep1Em].

> Let me consider physiologic states where ketonuria is expected. In fasting or ketogenic diets, β-OHB typically rises to about 0.5–1.5 mmol/L without acidosis, and in early critical illness many patients exhibit mild ketosis that resolves independently of glycemic targets, implying that modest ketonemia/ketonuria in these settings is adaptive rather than pathologic unless accompanied by acidosis or clinical deterioration [^111CvyBH] [^116CEE4q].

> Next, I should review pregnancy-related care. Ketonuria is common in hyperemesis gravidarum and can reflect starvation, but the RCOG advises not to use ketonuria to grade severity or dehydration in nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. In pregnant patients with persistent vomiting, assessing β-OHB can be more informative for triage, though clinical status and electrolytes remain paramount [^113JgakT] [^116k4dB6].

> I will now examine SGLT2 inhibitor–associated ketoacidosis. Euglycemic DKA is a recognized risk, and both FDA labeling and endocrine guidance advise patient education on symptoms, temporary withholding during illness or fasting, and provision of β-OHB testing; urine ketones may be delayed or misleading due to acetoacetate dynamics, so blood testing is preferred for timely recognition and for monitoring resolution, which may take longer and require continued insulin and dextrose even after the anion gap closes due to persistent glucosuria [^1121kc4j] [^114F3ib3] [^116JHDXY].

> Hold on, I should verify interferences and preanalytical pitfalls for urine ketones. Free-sulfhydryl–containing drugs (e.g., carbidopa-levodopa, captopril, mesna, N-acetylcysteine) can cause false-positive nitroprusside reactions, while highly acidic urine or poor storage can cause false negatives. Additionally, dehydration can concentrate urine and exaggerate apparent ketonuria, so I need to interpret urine ketones alongside clinical context and hydration status [^113eLXyY] [^114VCi1f] [^1154Udy3] [^1159MAEC].

> Let me reconsider the role of alternative modalities. Breath acetone correlates with plasma ketones and offers a noninvasive signal of ketosis, but devices remain largely nonclinical and not cleared for medical decision-making. Nonetheless, this underscores that urinary acetoacetate is an indirect and variable marker of the predominantly circulating β-OHB pool, reinforcing the preference for blood β-OHB in acute care [^112ZueNY] [^116xm6bK].

> Next, I should review special populations and edge cases. In toddlers with hypoglycemia, ketonuria does not exclude hyperinsulinism, so I must avoid anchoring on urine ketones in that differential. In children with suspected new-onset diabetes, urinalysis for glucose and ketones is appropriate, but confirmation of DKA requires acid-base assessment and, ideally, β-OHB. In postoperative or critically ill patients, early ketosis is common and often benign unless acidosis is present, so serial β-OHB and clinical trajectory guide management [^116iayiq] [^114zekfH] [^111CvyBH].

> I should now synthesize a practical diagnostic approach. First, assess the clinical context: diabetes status, medications (especially SGLT2 inhibitors), dietary patterns, pregnancy, alcohol use, and precipitating illness. Second, obtain blood glucose, electrolytes, renal function, and an acid-base profile. Third, measure β-OHB when available, recognizing that values ≥ 3.0 mmol/L support DKA in the right clinical setting, while 0.6–2.9 mmol/L may reflect early or non-acidotic ketosis. Fourth, use urine ketones only as an adjunct, never to exclude DKA, and interpret cautiously given lag and interferences. Finally, treat precipitating causes, provide fluids, insulin, and electrolytes per DKA protocols, and monitor β-OHB and acid-base parameters to track resolution [^113KospR] [^114srPLa] [^111N7noh].

> Hmm, wait a minute — I initially implied that urine ketones are "not recommended" for DKA diagnosis; I should correct that nuance. Guidelines still accept urine ketones as an adjunct, but they explicitly prefer direct β-OHB measurement for diagnosis and monitoring because of superior specificity, timeliness, and alignment with treatment response, so I need to ensure my recommendation emphasizes blood β-OHB while acknowledging urine testing only when blood testing is unavailable or as a supportive clue [^114o9ADe] [^113KospR] [^111N7noh].

> In summary, ketonuria reflects urinary acetoacetate excretion and signals increased ketogenesis, but it is an imperfect surrogate for the β-OHB that predominates in DKA. Blood β-OHB testing is the preferred modality for diagnosis and monitoring, urine ketones remain a low-cost adjunct with notable limitations, and clinical context plus acid-base assessment are indispensable to avoid both missed DKA and overcalling benign ketosis [^113KospR] [^111N7noh] [^114srPLa].

Ketonuria is the presence of ketone bodies in urine, most often due to **insulin deficiency** [^111itEwi] or **carbohydrate restriction** [^116CEE4q]. It is a hallmark of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) [^114srPLa] but can also occur with fasting, low-carb or ketogenic diets, prolonged vomiting, or SGLT2 inhibitor use [^114o9ADe] [^112ZueNY] [^116oXDyF] [^114EzAFr]. Urine ketone tests detect acetoacetate and acetone, not β-hydroxybutyrate, so they can be falsely negative early in DKA [^11423GKR] and falsely positive with some drugs [^1159MAEC]. Blood β-hydroxybutyrate is preferred for diagnosing and monitoring DKA [^111N7noh] [^113KospR]. Management targets the cause: insulin and fluids for DKA [^111itEwi], and refeeding or stopping ketogenic/SGLT2 therapy for nutritional or drug-induced ketosis [^116gd9TW] [^1121kc4j].

## Physiological and pathological mechanisms

Ketonuria reflects **increased hepatic ketogenesis** from fatty acids when glucose is unavailable or insulin is deficient [^116xm6bK]. The main ketones are acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone; urine tests detect acetoacetate and acetone, not β-hydroxybutyrate [^113eLXyY].

- **Insulin deficiency**: In DKA, low insulin with high glucagon drives lipolysis and ketogenesis, causing metabolic acidosis [^111itEwi].
- **Carbohydrate restriction**: Fasting or low-carb diets increase ketone production for energy [^116xm6bK].
- **Increased energy demand**: Pregnancy, lactation, and prolonged exercise can raise ketone use and excretion [^notfound].
- **SGLT2 inhibitors**: These drugs increase ketogenesis and risk euglycemic DKA [^114EzAFr].

---

## Clinical conditions associated with ketonuria

| **Clinical condition** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) | Insulin deficiency | Life-threatening; requires urgent treatment [^114Y6xhZ] |
| Starvation/fasting | Carbohydrate restriction | Adaptive; usually benign [^111qHztN] |
| Low-carbohydrate/ketogenic diets | Carbohydrate restriction | Intentional; usually benign [^116CEE4q] |
| Prolonged vomiting/anorexia | Caloric restriction | Reflects starvation; monitor for dehydration [^114o9ADe] |
| Pregnancy (hyperemesis gravidarum) | Increased energy demand | Monitor for maternal-fetal complications [^111chamD] |
| SGLT2 inhibitor use | Increased ketogenesis | Risk of euglycemic DKA; monitor ketones [^114EzAFr] |

---

## Detection methods and their limitations

Urine ketone testing is convenient but has **important limitations**:

- **Nitroprusside reaction**: Detects acetoacetate/acetone, not β-hydroxybutyrate [^113eLXyY]; early DKA can be falsely negative [^11423GKR].
- **False positives**: Levodopa, ACE inhibitors, and other sulfhydryl drugs can cause false positives [^1159MAEC] [^114VCi1f].
- **Delayed detection**: Urine reflects past levels, so changes are slower than blood [^116bcBjA].

Blood β-hydroxybutyrate measurement is **more accurate** for diagnosing and monitoring DKA [^116sN1Mz] [^113KospR] and is preferred when available [^111N7noh].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Ketonuria signals metabolic stress; management depends on the cause:

- **DKA**: Give insulin, fluids, and electrolytes; monitor blood ketones and acid-base status [^111itEwi] [^113KospR].
- **Nutritional ketosis**: Refeed with carbohydrates; stop ketogenic diets if symptomatic [^116gd9TW].
- **SGLT2-associated ketosis**: Stop the drug, treat as DKA if acidosis is present, and monitor ketones [^1121kc4j] [^114EzAFr].

---

## Special considerations

In **pregnancy**, ketonuria is common in hyperemesis gravidarum and is associated with maternal-fetal complications; monitor and treat dehydration and malnutrition [^111chamD]. In **pediatrics**, ketonuria is common in DKA and can also occur with fasting or illness; assess for DKA and monitor closely [^114zekfH] [^112rL1JY].

---

Ketonuria reflects increased ketone production and is most clinically urgent in DKA; **blood β-hydroxybutyrate testing** improves accuracy, and management should target the underlying cause.

2 CURRENT APPROACHES TO THE PREVENTION, RECOGNITION AND MANAGEMENT OF

The standard management of established DKA has been extensively documented in international guidelines. The principles are volume replacement, the correction of electrolyte abnormalities, provision of insulin and addressing precipitating factors, all of which should occur in a hospital environment in which the patient is closely monitored. Patients with DKA may range from early presenters who are mildly unwell and have rapid reversal of their metabolic disturbances to late presenters who are severely unwell with marked disturbances in acid–base balance, volume status and electrolyte abnormalities requiring admission to an intensive care unit. Generally, early presentation with a milder metabolic derangement is associated with lower mortality, faster recovery and lower socioeconomic costs.

The first step in the prevention and management of DKA is recognition of the impending or established condition with a ketone measurement. The measurement of ketones requires that the person recognizes that they are at an increased risk of DKA and to proactively initiate a test to confirm the presence of elevated ketones. Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and thirst occur late, and hyperglycaemia, which is not invariably present, may not always prompt the person to check their ketone levels. Current available options test for the presence of ketones in urine and blood samples.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, ADA 2006 guidelines recommend to consider using the following diagnostic criteria and classification for DKA and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Mild DKA|- Plasma glucose > 250 mg/dL <br/> - Arterial pH 7.25–7.30 <br/> - Serum bicarbonate 15–18 mEq/L <br/> - Positive urine ketones using the nitroprusside reaction method <br/> - Positive serum ketones using the nitroprusside reaction method <br/> - Β-hydroxybutyrate (enzymatic assay) 3–6 mmol/L <br/> - Variable effective serum osmolality <br/> - Anion gap > 10 <br/> - Alert|

### Severe euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis of multifactorial etiology in a type 2 diabetic patient treated with empagliflozin: case report and literature review [^113ErRxx]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

The pathophysiologic mechanism that leads to this serious metabolic disorder has been previously described. Accumulation of ketoacids in DKA, typically results in high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis complicating diabetic ketoacidosis during the recovery phase has been well documented; however, its contribution at presentation of euglycemic DKA has been only recently recognized. Furthermore, typical DKA commonly occurs in the presence of additional conditions (i.e. trauma, surgery or infection) that per se may lead to other coexisting types of metabolic acidosis (e.g. lactic, hyperchloremic). Herein, we describe a patient with T2DM under SGLT-2 treatment who 5 days post-surgery presented with severe acidosis and only mildly elevated anion gap, mild hyperglycemia and ketonuria. A traditional diagnostic approach based on serum glucose levels and the anion gap in this patient could have seriously misled us from the correct diagnosis.

### Unrecognized false-positive ketones from drugs containing free-sulfhydryl group (s) [^1159MAEC]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — There are a growing number of drugs that are present in the blood and/or excreted in the urine as free-sulfhydryl compounds. This list includes established drugs like dimercaprol, penicillamine, cysteine, and acetylcysteine, plus newer drugs like mesna and captopril. In alkaline medium, free-sulfhydryl compounds react with a purple color similar to that of ketone bodies in the nitroprusside test. 1 Since the nitroprusside test is used currently in. all commercial dipsticks and in the Acetest tablet assay for the detection of ketone bodies in urine and blood, the positive interference with free-sulfhydryl compounds is of great importance, particularly in diabetics2 and in those with suspected hepatocellular injury.

### Ethnic differences predicting ketonuria in patients with type 2 diabetes [^116bJT6v]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2005). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Ketonuria occurs more frequently than ketoacidosis does in patients with Type 2 diabetes and may portend serious future events. We studied the correlates of ketonuria among African American and Hispanic/Latino patients with Type 2 diabetes who did not have ketoacidosis.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients referred for diabetes education from the emergency department or the urgent care clinic of a large, public, urban hospital from 2001 until 2003. Eligible patients had newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes or diabetes diagnosed within 15 years but without treatment for the previous 2 months. Using logistic regression analysis, we analyzed the predictors of ketonuria and assessed whether they varied by ethnic group.

Results

Of 228 adult African American and Hispanic/Latino patients, 112 (49%) had ketonuria. Independent predictors of ketonuria were younger age (OR: 2.3), higher hemoglobin A(1c) (OR: 3.0), and a history of substance abuse (OR: 1.9) (for all: P < .05). Among Hispanic/Latino patients, ketonuria was also independently associated with low HDL-cholesterol (adjusted OR: 6.6; 95% CI: 2–20), but this relationship was not seen in African American patients.

Conclusions

Ketonuria is common among newly diagnosed or untreated patients with Type 2 diabetes in a public hospital serving a predominantly minority population. Some correlates of ketonuria differ among ethnic groups, suggesting potential ethnic differences in ketogenesis. Prospective identification and study of patients with ketonuria may have important implications for appropriate therapy, especially if it is shown that ketonuria is a predictor of symptomatic ketoacidosis.

### Altered branched chain ketoacids underlie shared metabolic phenotypes in type 1 diabetes and maple syrup urine disease [^1111JJmN]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) may present as an asymptomatic incidental finding, as new-onset classical diabetes symptoms (polydipsia, polyuria, hyperglycemia, and ketonuria), or as diabetic ketoacidosis. Although hyperglycemia without acidosis is the most common presentation, early symptoms such as persistent bedwetting, candidiasis, increased thirst, or weight loss often go unnoticed in young children. Diabetic ketoacidosis is an acute and potentially life-threatening metabolic complication of absolute insulin insufficiency. Various studies estimate diabetic ketoacidosis to be the initial presentation for approximately 30% of children, with notably increased risk in younger children, whose symptoms are frequently overlooked and who are often quicker to deteriorate.

In the setting of diabetic ketoacidosis, insulin deficiency paired with an increase in counter-regulatory hormones (glucagon, catecholamines, cortisol, and growth hormone) promotes a catabolic state and guides the body to exploit triglycerides and amino acids in place of glucose for energy production. Excess circulating glucagon stimulates lipolysis and muscle catabolism, and glycerol and alanine serve as substrates for hepatic gluconeogenesis. Hyperglycemia develops due to increased gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, and compromised glucose utilization at the peripheral tissues.

During prolonged insulin-deficient states, oxaloacetate is shunted into gluconeogenesis, depleting the oxaloacetate pool within hepatic mitochondria. In the absence of adequate TCA cycle activity, acetyl-CoA from β-oxidation of the free fatty acids liberated by lipolysis is converted into ketones. The major products of ketogenesis are strong organic acids, which, in conjunction with high production of lactate, cause a high anion-gap metabolic acidosis.

Simultaneously, hyperglycemia and hyperketonemia instigate osmotic diuresis, resulting in a marked loss of water and electrolytes through the urine, further worsened by nausea and vomiting. Hypovolemia can lead to increased catecholamine production and downstream glucagon production, worsening the patient's already dire hyperglycemic state. Excessive volume loss may result in renal hypoperfusion, explaining the high incidence of acute kidney injury in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis.

### New-onset diabetes mellitus in COVID-19: a scoping review [^113NeQXf]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

COVID-19, ACE2 Receptors, and New-Onset DM

The hypothesis that the binding of SARS‐CoV‐2 to ACE2 receptors increases the risk of developing DKA has some conceptual support. First, ACE2 receptors serve as the entry point for SARS-CoV-2, and its expression is downregulated after endocytosis of the virus complex, so the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into pancreatic islet cells may directly cause β-cell injury but can also lead to unopposed angiotensin II action, which may directly impede insulin secretion and the insulin signaling pathway. In addition, the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE-2 receptors provokes a decrease in glucose uptake into musculoskeletal cells, an increase in lipolysis in adipocytes, and an increase in hepatic gluconeogenesis. Aldosterone-stimulated secretion can also lead to hypokalemia, further impairing insulin secretion. Besides the aforementioned mechanisms, reported autoimmune mechanisms include direct cellular lytic effects from the viral replication process and host autoimmunity secondary to the inflammatory response of autoreactive lymphocytes. Islet cell destruction secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection can be an autoimmune pathophysiological mechanism, though this infection determines hyperglycemia in patients with COVID-19.

However, pre-existing DM predisposed patients to develop acidosis and ketoacidosis in cases of hospitalization for confirmed COVID‐19, since ketosis or ketonuria was present in 6.4% of a 658-patient cohort study. Data from a smaller analysis (102 patients) reported negative ketone urinary tests in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes and SARS-CoV-2 infection and marked hyperglycemia (148–321 mg/dl).

### Determination of the relationships between hyperemesis gravidarum and systemic inflammation markers: a case ‒ control study [^117U6KzP]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

In this analysis, logistic regression revealed significantly greater NLRs (OR 1.144, 95% CI: 1.072–1.221; p < 0.001), Hb levels (OR 1.478, 95% CI: 1.200–1.821; p < 0.001), urine pH levels (OR 0.540, 95% CI: 0.363–0.802; p = 0.002) and urine density levels (OR 1.064, 95% CI: 1.025–1.104; p = 0.001) in the HEG patients than in healthy controls (Table 4).

Multiple logistic regression analysis of factors related to HEG

Abbreviations: OR: Odds ratio

Note

a Variable(s) entered in step 1: NLR, PLR, MLR, Hb, Urine pH, Urine density. (These factors had a p value lower than 0.10 in the comparison of the HEG and control groups in Table 1 and the variables used for the calculation of the NLR, MLR and PLR omitted due to multicollinearity)

b We excluded the ketonuria variable although had a p value lower than 0.10 because all the values of the control group were 0. This affected the results and confidence intervals

c We used the backwards LR method for the selection of significant factors and the selection of variables was completed in Step 3: Hb, urine pH, urine density

### Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care testing for diabetic ketoacidosis at emergency-department triage: { beta }-hydroxybutyrate versus the urine dipstick [^111XbVN8]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Approximately one-fourth of emergency-department patients have diabetes, and almost half have poor glycemic control. Common clinical emergency-department practice is to consider the diagnosis of DKA in all patients presenting with blood glucose ≥ 250 mg/dL regardless of the reason for the visit. Because emergency-department overcrowding has stretched resources to the breaking point, there is increasing emphasis on developing, testing, and using the most rapid, accurate, and easy-to-use DKA screening tool available. The results of this study show that the specificity of capillary point-of-care β-OHB is superior to the urine dipstick.

Two retrospective emergency-department studies have shown that capillary point-of-care β-OHB is 100% sensitive for DKA. Charles et al. likewise found that β-OHB was 100% sensitive in a prospective study of seven DKA patients. Naunheim et al. reported a β-OHB sensitivity for DKA of 98% in a prospective sample of 160 patients (57 with DKA). Our study is the first to prospectively compare the test characteristics of point-of-care β-OHB against the urine dipstick in a cohort of emergency-department patients. Using β-OHB in lieu of the urine dipstick to screen our sample could have reduced full laboratory work-ups for DKA by 56.9%.

Our study has several limitations. First, we did not provide specific training to the nurses who interpreted the urine dipsticks. We felt this was unnecessary because they 1) are Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment certified, 2) are familiar and comfortable with this process, and 3) do so regularly in routine clinical practice. Second, the urine dipstick was considered only negative or positive, and consideration of trace/small ketones versus moderate/large ketones may impact the findings. Third, we did not send blood samples to the laboratory for an enzymatic analysis to correlate the values measured by the point-of-care β-OHB meter because, despite early concerns, current-generation β-OHB meters have been shown to be highly accurate compared with laboratory enzymatic analysis. Fourth, although there are many ways to define DKA, we chose to use the ADA definition because this is commonly used in DKA literature, allowing for direct comparison between our results and previous reports.

### Continuous ketone monitoring consensus report 2021 [^116hRGBD]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2022). Medium credibility.

This article is the work product of the Continuous Ketone Monitoring Consensus Panel, which was organized by Diabetes Technology Society and met virtually on April 20, 2021. The panel consisted of 20 US-based experts in the use of diabetes technology, representing adult endocrinology, pediatric endocrinology, advanced practice nursing, diabetes care and education, clinical chemistry, and bioengineering. The panelists were from universities, hospitals, freestanding research institutes, government, and private practice. Panelists reviewed the medical literature pertaining to ten topics: (1) physiology of ketone production, (2) measurement of ketones, (3) performance of the first continuous ketone monitor (CKM) reported to be used in human trials, (4) demographics and epidemiology of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), (5) atypical hyperketonemia, (6) prevention of DKA, (7) non-DKA states of fasting ketonemia and ketonuria, (8) potential integration of CKMs with pumps and automated insulin delivery systems to prevent DKA, (9) clinical trials of CKMs, and (10) the future of CKMs. The panelists summarized the medical literature for each of the ten topics in this report. They also developed 30 conclusions (amounting to three conclusions for each topic) about CKMs and voted unanimously to adopt the 30 conclusions. This report is intended to support the development of safe and effective continuous ketone monitoring and to apply this technology in ways that will benefit people with diabetes.

### Prevalence of ketosis, ketonuria, and ketoacidosis during liberal glycemic control in critically ill patients with diabetes: an observational study [^116vizfF]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

In addition to fasting, ketosis (and ketoacidosis) may be caused by excessive alcohol consumption, severe hypoxia, counter-regulatory hormone excess, catecholamine infusion, parenteral nutrition, alkalosis, severe liver disease, and various inborn errors of metabolism. However, among our patients with acute liver failure (n = 3), chronic alcohol intake (n = 4) and acute alcohol intoxication (n = 1) only one patient (acute-on-chronic liver failure) developed ketosis (peak blood β-OHB level 1.4 mmol/l). Furthermore, catecholamine infusion or alkalosis was not associated with elevated β-OHB levels in our study.

In contrast, in our patients, cardiopulmonary bypass surgery (performed during normothermia) appeared to be an important trigger of ketogenesis. This finding is supported by Hashimoto et al. In 24 patients, they compared the arterial acetoacetate to β-OHB ratio (the so-called ketone body ratio) between patients undergoing normothermic vs. hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. The ratio decreased significantly in both groups suggesting reduced mitochondrial redox potential favoring conversion to β-OHB in such patients. Importantly, the decrease in ketone body ratio was more pronounced after hypothermic bypass indicating even greater β-OHB generation in that group.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis [^111itEwi]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is the most common acute hyperglycaemic emergency in people with diabetes mellitus. A diagnosis of DKA is confirmed when all of the three criteria are present - 'D', either elevated blood glucose levels or a family history of diabetes mellitus; 'K', the presence of high urinary or blood ketoacids; and 'A', a high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Early diagnosis and management are paramount to improve patient outcomes. The mainstays of treatment include restoration of circulating volume, insulin therapy, electrolyte replacement and treatment of any underlying precipitating event. Without optimal treatment, DKA remains a condition with appreciable, although largely preventable, morbidity and mortality. In this Primer, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, risk factors and diagnosis of DKA and provide practical recommendations for the management of DKA in adults and children.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: exciting implications for clinical practice [^114Y6xhZ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a major acute life‐threatening complication of diabetes, mostly seen in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and less commonly in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). It is usually defined as a metabolic state in which the individual has either a glucose concentration of more than 11.1 mmol/L (> 200 mg/dL) at presentation, or has been previously diagnosed with diabetes; they must have a plasma β‐hydroxybutyrate concentration of 3.0 mmol/L or higher, or urine ketones of more than 2+ on a standard urine ketone test‐stick; and a pH less than 7.3 or a serum bicarbonate of less than 15.0 mmol/L. Blood glucose levels may not always be elevated in DKA, a state referred to as euglycaemic ketoacidosis.

DKA results from a relative or absolute deficiency in circulating insulin associated with elevated glucagon. These, in turn, promote the uncontrolled release of free fatty acids that are converted to ketone bodies, resulting in an anion gap acidosis. Acetoacetate, the primary ketone body, is then converted enzymatically to β‐hydroxybutyrate, the predominant circulating ketone body, and non‐enzymatically to acetone, which is exhaled(Figure 1). The reduced peripheral uptake of glucose and increased endogenous glucose production results in marked hyperglycaemia and dehydration. The metabolic acidosis, hypovolaemia, electrolyte disturbance and hyperosmolar state stimulate a counter‐regulatory hormone response increasing insulin resistance and ketogenesis, further exacerbating the metabolic disturbance, resulting in a downward spiral. If left unaddressed this culminates in altered consciousness, cardiovascular collapse, coma and death.

### Factors associated with the presence of diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis of diabetes in children and young adults: a systematic review [^112rL1JY]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Type 1 diabetes is one of the most common endocrine diseases in children. Worldwide, an estimated 65 000 children under 15 years old develop the disease each year, and the global incidence in children continues to increase at a rate of 3% a year. The current incidence in the UK is around 26/100 000 per year.

Between 10% and 70% of these diagnosed children present in diabetic ketoacidosis, a metabolic derangement characterised by the triad of hyperglycaemia, acidosis, and ketonuria. The current criteria for diagnosis published by the International Society for Paediatric and Adolescent Diabetes is blood glucose > 11 mmol/L, venous pH < 7.3 or bicarbonate < 15 mmol/L, and ketonaemia and ketonuria. It carries a substantial risk of life threatening complications such as cerebral oedema and is the commonest cause of diabetes related death in children. The longer term clinical course of type 1 diabetes also seems to be influenced by it: children with diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis have poorer glycaemic control, less residual β cell function up to two years after diagnosis, and a lower frequency of remission.

It is unclear why some children present in diabetic ketoacidosis whereas others do not and whether the development of diabetic ketoacidosis is a consequence of delayed diagnosis and treatment or whether it reflects a particularly aggressive form of diabetes. Understanding which factors are associated with diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis and the relative importance of delayed diagnosis and treatment is, therefore, important. This potentially informs both our understanding of the disease as well as the development of patient, professional, and population based interventions to reduce the proportion of children presenting in diabetic ketoacidosis. Several individual factors from individual studies have been quoted in guidelines and consensus statements. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of all factors associated with diabetic ketoacidosis at the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children and young adults.

### Association between serum β-hydroxybutyrate levels and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with impaired fasting glucose [^113BoLdM]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2025). Medium credibility.

Recent studies have examined the metabolic consequences of ketone bodies, including βHB, acetoacetate, and acetone, in ketogenic diets. A ketogenic diet, characterized by a very low intake of carbohydrates with unrestricted fat intake, is widely known to be effective for weight loss. In addition, accumulating evidence indicates that a ketogenic diet improves lipid profiles, insulin resistance, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Furthermore, in the process of studying the mechanisms of the pleiotropic effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, the hypothesis that ketogenic conditions can have a favorable metabolic effect has gained strength.

Some researchers have studied the prognosis of individuals with ketogenic tendencies not caused by specific diets or drugs. In 2010, Korean researchers conducted a cross-sectional analysis comparing the clinical characteristics of subjects with and without ketonuria using health check-up data. In that study, the ketonuria group showed favorable metabolic features, such as lower body weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, and blood glucose, and had a lower prevalence of obesity, central obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of ketonuria after fasting was significantly associated with a lower prevalence of obesity, central obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Several years later, another research team used large-scale data and compared the difference in the incidence of new-onset T2D during a long-term follow-up period between groups classified by ketonuria. They recruited 8,703 individuals who were free of diabetes at baseline and defined individuals with ketonuria as those with morning ketonuria, classified as trace, 1+ (150 mg/L), or 2+ (400 mg/L). Then, using 1:4 propensity score matching, the corresponding non-ketonuria group was recruited. Over 12 years, compared to those without ketonuria, individuals with spontaneous ketonuria showed a significantly low incidence of T2D, with an HR of 0.66 (95% CI 0.45–0.96). The researchers also showed a meaningful relationship between urinary ketones and blood βHB levels in an ancillary dataset consisting of patients with T2D using SGLT-2 inhibitors. Except for the ancillary study, the majority of previous studies used ketonuria as a variable since the qualitative or categorical ketonuria test was included in the routine urinalysis set in various clinics or health check-up centers.

### Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care testing for diabetic ketoacidosis at emergency-department triage: { beta }-hydroxybutyrate versus the urine dipstick [^117PnUxn]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

In the emergency department, hyperglycemic patients are screened for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) via a urine dipstick. In this prospective study, we compared the test characteristics of point-of-care β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) analysis with the urine dipstick.

Research Design and Methods

Emergency-department patients with blood glucose ≥ 250 mg/dL had urine dipstick, chemistry panel, venous blood gas, and capillary β-OHB measurements. DKA was diagnosed according to American Diabetes Association criteria.

Results

Of 516 hyperglycemic subjects, 54 had DKA. The urine dipstick had a sensitivity of 98.1% (95% CI 90.1–100), a specificity of 35.1% (30.7–39.6), a positive predictive value of 15% (11.5–19.2), and a negative predictive value of 99.4% (96.6–100) for DKA. Using the manufacturer-suggested cutoff of > 1.5 mmol/L, β-OHB had a sensitivity of 98.1% (90.1–100), a specificity of 78.6% (74.5–82.2), a positive predictive value of 34.9% (27.3–43), and a negative predictive value of 99.7% (98.5–100) for DKA.

Conclusions

Point-of-care β-OHB and the urine dipstick are equally sensitive for detecting DKA (98.1%). However, β-OHB is more specific (78.6 vs. 35.1%), offering the potential to significantly reduce unnecessary DKA work-ups among hyperglycemic patients in the emergency department.

### Prevalence of ketosis, ketonuria, and ketoacidosis during liberal glycemic control in critically ill patients with diabetes: an observational study [^114kfC1M]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

It is uncertain whether liberal glucose control in critically ill diabetic patients leads to increased ketone production and ketoacidosis. Therefore, we aimed to assess the prevalence of ketosis, ketonuria and ketoacidosis in critically ill diabetic patients treated in accordance with a liberal glycemic control protocol.

Methods

We performed a prospective observational cohort study of 60 critically ill diabetic patients with blood and/or urine ketone bodies tested in ICU. All patients were treated according to a liberal glucose protocol targeting a blood glucose level (BGL) between 10 and 14 mmol/l in a single tertiary intensive care unit in Australia. We measured quantitative bedside blood 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) and semi-quantitative urine ketones on ICU admission and daily during ICU stay, for a maximum of 10 consecutive days.

Results

Median blood β-OHB level on admission was 0.3 (0.1, 0.8) mmol/l. Ketoacidosis was rare (3%), but some level of ketosis (β-OHB ≥ 0.6 mmol/l) was found in 38 patients (63%) early during their ICU stay. However, there was no significant difference in prevalence or severity of ketonemia and ketonuria among patients with BGL above (permissive hyperglycemia) or below 10 mmol/l. On multivariable linear regression analysis there was no association between blood ketone levels and BGL, HbA1c, lactate levels, hematocrit, catecholamine infusion or APACHE III score. In contrast, blood ketone levels tended to be higher after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery (P = 0.06).

Conclusions

Liberal glycemic control in critically ill diabetic patients does not appear to be associated with a high prevalence of ketoacidosis or ketonemia. Moreover, ketosis is typically present on admission and resolves rapidly. Finally, cardiopulmonary bypass surgery may be an important trigger of ketone body production.

### Prevalence of ketosis, ketonuria, and ketoacidosis during liberal glycemic control in critically ill patients with diabetes: an observational study [^112c4C5g]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Ketosis in critically ill diabetic patients is common and typically occurs in the period early after admission. Ketosis may be particularly pronounced following cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. However, in critically ill diabetic patients, liberal glycemic control or insulin therapy does not appear to be associated with ketosis. These findings suggest that liberal glycemic control in these patients does not cause additional ketotic stress and imply that factors beyond glycemic control and insulin therapy may be more important drivers of ketosis in such patients.

### Update on measuring ketones [^116xm6bK]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2024). Medium credibility.

Ketone bodies are an energy substrate produced by the liver and used during states of low carbohydrate availability, such as fasting or prolonged exercise. High ketone concentrations can be present with insulin insufficiency and are a key finding in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). During states of insulin deficiency, lipolysis increases and a flood of circulating free fatty acids is converted in the liver into ketone bodies-mainly beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate. During DKA, beta-hydroxybutyrate is the predominant ketone in blood. As DKA resolves, beta-hydroxybutyrate is oxidized to acetoacetate, which is the predominant ketone in the urine. Because of this lag, a urine ketone test might be increasing even as DKA is resolving. Point-of-care tests are available for self-testing of blood ketones and urine ketones through measurement of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate and are cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Acetone forms through spontaneous decarboxylation of acetoacetate and can be measured in exhaled breath, but currently no device is FDA-cleared for this purpose. Recently, technology has been announced for measuring beta-hydroxybutyrate in interstitial fluid. Measurement of ketones can be helpful to assess compliance with low carbohydrate diets; assessment of acidosis associated with alcohol use, in conjunction with SGLT2 inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, both of which can increase the risk of DKA; and to identify DKA due to insulin deficiency. This article reviews the challenges and shortcomings of ketone testing in diabetes treatment and summarizes emerging trends in the measurement of ketones in the blood, urine, breath, and interstitial fluid.

### Utility of ketone measurement in the prevention, diagnosis and management of diabetic ketoacidosis [^113oCyb2]. Diabetic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Ketone measurement is advocated for the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis and assessment of its severity. Assessing the evidence base for ketone measurement in clinical practice is challenging because multiple methods are available but there is a lack of consensus about which is preferable. Evaluating the utility of ketone measurement is additionally problematic because of variability in the biochemical definition of ketoacidosis internationally and in the proposed thresholds for ketone measures. This has led to conflicting guidance from expert bodies on how ketone measurement should be used in the management of ketoacidosis. The development of point-of-care devices that can reliably measure the capillary blood ketone β-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) has widened the spectrum of applications of ketone measurement, but whether the evidence base supporting these applications is robust enough to warrant their incorporation into routine clinical practice remains unclear. The imprecision of capillary blood ketone measures at higher values, the lack of availability of routine laboratory-based assays for BOHB and the continued cost-effectiveness of urine ketone assessment prompt further discussion on the role of capillary blood ketone assessment in ketoacidosis. In the present article, we review the various existing methods of ketone measurement, the precision of capillary blood ketone as compared with other measures, its diagnostic accuracy in predicting ketoacidosis and other clinical applications including prevention, assessment of severity and resolution of ketoacidosis.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — metabolic abnormalities and mitochondrial evaluation: During vomiting episodes, mild mitochondrial dysfunction is suggested by anion gap metabolic acidosis that "is often 15–20 mg/dL", lactic acidosis, urinary ketosis early in the episode, and/or hypoglycemia, and these findings "by themselves do not necessitate a comprehensive metabolic workup". When present, early testing with quantitative urine organic acids and plasma amino acids "can confirm mild mitochondrial dysfunction" by elevated urine ketones, Krebs cycle intermediates, and/or dicarboxylic acids, while "urine organic acids are typically normal" when asymptomatic or after several hours of intravenous dextrose. In some cases, episodes may reflect mitochondrial disease with severe anion gap metabolic acidosis " > 20 mg/dL", insulin resistance, and/or multisystem failure such as cardiomyopathy or seizures.

### Determination of the relationships between hyperemesis gravidarum and systemic inflammation markers: a case ‒ control study [^116oXDyF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Although patients with HEG should have haemoconcentration due to vomiting and dehydration, studies have shown that the Hb levels and WBC counts in HEG patients are not significantly different from those in control individuals. In our study, no significant difference was found in the WBC count and PLT levels between the HEG and control groups; however, a significant difference was detected in terms of the Hb level. Although LYM counts are typically thought to be greater in women with HEG, the literature presents conflicting findings. Some studies have shown that there is no change in LYM counts, whereas others have shown lower counts in the HEG group. In our study, we did not observe any significant difference in LYM counts between the HEG group and the control group. The MPV is an indicator of PLT activation and indicates changes in PLT size. This parameter can be easily assessed using a complete blood count device. Markers indicating PLT activation have been utilized in the diagnosis of various inflammatory diseases. However, no statistically significant difference was reported in the literature when the MPV was investigated in patients diagnosed with HEG, whereas a significant difference was found in one study.

Ketonuria is commonly used in the diagnosis of HEG. Ketonuria serves as a parameter to assess the metabolic consequences and clinical outlook of patients with HEG; however, its relationship with the severity of HEG remains unclear. Various studies have explored this connection. One study reported that ketone levels in HEG patients were associated with longer hospital stays. In contrast, some studies have shown that ketone levels have no direct relationship with the clinical severity of HEG. One study reported a positive correlation between the level of ketones in urine and the NLR and PLR. We evaluated the same relationship in HEG patients. However, we did not find any significant relationships between ketonuria and inflammatory markers such as the NLR, PLR and MLR.

Our study has several limitations. First, our study had a retrospective design. Dehydration and malnutrition may increase the systemic inflammatory response. This point should be considered. Owing to the retrospective nature of the study, this question could not be answered according to the study results. Second, we did not use a scoring system that would allow more specific assessment of HEG. Third, we could not include the CRP level, sedimentation rate, or IL-6 level in our study because these parameters were not measured via routine screening in all patients.

### Urine specific gravity and other urinary indices: inaccurate tests for dehydration [^111GmpgW]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Urine output, specific gravity, and ketones (urinary indices) are commonly used as an objective means to assess for dehydration and gastroenteritis severity; however, their utility has not been established. The study was designed to evaluate the accuracy of urinary indices as diagnostic tests to identify acute dehydration.

Methods

We completed a prospective cohort study in the Emergency Department of an urban pediatric hospital. Seventy-nine subjects ages 3 months to 36 months with gastroenteritis, clinically suspected moderate dehydration, and the need for intravenous rehydration were enrolled in the trial. Urine specific gravity and urine ketone levels were determined with bedside calorimetric (dipstick) testing, and urine output during rehydration and observation was measured by commonly used techniques. An internally validated, weight-based criterion standard for the percent dehydration on enrollment was used to identify the cohort of dehydrated subjects. Correlation statistics were calculated for urine output, specific gravity, and ketones. In addition, multilevel tables were created to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratio at varying test cutoff values to detect 3% and 5% dehydration.

Results

Urine specific gravity (r = -0.06, P = 0.64), urine ketones (r = 0.08, P = 0.52), and urine output during rehydration (r = 0.01, P = 0.96) did not correlate with the initial degree of dehydration present. Clinically useful cutoff values for urine specific gravity and ketones to increase or decrease the likelihood of dehydration at the time of enrollment could not be identified.

Conclusions

Urinary indices are not useful diagnostic tests to identify the presence of dehydration during the initial assessment of children with gastroenteritis.

### Low calory, low fat, ketogenic diet for treatment of infections of urinary tract… [^115Andrs]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The value of ketonuria in the treatment of certain types of infections of the urinary tract has become widely recognized and utilized. Although the ketogenic diets recommended by Clark1 have proved their worth as a therapeutic agent, it has been constantly observed that a considerable proportion of patients placed on this regimen find it unpalatable, and many are completely unable to tolerate it. In a series of fifty cases treated by this method at the University Hospital, it was observed that practically every patient was upset by the diet at one time or another. The gastric upsets produced by its high fat content were so objectionable to some that they refused to continue on this regimen. Modifications of the diet were therefore made in an effort to remove this objectionable feature. It has long been recognized as a fundamental principle of metabolism that the organism is not dependent on NESBIT RM, McDONNELL CH.

### Prolonged glucosuria and relapse of diabetic ketoacidosis related to SGLT2-inhibitor therapy [^116JHDXY]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

It is essential that inpatient therapy of SGLT2i‐related DKA focuses on providing adequate insulin and dextrose independent of serum glucose concentrations given ongoing glucosuria despite resolution of metabolic acidosis. Monitoring urine glucose concentration may also assist in the risk assessment for DKA relapse in this setting. A larger, prospective multicentre study comparing patients with DKA on SGLT2i to a control group of DKA and no SGLT2i that closely monitors urine glucose concentrations and other relevant clinical factors is necessary to define recommended monitoring and management strategies. Guidelines for treatment of SGLT2i‐related DKA should recognize that patient characteristics and course may differ from that of classical DKA and require vigilance to prevent relapse and extended hospitalization.

### Evaluation of a nitroprusside dip test for ketone bodies… [^112tPsm9]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The detection of ketone bodies in urine specimens is sufficiently important to warrant the inclusion of a nitroprusside test for ketonuria as a part of the routine urinalysis. In the past, methods available have included a tablet test and the Rothera test, a conventional test tube procedure. Recently the nitroprusside test for urine ketones has been made available as a stick or dip test with a preparation called Ketostix. This test, like the other nitroprusside tests, depends on the reaction between acetoacetic acid and nitroprusside to produce a colored complex. In order to determine the accuracy and simplicity of the new test, it was compared with the two more standard procedures on a series of routine urine specimens in a general hospital laboratory. Tests were also carried out by experienced and inexperienced personnel on urines with and without added acetoacetic acid. The present report describes the results obtained in.

### The impact of maternal ketonuria on fetal test results in the setting of postterm pregnancy [^111BY1M6]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine whether ketonuria, a commonly assessed urinary marker of maternal starvation and dehydration, is associated with abnormal fetal test results in the setting of postterm pregnancy.

Study Design

During a 4-year period (January 1993-December 1996), a total of 3655 visits for antepartum maternal-fetal testing of postterm pregnancies (≥ 41 weeks' gestation) occurred at our institution. Maternal assessment included vital signs and urinalysis. The presence and degree of maternal ketonuria was correlated against abnormal results of fetal heart rate tests, nonstress tests, amniotic fluid index measurements, and biophysical profile scores performed on the same day.

Results

There were 3601 encounters suitable for inclusion in the study. Clinically detectable ketonuria occurred in 10.9% of the patients studied. Patients with clinically detectable ketonuria were at increased risk relative to patients without ketonuria for abnormal outcomes during postterm testing, including the presence of oligohydramnios (24% vs. 9.3%; P < .0001), nonreactive nonstress tests (6.2% vs. 2.15%; P < .0001), and fetal heart rate decelerations (14% vs 9.2%; p = 0.0039).

Conclusion

Maternal ketonuria among patients with postterm pregnancy was associated with a > 2-fold increase in the occurrence of oligohydramnios, a 3-fold increase in nonreactive nonstress tests, and a significant increase in fetal heart rate decelerations. Further studies are required to evaluate the potential benefits of treating ketonuria before fetal testing.

### Carbidopa and levodopa [^114VCi1f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Laboratory Tests

Abnormalities in laboratory tests may include elevations of liver function tests such as alkaline phosphatase, SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and bilirubin. Abnormalities in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and positive Coombs test have also been reported. Commonly, levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and uric acid are lower during administration of carbidopa-levodopa preparations than with levodopa.

Carbidopa-levodopa preparations, such as carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release and carbidopa and levodopa extended-release, may cause a false-positive reaction for urinary ketone bodies when a test tape is used for determination of ketonuria. This reaction will not be altered by boiling the urine specimen. False-negative tests may result with the use of glucose-oxidase methods of testing for glucosuria.

Cases of falsely diagnosed pheochromocytoma in patients on carbidopa-levodopa therapy have been reported very rarely. Caution should be exercised when interpreting the plasma and urine levels of catecholamines and their metabolites in patients on levodopa or carbidopa-levodopa therapy.

### Prevalence of ketosis, ketonuria, and ketoacidosis during liberal glycemic control in critically ill patients with diabetes: an observational study [^116Ge7qU]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Strengths and limitations

Our study has several strengths. We prospectively analyzed a representative sample of patients with diabetes using the same point-of-care analysis platform in every patient. The setting of a tertiary hospital with a heterogeneous case mix is likely to reflect the average ICU population. We performed daily ketone measurements and simultaneously tested urine samples for ketonuria during the entire ICU stay or up to 10 consecutive days. We used a multivariable model to assess the relationship between blood ketone levels and glycemic control, markers of disease severity and insulin administration. Our findings are robust and demonstrate that blood ketone levels are unrelated to blood glucose levels or insulin treatment in the critically ill diabetic patient without diabetic ketoacidosis within the boundaries of a liberal glucose protocol.

Our study has some limitations. First, it is observational in nature and not a randomized controlled study. However, our aim was to explore the prevalence of ketosis during liberal glucose management of critically ill diabetic patients. Second, this is a single-center study with only a limited number of patients. However, we used solid methodology and obtained more than 270 blood ketone measurements and analyzed more than 100 hyperglycemic episodes. Third, we used a semi-quantitative method to measure ketonuria. However, given the inherent limitations of point-of-care urine ketone tests, and in view of our results, it is unlikely that quantitative methods would have influenced our results. Yet, previous validation studies suggest that the use of point-of-care instruments may overestimate true blood β-OHB levels when hematocrit is below normal, which was the case in most of our patients. Hence, we may have overestimated the true ketosis prevalence. Fourth, we did not measure plasma insulin concentrations or C-peptide levels and were therefore not able to quantify beta-cell function. Furthermore, although we lack data on counter-regulatory hormone, FFA, amino acid and oxaloacetate levels, we assessed clinical variables relevant to ketogenesis. Fifth, we did not measure glycosuria, which may be particularly pronounced in critically ill patients during permissive hyperglycemia. The degree of glycosuria in such patients and its impact on patient-centered outcomes should therefore be explored in future studies. Sixth, we did not measure acetoacetate and acetone and could therefore not quantify the total ketotic activity. Perturbations in the mitochondrial redox state during critical illness may alter the ratio between acetoacetate and β-OHB. However, we performed repeated β-OHB measurements over several days and observed a consistent and marked decline over time. It is unlikely that unmeasured ketones would have a different directional change over the corresponding time frame. Finally, because the results of the daily ketone measurements were documented on the observational chart, we cannot exclude that these data influenced glucose management by clinicians. However, nursing and research staff performed ketone measurements and documentation without direct involvement of medical staff.

### Feasibility of continuous ketone monitoring in subcutaneous tissue using a ketone sensor [^112593dJ]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2021). Medium credibility.

Ketones produced during ketosis or ketoacidosis are water soluble ketones, namely, acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), and the spontaneous breakdown product of acetoacetate, which is acetone. In a setting of acidosis, acetoacetate is converted into BHB. With resolution of the ketoacidosis, BHB levels fall, with an increase in the conversion of BHB to acetoacetate that remains detectable in the urine. Therefore, BHB is the primary ketone body that indicates the onset and resolution of a ketoacidosis and levels are commonly sampled over time in the critical care setting to help guide therapy.

Currently, measurement of ketone levels is most frequently performed using urine or blood ketone test strips. Assays using blood are based on BHB utilizing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +) dependent β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (β-HBDH) enzyme. These measurements do not indicate the onset of ketosis or ketoacidosis, but rather confirm if ketosis or ketoacidosis is already in progress and may require medical attention. In real world clinical care, patients seldom check their ketone levels as recommended by the health care professional because of the lack of availability of the in-date strips at the time of needand the fingerstick blood testing requires a conscious action by the patient. Under multiple scenarios, such as failure of insulin delivery, sick days, low carbohydrate intake, use of SGLT2 inhibitors, high risk patients such as people with T1D, or recurring DKA, and so on, patients would benefit from a continuous ketone sensor. Further, continuous monitoring such as how glucose is measured, has been shown to provide real-time behavior feedback to help guide treatment decisions. Measurement of analytes beyond glucose may provide additional information for self-management decisions, potentially reducing the incidence and severity of DKA and perhaps serving as a tool to inform those following a ketogenic diet.

Many women suffered from nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy: it has been estimated that the incidence was as high as 70% of pregnancies. HG (HG) is a severe form of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. HG is associated with fluid, electrolyte, and acid–base imbalances, nutritional deficiencies, and weight loss, and is often severe enough to require hospitalization. Generally, about 60% of HG cases resolved by the end of early pregnancy, and up to 90% of cases resolved by 20 weeks of gestation. Studies have concluded that ketonuria and high serum urea were particularly valid laboratory indicators of the severity of HG, as they were good markers of starvation and dehydration. Ketosis implies heavy use of fat stores and fat metabolism. Similarly, urea is a byproduct of protein metabolism, and high serum urea in patients with HG may be due to a combination of protein-energy catabolism metabolism and may be exacerbated by dehydration-induced reduced renal clearance. Although ketonuria was not found to be a marker of HG in a meta-analysis, 65% of the articles included in the meta-analysis were found to have ketonuria in patients with HG only, suggesting that elevated ketone bodies possess some influences in HG.

### Rosiglitazone maleate and metformin hydrochloride (Avandamet) [^115mfNx8]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

The onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur. AVANDAMET should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose and, if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of AVANDAMET, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.

Levels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking AVANDAMET do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity or technical problems in sample handling.

Lactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).

### Investigation of renal tubular function with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus during diabetic ketoacidosis [^111ciNtu]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Proximal renal tubular dysfunction occurs during diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in type 1 diabetes. However, only a few studies have reported on the multiple proximal renal tubular functions simultaneously. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, distal renal tubular function has not yet been investigated.

Methods

Patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus were classified into those with DKA and those without DKA, and their proximal and distal renal tubular functions were investigated. The diagnostic criteria for DKA were blood glucose > 200 mg/dL, blood pH < 7.3 or HCO₃⁻ < 15 mEq/L, and urine ketone body positivity.

Results

Six patients with DKA and five patients without DKA were included. In patients with DKA, urinary β₂-microglobulin levels were significantly higher, while blood pH, HCO₃⁻, and tubular reabsorption of phosphorus were significantly lower than in those without DKA. There were no significant differences in blood glucose, HbA1c, serum phosphorus, urinary N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, and urinary amino acid excretion between patients with and without DKA. Elevated NH₃ levels and impaired urinary acidification were not observed in patients with and without DKA.

Conclusions

In patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus complicated with DKA, multiple proximal renal tubular dysfunctions occur simultaneously, suggesting transient Fanconi syndrome. Distal renal tubular acidosis was unlikely. The diagnostic criteria for DKA are appropriate also in the view of proximal renal tubular dysfunction and are considered suggestive of pathophysiological factors that may cause proximal renal tubular dysfunction.

### Gluconeogenesis defect presenting with resistant hyperglycemia and acidosis mimicking diabetic ketoacidosis [^1175deEC]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Fructose-1,6-diphosphatase (FDPase) enzyme deficiency is a rare inherited metabolic disease. Affected patients usually present with metabolic crisis including hypoglycemia, acidosis, ketonuria, and hyperuricemia. A previously healthy 8-month-old male infant presented with fever, vomiting, and hypoactivity. He had tachycardia, tachypnea, and a tendency to sleep. The patient had signs of severe dehydration and shock. Laboratory findings revealed significant lactic acidosis, hyperuricemia, hyperglycemia, elevated liver enzyme level, and hyperlipidemia. The urine analysis had evidence of glycosuria and ketonuria. Hyperuricemia, lactic acidemia, and hyperglycemia persisted despite insulin infusion, adequate hydration, and perfusion. Consequently, peritoneal dialysis was started. About 12 hours after dialysis, his metabolic derangements were normalized, and clinical status was improved dramatically. His metabolic disease workup was compatible with FDPase deficiency. Here, we described a metabolic attack of FDPase deficiency presented with hyperglycemia mimicking diabetic ketoacidosis.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis: a potential complication of treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition [^114EzAFr]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are the most recently approved antihyperglycemic medications. We sought to describe their association with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (euDKA) in hopes that it will enhance recognition of this potentially life-threatening complication.

Research Design and Methods

Cases identified incidentally are described.

Results

We identified 13 episodes of SGLT-2 inhibitor-associated euDKA or ketosis in nine individuals, seven with type 1 diabetes and two with type 2 diabetes, from various practices across the U.S. The absence of significant hyperglycemia in these patients delayed recognition of the emergent nature of the problem by patients and providers.

Conclusions

SGLT-2 inhibitors seem to be associated with euglycemic DKA and ketosis, perhaps as a consequence of their noninsulin-dependent glucose clearance, hyperglucagonemia, and volume depletion. Patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who experience nausea, vomiting, or malaise or develop a metabolic acidosis in the setting of SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy should be promptly evaluated for the presence of urine and/or serum ketones. SGLT-2 inhibitors should only be used with great caution, extensive counseling, and close monitoring in the setting of type 1 diabetes.

### Prevalence of ketosis, ketonuria, and ketoacidosis during liberal glycemic control in critically ill patients with diabetes: an observational study [^111CvyBH]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Key findings

We performed a prospective observational study to explore the prevalence of ketonemia and ketonuria in critically ill diabetic patients treated within a liberal glycemic control protocol. Overall, about two thirds of our patients had some degree of ketosis (β-OHB ≥ 0.6 mmol/l) during their ICU stay and 33% had some degree of ketonuria. However, ketosis in these critically ill diabetic patients managed with liberal glycemic control was typically seen in the first 24–48 hours of admission and appeared independent of glucose control, HbA1c level and severity of illness. Moreover, ketosis resolved in all patients irrespective of whether insulin was given or not. Finally, ketosis appeared more pronounced following cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.

Relationship to previous studies

To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the prevalence of ketosis in critically ill diabetic patients without acute diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. We are also the first to describe the prevalence of ketosis in patients treated with a liberal glucose protocol (BGL target 10–14 mmol/l).

In accordance with our results, a study of 32 ventilated non-diabetic ICU patients with (n = 19) and without (n = 13) stress hyperglycemia (BGL up to 16 mmol/l) found no relationship between breath acetone concentration and BGL. While in most patients (n = 11) breath acetone concentration decreased after insulin administration, some had persistent ketosis despite normal BGL.

The two main ketone bodies, acetoacetate (AcAc) and 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB), usually circulate in low concentrations (< 0.5 mmol/l) in healthy adults. Serum levels of β-OHB start to rise after 12–16 hours of fasting (an essentially ubiquitous state in critically ill patients in the period surrounding ICU admission), reaching 1–2 mmol/l after 2 days, and 6–8 mmol/l after 2–3 weeks of starvation.

### Exploring the clinical utility of blood ketone levels in the emergency department assessment of paediatric patients [^114mDkrT]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Ketonuria (on standard urine testing) is a frequent finding in children presenting to emergency departments. With the advent of hand-held ketone meters, blood ketone levels can now be rapidly quantified.

Hypothesis

Point of care testing (POCT) of blood ketone levels could provide clinically useful information on severity of illness in children and risk of hospital admission.

Methods

A prospective study using POCT of blood ketone levels in a convenience sample of children < 13 years old, with a typical case mix of medical problems.

Findings

186 children were studied. The range of ketone levels varied widely among this study population depending on the presenting complaint. Higher levels were noted in those presenting with anorexia or vomiting and fever. The median ketone level of the total study population was 0.2 (range 0–6.0, interquartile range 0.1–0.9) mmol/l. Ketone levels correlated poorly with discharge destination and duration of admission. However, receiver-operator characteristics for ketones as a predictor of admission were comparable to Pediatric Risk of Admission scores (area under the curve 0.64 and 0.72, respectively) and may represent an independent risk factor for admission. A ketone level > 1.2 mmol/l has a positive predictive value of 66.7% for admission. Ketone levels correlated well with decreased oral intake (R² = 0.25; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

A strong association was found between ketone levels, decreased oral intake and fever. Although ketone levels do not correlate well with more traditional markers of illness severity, they can help to predict the requirement for admission to hospital when interpreted in the context of the presenting illness. They may have applications in both the emergency department and primary care settings. Further prospective testing is required to validate these findings.

### Controversies around the measurement of blood ketones to diagnose and manage diabetic ketoacidosis [^111aUKuC]. Diabetes Care (2022). Medium credibility.

The measurement of blood ketones in preference to urine ketones has become a well-established tool in the diagnosis and management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). However, there remains considerable disparity between diabetes guidelines regarding if, how, and when this test should be used. While recent guidelines now mainly emphasize blood measurement, several issues nonetheless remain. Many laboratories still measure blood ketones using a semiquantitative test that does not measure the predominant ketone, β-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB), which may hinder patient management. Even when BOHB is measured, the evidence for cutoffs used in DKA diagnosis or exclusion is limited, while its use in gauging severity, treatment progress, and resolution is not fully clear. Lastly, although employing point-of-care meters instead of a laboratory for BOHB measurement brings undoubted benefits, this approach has its own challenges. This article provides a perspective on these topics to complement current recommendations and to suggest how future research may improve its use in the DKA context.

Regarding patient education for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to general counseling, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to educate patients with diabetes at risk for developing DKA and/or following a ketogenic eating pattern and being treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors on the risks and signs of ketoacidosis and methods of risk mitigation management, and provide them with appropriate tools for accurate ketone measurement (serum β-hydroxybutyrate).

### Accidental ketosis-induced polyuria in a toddler: a case report [^111FNs5s]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Polyuria refers to the excessive production of urine, generally defined as > 2000 mL/m²/24h in the pediatric population. Polyuria is differentiated from urinary frequency, which is the increased need to urinate without excessive urine volume production. While urinary frequency is a relatively common phenomenon in children, often occurring in the setting of lower genito-urinary tract infections, the causes of polyuria in pediatric patients are less common and require prompt recognition and diagnosis. Polyuria frequently presents in the setting of underlying conditions that result in either a water diuresis or solute diuresis. The differential diagnosis for new-onset polyuria in the pediatric population includes diabetes mellitus, central diabetes insipidus, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, in addition to other less common metabolic, endocrine, renal, and psychological causes (Table 1).

### Blood β-hydroxybutyrate vs. urine acetoacetate testing for the prevention and management of ketoacidosis in type 1 diabetes: a systematic review [^112H9My1]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

Diabetic ketoacidosis is a life-threatening complication of Type 1 diabetes. Blood β-hydroxybutyrate testing is now widely available as an alternative to urine acetoacetate testing for detecting ketosis. The aim of this study was to review the effectiveness of capillary or serum β-hydroxybutyrate compared with urine acetoacetate testing in prevention and management of diabetic ketoacidosis.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBM Reviews, The Cochrane Library and CINAHL (until April 2012, no language restrictions, studies in humans) were searched for experimental and observational studies comparing the effectiveness of blood β-hydroxybutyrate and urine acetoacetate testing. Outcomes examined were prevention of diabetic ketoacidosis, time to recovery from diabetic ketoacidosis, healthcare costs and patient or caregiver satisfaction. Additional sources included reference lists, conference proceedings and contact with experts in the field.

Results

Four studies (two randomized controlled trials and two cohort studies) met eligibility criteria, including 299 participants across 11 centres. Risk of bias was low to moderate. Blood ketone testing compared with urine testing was associated with reduced frequency of hospitalization (one study), reduced time to recovery from diabetic ketoacidosis (three studies), cost benefits (one study) and greater satisfaction (one study, intervention group only). No study assessed prevention of diabetic ketoacidosis. Meta-analysis could not be performed because of heterogeneity in study design and published data.

Conclusions

There is evidence suggesting that blood β-hydroxybutyrate testing is more effective than urine acetoacetate testing in reducing emergency department assessment, hospitalization and time to recovery from diabetic ketoacidosis, as well as potentially lowering healthcare expenditure. Further research in both young people and adults is needed.

### Dapagliflozin [^1121kc4j]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and consider ketone monitoring in others at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis, if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS.

Withhold DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

5.2 Volume Depletion

Dapagliflozin can cause intravascular volume depletion which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine. There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, and renal function after initiating therapy.

5.3 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis

Serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization have been reported in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

5.4 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues

Insulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylureas) are known to cause hypoglycemia. DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or an insulin secretagogue [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when these agents are used in combination with DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Dapagliflozin and saxagliptin (Qtern) [^111b1XcH]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Other Ketoacidosis

In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, dapagliflozin, a component of QTERN, significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening event, beyond the background rate. In placebo-controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to patients who received placebo. QTERN is not indicated for glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g., history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin.

Precipitating conditions for diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketoacidosis include under-insulinization due to insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse.

Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g., less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for 3 days after discontinuing QTERN [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.2)]; however, there have been postmarketing reports of ketoacidosis and/or glucosuria lasting greater than 6 days and some up to 2 weeks after discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibitors.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: exciting implications for clinical practice [^116414cU]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

3 BREATH‐BASED KETONE TESTING

Although not widely available clinically, ketones can also be measured by breath testing. The predominant ketone measured is acetone, which is volatile and exhaled. Advantages include the painless assessment of ketone levels and no necessity for blood exposure or urine collection. Additionally, changes in acetone are dynamic and may provide an early signal of change in a person's metabolic state. Conversely, breath ketone meters are expensive, the test needs to be user‐initiated and the person is required to carry an additional device. A proof‐of‐concept study evaluating a breath ketone analyser (Ketonix, Varberg, Sweden) in 10 adults and nine children with T1D concluded that the device could be used to rule out ketosis in adults, but not in children. However, in general, there is a lack of an evidence base for the accuracy and dynamic range of these devices for those with T1D because they have generally been developed for those pursuing ketogenic diets instead of for medical use.

### Prevalence of ketosis, ketonuria, and ketoacidosis during liberal glycemic control in critically ill patients with diabetes: an observational study [^111qu7qM]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Implications of study findings

Our finding that a BGL ≥ 10 mmol/l is not associated with increased ketogenesis and that critical illness is associated with some degree of peri-admission ketosis irrespective of blood glucose level and insulin therapy implies that a BGL range of 10–14 mmol/l in critically ill diabetic patients may be associated with minimal additional ketogenic metabolic stress.

Low nutritional intake in the hours and days before ICU admission is a plausible explanation for the observed early ketosis of critical illness in our population. Indeed, although only about half of our patients received nutrition, their caloric intake progressively increased, which may have contributed to the observed decline in ketone levels over time. In addition, it seems that endogenous insulin secretion due to residual beta-cell function may be sufficient to suppress ketogenesis in patients not requiring insulin. This hypothesis is also supported by a lack of correlation between the level of ketonemia and blood glucose in our patients. In addition, even in our patients with premorbid insulin-dependent diabetes, the majority of which also required insulin in ICU, early ketosis resolved despite sustained hyperglycemia.

The clinical relevance of ketosis in ICU patients remains unclear as recent studies suggest that β-OHB could have anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 production. In addition, ketone bodies provide important energy source for vital organs not only during starvation but also during stress-induced insulin resistance. Ketogenesis could, therefore, be an adaptive and protective response to critical illness.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis: evaluation and treatment [^116ZgiFF]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is characterized by a serum glucose level greater than 250 mg per dL, a pH less than 7.3, a serum bicarbonate level less than 18 mEq per L, an elevated serum ketone level, and dehydration. Insulin deficiency is the main precipitating factor. Diabetic ketoacidosis can occur in persons of all ages, with 14 percent of cases occurring in persons older than 70 years, 23 percent in persons 51 to 70 years of age, 27 percent in persons 30 to 50 years of age, and 36 percent in persons younger than 30 years. The case fatality rate is 1 to 5 percent. About one-third of all cases are in persons without a history of diabetes mellitus. Common symptoms include polyuria with polydipsia (98 percent), weight loss (81 percent), fatigue (62 percent), dyspnea (57 percent), vomiting (46 percent), preceding febrile illness (40 percent), abdominal pain (32 percent), and polyphagia (23 percent). Measurement of A1C, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, serum glucose, electrolytes, pH, and serum ketones; complete blood count; urinalysis; electrocardiography; and calculation of anion gap and osmolar gap can differentiate diabetic ketoacidosis from hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, gastroenteritis, starvation ketosis, and other metabolic syndromes, and can assist in diagnosing comorbid conditions. Appropriate treatment includes administering intravenous fluids and insulin, and monitoring glucose and electrolyte levels. Cerebral edema is a rare but severe complication that occurs predominantly in children. Physicians should recognize the signs of diabetic ketoacidosis for prompt diagnosis, and identify early symptoms to prevent it. Patient education should include information on how to adjust insulin during times of illness and how to monitor glucose and ketone levels, as well as information on the importance of medication compliance.

### Sequence variants associating with urinary biomarkers [^115yMC8e]. Human Molecular Genetics (2019). Medium credibility.

For glucosuria, ketonuria, proteinuria and hematuria, we performed three different categorical analyses for each trait: (1) All positive results: cases with at least one measurement of + or greater versus negative controls; (2) Mild: cases with at least one + measurement, but never ++ or greater, versus negative controls; (3) Moderate/Severe: cases with at least one measurement of ++ or greater versus negative controls (Table 1). Results that read ' ' were not included in the analysis. For these phenotypes, we also performed separate analysis for each sex and examined if the association results were different between the sexes.

Glucosuria cases and controls were categorized as + cases (N = 4748), ++/+++/++++ cases (N = 6109) and − controls (N = 135 512).

Ketonuria cases and controls were categorized as + cases (N = 19 327), ++/+++/++++ cases (N = 21 803) and − controls (N = 95 568).

Proteinura cases and controls were categorized as + cases (N = 28 692), ++/+++/++++ cases (N = 25 317) and − controls (N = 91 538)

Hematuria cases and controls were categorized as + cases (N = 18 839), ++/+++/++++ cases (N = 49 212) and − controls (N = 68 903).

For urine pH, we performed categorical analysis in which low pH cases (N = 35 897) were those with at least one measurement of pH ≤ 5, while controls (N = 112 302) were individuals who had only measurements of ≥ 5.5. We also tested urine pH as a quantitative trait (N = 149 899) with the measurements rank-standard normalized separately for each sex, using age as a covariate. Multiple measurements per individual were averaged after standardization.

### Accidental ketosis-induced polyuria in a toddler: a case report [^116LK1or]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

In the pediatric population, parental concern of recent onset frequent or large volume urination in young children is common.

Case Presentation

A 2-year-old male with no significant past medical history and unremarkable family history was brought to his pediatrician by his mother who reports that the child had been "soaking through his diapers" for the previous two to 3 days. Mother states that patient has not had an appreciable change in the number of wet diapers per day, just the perceived weight/volume of each diaper. The patient's mother denied any recent illness, apparent abdominal pain, dysuria, or recent changes in his bowel movements. She similarly denied polydipsia, polyphagia, or gross hematuria in the patient. Patient's diet consists of eating a low carbohydrate with mostly high protein and fat diet that was similar to the paleo-type diet consumed by her and her husband. Meals over the recent days were even lower in carbohydrates than usual as the family was actively trying to consume healthier food options. On physical exam the child was found to be afebrile with a normal physical exam. A urine dipstick was performed and was positive for 2+ ketones and 1+ protein. Urine leukocytes and nitrites were negative, as was urinary glucose. A fingerstick blood glucose sample was 83mg/dL. Based on the patient's physical examination, laboratory findings, and the history which revealed a very-low carbohydrate diet, a preliminary diagnosis of ketosis-induced polyuria was made. The patient's mother was advised to incorporate a greater portion of carbohydrates into her son's diet, with a follow-up scheduled for the following week. At the follow-up appointment the mother reports that she had continued the patient's carbohydrate intake and the excessive urine amount per wet diaper has not returned. Repeat urine dipstick confirmed the resolution of the ketonuria and proteinuria.

Conclusion

This case illustrates the inadvertent consequences that can occur when parents impose new fad diets on their young children. The recent increase in the popularity of fad diets makes the consideration of alternative diets important to review in the patient history and subsequently include in the differential diagnosis of polyuria.

### Ketonuria does not exclude hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia… [^116iayiq]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- We examined the relationship between serum β-hydroxybutyrate and plasma glucose concentrations and between serum free fatty acid and glucose concentrations in 34 normal children who fasted for up to 24 hours. The BOHB concentration correlated inversely with the glucose concentration, as did the FFA concentration. We compared these results with those in six patients with hypoglycemia due to hyperinsulinism. In the hyperinsulinemic children, hypoglycemia was invariably associated with relative hypoketonemia. The FFA concentrations were also unduly low. However, despite being significantly hypoketonemic when hypoglycemic, four of the six hyperinsulinemic patients had ketonuria. Since it does not exclude hyperinsulinism, ketonuria may be a potentially misleading finding in a hypoglycemic child. Wolfsdorf JI, Sadeghi-Nejad A, Senior B.

### Significance of postoperative glycosuria and ketonuria in nondiabetic adults… [^114vWiuL]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

EVEN though glycosuria and acetonuria are fairly common after operation, their exact significance is not generally known. Do they mean a serious disturbance in carbohydrate metabolism. Is the excretion of ketone bodies evidence of a transient overproduction thereof by the liver or of diminished utilization by peripheral tissue. Is the glycosuria the result of a diminution of peripheral utilization of glucose or of increased glycogenolysis. A number of surgical patients were observed in whom quantitative determinations of the 24 hour output of glucose and of acetone were made in an attempt to answer these questions. A few of these observations were briefly reported in a previous paper from this laboratory. 1 PREVIOUS WORK In an exhaustive report published in 1933, Roscher2 studied and reviewed postoperative acidosis and ketonuria. A disturbance in acid-base balance was common, particularly in patients operated on under general anesthesia. A fall in the pH and.

### Optimising the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors for type 1 diabetes [^114F3ib3]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Consider Prescribing Dapagliflozin

People most suitable for dapagliflozin in T1DM are likely to be those with a BMI ≥ 27 kg/m², established on stable optimised insulin therapy (i.e. not recently diagnosed) and with high insulin needs (i.e. > 0.5 units/kg of body weight/day).

One of the most important criteria for determining if someone is suitable for dapagliflozin treatment is normal blood ketone levels (< 0.6 mmol/l). Urine ketone monitoring is not advisable as it is not deemed to be as accurate as blood ketone testing, since urine test results are indicative of blood ketone levels in the past, and accuracy is also affected by hydration levels and kidney function. The willingness/ability to follow prescribed regimens for monitoring ketones and responding appropriately to elevated ketone levels must also be considered.

Additional criteria for which people with T1DM should be prescribed dapagliflozin include glomerular filtration rate (GFR) > 60 ml/min/1.73 m² (as dapagliflozin efficacy is dependent on renal function) and age 18–74 years (as the DEPICT clinical trial programme was conducted in this age group).

Participants

The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age at onset under 18 years; (2) diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) based on the ICD code from the electronic health records (EHRs) or biochemical criteria for DKA as recommended by guidelines: a. hyperglycemia (blood sample glucose > 11 mmol/L [≈ 200 mg/dL]), serum blood bicarbonate < 18 mmol/L or pH < 7.30, ketonemia (blood β-hydroxybutyrate ≥ 3 mmol/L) or moderate or large ketonuria; those with hyperglycemia, ketonuria and ketonemia while without acidosis were also included due to the presence of DK; (3) availability of medical records both at onset and after two years of diabetes. Given that the primary objective of this study was the classification and diagnosis of diabetes in pediatric patients with DK/DKA onset, individuals with other types of diabetes, including drug-induced or pancreatitis-induced diabetes, as well as genetically induced diabetes without DKA manifestations (e.g. neonatal diabetes, MODY), were excluded from the study.

### Breath acetone is a reliable indicator of ketosis in adults consuming ketogenic meals [^112ZueNY]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Ketogenic diets are used therapeutically to treat intractable seizures. Clinically, it appears that the maintenance of ketosis is crucial to the efficacy of the diet in ameliorating seizures. To understand how ketosis and seizure protection are related, a reliable, noninvasive measure of ketosis that can be performed frequently with minimal discomfort is needed.

Objective

The objective was to determine which index, breath acetone or urinary acetoacetate, is more strongly related to the plasma ketones acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate.

Design

After fasting overnight for 12 h, 12 healthy adults consumed 4 ketogenic meals over 12 h. Blood, breath, and urine samples were collected hourly. Blood was analyzed for plasma acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate, breath for acetone, and urine for acetoacetate.

Results

By the end of the 12-h dietary treatment, plasma acetoacetate, plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate, and breath acetone had increased 3.5-fold, whereas urinary acetoacetate increased 13-fold when measured enzymatically and 25-fold when measured with urinary ketone dipsticks. Plasma acetoacetate was best predicted by breath acetone (R² = 0.70, P < 0.0001). Plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate was equally predicted by breath acetone and urinary acetoacetate (R² = 0.54, P = 0.0040).

Conclusions

Breath acetone is as good a predictor of ketosis as is urinary acetoacetate. Breath acetone analysis is noninvasive and can be performed frequently with minimal discomfort to patients. As an indicator of ketosis in epilepsy patients consuming a ketogenic diet, breath acetone may be useful for understanding the mechanism of the diet, elucidating the importance of ketosis in seizure protection, and ultimately, enhancing the efficacy of the diet by improving patient monitoring.

### Feasibility and biological activity of a ketogenic / intermittent-fasting diet in patients with glioma [^111dM2fT]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine the feasibility, safety, systemic biological activity, and cerebral activity of a ketogenic dietary intervention in patients with glioma.

Methods

Twenty-five patients with biopsy-confirmed World Health Organization grade 2 to 4 astrocytoma with stable disease after adjuvant chemotherapy were enrolled in an 8-week Glioma Atkins-Based Diet (GLAD). GLAD consisted of 2 fasting days (calories < 20% calculated estimated needs) interleaved between 5 modified Atkins diet days (net carbohydrates ≤ 20 g/d) each week. The primary outcome was dietary adherence by food records. Markers of systemic and cerebral activity included weekly urine ketones, serum insulin, glucose, hemoglobin A1c, insulin-like growth factor-1, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy at baseline and week 8.

Results

Twenty-one patients (84%) completed the study. Eighty percent of patients reached ≥ 40 mg/dL urine acetoacetate during the study. Forty-eight percent of patients were adherent by food record. The diet was well tolerated, with two grade 3 adverse events (neutropenia, seizure). Measures of systemic activity, including hemoglobin A1c, insulin, and fat body mass, decreased significantly, while lean body mass increased. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrated increased ketone concentrations (β-hydroxybutyrate [bHB] and acetone) in both lesional and contralateral brain compared to baseline. Average ketonuria correlated with cerebral ketones in lesional (tumor) and contralateral brain (bHB Rₛ = 0.52, p = 0.05). Subgroup analysis of isocitrate dehydrogenase-mutant glioma showed no differences in cerebral metabolites after controlling for ketonuria.

Conclusion

The GLAD dietary intervention, while demanding, produced meaningful ketonuria and significant systemic and cerebral metabolic changes in participants. Ketonuria in participants correlated with cerebral ketone concentration and appears to be a better indicator of systemic activity than patient-reported food records.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^114o9ADe]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

4. Interpretation

RECOMMENDATION: KETONES MEASURED IN URINE OR BLOOD IN THE HOME SETTING BY PATIENTS WITH DIABETES AND IN THE CLINIC/HOSPITAL SETTING SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ONLY AN ADJUNCT TO THE DIAGNOSIS OF DKA GPP.

A. Urine ketone measurements.

The presence of positive urine ketone readings in a patient with known diabetes or a patient not previously diagnosed with diabetes but who presents with typical symptoms of diabetes and hyperglycemia suggests the possibility of impending or established DKA. Although DKA is most commonly associated with type 1 diabetes, it may occur rarely in type 2 diabetic patients. Patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis will have positive urine ketone readings, but hyperglycemia is not usually present. Positive urine ketone readings are found in up to 30% of first morning urine samples from pregnant women (with or without diabetes), during starvation, and after hypoglycemia.

RECOMMENDATION: BLOOD KETONE DETERMINATIONS THAT RELY ON THE NITROPRUSSIDE REACTION SHOULD BE USED ONLY AS AN ADJUNCT TO DIAGNOSE DKA AND SHOULD NOT BE USED TO MONITOR DKA TREATMENT. SPECIFIC MEASUREMENT OF βHBA IN BLOOD CAN BE USED FOR DIAGNOSIS AND MONITORING OF DKA B (moderate).

B. Blood ketone measurements.

Blood ketone measurements that rely on the nitroprusside reaction should be used with caution for DKA diagnosis, because the results do not quantify βHBA, the predominant ketone in DKA. The test should not be used to monitor the course of therapy, because AcAc and acetone may increase as βHBA decreases during successful therapy (,–). Blood ketone measurements that measure βHBA specifically are useful for both the diagnosis and ongoing monitoring of DKA. Reference intervals for βHBA differ among assay methods, but concentrations in healthy individuals who have fasted overnight are generally < 0.5 mmol/L. Patients with well-documented DKA [serum CO₂ < 17 mmol/L, arterial pH < 7.3, plasma glucose > 14.9 mmol/L (250 mg/dL)] generally have βHBA concentrations > 2 mmol/L.

5. Emerging considerations

Further studies are needed to determine whether blood ketone measurements by patients with diabetes are preferable (e.g. better accepted by patients, more prompt diagnosis of DKA) to urine ketone measurements. Studies are necessary to evaluate whether the test offers any clinical advantage over more traditional management approaches (e.g. measurements of serum CO₂, anion gap, or pH).

2.1 Urine testing for ketones

Urine testing for ketones is a method that has been available for a long time; it is relatively inexpensive and painless, does not require the user to carry a meter and involves minimal technical skill to implement. However, many patients prefer to avoid doing urine tests. The colour‐coded, strip‐based test uses a nitroprusside reaction, which provides a semiquantitative measure of acetoacetate and with some brands acetone. The test represents an average of ketones excreted in the urine since the last void, which may delay recognition of impending DKA or its resolution. Importantly with treatment, the circulating pool of β‐hydroxybutyrate is oxidized to acetoacetate, which may cause urine ketone readings to rise, while blood β‐hydroxybutyrate concentrations are falling. The paradoxical increase in urinary acetoacetate gives the false impression that the condition is not improving. In addition, acetoacetate accounts for approximately only 20% of circulating ketone bodies, impacting the sensitivity of urine testing. False positive results can result from highly pigmented urine and interfering substances, including levodopa and drugs that are present in the blood and/or excreted in the urine as free‐sulphydryl compounds. Finally, it requires the person to recognize an increased risk of DKA to then initiate testing. This may be difficult because of oliguria from dehydration and acute renal failure or in the absence of a private environment where a urine sample may be obtained.

RESULTS

Participants

A total of 859 patients were screened, 616 provided informed consent, and 516 (83.7%) had all data elements necessary for data analysis (excluded patients: 49 with no urine dipstick, 30 with no serum pH via venous blood gas, and 21 with no serum chemistry panel). In our final sample, 54 of 516 subjects (10.5%) met the ADA criteria for DKA. See Table 1 for sample characteristics.

Table 1
Demographic and laboratory characteristics of the study sample

Diagnostic accuracy

At the manufacturer-suggested cutoff of > 1.5 mmol/L, the sensitivity of capillary β-OHB and the urine dipstick for DKA were identical at 98.1% (95% CI 90.1–100). However, the specificity of β-OHB was significantly higher than that of the urine dipstick (78.6 [74.5–82.2] vs. 35.1% [30.7–39.6]; P < 0.01). Positive and negative predictive values of capillary β-OHB were 34.9 (27.3–43) and 99.7% (98.5–100), respectively. Positive and negative predictive values of the urine dipstick were 15 (11.5–19.2) and 99.4% (96.6–100), respectively. Test characteristics of β-OHB were stable across a wide range of potential cutoffs (Table 1). The receiver-operator curve suggested that the optimal β-OHB cutoff is > 2 mmol/L, where sensitivity remains at 98.1% but specificity improves to 82.3%.

### Accidental ketosis-induced polyuria in a toddler: a case report [^116gd9TW]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

In addition to a thorough history and physical, the diagnosis of polyuria typically requires a 24 h urine void collection to confirm the presence of excessive urine output. Subsequent laboratory analysis including urine osmolality, urine electrolytes, renal function tests, blood gas, and serum and urine glucose measurement can help make a diagnosis. In our patient, the history of recent diet initiation, presence of ketonuria, and normal blood glucose was suggestive of a diagnosis for ketosis-induced osmotic diuresis and the patient was recommended to immediately discontinue the diet and increases carbohydrate intake rather than obtain a 24 h urine collection which is difficult to obtain in a non-potty trained toddler. The subsequent resolution of the patient's excessive urination with normal urinalysis further supports the diagnosis.

This case illustrates the inadvertent consequences that can occur when parents impose new fad diets on their young children. While ketogenic diets were once a mainstay treatment for epilepsy in pediatrics and are still used for refractory cases, they have since been replaced as an early treatment modality by the invention of various classes of antiepileptic drugs. The KD is recommended after the failure of two anticonvulsant medications in a pediatric patient with intractable epilepsy. However, care must be paid attention to associated complications such as nausea, lethargy, fatigue, food refusal, hypoglycemia and confusion. Furthermore, life-threating complications such as selenium deficiency cardiomyopathy, QT interval prolongation and protein-losing enteropathy should be monitored for. We present increased urination as an additional complication of the KD in a non-epileptic pediatric patient. The recent increase in the popularity of the KD for the purposes of weight loss makes the consideration of alternative diets important to review in the patient history and subsequently included in the differential diagnosis of changes in urinary volume and frequency in children.

### Carbidopa, levodopa, and entacapone (Stalevo) [^1154Udy3]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

5.14 Laboratory Tests

Abnormalities in laboratory tests may include elevations of liver function tests such as alkaline phosphatase, SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), lactic dehydrogenase, and bilirubin. Abnormalities in blood urea nitrogen and positive Coombs test have also been reported. Commonly, levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and uric acid are lower during administration of Stalevo than with levodopa.

Stalevo may cause a false-positive reaction for urinary ketone bodies when a test tape is used for determination of ketonuria. This reaction will not be altered by boiling the urine specimen. False-negative tests may result with the use of glucose-oxidase methods of testing for glucosuria.

Cases of falsely diagnosed pheochromocytoma in patients on carbidopa/levodopa therapy have been reported very rarely. Caution should be exercised when interpreting the plasma and urine levels of catecholamines and their metabolites in patients on carbidopa/levodopa therapy.

### Diagnostic accuracy of fingerstick β-hydroxybutyrate for ketonuria in pregnant women with nausea and vomiting [^116k4dB6]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to determine whether a rapid, fingerstick β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) test predicts ketonuria in pregnant women with nausea and vomiting.

Methods

A convenience sample of 82 pregnant women who presented to the Barnes-Jewish Hospital emergency department (ED) with complaints of nausea or vomiting were enrolled into an institutional review board-approved, prospective, observational study. Exclusion criteria were temperature of > 38.3°C, altered mental status, prisoners, and > 1 L of any intravenous (IV) fluid before screening. Subjects had fingerstick β-OHB tests, with results reported in increments of 0.1 mmol/L. Urine ketone results were made available once reported as part of standard care and varied from 0 (trace) to +4 values. Ketonuria was defined as a urine ketone value of 3+ or 4+ and was analyzed as a dichotomous, categorical variable. A contingency table and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve were constructed for comparing the β-OHB values to those urine ketone values for each patient.

Results

Mean (± SD) β-OHB was 0.43 (± 0.52) mmol/L, and median urine was 1+ for the cohort as a whole. The area under the ROC curve equaled 0.95. The sensitivity and specificity for a fingerstick test of > 0.45 mmol/L were 89 and 94.5%, respectively. The positive likelihood ratio (LR) was 16, and the negative LR was 0.12.

Conclusions

Fingerstick β-OHB is a rapid and reliable diagnostic tool that correlates well with ketonuria and identifies ketonemia in pregnant women with nausea and vomiting. Fingerstick β-OHB testing has the potential to increase triage efficiency, shorten length-of-stay times, and positively affect patient outcomes in an ED setting.

### Does a ketogenic diet have a place within diabetes clinical practice? Review of current evidence and controversies [^116CEE4q]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Challenges of the Universal Application of a Ketogenic Diet

A key barrier that healthcare professionals face with recommending, counselling about and 'prescribing' ketogenic diets for diabetes management is that there are considerable inconsistencies of its definition in the scientific literature, with no international consensus reached. There are many variants of diets that primarily focus on carbohydrate restriction; however, the precise amount of carbohydrates to define a diet as 'low' or 'very low' and the range of carbohydrates allowed differs substantially within studies, resulting in difficulty drawing conclusions within the literature.

The search for the correct definition of ketogenic diets' suitability for prescription is further complicated by the fact that the optimal distribution and intake of the other macronutrients (protein and fat) for individuals with diabetes also remains inconclusive. Therefore, the varying guidelines of permitted quantities of other macronutrients create further heterogeneity within studies making it challenging to interpret and compare findings. Consequently, the significant alteration of other macronutrients within a ketogenic diet (fat and protein) results in confounding variables which make distinguishing the accrediting factor of a ketogenic diet on glucoregulatory control challenging. Until there is consistency of a definition, the recommendation of a ketogenic diet for diabetes management cannot be endorsed for public health.

The most practical definition of a ketogenic diet should, in theory, be a dietary pattern that promotes nutritional ketosis, i.e. the formation of ketone bodies. A ketone concentration > 0.5 mmol/l or 0.5 Mm is typically defined as reaching nutritional ketosis; however, there is further conflicting evidence surrounding the optimal ketone concentration in nutritional ketosis for diabetes management. The only way to show a person has reached nutritional ketosis is through assessing it by a urine or blood sample. Therefore, individuals who follow the ketogenic diet may think they are achieving ketosis but may require further carbohydrate restriction. On the other hand, some individuals may not need to restrict < 50 g carbohydrates to achieve ketosis which will be discussed later. This is evidenced in a study whereby ketone analysis at 12 and 24 months revealed that individuals have difficulty sustaining nutritional ketosis with many rarely exceeding 0.5 mmol/l. As previously mentioned, it is important to note that excessively high protein intake in the absence of carbohydrates will lead to excess amino acids that can be converted to carbohydrates and fat which can lead to issues reaching clinical ketosis.

4 THE IDEAL KETONE MONITOR

To address the limitations associated with current approaches to ketone testing we propose the following: (i) an ideal ketone testing device would measure ketones over a relevant dynamic range (we suggest 0‐10 mmol/L) with automated alerts that would not require the user to initiate a measurement; (ii) measurements would need to be precise, particularly at the lower end of the measured range, so as not to result in a significant number of false alerts leading to alarm fatigue; (iii) the display should not be noticeable unless required; and (iv) the technology should be integrated with the user's usual glucose‐management system so that they are not required to carry an additional device. For example, ketone levels and trend information could be displayed on a smartphone or insulin pump screen. Ideally, discomfort, as well as psychological, financial and physical burdens imposed upon the user, should be minimized. At the same time, the device needs to be reliable and durable (Table 1). A further level of refinement, although not essential, could include instructions regarding the most appropriate response to the information provided. Urine, blood and breath ketone testing do not meet these criteria and therefore other approaches need to be explored.

### Prolonged glucosuria and relapse of diabetic ketoacidosis related to SGLT2-inhibitor therapy [^115sDkrf]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

A total of 273 unique patient records were identified and reviewed for inclusion. Reasons for exclusion included: no inpatient or emergency room admission for DKA (249 cases) and not on SGLT2i prior to admission (13 cases). The remaining 11 cases were analysed for this study.

Data for the 11 cases are summarized in Table 1. Patients with type 2 diabetes tended to be older and have more comorbidities than those with type 1. Among all patients, the average time to resolve DKA as defined by closure of the AG was 37.8 hours, ICU stay averaged 4.5 days, and total length of stay was 9.5 days. Our investigation reveals a subset of six patients who had prolonged ICU courses of four or more days, were on an IV insulin infusion for over 40 hours, had glucosuria for at least 3 days following admission, and in three cases, had relapse of DKA while admitted. Glucosuria persisted for up to 10 days after discontinuing the SGLT2i despite adequate glycemic control in most cases, suggesting that glucosuria is evidence of continued drug action. For one case (#5), urine glucose concentration was quantified during hospitalization (see Figure 1) and demonstrated significant elevation of urine glucose for several days after discontinuation of the drug despite normal plasma glucose levels. Of note, two cases (#7 and #8) had recently initiated a ketogenic diet.

Table 1
Clinical data for patients admitted with DKA in the setting of SGLT2 inhibitor use

Figure 1
Urine and plasma glucose concentration for patient 5

Our study suggests not only that the time to close the anion gap may be longer in patients with SGLT2i‐related DKA, but also that even once the gap has closed, inadequate insulin or carbohydrate delivery can result in recurrent ketosis and risk of DKA relapse due to the ongoing glucosuric effects of the medication. Treatment of DKA relies principally on volume resuscitation and adequate insulin and carbohydrates to suppress ketosis. In classical DKA in patients with type 1 diabetes, this is often accomplished relatively quickly; multiple prior studies have indicated that median time to resolution of classical DKA is approximately 11 hours and total hospital length of stay is 3 days, though patients with classical DKA tend to be younger and with fewer comorbidities compared with those on SGLT2i. 6, 7

### Prevalence of ketosis, ketonuria, and ketoacidosis during liberal glycemic control in critically ill patients with diabetes: an observational study [^111qHztN]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Harano et al. compared serum ketone levels between non-acutely ill type 1 (n = 117) and type 2 (n = 260) diabetic patients and 91 healthy subjects after an overnight fast. In patients with type 1 diabetes, ketone bodies were higher despite normal fasting BGL and increased proportionally to the BGL in hyperglycemic individuals. In type 2 diabetics, however, the authors found only a weak correlation between fasting plasma glucose and ketonemia with serum ketone levels rarely exceeding 2 mmol/l. Interestingly, a post-prandial reduction in 3-hydroxybutyrate was noted in subjects with a sufficient endogenous insulin response (on dietary control or sulphonylureas), but not in subjects with insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes, who are also known to have greater ketogenesis after nighttime fasting (12). Duska et al. explored the relative impact of exogenous insulin administration and endogenous insulin secretion on plasma insulin levels in critically ill trauma patients without diabetes. They found that, in such patients without beta-cell dysfunction, the plasma insulin level is mainly determined by the endogenous secretion rather than by the insulin infusion, even during the acute phase when exogenous insulin requirements were high.

Preserved beta-cell function with sufficient endogenous insulin secretion could also explain the relatively low blood ketone levels in our cohort and the similar ketone kinetics in hyperglycemic patients with and without exogenous insulin administration. Moreover, among the few patients with marked ketonemia (n = 7) the majority was insulin-dependent suggesting significant beta-cell failure. However, even in this subgroup ketonemia resolved despite permissive hyperglycemia.

The effect of fasting on urine ketone concentration has been studied in a large Korean trial of 16,523 volunteers. Only 8.8% of all subjects developed ketonuria after fasting overnight. Among those without ketonuria, the prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome was significantly higher and cholesterol levels, insulin levels and body mass index (BMI) were more likely to be abnormal. A ketotic response to fasting could, therefore, indicate a favorable metabolic state.

### Prevalence of ketosis, ketonuria, and ketoacidosis during liberal glycemic control in critically ill patients with diabetes: an observational study [^111TAF4e]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend using insulin to maintain a blood glucose level (BGL) between 6 and 10 mmol/l in critically ill patients. However, controlling glucose within this target range is associated with a relatively high rate of hypoglycemia and increased mortality in diabetic patients especially if adapted to chronic hyperglycemia (glycated hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] > 7%). Therefore, a more liberal glycemic approach (target BGL between 10 and 14 mmol/l) may be safer in patients with diabetes. Recent pilot studies have demonstrated that such "permissive hyperglycemia" effectively reduces the need for exogenous insulin administration. Consequently, in response to the introduction of a liberal glucose protocol in diabetic patients, the incidence of both absolute hypoglycemia (BGL < 3.9 mmol/l) and potentially harmful relative hypoglycemia (an acute and marked decrease in glycaemia) may be reduced.

However, whether such liberal strategies lead to relative insulin deficiency, accelerated ketone body production and induce ketoacidosis is uncertain. In addition to insulin deficiency, several other factors may stimulate ketogenesis via beta-oxidation of free fatty acids (FFA) in critically ill patients. Such factors include fasting (a ubiquitous state in patients admitted to the intensive care unit [ICU]), increased secretion of counter-regulatory hormones (glucagon, adrenaline, growth hormone and cortisol), administration of exogenous catecholamines (adrenaline and noradrenaline) and administration of parenteral nutrition containing medium-chain triglycerides. Furthermore, entry of acetyl coenzyme A into the Krebs cycle may be impaired during critical illness due to reduced oxaloacetate levels. Consequently, more acetyl coenzyme will be used for synthesis of ketone bodies. Similarly, elevated levels of deaminated amino acids may feed ketogenesis. Moreover, although the mechanism is less clear, alkalosis appears to stimulate ketogenesis, particularly in diabetic subjects. Finally, elevated blood ketone levels have been observed following cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, especially when performed under hypothermia. Although, many of these factors may co-exist in the ICU setting, their combined impact on ketone body production is unknown.

Accordingly, we conducted a prospective observational study to explore the incidence of ketosis, ketonuria and ketoacidosis during liberal glucose management of critically ill diabetic patients. In addition, we aimed to assess the association of chronic glycaemia (HbA1c), acute glycaemia, illness severity, alkalosis, catecholamine infusion and cardiopulmonary bypass surgery with blood ketone levels on ICU admission in such patients.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^114e7ULJ]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

URINARY GLUCOSE

RECOMMENDATION: SEMIQUANTITATIVE URINE GLUCOSE TESTING IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR ROUTINE CARE OF PATIENTS WITH DIABETES MELLITUSB (low).

1. Use

Semiquantitative urine glucose testing, once the hallmark of diabetes care in the home setting, has now been replaced by SMBG (see above). Semiquantitative urine glucose monitoring should be considered only for patients who are unable or refuse to perform SMBG, because the urine glucose concentration does not accurately reflect the plasma glucose concentration. Notwithstanding these limitations, urine glucose monitoring is supported by the IDF in those situations in which blood glucose monitoring is not accessible or affordable, particularly in resource-poor settings.

2. Rationale

Although urine glucose is detectable in patients with grossly increased blood glucose concentrations, it provides no information about blood glucose concentrations below the variable renal glucose threshold [approximately 10 mmol/L (180 mg/dL)]. This fact alone limits its usefulness for monitoring diabetes under modern care recommendations. Semiquantitative urine glucose tests also cannot distinguish between euglycemia and hypoglycemia. Furthermore, the extent to which the kidney concentrates the urine will affect urine glucose concentrations, and only mean glucose values between voidings are reflected. These facts further minimize the value of urine glucose measurements.

3. Analytical considerations

Semiquantitative test-strip methods that use reactions specific for glucose are recommended. Commercially available strips use the glucose oxidase reaction. Test methods that detect reducing substances are not recommended because they are subject to numerous interferences, including numerous drugs and nonglucose sugars. When used, single voided urine samples are recommended.

4. Interpretation

Because of the limited use of urine glucose measurements, semiquantitative specific reaction–based test-strip methods are adequate.

KETONE TESTING

1. Use

RECOMMENDATION: KETONES MEASURED IN URINE OR BLOOD IN THE HOME SETTING BY PATIENTS WITH DIABETES AND IN THE CLINIC/HOSPITAL SETTING SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ONLY AN ADJUNCT TO THE DIAGNOSIS OF DKA GPP.

The ketone bodies acetoacetate (AcAc), acetone, and β-hydroxybutyric acid (βHBA) are catabolic products of free fatty acids. Measurements of ketones in urine and blood are widely used in the management of patients with diabetes as adjuncts for both diagnosis and ongoing monitoring of DKA. Measurements of ketone bodies are routinely performed, both in an office/hospital setting and by patients at home. The ADA recommends that ketosis-prone patients with diabetes check urine or blood ketones in situations characterized by deterioration in glycemic control in order to detect and preempt the development of DKA.

### Sequence variants associating with urinary biomarkers [^115GYSnF]. Human Molecular Genetics (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The urine, a final product of nephron function which consists of glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption and secretion of water and solutes, provides valuable information about numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes. Urine dipstick tests are routinely used as a diagnostic tool in medical practice, facilitating early detection of diseases, such as urinary tract infections (UTI), and renal and metabolic disorders. Urine dipstick measurements are semiquantitative traits; positive urine dipstick results are expressed as intervals (e.g. pH and specific gravity) or graded according to severity on a scale from 1 to 4 plus (written as + to ++++; e.g. proteinuria and hematuria), and require medical interpretation. Apart from various diseases, environmental factors, such as exercise and food supplements, are known to affect urine dipstick results. However, it is an open question as to how genetic variation influences urine dipstick test results, both in a disease dependent and independent context.

Here we describe a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of urine dipstick measurements, testing for associations of variants in the sequence of the genome with glucosuria, ketonuria, proteinuria, hematuria, urine pH, signs of UTI (i.e. nitrites and leukocyte esterase) and urine specific gravity in a set of 150 274 Icelanders. In addition, we assess the variants detected for association with a broad set of diseases and other biological traits. By doing so, we attempt to shed light on whether the variants that affect urine dipstick test results are associated with specific diseases, or if they simply affect urinary traits separate from everything else.

### Prolonged glucosuria and relapse of diabetic ketoacidosis related to SGLT2-inhibitor therapy [^113htq7h]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

This study is the first detailed analysis of the inpatient course of all SGLT2i‐related DKA cases within a single centre and including an evaluation of glucosuria. Prior investigations have focused primarily on defining the risk of developing DKA with SGLT2i use in large populations, indicating an increased risk in some 8 but not all 9, 10 analyses. Two more recent studies designed to identify risk factors for developing SGLT2i‐associated DKA also reported hospital stay characteristics, 3, 11 though the focus was on precipitating events which lead to DKA rather than inpatient course, and duration of glucosuria was not reported. Case reports have suggested that despite half‐lives of 10‐19 hours (depending on the agent), the glucosuric effects of SGLT2i can persist up to 9 days. 12 In our cohort of 11 patients, six had elevated urinary glucose concentrations for 3‐10 days despite cessation of the medication upon admission, and three of those had DKA relapse during their admission.

Our study suggests that patients with type 2 diabetes hospitalized with SGLT2i‐related DKA are likely older and have more comorbidities than those with type 1 diabetes, and required a longer period of time on IV insulin and in the hospital. Age and comorbidities certainly may have played a role in their clinical course, and given new SGLT2i indications for prevention of adverse cardiovascular events and progression of renal failure, increasing numbers of chronically ill patients may be started on this therapy. In cases of DKA, particularly when clinical circumstances may require prolonged fasting or oral intake is not adequate due to concomitant medical conditions or treatments, sequential urine glucose measurements may be particularly helpful to assess whether continuous intravenous insulin and dextrose should be extended. In situations where IV insulin is not readily available, frequent scheduled dosing of subcutaneous rapid‐acting insulin every 2‐4 hours with monitoring of blood glucose may be a reasonable alternative.

### Accidental ketosis-induced polyuria in a toddler: a case report [^115x4jMq]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

The connection between low carbohydrate diets and reductions in body water composition has been previously documented. Under physiological conditions, ketones are not present to an appreciable degree in urine in either the post prandial or overnight fasting state. Yet, once a ketogenic diet is begun, the presence of urinary ketones may be detectable within 2 days after initiation of the diet. Furthermore, in some individuals undergoing a very-low carbohydrate diet, the amount of urinary ketones measured during the first 3 days of a fast, was found to be proportional to the amount of natriuresis. Other studies have similarly shown that decreases in total body, intracellular, and extracellular water were correlated with greatest levels of ketosis during ketogenic diets. Therefore, it is likely that initiation of a ketogenic diet results in an osmotic polyuria driven by elevations in serum and urinary ketones. Furthermore, it is likely that the increased natriuresis is sufficient to change body water composition, although the clinical significance and mechanism by which this occurs is not fully known. At the time of this publication, it is also not fully known if, or the extent to which, different ketogenic diets may induce polyuria in pediatric versus adult populations. Increased metabolic demands in pediatric populations and significant variation in the different types of low carbohydrate diets likely confound this factor and further work on this topic is required.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^112VjVXT]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in chronic kidney disease — recommendations and practice points include: We recommend treating patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), CKD, and an eGFR ≥ 20 ml/min per 1.73 m² with an SGLT2i (1A). Once an SGLT2i is initiated, it is reasonable to continue an SGLT2i even if the eGFR falls below 20 ml/min per 1.73 m², unless it is not tolerated or KRT is initiated. It is reasonable to withhold SGLT2i during times of prolonged fasting, surgery, or critical medical illness (when people may be at greater risk for ketosis). We recommend treating adults with CKD with an SGLT2i for the following (1A): eGFR ≥ 20 ml/min per 1.73 m² with urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) ≥ 200 mg/g (≥ 20 mg/mmol), or heart failure, irrespective of level of albuminuria. SGLT2i initiation or use does not necessitate alteration of frequency of CKD monitoring and the reversible decrease in eGFR on initiation is generally not an indication to discontinue therapy. We suggest treating adults with eGFR 20 to 45 ml/min per 1.73 m² with urine ACR < 200 mg/g (< 20 mg/mmol) with an SGLT2i (2B).

### Recurrent hypoglycemia in a toddler [^112BavKA]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Idiopathic ketotic hypoglycemia is the most common cause of hypoglycemia in toddlers. This diagnosis should be considered in any hypoglycemic toddler with no prior history of abnormal growth who is developmentally normal when toxic ingestions and sepsis are inconsistent with the clinical picture. Diagnosis is important in preventing serious long-term sequelae and is made in the setting of hypoglycemia, ketonuria, and ketonemia. Therefore, checking urine and blood ketones is an essential part of the evaluation in any hypoglycemic toddler. We report the case of a 3-year-old girl with recurrent hypoglycemia secondary to idiopathic ketotic hypoglycemia.

### Blood ketone bodies in patients with recent-onset type 1 diabetes (a multicenter study) [^115KAcdp]. Pediatric Diabetes (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Insulin deficiency with glucagon excess leads to the release of ketone bodies (KBs) by the liver and excretion in the urine. So far, only KB monitoring in urine has been used during assessment of children with diabetes. Currently used nitroprusside strips for urine KB detection react only with acetoacetate (AcAc) and not with the most prevalent KB moiety - 3beta-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) - that is in equilibrium with AcAc (up to 10:1 ratio).

Aim

To verify the significance of 3HB in the blood compared to that of AcAc in the urine in recently diagnosed type 1 diabetic subjects independent of the presence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Methods

A total of 118 consecutive newly diagnosed subjects with type 1 diabetes from different centers in Italy underwent intensive insulin therapy and hydration when necessary (38/118 = 32% with DKA). Hourly urine and capillary blood samples were used to monitor KBs until metabolic control was achieved.

Results

Although DKA was present in 32% of patients, blood 3HB was significantly increased (3.56 ± 1.7 mmol/L) in 83% of the patients and correlated with blood glucose (r = 0.39; p < 0.01) according to a bimodal model. The strongest association was found between 3HB and venous pH (r = -0.56; p < 0.0001). Time required for blood 3HB normalization depended strongly on the starting blood KB values (r = 0.44; p < 0.0001) and was significantly lower than that required for disappearance of KB from urine (17.4 ± 13.6 h, range 1–69 h vs. 19.7 ± 17.8 h, range 1–120 h; p = 0.004). However, urine KBs disappeared before blood 3HB normalization in 23% of the patients.

Conclusions

Blood 3HB evaluation is a better indicator of metabolic control compared to urine KB detection and is useful to predict the time required for blood KB clearing. Further studies are needed to assess its use in the early detection and management of DKA.

### Clinical profile of diabetic ketoacidosis: a prospective study in a tertiary care hospital [^1174Euhp]. Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research (2015). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on diabetic ketoacidosis:

- **Definition**: DKA is an acute metabolic complication occurring mostly in patients with T1DM, characterized by a triad of hyperglycemia, ketosis, and acidemia.
- **Pathophysiology**: DKA is caused by absolute or relative insulin deficiency and increased levels of counterregulatory hormones, typically ocurring at the time of new diagnosis of untreated T1DM or due to inadequate insulin therapy, infection (such as pneumonia, UTI, sepsis), concomitant medications (corticosteroids, SGLT-2 inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, sympathomimetics, certain antipsychotics), illicit drug use, surgery, trauma, physiologic stress, or pregnancy.
- **Epidemiology**: The age-adjusted hospitalization rate for DKA in the US was estimated at 6.3% annually in 2014, with an in-hospital case fatality of 0.4%. The rate of hopsitalization for DKA per 10,000 admissions was reported as 53.4 in 2014 and 61.6 in 2017.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include inconsistent caloric intake, poor medication adherence, poor glucose control, alcohol use, and dehydration.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weakness, polydipsia, polyuria, dehydration, weight loss, polyphagia, fruity odor of breath, dyspnea, tachypnea, Kussmaul breathing, hypotension, tachycardia, and altered mental status. Laboratory findings in DKA include hyperglycemia, anion gap metabolic acidosis, and ketonemia/ketonuria.

a pH > 7.45

Overall, 38 (63%) patients showed some degree of ketosis (β-OHB ≥ 0.6 mmol/l) during ICU admission (20 [33%] mild, 11 [18%] moderate and seven [12%] severe ketosis). A total of 20 (33%) patients had some degree of ketonuria (13 [22%] mild, six [10%] moderate and one [2%] severe ketonuria). Additionally, 25 (42%) patients had at least one episode of alkalosis (pH > 7.45). On crude comparison, we observed a similar prevalence and severity of ketosis and ketonuria in patients with peak BGL above and below 10 mmol/l. In contrast, patients with a peak BGL ≥ 10 mmol/l had lower bicarbonate levels (P = 0.001) and base excess (P = 0.006).

However, only two out of 60 (3.3%) patients (one patient in each group) fulfilled the criteria for ketoacidosis according to the JBDS consensus criteria (no patients developed ADA-defined ketoacidosis, Table 2). A description of these two individuals is provided in the Additional file 1.

Patients with (n = 38) and without (n = 22) ketosis had similar HbA1c levels (median HbA1c 6.7% in both groups, P = 0.72) whereas admission hematocrit levels were higher in patients with ketosis (P = 0.046). A similar proportion of patients had insulin-dependent diabetes in the two groups (42 vs. 50%). Moreover, admission and peak BGLs did not differ significantly (Additional file 1: Table S1 and S2).

### Frequency of morning ketosis after overnight insulin suspension using an automated nocturnal predictive low glucose suspend system [^114aDuhq]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

As part of an in-home randomized trial assessing an automated nocturnal predictive low glucose suspend system, blood and urine ketone levels were measured each morning, irrespective of the blood glucose level, in individuals with type 1 diabetes who were between 15 and 45 years of age. This provided a large data set with standardized data collection for assessing the frequency of morning blood and urine ketone levels and their relationship to the blood glucose level. The measurements from the control mornings provide a relatively unique opportunity to determine the frequency of elevated ketone levels according to the blood glucose level, which can be useful for informing patients as well as for serving as a benchmark for studies involving automated suspension of insulin delivery. Overall, the frequency of elevated ketone levels was similar after intervention and control nights. Even after ≥ 2 h of overnight suspension of insulin delivery, the presence of blood ketone levels ≥ 0.6 mmol/L, or moderate or large urine ketone levels was very uncommon (∼1%) and was no higher than it was after intervention nights with no pump suspension or control nights. Moderate elevation of the morning fasting blood glucose level (200–300 mg/dL) increased the likelihood that ketones would be present only slightly and, thus, was not a good predictor of the presence of ketones. There were too few mornings (7 of 977 mornings [0.7%]) with a fasting glucose level > 300 mg/dL and a prolonged pump suspension to assess with reasonable precision the association of these factors with elevated ketone levels.

Our results are consistent with a number of prior studies in which insulin delivery was experimentally suspended for varying lengths of time to assess the effect on blood glucose and ketone levels (Table 2). In these mostly inpatient studies, ketonemia and/or ketonuria occurred if insulin delivery was suspended for a long enough period of time, but ketosis declined rapidly once insulin delivery was restored. Our results also are consistent with those of studies conducted using the low glucose suspend feature of the Paradigm Veo pump, which have demonstrated that a 2-h suspension of insulin delivery when a hypoglycemic threshold is reached is safe and does not increase the risk of ketoacidosis. Our study differs from the prior reports in having almost 2,000 at-home blood and urine ketone measurements obtained in a standardized manner irrespective of the blood glucose level, and provides valuable data with respect to the expected frequency of blood and urine ketone levels with and without pump suspension.

### Ketoacidosis at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children and adolescents: frequency and clinical characteristics [^111vymiq]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a potentially life-threatening acute complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Although the frequency of DKA as first manifestation of T1DM is higher in developing compared developed countries, there is paucity of information on its characteristics in developing countries.

Methods

This retrospective study determined the frequency of ketoacidosis at diagnosis of new-onset type 1 diabetes and described the clinical characteristics of the patients seen between 1996 and 2011 by auditing the hospital records of all cases. The diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) was based on the presence of hyperglycaemia (blood glucose > 11 mmol/L), acidosis (serum bicarbonate < 15 mmol/L) and ketonuria (urine ketone ≥ 1+).

Results

At diagnosis of new-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus, three-quarter (77.1%) of the children and adolescents presented with DKA. Comparing the frequency of DKA during the initial 8 years (1996–2003) with the later 8 years (2004–2011), it was 81.8% vs 73.1%; p > 005. The frequency has not shown any significant declined over a 16-year period. The frequency of re-admission in ketoacidosis was 24.3%.

Conclusion

Three-quarter of children and adolescents present with DKA as first manifestation of T1DM with no significant decline in frequency over a 16-year period in our hospital.

A. Urine ketones

1. Preanalytical.

The concentrations of ketones in the urine of healthy individuals are below the detection limits of commercially available testing materials. False-positive results have been reported with highly colored urine and in the presence of several sulfhydryl-containing drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Urine test reagents deteriorate with exposure to air, giving false-negative readings; therefore, testing material should be stored in tightly sealed containers and discarded after the expiration date on the manufacturer's label. False-negative readings have also been reported with highly acidic urine samples, such as after large intakes of ascorbic acid. Loss of ketones from urine attributable to microbial action can also cause false-negative readings. Because acetone is a highly volatile substance, samples should be kept in a closed container. For point-of-care analyses in medical facilities and for patients in the home setting, control materials (that give both negative and positive readings) are not commercially available but would be desirable to ensure accuracy of test results.

2. Analytical.

Several assay principles have been described. Most commonly used is the colorimetric reaction that occurs between AcAc and nitroprusside (sodium nitroferricyanide) to produce a purple color. This method is widely available in the form of dipsticks and tablets and is used to measure ketones in both the urine and blood (either serum or plasma). Several manufacturers offer dipsticks for measuring glucose and ketones. A combination dipstick is necessary only if the patient monitors urine glucose instead of or in addition to blood glucose. The nitroprusside method measures only AcAc unless the reagent contains glycine, in which case acetone is also measured. The nitroprusside-containing reagent is much more sensitive to AcAc than acetone with respect to color generation. Importantly, this reagent cannot be used to measure βHBA.
