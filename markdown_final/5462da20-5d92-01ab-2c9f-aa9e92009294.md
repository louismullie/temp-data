## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which statement best summarizes evolution as it is viewed today, with options A through D provided. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the modern definition of evolution by natural selection. Then, I should verify what each option claims and whether it aligns with that definition. Next, I will check for common misconceptions embedded in the distractors. Finally, I will select the best answer and briefly justify it with references.

> Let me first confirm the modern definition so I don't jump to conclusions. Evolution by natural selection is the change in heritable traits within populations over generations due to differential survival and reproduction of individuals with advantageous phenotypes; this requires heritable variation, differential fitness, and transmission of that variation to offspring, and it is not goal-directed or Lamarckian in mechanism [^6122dd00] [^f102eac0].

> Now, Option A claims evolution is goal-directed; wait, let me verify whether contemporary evolutionary biology supports teleology. Modern evolutionary theory explicitly rejects goal-direction; evolution has no predetermined endpoint or intent, and adaptation emerges from selection acting on heritable variation rather than striving toward a target, so this option is incorrect [^f102eac0].

> Option B says evolution represents selection for acquired characteristics; hold on, I should verify whether this reflects Lamarckian inheritance. This is a classic misconception: acquired traits are not heritable in the way required for natural selection, and modern synthesis replaced this idea with selection on heritable genetic variation, so this option is wrong [^notfound].

> Option C asserts evolution is synonymous with gene flow; hmm, wait a minute, I need to check the relationship. Gene flow is a mechanism that can change allele frequencies and thus contribute to evolution, but it is not synonymous with evolution itself, which also includes mutation, selection, and drift; so this overstates gene flow's role and is too narrow a definition [^notfound].

> Option D states evolution is the differential survival and reproduction of the most-fit phenotypes; let me consider whether this captures the essence. This aligns with the modern definition: heritable variation leads to differences in fitness, and those with higher fitness contribute more offspring, changing trait frequencies over generations; this is precisely how evolution by natural selection is described today [^6122dd00] [^f102eac0].

> Putting this together, I should double-check that none of the other options sneak in partial truths that might confuse the choice. Options A and B reflect outdated or incorrect views, and Option C conflates a mechanism with the process itself, whereas Option D matches the contemporary, mechanism-based definition of evolution by natural selection, making it the best summary among the choices provided [^6122dd00] [^f102eac0].

---

The best answer is **D. It is the differential survival and reproduction of the most-fit phenotypes**. This is the modern synthesis view: evolution is the change in heritable traits within populations due to **differential reproductive success** of individuals with advantageous phenotypes, not a goal-directed process or selection for acquired traits [^6122dd00] [^f102eac0]. Gene flow is a mechanism of evolution, not its definition, and evolution is not synonymous with gene flow [^b878b356].

---

## Analysis of answer choices

### A. It is goal-directed

This is incorrect because modern evolution is **not goal-directed**; it has no predetermined endpoint or purpose [^f102eac0]. Evolution is a **blind process** driven by environmental selection, not by intent or foresight [^b8a8fc1a].

---

### B. It represents the result of selection for acquired characteristics

This is incorrect because it reflects **Lamarckian inheritance**, which modern genetics refutes. Acquired traits are not heritable; evolution acts on **heritable genetic variation**, not on traits acquired during an individual's lifetime [^notfound].

---

### C. It is synonymous with the process of gene flow

This is incorrect because gene flow is only one mechanism of evolution, not its definition. Evolution also includes mutation, selection, and drift; gene flow can change allele frequencies but is **not synonymous with evolution** itself [^b878b356].

---

### D. It is the differential survival and reproduction of the most-fit phenotypes

This is correct because it aligns with the **modern synthesis**: evolution is the change in heritable traits due to **differential reproductive success** of individuals with advantageous phenotypes. This is the core mechanism of natural selection [^6122dd00] [^f102eac0].

---

## Conclusion

The best summary of evolution today is **D. It is the differential survival and reproduction of the most-fit phenotypes**, reflecting the modern synthesis view of natural selection acting on heritable variation [^6122dd00].

Evaluating fitness outcomes of immunological trade-offs

Combining both trade-offs, a bimodal survival landscape emerges. To maximize survival, strategies with high sensitivity are paired with a low magnitude immune response (e.g. one involving few effector cells; Fig. 1c, top right) and vice versa (Fig. 1c, bottom left). Where sensitivity is high, the mortality hazards associated with infection are experienced rarely, so the survival benefits of a reduced magnitude immune response associated with reduced immunopathology (reflected by points towards the right of the trade-off on Fig. 1b) outweigh the costs of reduced response to infection (and thus high mortality hazard associated with infection, x axis, Fig. 1b). Conversely, survival is maximized for strategies with low sensitivity paired with a high magnitude immune response: under this configuration, frequent infections associated with failure to detect "non-self" are best combatted with a large magnitude immune response. Increasing pathogen incidence expands the scope where high sensitivity is optimal (Supplementary Figure 2) but the bimodal landscape remains. The shape of the two trade-offs (the first, linking sensitivity and specificity, and the second, reflecting positive and negative effects of immune effector responses) will also influence these outcomes. The former is to some degree constrained (illustrated and discussed in Supplementary Figure 1), and while the exponential framing used for the latter simplifies derivation of the optimal magnitude of the immune effector response (above), the bimodal survival landscape emerges for a range of shapes of the relationship linking μ i and μ d (see Supplementary Data 1 (code) for an example with a linear relationship). Additionally, the remainder of results presented do not depend on the exact shape of the relationship (beyond it being negative). Finally, we note that trade-offs surrounding immune sensitivity and response magnitude are likely to shape whether a host resists and/or tolerates pathogensbut that the two survival peaks described above do not simply map onto resistance versus tolerance.

Methods

Defining survival in the context of a discrimination trade-off

Individuals can be either infected, or not, and either detect (or suspect) this occurrence, or not; each outcome is associated with a particular risk of mortality, see Table 2. The probability of detection is predicated on a trade-off between sensitivity, s e and specificity, s p, where sensitivity is defined as a function of specificity according to:such that γ determines the discriminatory power associated with that particular trade-off, see Fig. 1. From this, we can define the probability of survival for individuals of age x till the next time-step as the sum of the different mortality hazards:where i x is the probability of being infected for an individual of age x, μ b is the baseline hazard of mortality, μ i is the mortality hazard associated with immunopathology occurring in a context of a false positive (1 − s p), μ d is the mortality hazard associated with undetected infection, reflecting a false negative, and μ id reflects the damage from immune response occurring in the context of true positives, see also Table 2. From this expression, we can extract the value of specificity that yields the maximum survival for individuals of age x, by identifying the value of specificity for which the derivative of the expression above, d x /d s p, is equal to zero (verifying also that this is a maximum and not a minimum). The derivative relative to s p is defined by

Table 2
Possible mortality hazard scenarios for an individual of age x

Mortality hazards occur according to the probability of being infected at age x, i x, combined with the probabilities defined by the discrimination trade-off (sensitivity / specificity or s e / s p) outcome. The parameter μ i captures the mortality hazard associated with exuberant immune reactions in the absence of infection (false positives), the parameter μ id captures the same but in the presence of infection, and μ d captures the mortality hazard associated with undetected infections (false negatives)

From this, the optimal specificity is:

Further, introducinginto the expression for the second derivatives of survival at the optimal, yields a negative value, confirming that this value reflects a maximum. It is straightforward to relate to this quantity to optimal sensitivity, results for which are discussed in the Results section entitled "Evaluating fitness outcomes of immunological trade-offs" (analytical results are framed in terms of specificity for consistency with previous work).

Fig. 1
Trade-offs underpinning differences in immune function. a Detection and discrimination: Selective pressure on pathogens to mimic host molecules to evade detection will result in overlap between the distribution of host (black histogram) and pathogen (gray histogram) molecules, which the immune system must discriminate. Host immunity then faces a trade-off between reducing false positives (triggering a response in the absence of pathogens) and reducing false negatives (failing to detect pathogens), as delineated by a classic Receiver Operator Curve (ROC) from epidemiology obtained by plotting sensitivity (proportion of true positives detected) against 1-specificity (proportion of true negatives detected). b Magnitude of immune response: a high magnitude response risks considerable damage associated with immunopathology, and thus an associated hazard of mortality (μ i, y axis), but may more effectively control the pathogen, thus reducing the hazard of mortality associated with infection (μ d, x axis), note that a variety of trade-off shapes are possible. c Optimizing survival: Combining these two trade-offs yields a bimodal landscape of survival, with high survival (lightest shades of red) corresponding to either low pathogen detection (low sensitivity, s e, y axis) and low risk of pathogen associated mortality (μ d, x axis) corresponding to high levels of immune response and thus μ i (bottom left corner); or high pathogen detection (high sensitivity, y axis) and high risk of pathogen associated mortality (μ d, x axis) resulting from a relatively small magnitude immune response (top right corner).

Defining immunological trade-offs

We start by developing a mathematical framing of our two focal immunological trade-offs, that of discrimination, and that of scale of response. For the first, overlap between characteristics of pathogen and host molecules means that host receptors (such as B-cell receptors or Toll-Like Receptors) run the risk of triggering inappropriate immune reactions, by responding to "self". Core principles from epidemiology capture the trade-off inherent in this discrimination problem — increasing "true" positives via increased sensitivity will come at the cost of increasing "false positives", and vice versa (Fig. 1a), where the shape of the relationship is dictated by the degree of overlap between the distributions of self and non-self (see Supplementary Figure 1). Second, moving from immune detection to immune response, greater deployment of immune effectors should drive more effective pathogen control, but potentially at the cost of greater damage to the host –, indicating a trade-off between the mortality hazard associated with infection, and the mortality hazard associated with immunopathology (Fig. 1b). These two trade-offs can be combined into an expression for host survival that allows us to precisely characterize what defines the level of sensitivity that maximizes survival within an age class (see "Defining survival probability in the context of a discrimination trade-off" in the Methods). At every age, individuals experience a background hazard of mortality μ b (assumed constant over age, for simplicity), which may be increased by the mortality hazard associated with failing to detect an infection μ d (the result of a "false negative" associated with low sensitivity, s e, see Fig. 1a), or associated with immunopathology μ i (the result of a "false positive" associated with high sensitivity, s e). High sensitivity, s e, is favored where the probability of infection i x at age x, is high, and where the hazard associated with immunopathology, μ i, is low relative to the hazard associated with infection, μ d. Conversely, low sensitivity is favored if infection probability is low and the hazard associated with immunopathology is high. Similarly, we can characterize what shapes the optimal magnitude of the immune effector response that is induced following pathogen detection (see "Extension to reflect a trade-off around the magnitude of the immune response" in Methods). The optimal magnitude of immune response can increase or decrease with probability of infection, i x and sensitivity, s e depending on the relative magnitude of other parameters (see Methods, eqn [8]), but an increase in the relative impact of immunopathology under conditions of infection (captured by the parameter ρ) consistently reduces the optimal level of immune related damage, μ i, and therefore the optimal magnitude of effector response.

The impact of sex-specific reproductive risks and schedules

In the sex making a greater reproductive investment, their mortality, infection risk, or mortality associated with infection might all be increased relative to identically-aged individuals of the other sex. Such changes will shift both the stable population structure and reproductive value of individuals across ages, altering the impact of underlying parameters such as immune sensitivity on the population growth rate, a proxy for fitness (see section "Defining the demographic context" in Methods). Addressing this requires moving beyond identifying the strategy that optimizes, s x, survival within an age class (the focus so far) to identifying the strategy that maximizes fitness for each of the sexes, i.e. requiring a full demographic model. We assume that neither sex is limiting, and therefore evaluate outcomes for the two sexes separately (see Methods). Taking as a starting point constant background mortality over age, and constant fertility from the age of maturity, we can characterize the consequences of a reduction in survival during reproductive years (achieved by increasing the background hazard of mortality μ b during those years), potentially reflecting costs associated with parental investment (Fig. 3a) and delineate the resulting changes in fitness associated with a change in survival (Fig. 3b–d).

Fig. 3
Tracking the impact of changing sensitivity from survival to fitness a Survival: across age (x axis) scenarios include constant survival (y axis, black), reduced survival associated with increased infection during reproductive years (blue, starting at the age of maturity indicated by the gray vertical line), reduced survival associated with infection during reproductive years, although probability of infection remains constant (green, as before), and overall reduced survival (e.g. associated with risks of birth, or other investments for in reproduction), again with constant probability of infection (red, as before); b Stable population structure: changes in the age profile of survival directly alter the stable population structure (colors as before); high mortality during reproductive years reduces the fraction of later aged individuals (all lines are predominantly below the black line for ages above the age of maturity) and if sufficiently large, can increase the fraction of younger aged individuals across some ages (red line is above the other lines). c Reproductive value: reducing survival reduces the reproductive value of individuals, colors as before with two additional scenarios added for comparison: increased fertility with age (orange), and reduced fertility for higher levels of sensitivity (purple). d Effect of changes of survival on fitness as measured by the populations rate of increase, λ, is the product of the stable population structure (b) and reproductive value (c); largest impacts are found for increasing survival at young ages for the scenario with the lowest overall survival. The overall optimal strategy for sensitivity (e) does not change with baseline mortality (colors as above, see Methods) as long as infection is constant over age (but see Fig. 4), increases with infection during reproductive years (f), or mortality associated with infection during reproductive years (g, h) is reduced by a reduction of fertility by sensitivity (e.g. if miscarriage is a risk during pregnancy) and unaffected by a change of fertility with age (but see Fig. 4)

Evolutionary ground rules

Three prerequisites are necessary and sufficient for evolution by natural selection to occur:
Individual variations exist in the population
These variations are heritable
Variations in individuals lead to differential survival and reproduction

Evolution by natural selection is the causal consequence because individuals with favourable characteristics are positively selected based on their reproductive advantage, whereas less well-adapted individuals are eliminated from the population through negative selection. On the basis of these principles, the main determinant of the ability of a population to evolve is the extent of heritable variation within the population.

### A meta-analysis of birth-origin effects on reproduction in diverse captive environments [^2e36be2b]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Understanding possible causes of differences in reproductive success in the first generation of captive breeding is useful for the successful establishment of breeding programs. We suggest comparing changes within the first generation of captive breeding to long-term changes over multiple generations in order to disentangle possible causative factors, such as environmental effects versus long-term genetic change. For example, one possible explanation of increased fitness of wild-born animals, relative to F1 captive-born animals, is that animals caught in the wild have survived early and ongoing natural selection pressures, and are therefore 'fit'. Relaxed selective pressures in captivity mean that even F1 animals that would be 'unfit' in the wild may survive to reproductive age. If these unfit animals are also unproductive, the captive-bred population would exhibit a reduction in reproductive success in the first generation, relative to wild-born animals. In an aquaculture setting this is not necessarily a cause for concern — artificial selection can act to increase population productivity where there is variation in heritable reproductive success over generations of captive breeding. This is most simply demonstrated by the breeder's equation: R = h²S, where R is the response to selection, h² is the narrow-sense heritability and S is the selection differential. However, as traits linked with broad evolutionary fitness (such as reproductive success) tend to have low heritability, selection cannot be relied upon to improve them. Furthermore, processes such as antagonistic pleiotropy can complicate the response to selection on life-history traits in captivity. In the establishment phase of an agricultural program, the potential benefits of long-term selection and domestication must be weighed against short-term productivity losses. In a conservation setting, unintentional selection may be disastrous. For example, offspring survival in utero that differs from Mendelian expectations provides an opportunity for early viability selection that is difficult to prevent and may impact on the effectiveness of pedigree management. Instead, efforts to address variation among breeders during the first generation of captive breeding, such as improved nutrition, should be prioritized.

### A multidimensional selective landscape drives adaptive divergence between and within closely related phlox species [^a55c1643]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

As taxa become reproductively isolated, they tend to evolve suites of diverged traits that lead to higher fitness (survival or reproduction) in local or native habitats compared to habitats of closely related taxa. Adaptive divergence often leads to a similar pattern of reciprocal local vs. foreign advantage between closely related species as the pattern that we see between locally adapted populations within a single species. Even when closely related species are in broad sympatry with extensive geographic overlap, we may expect a pattern of adaptive divergence. Interspecific competition for resources can select for ecological divergence and niche partitioning driving either species-wide patterns of differentiation or leading to patterns of character displacement in sympatry. Therefore, we expect many of the traits that differentiate species from each other to be the suites of traits that lead to differential fitness and thus ecological reproductive isolation between the species. In this way, adaptive divergence not only causes phenotypic differentiation between taxa but also contributes to the cessation of gene flow between taxa, leading to speciation. For this reason, ecological adaptation is considered important during the speciation process. In fact, environmental divergence and ecological divergence are often added to, and portrayed as parallel to, the speciation continuum from no reproductive isolation to complete reproductive isolation.

The idea of a continuum of adaptive ecological divergence — from producing and maintaining diversity within species to causing reproductive isolation between species — invites us to consider how patterns of adaptation within and between species may or may not be related. Under one notion of this continuum, the adaptive divergence that we see between species is an extreme case of the local adaptation we see within species across populations and therefore could be due to the similar axis of selection and involve similar types of trait divergence (Fig. 1, top & bottom right). Alternatively, the types of selection driving divergence between species could be distinct from the selection pressures favoring local adaptation within a species (Fig. 1, top & bottom left). Under this latter scenario, the trait divergence that differentiates species is different from the variation that we see within a species. Importantly, ecological divergence and speciation unfold over evolutionary time, and the snapshot of divergences we see now between populations and species does not directly tell us about how the process of speciation did or will proceed in this system. Nonetheless, comparing patterns of phenotypic divergence and axes of selection across phylogenetic scales can help us understand how phenotypic diversity is generated and maintained under different scales of geographic range and genetic exchange.

### Natural variation in fecundity is correlated with species-wide levels of divergence in caenorhabditis elegans [^bdef06d7]. G3 (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Life history traits are phenotypic characters that affect the fitness of organisms. Traits, such as fecundity, size at birth, age at reproductive maturity, and stage- or size-specific rates of survival, interact with each other to affect the fitness of organisms in an ever-changing environment. Genes that affect life history traits should be subject to strong natural selection because they directly affect the fitness of organisms. Adaptive alleles with strong selective advantages in life history-related genes are likely to spread rapidly across a population in a selective sweep. Signatures of selective sweeps include a loss of neutral polymorphism, drastic changes in the site frequency spectrum, and particular patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) across the site of selection. Identification of selective sweeps by these signatures provides a key to locate genes under selection and helps to understand the process of adaptation and evolution.

### Evolved tumor suppression: why are we so good at not getting cancer? [^5bcfbfb4]. Cancer Research (2011). Low credibility.

The law of natural selection can be used to understand cancer development at the level of species as well as at the level of cells and tissues. Through this perspective, I seek to explain: (i) Why the lack of sufficient selective pressure to prevent cancers in old age helps explain the exponential increase in cancer incidence in the elderly. (ii) Why the evolution of long-lived animals necessitated the acquisition of potent tumor suppressive mechanisms. (iii) How the requirement to prevent inappropriate somatic cell expansion and cancer has constrained developmental and tissue architectural modalities. (iv) How the evolution of well-adapted stem cells with complex niche requirements has conferred resistance to oncogenic mutations, as phenotype-altering genetic change is almost always disadvantageous within a well-adapted cell population. (v) How the impairment of stem cell fitness, as occurs in old age, can promote selection for adaptive mutations and cancer initiation. (vi) Why differential maintenance of stem cell fitness may explain how different vertebrate species with enormous differences in life span and body size similarly avoid cancer through reproductive years.

### Survival of the simplest in microbial evolution [^23abaa82]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

Here we have developed the evolutionary genetics of multiple biophysical traits in non-recombining populations. Our approach combines quantitative trait theory with fitness wave theory. We find a specific evolutionary mode of phenotypic interference, which is characterized by a feedback between global and local selection. The system-wide genetic variation of the traits generates fitness variance, which, in turn, determines the scale of selection at local genomic sites encoding the traits. This feedback generates highly universal features, which do not depend on system details. These include the complexity of the evolutionary process and the scaling of coalescence rate and genetic load with the gene number, as given by Eqs. 5–9. A similar destructive feedback generating a superlinear cost has been identified in crosstalk of gene regulation. Importantly, phenotypic interference also generates universal local selection. By Eq. 3, the average selective amplitude of trait-changing mutations decouples from the total fitness effect of the trait. That is, the spectrum of site selection coefficients is not a fixed input, but a dynamical output of the evolutionary process. This selection filter is the main difference of our approach to previous population-genetic models of asexual evolution –. We argue it is a relevant step towards biological realism.

### Exploiting evolutionary steering to induce collateral drug sensitivity in cancer [^98c544f6]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Different drugs may select for distinct phenotypes (e.g. y and z are differentially selected by drugs 2 and 3 — Fig. 1e). Using drugs with divergent fitness landscapes is the central idea of evolutionary steering. This concept is illustrated in Fig. 1f. Tumourigenesis gives rise to a heterogeneous population of cancer cells that is the substrate for Darwinian selection to operate. When drug 1 is applied (Fig. 1g), only populations that are around the new fitness peaks survive, while drug-sensitive cells in fitness valleys go extinct. If then we expose the population to drug 2, which has an overlapping fitness peak, we select for a doubly resistant phenotype z, against which both drug 1 and 2 are ineffective. At this point we would have lost control of the tumour. Instead, if we first apply drug 3 (Fig. 1h) this leads to selection for phenotype y. Because drug 2 shows differential fitness peaks with respect to drug 3, the sequence drug 3–drug 2 leads to an evolutionary trap in which the cancer cell population goes extinct. This is the principle of evolutionary steering that can be exploited to delay and potentially control drug resistance, thus significantly extending patient survival.

### Predicting the direction of phenotypic difference [^3d01708e]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Methods

Formal model for prediction accuracy

We consider a pair of individuals, one phenotyped and the other unphenotyped, with genomes that diverge at n loci that affect a certain phenotype. We denote the (absolute value of the) differential effect of these loci as eᵢ, (i = 1,…, n) which is the relative contribution of locus i to the difference between the phenotypes of the two individuals (Fig. 1 a). Each effect of a locus where the individuals differ in their genotype either increases the phenotypic difference in the direction of the phenotyped individual, arbitrarily denoted as dᵢ = 1, or in the direction of the unphenotyped individual, denoted as dᵢ = − 1. The sum of the known effects is(Fig. 1 b). The sign of Δ is our prediction for the direction of the phenotypic difference (Fig. 1 c).

We consider additional m unknown effects on the phenotype, and denote them as random variables X₁…Xₘ. For the most part of this work (but see simulations with selection below), we assume that X₁,…, Xₘ are independent random variables that attain one of two values, Eⱼ or, − Eⱼ, with equal probability, i.e. for j = 1,…, m. We assume that the Eⱼ's are identical independent random variables with an effect-size distribution Y, which means that X₁…Xₘ are also identical and independent. Each unknown effect has some contribution to the phenotype, and it can work to either increase or decrease the phenotypic difference. We denote the sum of the unknown effects as. Following the definitions in Eq. (1), we denote the variance of Ω as σ².

The true phenotypic difference is D = Δ + Ω, the sum of both known and unknown effects. Our prediction is correct if the signs of Δ and D are the same; otherwise, our prediction is incorrect. We define the 'prediction accuracy' P as the probability that the signs of Δ and D are the same.

### Differential regulation of antagonistic pleiotropy in synthetic and natural populations suggests its role in adaptation [^335fa440]. G3 (2015). Low credibility.

The Ras/PKA pathway regulates multiple phenotypes across taxa, including reproduction, development, longevity and metabolism. Activation of the Ras pathway results in active growth, and consequently, it is down-regulated when proliferation is not preferred or required, such as when cells are under stress or are differentiated. However, although the Ras pathway antagonistically regulates cellular growth and robustness, it provides scope for compensation of defects associated with these phenotypes. We show that some natural yeast isolates employ the Ras pathway during adaptation to achieve higher stress resistance without the associated growth defect. In humans, ~20% of all tumors have Ras mutations. Although overproliferation would make a (malignant) cell vulnerable to stresses resulting in programmed cell death and eventual tumor regression, mutations in this pathway (EGFR pathway) can bypass this by developing survival adaptation. Similarly, although mutations in various signaling pathways (Ras, TOR, and their downstream transcription factors) increase longevity at the cost of reduced growth, yeast lackingand worms with daf-2 mutation overcome this growth defect. This consistent ability to balance various antagonistic phenotypes could explain the "conserved yet polymorphic" nature of such a central pathway, not just in yeast but also across taxa. This ability to fine-tune various fitness traits, most likely through different epistatic interactions, may be the result of the high connectivity of this pathway. Similar effects also are seen on other pathways that are hubs in the cellular machinery, such as the p53 pathway. Indeed, as organisms became complex, the requirement to balance multiple antagonistic phenotypes might be the reason that gene and protein networks developed regulatory hubs controlling basic cellular pathways, such as cell cycle, apoptosis, autophagy and anoikis. One may also speculate that partially resolved AP in such key pathways may be the reason for rapid speciation following an extinction event, as organisms scramble to adapt to novel niches and environmental conditions which open up as recombinants suddenly find themselves adapted to the new situation.

### Schedule and magnitude of reproductive investment under immune trade-offs explains sex differences in immunity [^1c7faf60]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

A higher burden of infection or mortality associated with infection while reproducing provides a straightforward way of weighting the optimal life history towards sensitivity in the sex making the greater investment (Fig. 3e–h). More subtly, changes in baseline patterns of mortality or fertility over age can modulate the optimal sensitivity, as long as there is variability in the risk of infection over age. Although baseline mortality, μ b, does not enter into the expression of the optimal sensitivity within an age class (see Methods, eqn [4]), and thus has no effect if infection risk is constant (Fig. 3e), where the risk of infection varies over age, changes in the stable age distribution emerging from changes in the baseline mortality over age will shift the contribution of different age classes to fitness (Supplementary Figure 3), ultimately altering the optimal level of sensitivity. An early age of infection favors higher sensitivity (Supplementary Figure 4), echoing basic theory on the evolution of senescence — improvements in survival earlier in life are generally favored over later ones — and this increase in sensitivity is amplified if there is higher mortality during reproductive years, since the penalty associated with years of high sensitivity and thus "false positives" is reduced as a result of reductions in life expectancy (Supplementary Figure 4). The pattern of fertility over age modulates this outcome: a higher reproductive value of later age individuals makes false positives during years unaffected by infection costly again, and thus tips the balance away from sensitivity.

The impact of pregnancy and antibody transfer

In mammals, the physiology of pregnancy poses a particular challenge in the context of the evolution of female immunity. Greater discrimination between self and non-self might allow more nuanced tolerance of (self-similar) offspring, but the scope of contexts where an increase in discrimination favors increased sensitivity (mapping onto observations for mammalian females) is limited (Fig. 2). Sensitive immune responses might also lead to miscarriage where fetuses are detected as "non-self", also tending to drive selection for lower sensitivity in females (Fig. 3h). However, the time-scale of pregnancy being short relative to the life-span in many organisms, this might rather drive the evolution of plasticity in immune response, tilted towards reduced sensitivity during pregnancy, rather than a lifelong reduction, in line with what is observed.

### Natural selection 150 years on… [^f102eac0]. Nature (2009). Excellent credibility.

### The selection force weakens with age because ageing evolves and not vice versa [^f0c0dda9]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

However, age-specificity remains an important component of the most advanced developments of the mutation-accumulation hypothesis of ageing. The newest models of this hypothesis have overcome previous linearity assumptions in dealing with epistatic interactions among mutations. These models are sufficiently powerful to allow computation of, among other things, the equilibrium distribution, when it exists, of mortality over age in a genetically and, therefore, demographically heterogeneous population under mutation-selection balance. Some equilibrium results of these models can explain features of observed mortality, i.e. its deceleration at very late ages, that are not within the reach of the classic theory. They also yield predictions, i.e. extremal mortality before the last reproductive age, that even contradict this theory. Despite sharing both an assumption of age-specificity and a dynamical perspective, a direct comparison of our work with these models appears arduous because of other, diverging assumptions in the overall approach. The architecture of advanced models of mutation-accumulation is very general. They are genetically detailed in the haploid case. They can in principle accommodate both beneficial mutations and detrimental ones as well as effects that may be pleiotropic to some degree, i.e. of different sign at different ages, or not only additive. But analysis of these models appears to be mostly focused on the case of detrimental, age-specific mutations with additive effects on mortality. The aim is to compute the load of such mutations that a population can tolerate. Our model, instead, is not genetically explicit and tracks life history evolution at the phenotypic level. Selection only acts on beneficial variation with a typically non-additive effect on fecundity and mortality. Moreover, our analysis in this work is mostly qualitative. The focus is on the ultimate age pattern of fecundity and survival and their selection gradients, i.e. whether they increase, decline, or stay constant with age. We are not interested in the exact shape of these trajectories at equilibrium, although some of these may be computed with our methods (Supplementary Methods).

### When is offspring viability fitness a measure of paternal fitness and when is it not? [^87ef201b]. The Journal of Heredity (2022). Medium credibility.

Mutation-Selection Balance: Expected Genetic Diversity With Opposing Levels of Selection

Here we deviate briefly from our focus on paternal care to demonstrate that separating direct and indirect effects can also strengthen predictions about the expected patterns of gene sequence diversity. Indeed, population genetic models are commonly used for this purpose (e.g.;). However, even though it is common to posit transgenerational effects of a gene with opposing indirect and direct effects on fitness (like those in our model), the influence of such an effect on sequence diversity at mutation-selection balance has not been investigated.

At mutation-selection balance in an infinite population with weak selection, we find the equilibrium value of p, p*, by setting the total change in allele frequency, the sum of the changes by selection and by mutation, equal to zero. We assume that net selection favors the 'c' allele so that it is near fixation, where q is near 1 and p is near 0. Weak selection means that W is also essentially equal to 1. Mutation introduces deleterious alleles by altering 'c' to other states, which we lump into the frequency, p. Together, selection and mutation with the assumptions above give us the following approximation,

Setting Equation 5 equal to 0, we find that p✱ = u/(s_D + [s_I/2]). Clearly, the relative values of s D and s I affect the expected value of p* and thus gene diversity at equilibrium. When both s D and s I > 0, p* is smaller than if they are of opposite sign. When of opposite sign (but still net positive), net selection is weakened by the opposing selective forces, so that p* is higher and gene diversity is increased. This is a general feature of fitness trade-offs: it can weaken total selection acting on a gene when it leads to opposing types or levels of selection.

### Echoes of early life: recent insights from mathematical modeling [^ac19d122]. Child Development (2018). Low credibility.

Modeling Development

All traits of organisms (phenotypes) result from development, that is, are the product of a process that begins with the zygote and proceeds during the subsequent lifetime. Hence, natural selection can only modify phenotypes by shaping developmental systems, that is, the array of factors (e.g. genes) and processes (e.g. gene regulation) that give rise to phenotypes (Bjorklund, Ellis, & Rosenberg, 2007; Dall, McNamara, & Leimar, 2015; Frankenhuis et al. 2013; Mangel & Ludwig, 1992; McNamara, Dall, Hammerstein, & Leimar, 2016). Natural selection favors systems that tend to construct adaptive phenotypes, which increase fitness. The term fitness is often used to denote individual survival and reproduction. However, fitness should actually be assigned to developmental systems (or strategies, genotypes), not to individuals, and the appropriate measure of fitness depends on the environmental context and species. The distinction between developmental systems and individuals is crucial because, as we will see, optimal systems often produce detrimental outcomes for some individuals (Frankenhuis & Del Giudice, 2012).

Individuals change over time, depending on influences internal (e.g. glucose levels) and external to the body envelope (e.g. resources in the environment). Models describe such changes using state variables, which quantify the current state of the individual and predict its future state, if only probabilistically. State variables can represent any factor of interest. For example, a model of growth might describe the composition of the body using variables representing skeletal size, bone density, muscle mass, fat levels, the types of tissues present and their degree of differentiation, patterns of gene methylation, brain wiring, hormone levels, receptor densities, and so on. Each variable takes on a specific value, which might change over time. Age is typically not a state but rather a crude aggregate measure, because individuals of the same age might be in different developmental and physiological states.

### The selection force weakens with age because ageing evolves and not vice versa [^98839e7a]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The evolution of the variance-covariance structure among traits, i.e. the G matrix for a finite number of traits, is a major research topic that has proven hard to deal with analytically. For our purposes, assuming such structure to be constant with no covariances and small variances for each trait is needed for analytical tractability. This is also an assumption of the classic theory. Including a nontrivial, time-dependent covariance structure in our model may thus modify our findings — but such an approach would likely come with substantial analytical challenges.

However, our results are still indirectly suggestive of what the role may be of the trade-offs that determine those trait covariances — and which we have excluded from our model. Looking across the tree of life, trajectories of fecundity and survival over adulthood are very diverse from one species to another. Ageing is only one of the many patterns that these trajectories can follow. It has been arguedthat the inability of the classic theoryto explain these observations could be due to two of its assumptions: (i) age-specific genetic effects that necessarily lead to declining selection with age and (ii) absence of trade-offs between fecundity and survival across different ages. Reasoning within this scheme, our work shows that, once trade-offs are kept out of the picture and any sort of age-specific genetic effect is allowed, ageing remains the one and only stable outcome of evolution. We are then left with the dilemma of whether the observed lack of ageing in certain branches of the tree of life should be regarded as a merely transient phenomenon, as our stylized model would suggest, or whether trade-offs can stabilize the lack of ageing. We favour this second option for two main reasons. First, dependencies among fitness components have been shown pervasive in life history evolution –. Second, the application of optimization principles has already demonstrated how these can account for a vast array of different life histories. In theoretical models, the specific functional form of trade-offs was already shown to determine whether ageing or something other than ageing is an evolutionarily stable strategy –. However, optimization models are not dynamic in that they do not describe how an ancestral population evolves over time. It would be interesting to apply a dynamical perspective to models that structure the life history into stages (e.g. size classes, phases of development). In stage-structured models, trade-offs between ages are deeply ingrained, as a stage may lump together fecundity or survival over separate ages and could be under genetic control. These models, once equipped with dynamics, may give us a new perspective on the evolution of the trajectories of fecundity and survival over age.

### Schedule and magnitude of reproductive investment under immune trade-offs explains sex differences in immunity [^af279437]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Defining the demographic context

Using the expression for survival at age x, s x that is the result of the summed competing hazards at that age, we identified the strategy that maximized survival at age x in terms of both specificity, and the magnitude of the immune response. However, the optimal strategy will reflect the optimal across the life-span and not within a single age class. Changes in the baseline mortality hazard or probability of infection across age, combined with the pattern of fertility over age will modulate the overall optimal strategy. Such patterns are likely to differ between the sexes, and therefore play a role in shaping the evolution of different immunological processes between the sexes.

To address this, we frame the full demographic process using a Leslie matrix, denoted M. We assume that survival from age x to x + 1, reflecting the x th column and x +1 th row in the matrix, is defined by s x (such that the proportion of individuals surviving to age A will be s 1 s 2 s 3… × s A −1); and the first row of the matrix is completed to reflect a chosen fertility schedule, f x. The dominant eigenvalue of this Leslie matrix, λ, captures the population rate of increase and can be used as a proxy for fitness. This framing provides a straightforward expression of the impact of changes in underlying parameters on the population rate of increase (confusingly called "sensitivity"):

whereis the reproductive value of individuals of age x and w x −1 is the fraction of individuals in the x -1 th age class, i.e. is the x -1 th value of the stable age distribution. For this expression, the scalar product of the vector of reproductive values (v, the left eigenvector corresponding to the dominant eigenvalue of M) and the vector reflecting the stable size distribution (w, the right eigenvector corresponding to the dominant eigenvalue of M) is scaled such that.

By the chain rule, we can obtain the dependence to underlying parameters, such as specificity, s p:

We can thus modulate the patterns of i x, μ b x, and f x and evaluate the outcome for the population rate of increase. For comparison between the sexes, this is equivalent to making the assumption that the mate of the opposite sex is never limiting (i.e. we are not formally modeling a "marriage function").

### Genetic epidemiology and schizophrenia: a study of reproductive fitness [^66bf8be8]. Schizophrenia Research (2001). Low credibility.

Genetic epidemiological studies have demonstrated markedly reduced rates in reproduction among schizophrenic patients. According to evolutionary theory, behavioral and psychological phenotypes are selected based on ecological "fit". Where differential survival or reproductive success exists, genotype frequencies are altered in subsequent generations. In the case of schizophrenia, lower rates of reproduction constitute a negative selection factor that should reduce genes in the population associated with the expression of the disease — ultimately leading to decreases in prevalence. However, studies reveal a stable prevalence of about 1% over time. Attempts to explain the apparent contradiction between negative selection and stable prevalence have taken several forms. One explanation suggests that reproductive rates in relatives of schizophrenic patients are increased — compensating for reproductive loss in affected family members. Family data from schizophrenic patients at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center were compared with those of healthy volunteers and volunteers with schizophrenia spectrum personality (SSP) disorders. Controlling for important socio-cultural and demographic variables, a multiple regression model revealed a significant increase in the number of siblings associated with schizophrenia. No differences in reproductive fitness were found among normal and SSP volunteers. This observed pattern in reproductive fitness provides one mechanism by which prevalence rates can remain stable despite lower reproductive rates among individuals with schizophrenia. Evidence of increased reproductive fitness in relatives suggests the need to consider the complex interactions of proximate and ultimate (evolutionary) mechanisms in the expression of schizophrenia.

### Sex differences: a resultant of an evolutionary pressure? [^bb8789c4]. Cell Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Spurred by current research policy, we are witnessing a significant growth in the number of studies that observe and describe sexual diversities in human physiology and sex prevalence in a large number of pathologies. Yet we are far from the comprehension of the mechanisms underpinning these differences, which are the result of a long evolutionary history. This Essay is meant to underline female reproductive function as a driver for the positive selection of the specific physiological features that explain male and female differential susceptibility to diseases and metabolic disturbances, in particular. A clear understanding of the causes underlying sexual dimorphisms in the physio-pathology is crucial for precision medicine.

### Heritability and genomic basis of age-at-maturity in chinook salmon [^4de97765]. The Journal of Heredity (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1.
Fork length versus ocean age (years) from scales for natural and hatchery-origin Chinook Salmon sampled (N = 5,558) at Bonneville Dam from 2014 to 2019 (data from). a) Coastal; b) Interior stream-type; c) Interior ocean-type, summer run; d) Interior ocean-type, fall-run. Pearson correlations between fork length and ocean age are provided for each panel for females (orange)/males (green).

The difference in age-at-maturity variation between males and females is understood to reflect distinct sexual fitness landscapes: although both males and females likely experience a fitness tradeoff between accruing mortality risk versus returning at a smaller size, differences in body size at spawning have different fitness implications for males and females. Female Chinook Salmon are nearly assured of mating opportunities but compete among themselves for spawning sites, and thus they maximize fitness through body size and fecundity. Similarly, older "hooknose" male Chinook Salmon increase reproductive success by excluding other males to monopolize access to females, for which a larger body size is generally advantageous. Jack males, on the other hand, often mate by passing as females or immatures and "sneaking" into redds during spawning of the female and dominant male, and may exhibit higher quality, more competitive sperm than "hooknose" males. As the risk of mortality accumulates rapidly with each subsequent year of life, which leads to lower overall survival to spawning grounds for relatively older aged fish (e.g.), the success of these alternative male strategies may be governed by the product of balancing selection (e.g. negative frequency dependent) on reproductive phenotypes and the probability of annual survival. As a consequence, the somatic growth dynamics that favor fitness in males may sometimes conflict with those that are optimal for females. Notably, salmon hatcheries, which typically optimize feed and rearing conditions to maximize growth and survival, often produce the less desirable jack phenotypes at rates higher than natural-spawning populations. Moreover, due to a combination of anthropogenic forces, age-at-maturity has been in a steady decline in Chinook Salmon across their range, prompting major interest in understanding the proximal factors that govern age-at-maturity variation.

### Towards an engineering theory of evolution [^398b6ded]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Engineered biosystems have phenotypic traits that influence reproductive fitness and traits that influence 'function' — the behaviour or properties specified by the designer (although these are not mutually exclusive). The structure of the mapping from genotype space to function space is therefore a key part of the evotype. Function space may be discrete or it may be continuous (Fig. 1c). In complex systems, such as biochemical networks, even continuous variation of parameters during evolution can result in the production of identical functions or cause phase changes where qualitatively different functions arise. Designed functions could be literal mathematical functions, physical characteristics such as colour or size, or combinations of several properties.

Any designed system has a degree of 'utility' — the extent to which the system fulfils the specified function. The sole goal of a traditional engineering design process is to maximise the utility of the design type. However, the topology of the function landscape surrounding the design type is also important. It may be rugged and highly variable with the function rapidly changing across sequence space or it may be smooth and have large neutral regions where function changes little or remains constant. Whether the goal is to evolve novel functions or to tune the parameters of an existing one, these properties are a key design consideration: what is the functional range to be covered by the design type's evotype? Should the variation be large for increased evolvability, or limited, for evolutionary stability? Most likely, the function landscape should be smooth and predictable, but how is this best achieved? Which regions of function space must be avoided, and which can be tolerated? For example, it may be necessary to reduce irrelevant or harmful functions as much as possible in a diagnostic application where regions of function space cause false negatives, whereas regions causing false positives can be tolerated.

### Schedule and magnitude of reproductive investment under immune trade-offs explains sex differences in immunity [^e5839c7a]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Can these trade-offs drive sex differences in immune function?

Although the existence of alternative optima (Fig. 1c) aligns with the observation of divergent immune strategies between the sexes, it provides no explanation as to why one sex (females in many vertebrate species) should evolve towards the high sensitivity optimum. Demographic variability across the life-span will ultimately modulate how changes in immune function within an age class translate into changes in fitness. This might shape differences between the sexes, tipping the balance in favor of one or the other optimal strategies that emerge at the within-age scale (Fig. 1c). A classic difference between the sexes is that greater variability in male reproductive success means that males can obtain greater fitness returns for investment towards securing mating opportunities than females, leading to sexual selection for display or competition in males, potentially at the expense of immune function. In birds and mammals, for example, testosterone has been suggested as a mediator of allocation of resources between immune function and features relating to male–male competition, as an explanation for its broadly immunosuppressive effects. Males which reduce investment in the magnitude of the immune response (e.g. reducing, thus shifting from the top left to bottom right on Fig. 1b; see Table 1 for term definitions, and note that the shape of the relationship linking the various hazards does not enter into this expression) or in discrimination (e.g. reducing γ, the parameter governing the shape of the relationship between sensitivity and specificity, and thus increasing the perceived overlap between the distribution of self and non-self, Fig. 2, lower panel, Supplementary Figure 1), might experience a fertility advantage. Females would experience no such advantage, since whatever the resources invested, the number of offspring that females can produce within a time horizon has an upper bound. However, reducing allocation towards R always results in selection for increased sensitivity all else being equal (see Methods, eqn [4]), a prediction at odds with the observation of higher sensitivity in females. The effect of a reduction in discrimination depends on the context: reduced discrimination selects for increased sensitivity in contexts with prevalent and damaging infection (Fig. 2, top left, the expected direction), but selects for higher specificity in contexts where infection is rare and immunopathology is damaging (Fig. 2, bottom right). While translating the range of values of R and i x to reality is not straightforward, the unexpected outcome (selection for greater specificity) characterizes a large part of reasonable parameter space (Fig. 2). Overall, these two patterns (increased sensitivity with reduced R, and increased sensitivity across a broad scope of reduced discrimination) both suggest that allocation trade-offs between immune function and fertility alone are unlikely to drive the emergence of observed sex differences in birds and mammals (i.e.g.enerally more sensitive females). We therefore turn to the impact of broader sex differences in the schedule and magnitude of reproductive investment.

### Phenotypic memory in Bacillus subtilis links dormancy entry and exit by a spore quantity-quality tradeoff [^97caf924]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Theoretical models have predicted that survival strategies employing cellular memory could be beneficial –. In the E. coli lac operon, phenotypic memory results in a reduced lag time when a stimulus is repeated. In B. subtilis, the transition from sessile to motile cells is controlled by memory, which might give cells sufficient time to explore the alternative lifestyle. It is not yet known whether other types of memory, e.g. the history-dependent sporulation dynamics of B. subtilis or the population-based "memory" in the Caulobacter crescentus salt-stress response, serve an adaptive purpose. Our data does not point to a direct benefit of spore memory. While the Ald-based memory resulted in differential spore outgrowth, it did not affect germination probability. Thus, late spores will irreversibly lose their protective properties upon germination, yet their impaired outgrowth prevents them from taking full advantage of the available nutrients. Moreover, we were able to overcome this outgrowth "defect" by inducing Ald prior to sporulation, which boosted the overall revival success of the population. We therefore favor the idea that phenotypic spore memory arises as a byproduct of evolution, and might be maintained by selective pressures, e.g. costs of gene expression, not addressed by our experiments.

The fact that sporulation timing controls both the spore yield and the spore revival frequency argues strongly that the production of spores is subject to a quantity vs. quality tradeoff. Quantity vs. quality tradeoffs have been proposed as a fundamental principle that shapes the production of reproductive units in response to resource limitations. Examples include plant seeds and fish eggs. Although, in bacteria, this tradeoff appears to be the result of phenotypic memory rather than constraints imposed by physicochemical factors during prolonged starvation, the consequences for evolution may be similar. In general, both the quantity and the quality of progeny determine the reproductive success of an organism. By analogy, for bacteria that survive fluctuating environments by cycling between a vegetative and a spore state, the success of spore revival is an important factor in determining their fitness. Under conditions where revival is limited by spore quality, rapid sporulation is favorable, whereas slower sporulation is beneficial when the yield determines revival success. Thus, irrespective of its evolutionary origin, an intrinsic spore memory could have an important evolutionary function by driving adaptations through quantity vs. quality tradeoffs.

### Fundamental concepts in genetics: genetics and the understanding of selection [^785509f7]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2009). Medium credibility.

At first sight selection is a simple notion, and some consider it the most important evolutionary force. But how important is selection, is it really so trivial to understand and what are the alternatives? Here I discuss how genetics is crucial for addressing all of these questions: genetics allowed the concept of natural selection to become viable, it contributed to our understanding of the complexities of selection and it spurred the development of competing models of evolution. Understanding how and why selection acts has important potential applications, from understanding the mechanisms of disease and microbial resistance, to improving the design of transgenes and drugs.

### Bet hedging in a unicellular microalga [^d9cd05e0]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Compared to adaptive tracking and phenotypic plasticity, bet hedging is an alternative strategy for adapting to randomly fluctuating environments. For a genetically clonal population, it might be advantageous to hedge the bet of population fitness on differentiating into different phenotypes. The presumed advantage of different phenotypes with different survival chances and reproductive success is that they are best suited to different conditions. Consequently, a subpopulation will already exhibit the appropriate phenotype for the new environment before the external environment changes, ensuring that at least a subpopulation can survive and reproduce successfully. Currently, bet hedging is widely reported to be a common adaptive strategy in various organisms. However, to our knowledge, it has never been reported and experimentally verified in microalgae, key players in aquatic ecosystems.

Interestingly, it has been repeatedly reported that the green stage of H. pluvialis consists of two phenotypically distinct types at the population level: mobile and non-mobile. Such phenotypic heterogeneity has been described for a number of other systems, and is thought to result mainly from adaptation to microscale environmental variation.

In the case of H. pluvialis, it has been suggested that non-mobile cells arise from mobile cells due to external stress. This may indeed be the case in older cultures due to increased stress related to high cell density, specifically reduced availability and increased competition for nutrients, self-shading, and the release and accumulation of unfavourable substances from dead cells. Under these circumstances, it is reasonable to expect cells to switch from growth-dedicated activities to stress-resistant metabolisms (the non-mobile phenotype). In our study, we observed an increasing proportion of non-mobile cells over time (Fig. 1b, c), and in particular an acceleration of the transformation from mobile to non-mobile cells from day 8 onwards, becoming very apparent from day 14 onwards (Fig. 1c). At this relatively late stage of growth, we agree that external stress occurred and led to the observed shift in the population, which was then soon dominated by the stress-resistant non-mobile state.

### The evolution of convex trade-offs enables the transition towards multicellularity [^93cd8e65]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

One of the central steps in the evolution towards multicellularity is the differentiation of somatic and germ cells whereby the cells of the body (soma cells; cell group) must play an ecological role (e.g. predation avoidance, motility that increases access to resources) while simultaneously initiating the next generation of bodies (germ-like cells; single cell). The differentiation into germ and soma cells can be favored due to an inherent fitness trade-off between survival and fecundity. Theoretical work analyzing this trade-off showed that the survival-fecundity trade-off could lead to the separation of soma and germ cells when the costs of increasing cell group sizes become larger than the benefits of being in cell groups or aggregates. Here, we tested experimentally the evolution of growth in cell groups by evolving populations of the unicellular C. reinhardtii in different environments, characterizing their phenotypes and finding mutations that are likely involved in the observed phenotypes. Specifically, we checked for the curvature of the trade-off between survival in the presence and absence of a predator and reproduction of the algal cells, as the curvature is predicted to determine the likelihood that cell groups can evolve further to specialize into soma and germ line cells. We found that isolates of algal clones that were selected under rotifer predation were more likely to grow as cell groups and displayed a decrease in growth rate and increase in the defense level against consumption by the predator, i.e. survival. We found a convex trade-off curve between reproduction and survival as predicted. The majority of cell groups we observed were growing as groups and they had increased survival in the presence of a predator. We found a smaller percentage of isolates that grew as a mix of groups and single cells, but it is unclear whether these represent different life stages of a cell group or parts of cell groups as observed in other studies. As we focus in our study on the curvature of the trade-off curve, our experimental environments were not designed for testing for ecological scaffolding and separating fitness benefits of the soma (cell group) and germ cell-like cells (single cells) –. Whether these mixed isolates would provide a fitness benefit in environments where selection for germ and soma are temporally and/or spatially separated or whether the fitness of the group is larger than the average fitness of the germ and soma cells, needs further investigations. The observed lower growth rate for a given survival rate of non-motile cells compared to motile cells and selection in static cultures in our experiments suggest that motility could be beneficial for accessing nutrients in the planktonic phase and/or access to light.

### Diversifying evolution of competitiveness [^24b639f1]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

In many species, individuals express phenotypic characteristics that enhance their competitiveness, that is, the ability to acquire resources in competition with others. Moreover, the degree of competitiveness varies considerably across individuals and in time. By means of an evolutionary model, we provide an explanation for this finding. We make the assumption that investment into competitiveness enhances the probability to acquire a high-quality resource, but at the same time reduces the ability of exploiting acquired resources with maximal efficiency. The model reveals that under a broad range of conditions competitiveness either converges to a polymorphic state, where individuals differing in competitive ability stably coexist, or is subject to perpetual transitions between periods of high and low competitiveness. The dynamics becomes even more complex if females can evolve preferences for (or against) competitive males. In extreme cases, such preferences can even drive the population to extinction.

### Predicting the first steps of evolution in randomly assembled communities [^f886843c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Finally, we asked how the accumulation of mutations shifts the landscape of beneficial mutations from the initial "assembled" state in Figs. 2 and 3. We found that the distribution of fitness effects does not dramatically differ between the start and the end of the simulation, although its shape changes slightly from a Gaussian distribution toward a two-tailed exponential (Fig. 5 d). In contrast, the impacts of successful mutations exhibit larger changes: the proportion of mutation events which result in mutant-parent coexistence increases substantially with evolutionary time, rising from about 20% to 80% over the course of the simulation (Fig. 5 e). This shift cannot be explained by changes in the overall number of species or the availability of beneficial mutations, but instead deviates entirely from the replica-theoretic predictions that describe our initial state. Thus, while many of our qualitative conclusions continue to hold on longer evolutionary timescales, the accumulation of mutations can lead to quantitative differences from our first-step analysis above. In both cases, the evolved communities exhibit distinct genetic signatures compared to their purely assembled counterparts, which could motivate future tests of in situ evolution.

### Intron-mediated induction of phenotypic heterogeneity [^0aed364c]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Differential fitness during starvation

Introns have a key role in preparing the yeast population for starvation. Therefore, we hypothesized that the two subpopulations, defined by distinct levels of Rps22B expression, have differential fitness under starvation stress. To test this idea, we subjected an exponentially growing culture of the Rps22B–GFP strain to LiCl stress using a microfluidic system (Methods). After the establishment of bimodality, we replaced the LiCl-containing growth medium with spent medium. In this way, we induced starvation of varying duration, followed by a sudden switch to rich medium (Fig. 3a). At first, the spent medium triggered a rapid disappearance of the strong nucleolar signal of Rps22B–GFP (Supplementary Videos 1, 2), which was presumably caused by the redistribution of nucleolar proteins across the cytoplasm upon stress, as occurs in other model systems. After the switch to rich medium, the nucleolar signal of Rps22B re-emerged in cells that started growing again. Notably, the fitness of cells depended on their levels of Rps22B expression immediately before the starvation stress. Longer starvation stress favoured the survival of cells that expressed Rps22B at low levels, in that they lysed less frequently than the highly expressing cells. By contrast, shorter starvation favoured the cells that expressed Rps22B at high levels, in that they budded more in the period following nutrient replenishment (Fig. 3b–f). FACS corroborated this phenotypic difference, as the Rps22B–GFP-high subpopulation exhibited poorer survival under starvation (Fig. 3h), but a higher growth rate in rich medium (Fig. 3i, j) compared to the Rps22B–GFP-low subpopulation. This marked diversification of the population observed for Rps22B, with clear fitness effects under a subsequent stress, may reflect a bet-hedging strategy –.

### A cell fitness selection model for neuronal survival during development [^25625cf3]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Developmental cell death plays an important role in the construction of functional neural circuits. In vertebrates, the canonical view proposes a selection of the surviving neurons through stochastic competition for target-derived neurotrophic signals, implying an equal potential for neurons to compete. Here we show an alternative cell fitness selection of neurons that is defined by a specific neuronal heterogeneity code. Proprioceptive sensory neurons that will undergo cell death and those that will survive exhibit different molecular signatures that are regulated by retinoic acid and transcription factors, and are independent of the target and neurotrophins. These molecular features are genetically encoded, representing two distinct subgroups of neurons with contrasted functional maturation states and survival outcome. Thus, in this model, a heterogeneous code of intrinsic cell fitness in neighboring neurons provides differential competitive advantage resulting in the selection of cells with higher capacity to survive and functionally integrate into neural networks.

### Maternal age generates phenotypic variation in caenorhabditis elegans [^a66ff941]. Nature (2017). Excellent credibility.

Genetically identical individuals that grow in the same environment often show substantial phenotypic variation within populations of organisms as diverse as bacteria, nematodes, rodents and humans. With some exceptions, the causes are poorly understood. Here we show that isogenic Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes vary in their size at hatching, speed of development, growth rate, starvation resistance, fecundity, and also in the rate of development of their germline relative to that of somatic tissues. We show that the primary cause of this variation is the age of an individual's mother, with the progeny of young mothers exhibiting several phenotypic impairments. We identify age-dependent changes in the maternal provisioning of the lipoprotein complex vitellogenin to embryos as the molecular mechanism that underlies the variation in multiple traits throughout the life of an animal. The production of sub-optimal progeny by young mothers may reflect a trade-off between the competing fitness traits of a short generation time and the survival and fecundity of the progeny.

### The loci of environmental adaptation in a model eukaryote [^97fe40fe]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The past two decades have seen major advances in identifying the likely genetic changes underlying adaptive evolution, including in some of the most iconic cases. While valuable –, for three reasons, these case studies are insufficient for a general understanding of the genomic rules and mechanisms of adaptation. First, because the number of case studies is relatively small, the outcome is dependent on the particular adaptation investigated so may be unrepresentative. Moreover, genetic dissections of adaptations brought by few, large-effect mutations are more likely to be successful than those brought by many, small-effect mutations, potentially distorting our understanding. Second, while each case of adaptive evolution usually involves changes of many phenotypic traits at multiple levels of biological organization, most studies focused on only one trait that is usually not the fitness per se, which may result in a biased view. Third, because our knowledge of the context (i.e. the genetic background and environment) of any past adaptive genetic change is at best incomplete, both the fitness impact of the genetic change and its mechanism of action are typically difficult to reconstruct with certainty. As such, several fundamental questions about the genomic basis of adaptation are unanswered. For example, it has been a long-standing debate whether protein-coding or noncoding mutations are more important to adaptive evolution. It is also unclear whether adaptations to diverse environments are brought by genetic changes distributed in diverse genes and biological processes or concentrated in a core set of genes and processes. For instance, estimating the nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitution rate ratio (ω) in comparative genomics tends to detect positive selection in genes for immunity or reproduction, but this enrichment may be attributable to a higher power of the approach in detecting diversifying selection than directional selection instead of an oversized contribution of these genes to adaptation, because diversifying selection tends to result in multiple nonsynonymous substitutions within a codon, facilitating the detection of positive selection.

### Pleiotropic fitness effects of a drosophila odorant-binding protein [^42aa38ee]. G3 (2023). Medium credibility.

Insect odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) are members of a rapidly evolving multigene family traditionally thought to facilitate chemosensation. However, studies on Drosophila have shown that members of this family have evolved functions beyond chemosensation, as evident from their expression in reproductive tissues and the brain. Previous studies implicated diverse functions of Obp56h, a member of the largest gene cluster of the D. melanogaster Obp repertoire. Here, we examined the effect of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of Obp56h on 2 fitness phenotypes, on resistance to starvation stress and heat stress, and on locomotion and sleep phenotypes. Obp56h-/- mutants show a strong sexually dimorphic effect on starvation stress survival, with females being more resistant to starvation stress than the control. In contrast, Obp56h-/- females, but not males, are highly sensitive to heat stress. Both sexes show changes in locomotion and sleep patterns. Transcriptional profiling of RNA from heads of Obp56h-/- flies and the wildtype control reveals differentially expressed genes, including gene products associated with antimicrobial immune responses and members of the Turandot family of stress-induced secreted peptides. In addition, differentially expressed genes of unknown function were identified in both sexes. Genes encoding components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, cuticular proteins, gene products associated with regulation of feeding behavior (Lst and CCHa2), ribosomal proteins, lncRNAs, snoRNAs, tRNAs, and snRNAs show changes in transcript abundances in Obp56h-/- females. These differentially expressed genes are likely to contribute to Obp56h-mediated effects on the diverse phenotypes that arise upon deletion of this OBP.

### The importance of species interactions in eco-evolutionary community dynamics under climate change [^be31f9d3]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

We derive our equations using the idealizations of additive quantitative genetics and the weak selection limit. Both have their drawbacks. The first assumes that all genetic variation is additive — genes and alleles at different loci do not interact. This ignores the fact that genes are part of a complex regulatory network in which interactions such as dominance, epistasis, and pleiotropy are bound to emerge. While purely additive quantitative genetics can be a good starting point for understanding the effects of selection, it remains an approximation. In turn, the weak selection limit assumes that selection is not so strong as to prevent one from writing otherwise discrete-time dynamics in the continuous-time limit (SI, Section 1). In fact, from a practical point of view, this limit can actually allow for quite a strong selection. For this, however, one must assume very large population sizes so genetic and ecological drift do not overpower selection. The rule of thumb is that effective population size times the selection differential must exceed one. This is obviously true if populations are so large that they can be modeled as continuous variables, but in reality, they are finite, and the weak selection assumption could potentially yield effects which we neglect. For example, a new immigrant at a habitat patch will naturally have a low population size and might not be able to establish even if it has higher fitness. Similarly, a slightly deleterious type will never spread in our approximation, while it might in reality, as known from the nearly neutral theory. Although Akashi et al.show that weak selection can often explain similar patterns of genome variation as the nearly neutral theory, a rigorous incorporation of the consequences of population finiteness in our model is still in the future.

### The evolution of mechanisms to produce phenotypic heterogeneity in microorganisms [^435d26df]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

In species that divide labour by coordination, the outcome of individual specialisation depends on the phenotypes of social group neighbours. Our first model is deliberately agnostic to the details of how phenotype information is shared between group members in order to facilitate predictions across different systems. For instance, individuals may share phenotype information via signalling between cells or with a common developmental programme (Fig. 2b). We make the simplifying assumption that individuals coordinate fully so that coordinated groups always form with precisely the optimal number of helpers. The disadvantage of coordinated specialisation is that the mechanism could incur metabolic costs, such as the production of extracellular signalling molecules. The fitness of a group of coordinated specialisers is given by:whereis the average group fecundity with the optimal number of helpers, andis the metabolic cost of coordination, whose form we leave unspecified but could in principle depend on further factors such as group size (Methods: Fully coordinated specialisation). We use 'metabolic costs' as a shorthand for all fixed costs at the time of differentiation, which could include other factors such as delaying reproduction. A number of different models have examined how different proximate mechanisms can produce coordinated division of labour in specific systems.

### Pleiotropic fitness effects of a drosophila odorant-binding protein [^11470e62]. G3 (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Insect odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) are members of a rapidly evolving multigene family traditionally thought to facilitate chemosensation. However, studies on Drosophila have shown that members of this family have evolved functions beyond chemosensation, as evident from their expression in reproductive tissues and the brain. Previous studies implicated diverse functions of Obp56h, a member of the largest gene cluster of the D. melanogaster Obp repertoire. Here, we examined the effect of CRISPR/ Cas9 -mediated deletion of Obp56h on 2 fitness phenotypes, on resistance to starvation stress and heat stress, and on locomotion and sleep phenotypes. Obp56h −/− mutants show a strong sexually dimorphic effect on starvation stress survival, with females being more resistant to starvation stress than the control. In contrast, Obp56h −/− females, but not males, are highly sensitive to heat stress. Both sexes show changes in locomotion and sleep patterns. Transcriptional profiling of RNA from heads of Obp56h −/− flies and the wildtype control reveals differentially expressed genes, including gene products associated with antimicrobial immune responses and members of the Turandot family of stress-induced secreted peptides. In addition, differentially expressed genes of unknown function were identified in both sexes. Genes encoding components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, cuticular proteins, gene products associated with regulation of feeding behavior (Lst and CCHa2), ribosomal proteins, lncRNAs, snoRNAs, tRNAs, and snRNAs show changes in transcript abundances in Obp56h −/− females. These differentially expressed genes are likely to contribute to Obp56h -mediated effects on the diverse phenotypes that arise upon deletion of this OBP.

### Empirical fitness landscapes reveal accessible evolutionary paths [^2f04cde4]. Nature (2007). Excellent credibility.

When attempting to understand evolution, we traditionally rely on analysing evolutionary outcomes, despite the fact that unseen intermediates determine its course. A handful of recent studies has begun to explore these intermediate evolutionary forms, which can be reconstructed in the laboratory. With this first view on empirical evolutionary landscapes, we can now finally start asking why particular evolutionary paths are taken.

### Characterizing the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of cancer [^9173a913]. Nature Genetics (2020). High credibility.

Tumor initiation and progression are somatic evolutionary processes driven by the accumulation of genetic alterations, some of which confer selective fitness advantages to the host cell. This gene-centric model has shaped the field of cancer biology and advanced understanding of cancer pathophysiology. Importantly, however, each genotype encodes diverse phenotypic traits that permit acclimation to varied microenvironmental conditions. Epigenetic and transcriptional changes also contribute to the heritable phenotypic variation required for evolution. Additionally, interactions between cancer cells and surrounding stromal and immune cells through autonomous and non-autonomous signaling can influence competition for survival. Therefore, a mechanistic understanding of tumor progression must account for evolutionary and ecological dynamics. In this Perspective, we outline technological advances and model systems to characterize tumor progression through space and time. We discuss the importance of unifying experimentation with computational modeling and opportunities to inform cancer control.

### Orthopaedic and rehabilitation devices panel sept. 9, 2020… [^c4382ae0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

testing has been done. Mr. Owens explained that, because the focus is on classifying preamendments devices, the Agency is limited to the way they were utilized, which was with cemented use. Jeremy L. Gilbert, Ph. D., expounded on the similarities of materials used in other. types of devices and pointed out that what is being said about toe implants today is the same thing that could have been said about shoulder arthroplasty over a decade ago. He pointed out that the degradation products used in the devices may lead to adverse reactions, that the risks are not disconnected, and that a range of hazards arise because of the interaction. Mr. Owens replied that, if the risks and proposed mitigation measures are not adequate, it is a possibility. Stacey Bonnell, M. B. A. RAC, Industry Representative, reminded the Panel of the definition of a Class III device, that they are life-supporting, life-sustaining, and of. arthroplasty.

As part of this discussion, please discuss the outcomes that provide clinically meaningful benefit and what types of evidence would be helpful to support mitigation of the identified risks. Dr. Gilbert stressed the need for Level I clinical data. He stated that a prospective. Dr. Lewis stated that additional controls of some type are definitely needed, that the risks associated with multiple surgeries are not adequately described, and that the deficiency of the data does not allow for a choice between the different devices. The Panel members unanimously agreed with Dr. Lewis and indicated that both answers to the question is no. stated. Mr. O'Brien and Dr. Price indicated that they concur with the rest of the Panel members. Ms. Bonnell stated that it appears that Class III is appropriate but general and special controls will suffice because of the inadequacy of the data. Chairperson Smith summarized the Panel's response: Q&A Dr.

Lewis noted that the only part of the device that contacts the patient is the Foley catheter. He asked why this is being treated as a separate device. Dr. Rabang explained that it is all one device with the catheter being a part of the tubing set. Dr. Ebramzadeh asked who designs the protocols and procedures for mechanical.

### What can we learn from fitness landscapes? [^e4602543]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

A combinatorially complete data set consists of studies of all possible combinations of a set of mutant sites in a gene or mutant alleles in a genome. Among the most robust conclusions from these studies is that epistasis between beneficial mutations often shows a pattern of diminishing returns, in which favorable mutations are less fit when combined than would be expected. Another robust inference is that the number of adaptive evolutionary paths is often limited to a relatively small fraction of the theoretical possibilities, owing largely to sign epistasis requiring evolutionary steps that would entail a decrease in fitness. Here we summarize these and other results while also examining issues that remain unresolved and future directions that seem promising.

### Strong phenotypic plasticity limits potential for evolutionary responses to climate change [^87066b96]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Under climate change, characterised by increased environmental stochasticity, the reliability of existing environmental cues as predictors for seasonal progression will likely diminish. As a consequence, the most common (i.e. previously adaptive) reaction norm is then more likely to produce mismatches between phenotype and environment. Such maladaptive phenological shifts are already being observed in many species. Under these conditions, selection will favour alternative reaction norms, for example with a different sensitivity to the environmental cue or bet-hedging strategies. Theoretical models predict that reduced environmental predictability places species with strong plasticity under increased extinction risk, and a rapid response to selection for alternative reaction norms hinges on the presence of sufficient standing variation for plasticity. However, if past purifying selection has depleted this variation, the potential for evolutionary change is limited in the short term, reducing the probability of population persistence under rapid climate change. Thus, rather than giving rise to adaptable generalists, phenotypic plasticity in seasonal habitats may generally result in specialists with reduced short-term adaptive potential that are particularly vulnerable to climate change. While selection on plasticity for timing of breeding has been documented in a wild-bird population in response to climate change, many other species or populations lack such adaptive potential, raising unanswered questions about why such variation may be depleted.

In order to clarify the role of plasticity in adaptation to climate change, we analyse adaptive potential in a textbook model of seasonal plasticity: the African savannah butterfly Bicyclus anynana (Fig. 1a). This species produces generations of butterflies that are highly distinctive in wing pattern, behaviour, and life history strategy across alternating seasonal environments –. As life histories are highly relevant for climate adaptation, our focus here is on seasonal plasticity in life history. In the warm wet season, when food and reproductive opportunities are abundant, these butterflies live short lives of fast growth and maximal reproduction, allocating less resources to body maintenance. In contrast, in the cool dry season, when adult food (fruit) is limited and larval food (grasses) absent, these adults express a life history focused on inactivity, postponed reproduction and long lifespan. The resulting life history syndrome comprises an integrated suite of coordinated traits, responding in a threshold-like manner to the seasonal environment via a common temperature-sensitive hormonal regulator.

### Hematopoietic fitness of JAK2V617F myeloproliferative neoplasms is linked to clinical outcome [^0e9a51ff]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

To manifest MPN phenotypes, MPN-SPCs and/or their progeny must be able to outcompete their normal counterparts. Over time, a survival advantage of mutant over normal HSCs increases MAF within the HSC compartment. Mutant gene products may also provide a proliferative and differentiation advantage to HSC progeny along certain trajectories. The competitive potential to pass on alleles/traits to progeny is referred to as "fitness" in evolutionary biology. Fitness integrates the intricate phenotypes that enrich for the selected alleles without necessarily defining the mechanism underlying success. Analogously, MAF within well-defined hematopoietic populations reports hematopoietic fitness of mutant cells. Herein, we tested the link between JAK2 V617F -driven MPN fitness and clinical phenotypes and outcomes.

We directly measured MPN fitness by quantifying JAK2 V617F MAF in WB and 11 well-defined and strictly validated immunophenotypic hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and mature leukocytes purified from routinely collected peripheral blood (PB) specimens (Figure 1A; supplemental Figure 2; supplemental methods). MAF was quantified by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction using DNA extracted from purified cells. Between August 2017 and August 2021, 173 PB specimens from 107 patients with JAK2 V617F MPNs were collected and analyzed (supplemental Table 1). Unsupervised, hierarchical clustering of JAK2 V617F MAF within the 11 populations identified 4 major MPN fitness levels: F1, F2, F3, and F4 (Figure 1B). The pattern of JAK2 V617F propagation through hematopoiesis was both lineage- and differentiation-stage specific and varied across fitness levels (Figure 1C-D). MPN fitness was lowest in F1 and highest in F4. MAF increased progressively in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from F1 to F4 and was further augmented during granulopoiesis, indicating that JAK2 V617F -driven fitness manifests both in HSCs and during myeloid differentiation.

### First in vivo batrachochytrium dendrobatidis transcriptomes reveal mechanisms of host exploitation, host-specific gene expression, and expressed genotype shifts [^44f88ce6]. G3 (2017). Low credibility.

The success of pathogens depends on their ability to invade, colonize, and reproduce within host tissues. Therefore, pathogens require finely tuned expression of genes during the dynamic infection process, allowing them to counter or evade host defense responses, and acquire nutrients to invest in growth and reproduction. For generalist pathogens, each host species represents a distinct selective environment, providing host-specific defense mechanisms to counter, and unique conditions for resource acquisition, potentially contributing to observed differences in pathogen fitness on different hosts. Thus, modulation of gene expression should be advantageous to generalist pathogens, responding optimally to a given host and mitigating costs of generalism. To gain insight into the mechanisms of within-host survival, host differences in pathogen virulence, and how the infection process shapes generalist pathogen evolution, we require characterization of gene expression in vivo in a diversity of hosts.

The study of many pathogenic microbes necessitates their maintenance in the laboratory using artificial culturing media — a far cry from the complex and often hostile environment of a living host. In vitro culturing of pathogens can result in drastic alterations in phenotypes, genotypes, and, importantly, pathogenicity. These changes undoubtedly involve underlying shifts in gene expression, and possibly in the proportion of genotypes represented in pathogen populations. Culture media, while providing the necessary nutrients and conditions to grow and reproduce pathogens, is a simpler or more relaxed selective environment, potentially resulting in sequence or expressed genotypes highly divergent to those seen in natural hosts.

Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is a generalist fungal pathogen capable of infecting hundreds of host species, and is a major cause of global amphibian decline. The pathogenicity of Bd varies among isolates and phylogenetic lineages, and within-strain virulence can change rapidly during serial passages through artificial culture conditions. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for variation in pathogenicity to hosts and rapid shifts in virulence are not fully understood. The environment in which Bd grows — including both abiotic factors and host skin conditions — is likely crucial to strain differences in pathogenicity and virulence.

### Towards an engineering theory of evolution [^824ccfd5]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

We have been careful throughout this work to clarify the differences between natural evolution based on natural selection (i.e. fitness) and artificial evolution based on our own forms of selection. However, there are cases where their differences become blurred. For example, when an engineered biological system has reproductive success coupled to utility, is this system naturally or artificially evolving? Much of these confusions stem from semantics of the framework used to interpret the system and here we have explicitly shown that in engineered biology the term "evolution" is almost always a mix of both natural and artificial contributions. Moving forward, ensuring that the terminology we use is consistent and clear will be crucial for supporting the robust development of an engineering theory encompassing all forms of evolution.

Traditional engineering disciplines have developed various methods that are somewhat analogous to some of the evolutionary principles outlined in this work. For example, the use of modular parts and hierarchical designs, fault tolerance, factors of safety and redundancy to improve robustness, the reuse of parts and building in tolerance to variation. However, there are clearly differences in exactly how and where these principles are applied in biological vs. engineered systems. A deeper understanding of the relationship between engineering principles and their evolutionary counterparts is needed. Better awareness of how evolution applies these principles will improve our ability to engineer all types of complex systems, in particular those that evolve.

### Key questions on the role of phenotypic plasticity in eco-evolutionary dynamics [^b47788b9]. The Journal of Heredity (2016). Low credibility.

Ecology and evolution have long been recognized as reciprocally influencing each other, with recent research emphasizing how such interactions can occur even on very short (contemporary) time scales. Given that these interactions are mediated by organismal phenotypes, they can be variously shaped by genetic variation, phenotypic plasticity, or both. I here address 8 key questions relevant to the role of plasticity in eco-evolutionary dynamics. Focusing on empirical evidence, especially from natural populations, I offer the following conclusions. 1) Plasticity is — not surprisingly — sometimes adaptive, sometimes maladaptive, and sometimes neutral. 2) Plasticity has costs and limits but these constraints are highly variable, often weak, and hard to detect. 3) Variable environments favor the evolution of increased trait plasticity, which can then buffer fitness/performance (i.e., tolerance). 4) Plasticity sometimes aids colonization of new environments (Baldwin Effect) and responses to in situ environmental change. However, plastic responses are not always necessary or sufficient in these contexts. 5) Plasticity will sometimes promote and sometimes constrain genetic evolution. 6) Plasticity will sometimes help and sometimes hinder ecological speciation but, at present, empirical tests are limited. 7) Plasticity can show considerable evolutionary change in contemporary time, although the rates of this reaction norm evolution are highly variable among taxa and traits. 8) Plasticity appears to have considerable influences on ecological dynamics at the community and ecosystem levels, although many more studies are needed. In summary, plasticity needs to be an integral part of any conceptual framework and empirical investigation of eco-evolutionary dynamics.

### Adaptive evolution: evaluating empirical support for theoretical predictions [^b1116c3e]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2012). Medium credibility.

Adaptive evolution is shaped by the interaction of population genetics, natural selection and underlying network and biochemical constraints. Variation created by mutation, the raw material for evolutionary change, is translated into phenotypes by flux through metabolic pathways and by the topography and dynamics of molecular networks. Finally, the retention of genetic variation and the efficacy of selection depend on population genetics and demographic history. Emergent high-throughput experimental methods and sequencing technologies allow us to gather more evidence and to move beyond the theory in different systems and populations. Here we review the extent to which recent evidence supports long-established theoretical principles of adaptation.

### Guidelines: from artificial evolution to computational evolution: a research agenda [^f91d9901]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2006). Medium credibility.

Computational scientists have developed algorithms inspired by natural evolution for at least 50 years. These algorithms solve optimization and design problems by building solutions that are 'more fit' relative to desired properties. However, the basic assumptions of this approach are outdated. We propose a research programme to develop a new field: computational evolution. This approach will produce algorithms that are based on current understanding of molecular and evolutionary biology and could solve previously unimaginable or intractable computational and biological problems.

### Schedule and magnitude of reproductive investment under immune trade-offs explains sex differences in immunity [^9317edc2]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Sex differences in immunity are found in many species. Known immune mechanisms in birds and mammals suggest that pathogen detection may be amplified in females, whereas in males, pathogen killing is amplified. We show that these immunological profiles emerge as distinct peaks on a fitness landscape defined by sensitivity-specificity and infection-immunopathology immune tradeoffs. What selection pressures might drive males and females towards separate peaks? Surprisingly, modeling immune trade-offs alone results in a pattern of sex differences that is the reverse of what is observed. By integrating these trade-offs into a life-history framework, where the schedule and magnitude of reproductive investment differs between the sexes, we find that increased age-specific infection and mortality risks during parental investment can push females towards the peak that aligns with empirical observations. Overall, our model suggests enhanced pathogen detection (in females) versus enhanced pathogen killing (in males) is best explained if shared immune tradeoffs interact with sex-specific reproductive schedules and risks. We suggest ways to test this framework empirically.

### Delineating the evolutionary dynamics of cancer from theory to reality [^975a85aa]. Nature Cancer (2020). High credibility.

Uncovering and quantifying the laws of the evolutionary dynamics of cancer, in particular in the context of specific genetic lesions and in individual patients, has the potential to revolutionize precision oncology. Recent technological advances in the study of human cancer have increased access to in vivo human data and have thereby facilitated the confirmation or refutation of existing theoretical models. In this Perspective, we discuss recent work at the intersection of quantitative mathematical models of cancer evolution and patient data that provides insights into different stages of tumor evolution, including premalignant and malignant progression and response to therapy.

### The evolutionary theory of cancer: challenges and potential solutions [^44433e2e]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2024). High credibility.

The clonal evolution model of cancer was developed in the 1950s-1970s and became central to cancer biology in the twenty-first century, largely through studies of cancer genetics. Although it has proven its worth, its structure has been challenged by observations of phenotypic plasticity, non-genetic forms of inheritance, non-genetic determinants of clone fitness and non-tree-like transmission of genes. There is even confusion about the definition of a clone, which we aim to resolve. The performance and value of the clonal evolution model depends on the empirical extent to which evolutionary processes are involved in cancer, and on its theoretical ability to account for those evolutionary processes. Here, we identify limits in the theoretical performance of the clonal evolution model and provide solutions to overcome those limits. Although we do not claim that clonal evolution can explain everything about cancer, we show how many of the complexities that have been identified in the dynamics of cancer can be integrated into the model to improve our current understanding of cancer.

### The evolution of mechanisms to produce phenotypic heterogeneity in microorganisms [^56b7e428]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

In bacteria and other microorganisms, the cells within a population often show extreme phenotypic variation. Different species use different mechanisms to determine how distinct phenotypes are allocated between individuals, including coordinated, random, and genetic determination. However, it is not clear if this diversity in mechanisms is adaptive-arising because different mechanisms are favoured in different environments-or is merely the result of non-adaptive artifacts of evolution. We use theoretical models to analyse the relative advantages of the two dominant mechanisms to divide labour between reproductives and helpers in microorganisms. We show that coordinated specialisation is more likely to evolve over random specialisation in well-mixed groups when: (i) social groups are small; (ii) helping is more "essential"; and (iii) there is a low metabolic cost to coordination. We find analogous results when we allow for spatial structure with a more detailed model of cellular filaments. More generally, this work shows how diversity in the mechanisms to produce phenotypic heterogeneity could have arisen as adaptations to different environments.

### Balancing selection via life-history trade-offs maintains an inversion polymorphism in a seaweed fly [^adb3da30]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Inversions are frequently reported as polymorphic and maintained over long evolutionary timescales by balancing selection. While one of the reasons could be the genetic load linked to the lack of recombination, we argue that antagonistic pleiotropy may also be a more important feature of the inversion systems than previously acknowledged. In fact, the particular architecture of inversions leads them to behave as a single-locus because of the stark reduction of recombination between rearrangements, but they are composed of dozens to hundreds of genes, sometimes interacting in a so-called "supergene" complex, where combinations of alleles at different genes lead to highly differentiated phenotypes. Inversion haplotypic rearrangements can thus have large, pleiotropic effects on complex phenotypes, which will be under various selective pressures, possibly in opposing direction. For example, in the longwing butterfly Heliconius numata an inversion polymorphism determining wing colour pattern is under opposing pleiotropic selection, with survival under positive frequency-dependent selection and reproduction under negative frequency-dependent selection. In the ruff Calidris pugnax, a polymorphic inversion that determines male reproductive morphs carries inverted alleles with lethal effect on survival but positive effects on testis size, indicating a possibly higher reproductive success, which is also under frequency-dependent selection. In the rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, alternate reproductive tactics are determined by a large polymorphic inversion, which involves a trade-off between reproductive output and longevity. The accumulating evidence from the literature combined with our results on C. frigida thus indicate that contrasted effects of inversions on different fitness components may represent a non-negligible process involved in the maintenance of inversion polymorphism. Clearly, antagonistic pleiotropy and the effect of a wide spectrum of fitness traits on pleiotropic interactions must be considered more carefully when studying the evolutionary importance of structural genomic variants, which are currently increasingly documented to underlie complex phenotypes.

### Life-history trade-offs favour the evolution of animal personalities [^6324f97a]. Nature (2007). Excellent credibility.

In recent years evidence has been accumulating that personalities are not only found in humans but also in a wide range of other animal species. Individuals differ consistently in their behavioural tendencies and the behaviour in one context is correlated with the behaviour in multiple other contexts. From an adaptive perspective, the evolution of animal personalities is still a mystery, because a more flexible structure of behaviour should provide a selective advantage. Accordingly, many researchers view personalities as resulting from constraints imposed by the architecture of behaviour (but see ref. 12). In contrast, we show here that animal personalities can be given an adaptive explanation. Our argument is based on the insight that the trade-off between current and future reproduction often results in polymorphic populations in which some individuals put more emphasis on future fitness returns than others. Life-history theory predicts that such differences in fitness expectations should result in systematic differences in risk-taking behaviour. Individuals with high future expectations (who have much to lose) should be more risk-averse than individuals with low expectations. This applies to all kinds of risky situations, so individuals should consistently differ in their behaviour. By means of an evolutionary model we demonstrate that this basic principle results in the evolution of animal personalities. It simultaneously explains the coexistence of behavioural types, the consistency of behaviour through time and the structure of behavioural correlations across contexts. Moreover, it explains the common finding that explorative behaviour and risk-related traits like boldness and aggressiveness are common characteristics of animal personalities.

### Predicting the direction of phenotypic difference [^09479bec]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Despite being less informative than a precise phenotypic value, the direction of phenotypic difference is often the crux of phenotypic comparisons. Thus, a method to evaluate the probability that the tested individual has a higher/lower phenotypic value, or that the phenotype of two individuals differs by at least a predetermined constant, could provide important insights into a wide array of applications (seefor introduction to the concept of 'local false sign rate' in statistics). These include studies that aim to (i) improve a phenotype, such as in agricultural research targeting increased crop yield, or preimplantation genetic testing attempting to estimate the probability that choosing the embryo with the lowest risk score would indeed decrease the individual disease susceptibility; (ii) study evolutionary changes over time by, for example, identifying selective pressures pushing a phenotype in a particular direction over time,–; (iii) predict if an individual's disease risk exceeds a baseline (e.g. the population average or a set clinical threshold) or that of other individuals with the disease; and (iv) predict and manage the response of a species to environmental changes, medications, or other interventions. Despite these and other important applications, we currently lack the ability to estimate how likely we are to correctly predict the direction of phenotypic difference from genomic information.

Here, we explored the feasibility of using currently available genotype-to-phenotype information to predict which individual has a greater phenotypic value. We compared the sum of the effects of the loci known to contribute to the phenotype, to the range of the potential effects of unknown genetic and non-genetic contributors. We studied this ratio of known-to-total effects through two independent branches of investigation: (i) formalizing a model to delineate the scenarios in which accurate predictions can be achieved, and (ii) evaluating performance in real-world empirical data from humans and other species, examining a wide range of levels of genetic divergence between individuals. Our findings underscore the known-to-total ratio as a high-fidelity and intuitive estimator of prediction accuracy. This approach allows us to identify cases where we can reliably discern the individual with the greater phenotypic value. Importantly, this is possible even in cases where the proportion of variance in the trait explained by known genetic effects is small. Our study suggests that it is possible to identify the pairs of individuals for which high-accuracy predictions can be made, and that more phenotypic information can be reliably extracted from a genome than perhaps intuitively expected.

### Standing genetic variation fuels rapid adaptation to ocean acidification [^8abd3065]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

A fundamental focus of ecological and evolutionary biology is determining if and how natural populations can adapt to rapid changes in the environment. Recent efforts that have combined natural population censuses with genome-wide sequencing techniques have shown that phenotypic changes due to abrupt environmental shifts oftentimes occur concomitantly to signatures of selection at loci throughout the genome –. These studies demonstrate the importance of standing genetic variation in rapid evolutionary processes, and challenge classical population genetic theory, which assumes that most genetic variation has a small effect on fitness and that selective forces alter this variation gradually over a timescale of millennia. Though the mechanisms maintaining such significant levels of genetic variation in natural populations have been historically debated, recent population genomic surveys have begun to elucidate the role of spatially and temporally variable selection pressures in this process. For example, environmental gradients in marine systems can maintain signatures of balanced polymorphisms between populations at multiple, putatively functional loci, even amidst high levels of gene flow –. While this variation has enabled the persistence of natural populations inhabiting the contemporary and historic regimes of environmental variability, it is unclear whether it will facilitate the magnitude and rate of adaptation necessary for species persistence under the conditions expected as a result of global climate change.

One pertinent threat facing marine species is ocean acidification, the global-scale decline in seawater pH driven by oceanic sequestration of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. The current rate of pH decline is unprecedented in the past 55 million years, and lab-based studies have shown negative effects of expected pH conditions on a range of fitness-related traits (e.g. growth, reproduction, and survival) across life-history stages and taxa. Marine bivalves are one of the most vulnerable taxa to ocean acidification, particularly during larval development. The ecologically and economically valuable Mediterranean mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis, is an exemplary species for studying the effects of ocean acidification on larval development. Low-pH conditions reduce shell size and induce various, likely lethal, forms of abnormal larval development. Sensitivity to low pH, however, can vary substantially across larvae from distinct parental crosses, suggesting that standing genetic variation could fuel an adaptive response to ocean acidification.

### Predicting the direction of phenotypic difference [^d936c550]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Other types of selection could also affect predictions. For example, negative selection is expected to reduce the number of loci whose genotype differs between two individuals, thus decreasing both the known and unknown effects. If it disproportionately affects larger-effect loci it might reduce the relative contribution of the known effects, thus shifting κ values towards lower values, resulting in lower prediction accuracy. Unlike directional selection, this is not expected to affect the relation between κ and prediction accuracy. Stabilizing selection, for a similar optimum on the two genomes, may also reduce prediction accuracy because it can reduce the variance contribution of shared loci affecting the phenotype.

The approach we presented evaluates the extent to which a key feature of a phenotype — its direction — can be predicted from genomic data. Given the currently limited ability to quantitatively predict phenotypes from genotypes, our approach suggests that qualitative prediction of phenotype direction is often feasible. While there is still much to explore with regard to the applicability of this approach to various data, its capability to robustly estimate prediction accuracy and to identify individuals and phenotypes for which accurate predictions can be achieved, suggests that more phenotypic information can be extracted from genomes than previously appreciated.

### Age of both parents influences reproduction and egg dumping behavior in drosophila melanogaster [^2eec458e]. The Journal of Heredity (2019). Medium credibility.

Trans-generational maternal effects have been shown to influence a broad range of offspring phenotypes. However, very little is known about paternal trans-generational effects. Here, we tested the trans-generational effects of maternal and paternal age, and their interaction, on daughter and son reproductive fitness in Drosophila melanogaster. We found significant effects of parent ages on offspring reproductive fitness during a 10 day postfertilization period. In daughters, older (45 days old) mothers conferred lower reproductive fitness compared with younger mothers (3 days old). In sons, father's age significantly affected reproductive fitness. The effects of 2 old parents were additive in both sexes and reproductive fitness was lowest when the focal individual had 2 old parents. Interestingly, daughter fertility was sensitive to father's age but son fertility was insensitive to mother's age, suggesting a sexual asymmetry in trans-generational effects. We found the egg-laying dynamics in daughters dramatically shaped this relationship. Daughters with 2 old parents demonstrated an extreme egg dumping behavior on day 1 and laid > 2.35× the number of eggs than the other 3 age class treatments. Our study reveals significant trans-generational maternal and paternal age effects on fertility and an association with a novel egg laying behavioral phenotype in Drosophila.

### Fundamental concepts in genetics: effective population size and patterns of molecular evolution and variation [^8dff428b]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2009). Medium credibility.

The effective size of a population, N(e), determines the rate of change in the composition of a population caused by genetic drift, which is the random sampling of genetic variants in a finite population. N(e) is crucial in determining the level of variability in a population, and the effectiveness of selection relative to drift. This article reviews the properties of N(e) in a variety of different situations of biological interest, and the factors that influence it. In particular, the action of selection means that N(e) varies across the genome, and advances in genomic techniques are giving new insights into how selection shapes N(e).

### The importance of species interactions in eco-evolutionary community dynamics under climate change [^4f88dd2f]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

We circumvented this problem by building, from first principles, a different framework for spatial eco-evolutionary dynamics. Within a single patch, it is based on a quantitative genetic recursion model. Spatial locations are discretized from the outset, therefore the approach is built on ordinary differential equations alone. As a consequence, it executes fast even with substantial model complexity: on an ordinary desktop computer, a single run for 6500 years with both trophic interactions and temperature-dependent competition, with 50 species on both trophic levels and 50 habitat patches (for 100 × 50 × 2 = 10,000 state variables; the factor of 2 is because both the density and trait mean of each species may change) finished in around 3 min. While this is fast, emerging methods such as Universal Differential Equations, which combine traditional integration with machine learning, hold the promise of a many-fold increase in the speed of computation in the near future. Incorporation of further complexity into our model is straightforward: complex food webs and spatial structure, or further trait variables under selection (e.g. having both temperature optimum and body size evolve, the latter dictating the type of prey a species can consume), can all be implemented. An important future extension would be to use an improved climate model with annual temperature fluctuations, instead of our smooth increase based on annual means. Annual extreme weather events are expected to become more common. Under such circumstances, Allee effects might mean more frequent extinctions than predicted from our current model, because species hit by such events might not be able to recover. On the other hand, annual temperature cycles could induce storage effects or relative nonlinearities, which in combination with our already incorporated spatial variation could promote coexistence through joint spatial and temporal variation.

### Clade diversification dynamics and the biotic and abiotic controls of speciation and extinction rates [^92ae5528]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Our investigation of biotic vs. abiotic controls of macroevolution sheds new light on the scope of Darwin's "principle of divergence", which lays at the core of Darwin's own approach to macroevolution. The "principle" assumes that new species begin as emerging varieties; the ones that survive the "struggle for existence" are populations that evolve more distinct characteristics and resource use, to the point where they may cause their ancestor's and some of their close relatives' extinction. In this view, reproductive isolation is a by-product rather than a driver of divergence, and the physical environment is of minor importance. The Modern Synthesis rejected Darwin's principle, minimized the role of competition in species origination and loss, and emphasized the interaction of abiotic factors and genetic mechanisms of reproductive isolation in driving the macroevolutionary dynamics of diversification. This model shows that, in line with Darwin's principle, biotic interactions are key, but their outcome is determined by an interaction with the abiotic "theater" of diversification — the dynamic geographic landscape. The spatial and temporal scales of landscape dynamics shape both macroevolutionary rates of speciation and extinction, but we emphasize that the landscape's relevant spatial scale itself is relative to the organisms' dispersal capacity. As envisioned by Darwin, the frequent extinction of incipient species insufficiently diverged from their parental species plays a key role in diversification (in stages 2 and 3). This general pattern of early extinctions fits the concept of ephemeral speciation. which predicts the rapid extinction of most newly diverging species. Our model backs up the contention that ephemeral speciation may explain observed mismatches between high microevolutionary rates of reproductive isolation and low macroevolutionary rates of speciation –.

### Fitness benefits of prolonged post-reproductive lifespan in women [^ded6bfe4]. Nature (2004). Excellent credibility.

Most animals reproduce until they die, but in humans, females can survive long after ceasing reproduction. In theory, a prolonged post-reproductive lifespan will evolve when females can gain greater fitness by increasing the success of their offspring than by continuing to breed themselves. Although reproductive success is known to decline in old age, it is unknown whether women gain fitness by prolonging lifespan post-reproduction. Using complete multi-generational demographic records, we show that women with a prolonged post-reproductive lifespan have more grandchildren, and hence greater fitness, in pre-modern populations of both Finns and Canadians. This fitness benefit arises because post-reproductive mothers enhance the lifetime reproductive success of their offspring by allowing them to breed earlier, more frequently and more successfully. Finally, the fitness benefits of prolonged lifespan diminish as the reproductive output of offspring declines. This suggests that in female humans, selection for deferred ageing should wane when one's own offspring become post-reproductive and, correspondingly, we show that rates of female mortality accelerate as their offspring terminate reproduction.

### Defeating lethal cancer: interrupting the ecologic and evolutionary basis of death from malignancy [^90d53ddf]. CA (2025). Medium credibility.

UNDERSTANDING CANCER LETHALITY IN AN ECO‐EVOLUTIONARY FRAMEWORK

"… nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution… "

We now understand that cancer remains incurable because it evolves the capacity to metastasize and develop resistance to both host defense systems and systemic therapies. Despite the uniqueness of each patient and each tumor — including different environments, different driver mutations, different organ sites, different treatment regimens, and different medical and personal histories — each of these lethal cancers in different patients independently arise and then evolve the same lethal features in each patient, metastasis and therapeutic resistance, in a process termed convergent evolution. Convergent evolution describes the independent evolution of a similar feature in different species; for example, wings evolved independently in birds, mammals, and insects. On the surface, that this occurs in cancer across millions of patients with cancer is quite remarkable. How is it possible?

The discovery of the myriad of epigenetic and genetic variation that emerges throughout the course of cancer progression highlights that evolutionary science can be a good tool to understand how cancer evolves and becomes lethal (Table 2). Evolutionary science is the study of the history of life on Earth. It studies how species evolve over time and how genetic variation leads to new observable phenotypes (the physical and functional characteristics of a species). How does this apply to cancer?

TABLE 2
Glossary of evolutionary ecology terms.

When a normal cell breaks its connections to its neighboring cells in a tissue or organ, it dies — this is essential for the survival of a complex multicellular organism like humans. Cancer begins when a once normal cell evolves the ability to break bonds with its neighbors, survives, and proliferates. Once this cell breaks away from the constraints of being a component of a multicellular tissue, it can be thought of as an emerging new species within the patient. Heritable changes in the cancer cells over time lead to alterations in genotypes and resultant phenotypes as the tumor population proliferates. Genetic changes, however, do not happen in a vacuum. Cancer cells are subject to evolution by natural selection in response to forces within their tumor microenvironment ecosystem. This is analogous to how species evolve: for example, how the beak shape of Charles Darwin's finches evolved in response to the various food sources of the different Galapagos Islands. Over time, cancer cells that accumulate a heritable variation that is favorable for a particular environment proliferate, become tumors, and grow.

### Predicting the direction of phenotypic difference [^9ebdcc78]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Impact of directional selection on predictions between populations and species

In the model above, we have not addressed the role of selection. Directional selection most likely has little effect on the within-population UK Biobank comparisons, but may play a more central role when more divergent genomes are compared. In this section, we extend our model to include directional selection and examine predictions in divergent populations and species (see Discussion for the potential effects of negative and stabilizing selection).

Until now, our model assumed that the effects have an equal probability of increasing or decreasing the phenotypic difference. Under directional selection, the phenotype of a lineage is typically pushed towards a new optimal value. The directions of effects of that lineage relative to the ancestral lineage are more likely to be in the direction of this optimum. Thus, to model the case that directional selection has shaped the divergence between the two compared genomes, we introduced biased effects into our model. We considered the case where selection is stronger for larger effect sizes. In other words, effects are more likely to be aligned with the direction of selection than with the opposite direction, and the probability of alignment increases with the size of the effect and the strength of selection.

### Continuously fluctuating selection reveals fine granularity of adaptation [^201a7523]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Temporally fluctuating environmental conditions are a ubiquitous feature of natural habitats. Yet, how finely natural populations adaptively track fluctuating selection pressures via shifts in standing genetic variation is unknown 1,2. Here we generated genome-wide allele frequency data every 1–2 generations from a genetically diverse population of Drosophila melanogaster in extensively replicated field mesocosms from late June to mid-December (a period of approximately 12 total generations). Adaptation throughout the fundamental ecological phases of population expansion, peak density and collapse was underpinned by extremely rapid, parallel changes in genomic variation across replicates. Yet, the dominant direction of selection fluctuated repeatedly, even within each of these ecological phases. Comparing patterns of change in allele frequency to an independent dataset procured from the same experimental system demonstrated that the targets of selection are predictable across years. In concert, our results reveal a fitness relevance of standing variation that is likely to be masked by inference approaches based on static population sampling or insufficiently resolved time-series data. We propose that such fine-scaled, temporally fluctuating selection may be an important force contributing to the maintenance of functional genetic variation in natural populations and an important stochastic force impacting genome-wide patterns of diversity at linked neutral sites, akin to genetic draft.

### Pleiotropy and the evolutionary stability of plastic phenotypes: a geometric framework [^87898129]. G3 (2025). Medium credibility.

Phenotypic plasticity allows organisms to express different traits in response to different environmental or genetic conditions. Understanding the evolution of conditional phenotypes is challenging because they are not expressed by all members of a population, which allows for the accumulation of deleterious variation due to a reduced efficacy of purifying selection. Theory suggests pleiotropic effects help prevent the decay of conditional phenotypes by exposing the variation accrued in one context to the effects of purifying selection in an alternative context. However, existing frameworks for describing the evolutionary dynamics of conditional phenotypes are limited in their ability to flexibly model the complex pleiotropic architectures that often underlie conditional phenotypes. To help improve our understanding of the evolutionary stability of conditional phenotypes, here we describe a geometric model that allows for explicit modeling of different fitness optima for conditional and alternative phenotypes, as well as their underlying pleiotropic associations. Using stochastic simulations and mathematical analyses, we show that this model recapitulates and elaborates on existing predictions regarding the role of pleiotropy in maintaining conditional phenotypes. Specifically, we found that more pleiotropic conditional phenotypes experience decreased rates of decay in fitness over periods of inexpression, the effects of which are comparable for phenotypes that are spatially and temporally conditional. Furthermore, the functional form of the relationship between conditional phenotype expression pattern and decay rate is mediated by pleiotropic effect, which provides more explicit hypotheses of when pleiotropic constraint is expected to play a significant role in the evolutionary maintenance of conditional phenotypes. Finally, we found that when pleiotropic architectures evolve over periods of conditional phenotype inexpression, decoupling from other phenotypes readily evolves and facilitates decay in fitness.

### Genomic signatures of sexual conflict [^0997d857]. The Journal of Heredity (2017). Low credibility.

Sexual conflict is a specific class of intergenomic conflict that describes the reciprocal sex-specific fitness costs generated by antagonistic reproductive interactions. The potential for sexual conflict is an inherent property of having a shared genome between the sexes and, therefore, is an extreme form of an environment-dependent fitness effect. In this way, many of the predictions from environment-dependent selection can be used to formulate expected patterns of genome evolution under sexual conflict. However, the pleiotropic and transmission constraints inherent to having alleles move across sex-specific backgrounds from generation to generation further modulate the anticipated signatures of selection. We outline methods for detecting candidate sexual conflict loci both across and within populations. Additionally, we consider the ability of genome scans to identify sexually antagonistic loci by modeling allele frequency changes within males and females due to a single generation of selection. In particular, we highlight the need to integrate genotype, phenotype, and functional information to truly distinguish sexual conflict from other forms of sexual differentiation.

### Genetic consequences of biologically altered environments [^e17df219]. The Journal of Heredity (2022). Medium credibility.

Evolvable traits of organisms can alter the environment those organisms experience. While it is well appreciated that those modified environments can influence natural selection to which organisms are exposed, they can also influence the expression of genetic variances and covariances of traits under selection. When genetic variance and covariance change in response to changes in the evolving, modified environment, rates and outcomes of evolution also change. Here we discuss the basic mechanisms whereby organisms modify their environments, review how those modified environments have been shown to alter genetic variance and covariance, and discuss potential evolutionary consequences of such dynamics. With these dynamics, responses to selection can be more rapid and sustained, leading to more extreme phenotypes, or they can be slower and truncated, leading to more conserved phenotypes. Patterns of correlated selection can also change, leading to greater or less evolutionary independence of traits, or even causing convergence or divergence of traits, even when selection on them is consistent across environments. Developing evolutionary models that incorporate changes in genetic variances and covariances when environments themselves evolve requires developing methods to predict how genetic parameters respond to environments-frequently multifactorial environments. It also requires a population-level analysis of how traits of collections of individuals modify environments for themselves and/or others in a population, possibly in spatially explicit ways. Despite the challenges of elucidating the mechanisms and nuances of these processes, even qualitative predictions of how environment-modifying traits alter evolutionary potential are likely to improve projections of evolutionary outcomes.

### Increasing our ability to predict contemporary evolution [^b8a8fc1a]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Two hypotheses for limits in our ability to predict evolution

The degree to which evolution is predictable forms a long-standing debate in biology. At the core of this debate is the question of the extent to which evolution is driven by random versus deterministic processes(Fig. 2). In this context, there are two main classes of explanation for difficulties in predicting evolution. First, predictability can be limited by random processes (the "random limits" hypothesis). The key mechanisms underlying this hypothesis are stochastic changes in allele frequency due to genetic drift and the random nature of mutation. Second, even evolution driven by deterministic natural selection can be difficult to predict, due to limited data that in turn leads to poor understanding of selection and its environmental causes, trait variation, and inheritance, (the "data limits" hypothesis). Indeed, a starting point for improving our ability to predict evolution is to increase understanding of when selection is expected to be directional, fluctuating, or stabilizing.

### The maintenance of polygenic sex determination depends on the dominance of fitness effects which are predictive of the role of sexual antagonism [^8a325d39]. G3 (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 2
Smoothed histograms show the frequency of each proto-sex chromosome (Y M, III M, and IV F) after 1000 generations in simulations using either 1000 random fitness arrays (random), fitness arrays that maintain PSD (polygenic), or the 1000 best-fitting fitness arrays for each population (CA, NC, or NY). Simulations were started with equal frequencies of all genotypes. The vertical line within each histogram shows the median. Red dots show the observed proto-sex chromosome frequencies in each natural population. Fitness arrays were calculated assuming either (A) additive, (B) dominant, (C) recessive, or (D) overdominant fitness effects of the proto-Y chromosomes.

Most dominant fitness effects that appear to maintain PSD are paths to the eventual fixation of the proto-Y chromosomes. More than 25% of dominant fitness maintain PSD for 1000 generations (Supplementary Figures S1A and S2A), but most of those produce very high frequencies of the Y M and III M chromosomes (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure S3). A proto-Y chromosome with a dominant fitness effect segregating at very high frequency is consistent with a beneficial effect that masks the recessive variant (in this case the homologous proto-X), allowing the proto-X chromosome to persist at a low frequency for a long time. To test this prediction, I selected fitness effects that maintain PSD for 1000 generations, and I ran simulations with those fitness effects for 1,000,000 generations. I considered a proto-Y chromosome to reach "fixation" after 1,000,000 generations if it achieves a frequency > 99.9% (i.e. the same threshold for maintaining PSD after 1000 generations). Consistent with the prediction, > 50% of dominant fitness effects that maintain PSD for 1000 generations eventually cause the Y M or III M proto-Y chromosomes to reach fixation within 1,000,000 generations, regardless of the starting genotype frequencies (Supplementary Figures S4–S7). In contrast, ≤ 1% of additive, recessive, or overdominant fitness effects of proto-Y chromosomes that maintain PSD for 1000 generations eventually result in fixation of a proto-Y chromosome after 1,000,000 generations. Despite the eventual fixation of proto-Y chromosomes with many dominant fitness effects, there are subset of dominant fitness effects that maintain Y M and III M at lower frequencies, resembling those observed in natural populations (Figure 2B). For these dominant fitness effects that produce proto-sex chromosome frequencies similar natural populations, fixation of proto-Y chromosomes never occurs after 1,000,000 generations (Supplementary Figures S4–S7). Therefore, dominant fitness effects can maintain PSD at equilibrium, although most dominant fitness effects result in fixation or loss of the proto-Y chromosomes. Below, I describe how dominant fitness effects that can or cannot maintain PSD differ in their signatures of sexual antagonism.

### Independent phenotypic plasticity axes define distinct obesity sub-types [^19d6882d]. Nature Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Source data

We validated these findings in several ways. First, deleting the imprinted maternal Nnat allele, which generates isogenic Nnat -deletion mutants albeit with normal Nnat expression, did not trigger overgrowth in the same line (Nnat -m/+; Extended Data Fig. 1b, c). Second, we tested and observed phenotypic bi-stability in two independent mouse houses and after surviving rederivations independently from cryopreserved embryos and sperm (MPI-IE, Germany; Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a; and VAI, USA; Extended Data Fig. 1d, e). Third, we observed bi-stability over dozens of generations, despite exclusively using Nnat ± p -Light animals as fathers and naive WT C57BL/6J females for continuous backcrossing. Nnat deletion is clear in both Light and Heavy morphs at the DNA and messenger RNA levels (Extended Data Fig. 1f). Thus, Nnat ± p -triggered overgrowth is robust across distinct environments and in vitro rederivation protocols. To the best of our knowledge, these data represent an unprecedented demonstration of mammalian polyphenism in a genetic context of substantial genome-wide heterozygosity (F1 hybrids as opposed to congenic lines). They rule out genome-wide homozygosity as a precondition for mammalian polyphenism.

### Developmental nonlinearity drives phenotypic robustness [^27de80b2]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Robustness to perturbation is a fundamental feature of complex organisms. Mutations are the raw material for evolution, yet robustness to their effects is required for species survival. The mechanisms that produce robustness are poorly understood. Nonlinearities are a ubiquitous feature of development that may link variation in development to phenotypic robustness. Here, we manipulate the gene dosage of a signaling molecule, Fgf8, a critical regulator of vertebrate development. We demonstrate that variation in Fgf8 expression has a nonlinear relationship to phenotypic variation, predicting levels of robustness among genotypes. Differences in robustness are not due to gene expression variance or dysregulation, but emerge from the nonlinearity of the genotype-phenotype curve. In this instance, embedded features of development explain robustness differences. How such features vary in natural populations and relate to genetic variation are key questions for unraveling the origin and evolvability of this feature of organismal development.

### Lethal phenotypes in mendelian disorders [^e778388c]. Genetics in Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Existing resources that characterize the essentiality status of genes are based on either proliferation assessment in human cell lines, viability evaluation in mouse knockouts, or constraint metrics derived from human population sequencing studies. Several repositories document phenotypic annotations for rare disorders; however, there is a lack of comprehensive reporting on lethal phenotypes.

Methods

We queried Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man for terms related to lethality and classified all Mendelian genes according to the earliest age of death recorded for the associated disorders, from prenatal death to no reports of premature death. We characterized the genes across these lethality categories, examined the evidence on viability from mouse models and explored how this information could be used for novel gene discovery.

Results

We developed the Lethal Phenotypes Portal to showcase this curated catalog of human essential genes. Differences in the mode of inheritance, physiological systems affected, and disease class were found for genes in different lethality categories, as well as discrepancies between the lethal phenotypes observed in mouse and human.

Conclusion

We anticipate that this resource will aid clinicians in the diagnosis of early lethal conditions and assist researchers in investigating the properties that make these genes essential for human development.

### New genes as drivers of phenotypic evolution [^28e3d79a]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2013). Medium credibility.

During the course of evolution, genomes acquire novel genetic elements as sources of functional and phenotypic diversity, including new genes that originated in recent evolution. In the past few years, substantial progress has been made in understanding the evolution and phenotypic effects of new genes. In particular, an emerging picture is that new genes, despite being present in the genomes of only a subset of species, can rapidly evolve indispensable roles in fundamental biological processes, including development, reproduction, brain function and behaviour. The molecular underpinnings of how new genes can develop these roles are starting to be characterized. These recent discoveries yield fresh insights into our broad understanding of biological diversity at refined resolution.

### Increasing our ability to predict contemporary evolution [^bb7a4969]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Table 1
Examples of data types and models that can aid the quantification of uncertainty related to predicting evolution over moderate time scales.

We focus mostly on hierarchical (i.e. multilevel) models that can be fit in a Bayesian context. Each model accounts for uncertainty (due to data limits or randomness) in a factor relevant for predicting evolution, but an ideal analysis would combine these components to propagate information and uncertainty across these disparate components. We stress that the examples below are representative, but by no means exhaustive.

Moreover, many complexities make it difficult to obtain data sufficient for accurate prediction (Fig. 3). An example of such a complexity is where mutations interact with one another (i.e. epistasis), rather than having additive effects. Epistasis can cause some genotypic combinations to have much higher fitness than others. Thus, epistasis can cause even adaptive (i.e. non-neutral) evolution to be mediated by historical contingencies in the type and order of mutations that arise. Specifically, mutations that arise early in evolution can strongly affect which mutations are subsequently viable, making evolution dependent on mutation-order and difficult to predict. For example, mutations that arise early in the evolution of antibiotic resistance effect which subsequent mutations are favored by natural selection. Other interactions, such as those between genes and the environment, are likely to have similar effects for complicating prediction.

### Evolution driven by differential dispersal within a wild bird population [^b878b356]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

Evolutionary theory predicts that local population divergence will depend on the balance between the diversifying effect of selection and the homogenizing effect of gene flow. However, spatial variation in the expression of genetic variation will also generate differential evolutionary responses. Furthermore, if dispersal is non-random it may actually reinforce, rather than counteract, evolutionary differentiation. Here we document the evolution of differences in body mass within a population of great tits, Parus major, inhabiting a single continuous woodland, over a 36-year period. We show that genetic variance for nestling body mass is spatially variable, that this generates different potential responses to selection, and that this diversifying effect is reinforced by non-random dispersal. Matching the patterns of variation, selection and evolution with population ecological data, we argue that the small-scale differentiation is driven by density-related differences in habitat quality affecting settlement decisions. Our data show that when gene flow is not homogeneous, evolutionary differentiation can be rapid and can occur over surprisingly small spatial scales. Our findings have important implications for questions of the scale of adaptation and speciation, and challenge the usual treatment of dispersal as a force opposing evolutionary differentiation.

### Adaptive dynamics under development-based genotype-phenotype maps [^d16bc19d]. Nature (2013). Excellent credibility.

It is not known whether natural selection can encounter any given phenotype that can be produced by genetic variation. There has been a long-lasting debate about the processes that limit adaptation and, consequently, about how well adapted phenotypes are. Here we examine how development may affect adaptation, by decomposing the genotype-fitness map-the association between each genotype and its fitness-into two: one mapping genotype to phenotype by means of a computational model of organ development, and one mapping phenotype to fitness. In the map of phenotype and fitness, the fitness of each individual is based on the similarity between realized morphology and optimal morphology. We use three different simulations to map phenotype to fitness, and these differ in the way in which similarity is calculated: similarity is calculated for each trait (in terms of each cell position individually), for a large or a small number of phenotypic landmarks (the 'many-traits' and 'few-traits' phenotype-fitness maps), and by measuring the overall surface roughness of morphology (the 'roughness' phenotype-fitness map). Evolution is simulated by applying the genotype-phenotype map and one phenotype-fitness map to each individual in the population, as well as random mutation and drift. We show that the complexity of the genotype-phenotype map prevents substantial adaptation in some of the phenotype-fitness maps: sustained adaptation is only possible using 'roughness' or 'few-traits' phenotype-fitness maps. The results contribute developmental understanding to the long-standing question of which aspects of phenotype can be effectively optimized by natural selection.

### Towards an engineering theory of evolution [^430c38a2]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Biological technologies are fundamentally unlike any other because biology evolves. Bioengineering therefore requires novel design methodologies with evolution at their core. Knowledge about evolution is currently applied to the design of biosystems ad hoc. Unless we have an engineering theory of evolution, we will neither be able to meet evolution's potential as an engineering tool, nor understand or limit its unintended consequences for our biological designs. Here, we propose the evotype as a helpful concept for engineering the evolutionary potential of biosystems, or other self-adaptive technologies, potentially beyond the realm of biology.

### Towards an engineering theory of evolution [^8d2b1777]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

For all but the very simplest biosystems, it is impractical to enumerate every potential evolutionary disposition, just as it is impossible to consider every trait of the phenotype. Instead, an appropriate sample of the evotype must be used for the purpose at hand, just as samples of traits are used when describing the phenotype. How we take this sample, and thus the scope of the evotype covered, should be determined by knowledge of the design type, its intended function and the context in which it will be used. This could include the size of population, environment and required number of generations over which the system must operate reliably.

Broadly speaking, we may wish to seek one of two goals when designing the evotype: the first is that of evolutionary stability, where a system changes its function as little as possible, as it evolves during use; the second is specific evolvability, where the system can easily evolve new phenotypes of a specific class (i.e. the classes of function specified by the engineer) or adapt to changes in the environment (i.e. continuing to produce a desired chemical product). Specific evolvability requires an element of robustness: core functions of the phenotype must remain unperturbed throughout sequence space so that new phenotypes can be explored. This is analogous to natural evolvability, where the ability to generate novel phenotypes alone is insufficient, as they must also be adaptive. It also relates to the concept of plasticity, which is the ability to generate new features without total loss of function. The relationship between robustness and evolvability in natural evolution has been explored in detail in prior literature. For example, a genetic circuit may have been specified to produce an OR logic function in response to two input chemicals. That is, it expresses an output protein if either one of the two input chemicals are present. A population with an evolutionarily stable version of this circuit is likely to maintain an OR function during use. A specifically evolvable version of the circuit on the other hand might be designed to readily produce other logic functions when evolved (e.g. AND, NOR, and NOT), without simply destroying existing functionality or causing lethality to the host cell.

### Social effects on annual fitness in red squirrels [^dd450236]. The Journal of Heredity (2022). Medium credibility.

When resources are limited, mean fitness is constrained and competition can cause genes and phenotypes to enhance an individual's own fitness while reducing the fitness of their competitors. Negative social effects on fitness have the potential to constrain adaptation, but the interplay between ecological opportunity and social constraints on adaptation remains poorly studied in nature. Here, we tested for evidence of phenotypic social effects on annual fitness (survival and reproductive success) in a long-term study of wild North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) under conditions of both resource limitation and super-abundant food resources. When resources were limited, populations remained stable or declined, and there were strong negative social effects on annual survival and reproductive success. That is, mean fitness was constrained and individuals had lower fitness when other nearby individuals had higher fitness. In contrast, when food resources were super-abundant, populations grew and social constraints on reproductive success were greatly reduced or eliminated. Unlike reproductive success, social constraints on survival were not significantly reduced when food resources were super-abundant. These findings suggest resource-dependent social constraints on a component of fitness, which have important potential implications for evolution and adaptation.

### The selective maintenance of allelic variation under generalized dominance [^ce68f2ec]. G3 (2016). Low credibility.

This feature of selection is not as problematic as it first appears, however. Subsequent studies showed that such unusual fitness sets arose easily when the process of recurrent mutation was incorporated into simulations of selection run over many generations. These sorts of models are paralleled by long-term experimental-evolution studies (e.g.), but they do not solve the problem completely. For example, pointed out that the models predict too much polymorphism, rarely, if ever, generating a monomorphism. In addition, the distributions of mutational fitnesses used in the simulations were often unrealistic (e.g. uniform on [0,1]).

In this paper, we again model recurrent mutation and selection at a single diploid locus, and examine the patterns of genetic variation produced by these models. But, unlike previous work in which the fitnesses of genotypes containing a newly arising mutation were independent (e.g.;), we constrain these fitnesses to be functions of the individual alleles comprising the genotype plus some, usually lesser weighted, interaction term. In using this form of generalized dominance, we are motivated by the fact that gene products often derive from the coding of just one chromosome. Hence, the fitness of A i A j types in the population may be the average of the fitness contribution of each allele (or some value close to this). Moreover, our formulation means that genotypes that share alleles have correlated, not independent, fitnesses. Our approach can be seen, therefore, as an attempt to improve the realism of mutational distributions in these sorts of investigations.

### Evolutionary dynamics of carcinogenesis and why targeted therapy does not work [^20239a8c]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2012). Medium credibility.

All malignant cancers, whether inherited or sporadic, are fundamentally governed by Darwinian dynamics. The process of carcinogenesis requires genetic instability and highly selective local microenvironments, the combination of which promotes somatic evolution. These microenvironmental forces, specifically hypoxia, acidosis and reactive oxygen species, are not only highly selective, but are also able to induce genetic instability. As a result, malignant cancers are dynamically evolving clades of cells living in distinct microhabitats that almost certainly ensure the emergence of therapy-resistant populations. Cytotoxic cancer therapies also impose intense evolutionary selection pressures on the surviving cells and thus increase the evolutionary rate. Importantly, the principles of Darwinian dynamics also embody fundamental principles that can illuminate strategies for the successful management of cancer.

### Evolutionary dynamics of multidrug resistant Salmonella enterica serovar 4, [5], 12: I:-in Australia [^d725f7b8]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Salmonella enterica serovar 4,[5],12:i:- (Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:-) is a monophasic variant of Salmonella Typhimurium that has emerged as a global cause of multidrug resistant salmonellosis. We used Bayesian phylodynamics, genomic epidemiology, and phenotypic characterization to describe the emergence and evolution of Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:- in Australia. We show that the interruption of the genetic region surrounding the phase II flagellin, FljB, causing a monophasic phenotype, represents a stepwise evolutionary event through the accumulation of mobile resistance elements with minimal impairment to bacterial fitness. We identify three lineages with different population dynamics and discrete antimicrobial resistance profiles emerged, likely reflecting differential antimicrobial selection pressures. Two lineages are associated with travel to South-East Asia and the third lineage is endemic to Australia. Moreover antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella 4,[5],12:i- lineages efficiently infected and survived in host phagocytes and epithelial cells without eliciting significant cellular cytotoxicity, suggesting a suppression of host immune response that may facilitate the persistence of Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:-.

### Maternal-offspring interactions: reciprocally coevolving social environments [^52522d65]. The Journal of Heredity (2022). Medium credibility.

Maternal-zygotic co-evolution is one of the best examples of why so many features of adaptations involve and are dependent upon indirect genetic effects. I would argue that there are no aspects of adaptive evolution of complex phenotypes that do not involve maternal indirect genetic effects owing to their critical involvement in the earliest stages of development. Mothers are an ubiquitous, essential component of the capacity of living systems to reproduce. Whether we are considering the reproductive fissioning of a mother cell giving rise to daughter cells in a single celled protist or the more complex, sex-specific multi-cellular reproductive process of a eukaryote, maternal genetic information is an essential feature of the reproductive process.

In all eukaryotes, messenger RNA transcripts from genes in the maternal genome control early offspring development. These maternal messenger RNAs are sequestered nonrandomly in the egg prior to its fertilization and, post-fertilization, they guide early development. Maternal gene products turn on gene expression in the zygote and, at a point in development, called the maternal-zygotic transition, control of embryo development is passed from maternal genes with indirect effects to zygotic genes with direct effects. Many genes have both maternal and zygotic transcripts, but some, like genes biocid in flies and mater in the mouse, are genes with strictly maternal effects acting on the zygotic phenotype. Selection on strictly maternal effect genes depends upon offspring fitness rather than maternal fitness. As a result, death of an offspring caused by a gene in the maternal genome is less effective at causing genetic change than is the death of an offspring caused by a gene with a direct effect in its own genome. As a result, within populations, strictly maternal effect genes tend to be more polymorphic than other genes in the same gene family that have zygotic expression and have similar effects on offspring fitness. The weaker selection on strictly maternal effect genes also results in their having a relatively greater rate of diversification among species. Similar patterns of polymorphism within species and relative divergence among them characterize other genes with indirect effects, such as genes with exclusively sib-social effects and genes whose expression is subject to control by quorum sensing. In this way, maternal effect genes are also similar to genes whose expression is dependent on environmental condition or sex-limited in their expression (e.g. sperm protein genes).

### Experimental evolution reveals natural selection on standing genetic variation [^a256ef40]. Nature Genetics (2009). Medium credibility.

Evolution depends on genetic variation generated by mutation or recombination from standing genetic variation. In sexual organisms, little is known about the molecular population genetics of adaptation and reverse evolution. We carry out 50 generations of experimental reverse evolution in populations of Drosophila melanogaster, previously differentiated by forward evolution, and follow changes in the frequency of SNPs in both arms of the third chromosome. We characterize the effects of sampling finite population sizes and natural selection at the genotype level. We demonstrate that selection has occurred at several loci and further that there is no general loss or gain of allele diversity. We also observe that despite the complete convergence to ancestral levels of adaptation, allele frequencies only show partial return.

### Systematic functional analysis of leishmania protein kinases identifies regulators of differentiation or survival [^b72be291]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Successful infection of the mouse was the most challenging phenotype assessed for the gene deletion mutants, as the cells required the ability to differentiate from promastigote to amastigote, infect and survive within the macrophage, as well as withstand the host immune response. Using cluster analysis we identified 29 genes required across at least two of the differentiation-specific experimental arms and a further 15 only required for infection of the mouse. It is worth noting that the screen does not distinguish between those mutants that have a significant loss of fitness during differentiation itself and those that differentiate normally and then have a loss of fitness growing as amastigotes. Using these data protein kinases were identified that are involved in extrinsic pathways activated in the parasite by external factors (e.g. from macrophage or sand fly) or intrinsic pathways activated by internal factors (e.g. the state of the cell cycle), independent of external factors. For example, CRK4 is required for infection of the mouse but is not required for axenic amastigote growth, suggesting an extrinsic role. On the other hand, MPK10 clusters as important across all three experimental arms implying an intrinsic requirement, supported by research showing it to have stage-specific activity important in promastigote and amastigote differentiation. Careful consideration is required when interpreting the data from enriched metacyclic promastigote cells, where a cluster of protein kinases was identified that have an increased trajectory, yet has a loss of fitness during infection of macrophages or mice. Whilst some mutants may become bona fide metacyclic promastigotes yet not infect macrophages, it is also possible that enrichment occurred for repressors of differentiation mutants, which have made an early transition towards amastigote morphology and alternative life cycle stages such as haptomonads. An example is RDK1, a regulator of amastigote to promastigote differentiation, and a homologue of T. brucei RDK1, which has previously been reported to be involved in differentiation of the bloodstream to procyclic form. Additionally, a mutant that had an impaired proliferation rate as a promastigote would not reach stationary phase by day 7, leading to fewer infective metacyclic forms present in the pooled culture. AMPKα is an example of this, with a consistent loss of fitness throughout the procyclic promastigote stages and metacyclic enrichment, leading to poor representation in macrophage and mouse infections. Phenotyping of selected individual mutants, rather than a pool, will allow more detailed analyses.

### Climate-induced range shifts drive adaptive response via spatio-temporal sieving of alleles [^2b4f79df]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Fig. 1
Conceptual mechanism for an adaptive response during a range shift.

A A shift from glacial to interglacial climate leads to a shift in the overlap of a species' fundamental niche (the range of environmental conditions tolerated by the species; dashed contour) with the period's available environmental space (the range of environmental conditions expressed in a certain area and time; blue ellipse – glacial, pink ellipse - interglacial). B The species' realised niche (striped curve), reflecting this overlap, hence shifts between glacial (top) and interglacial (bottom) periods, constrained by the species' fundamental niche (dashed outline). Importantly, rather than uniform entities described by a singular niche, species may comprise multiple genotypes, each with their own, potentially different, environmental niche (multiple grey-shaded curves). C Climate shifts, e.g. reflecting novel climatic conditions encountered by the species during post-glacial range shifts or expansions, thus act differently on different genotypes; changing their frequencies. D This filters or 'sieves' particular genotypes (alleles) from the pool of standing genetic variation depending on the local environment. E As the species expands out of a refugia (black cross) and across an environmentally-heterogenous landscape, this drives an adaptive response via the spatio-temporal sieving of climate-associated alleles.

The selective sieving of genotypes across space, and local adaptation in general, imply that populations inhabiting different areas of the species range may carry different genotypes and hence respond to changes in climate differently, (Fig. 1). Accordingly, recent studies have demonstrated that adaptive responses to climatic change can be captured by modelling genotype frequencies to environmental gradients, under the premise that each genotype exhibits a range of environmental conditions which it can tolerate. By assuming that contemporary gene-environment associations distributed across space reflect gene-environment associations across time, these studies suggest that proxies for past or future (i.e. unsampled) genotypes can further be predicted;, contingent that future or ancestral-like habitats are present and sampled today. While gene-environment models can incorporate adaptation into evaluations of species' response to climatic change, they do not currently integrate other evolutionary processes such as migration and drift, i.e. as shaped by demography. Integration of these demographic processes is, however, increasingly feasible with modern population genetic approaches, and provides a promising avenue to reconstruct the past neutral and adaptive landscapes of species.

### A multidimensional selective landscape drives adaptive divergence between and within closely related phlox species [^463bd64c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

By characterizing adaptive divergence between species and local adaptation within a species, we can compare and contrast how natural selection generates diversity across these scales. We quantify diversity in leaf morphological and physiological traits across species and find that different axes of diversity predict fitness between species versus within species. These three species of Phlox grow in close geographic proximity, share pollinators, and have similar flower shapes, sizes, colors, and timing. Therefore, their major phenotypic axis of diversity is in vegetative traits such as leaf morphology. Pilosa plants have long narrow leaves whereas amoena plants have shorter, wider leaves. Both species show extensive variation in the overall size and mass of the leaf.

Our results demonstrate that the major leaf trait differences between species strongly predict fitness variation across species in our common garden experiments. Plants with wider, shorter leaves do better in the amoena garden and plants with longer narrower leaves do better in the pilosa garden. It is perhaps unsurprising, that the traits that phenotypically differentiate species also predict fitness differences across the species' habitats. We have highlighted the link between key traits that define and differentiate closely related species, and fitness differences between species in their respective habitats.

This axis of phenotypic variation differentiating species (PC1) does not predict fitness variation within a species; instead, orthogonal trait variation (PC2) predicts within-species relative success. We found evidence of local adaptation across multiple proxies of fitness in pilosa that is predicted by a suite of leaf traits. Importantly, the strongest selection gradients within species are different in strength and direction from those inferred across species.

The observation that adaptation within and between species operates along different axes of selection might seem surprising given the perspective of a continuum of divergence between locally adapted populations and ecologically isolated species. The ecological speciation hypothesis suggests that populations within a species diverge ecologically until those populations evolve sufficient reproductive isolation and become distinct species. This hypothesis has largely been evaluated by documenting a correlation across many pairs of lineages between ecological divergence and genetic divergence or reproductive isolation. Here, we have demonstrated that the process of ecological adaptation is multidimensional: if ecological divergence along one axis leads to reproductive isolation and a signature of local adaptation between lineages, then local adaptation between populations within each lineage may persist or develop along other ecological axes. As has been articulated by others, the process of speciation is complex and not linear; similarly, the role of selection in driving divergence is also complex and multidimensional.

### The emerging conceptual framework of evolutionary developmental biology [^a687e791]. Nature (2002). Excellent credibility.

Over the last twenty years, there has been rapid growth of a new approach to understanding the evolution of organismic form. This evolutionary developmental biology, or 'evo-devo', is focused on the developmental genetic machinery that lies behind embryological phenotypes, which were all that could be studied in the past. Are there any general concepts emerging from this new approach, and if so, how do they impact on the conceptual structure of traditional evolutionary biology? In providing answers to these questions, this review assesses whether evo-devo is merely filling in some missing details, or whether it will cause a large-scale change in our thinking about the evolutionary process.

### Genome-wide congealing and rapid transitions across the speciation continuum during speciation with gene flow [^d18d7324]. The Journal of Heredity (2014). Low credibility.

Our current understanding of speciation is often based on considering a relatively small number of genes, sometimes in isolation of one another. Here, we describe a possible emergent genome process involving the aggregate effect of many genes contributing to the evolution of reproductive isolation across the speciation continuum. When a threshold number of divergently selected mutations of modest to low fitness effects accumulate between populations diverging with gene flow, nonlinear transitions can occur in which levels of adaptive differentiation, linkage disequilibrium, and reproductive isolation dramatically increase. In effect, the genomes of the populations start to "congeal" into distinct entities representing different species. At this stage, reproductive isolation changes from being a characteristic of specific, divergently selected genes to a property of the genome. We examine conditions conducive to such genome-wide congealing (GWC), describe how to empirically test for GWC, and highlight a putative empirical example involving Rhagoletis fruit flies. We conclude with cautious optimism that the models and concepts discussed here, once extended to large numbers of neutral markers, may provide a framework for integrating information from genome scans, selection experiments, quantitative trait loci mapping, association studies, and natural history to develop a deeper understanding of the genomics of speciation.

### The effect of temperature onHybrid fitness [^cdb9b70c]. G3 (2017). Low credibility.

Reproductive barriers hamper gene flow between species. Depending on when in the reproductive cycle barriers occur, they can be classified as prezygotic or postzygotic. Phenotypes that prevent the successful formation of a zygote, such as certain behavioral or gametic incompatibilities, can lead to prezygotic isolation (reviewed in). Conversely, postzygotic isolation manifests as defects in hybrids and includes a range of phenotypic defects such as developmental breakdown and behavioral abnormalities (reviewed in). In its most extreme form, postzygotic isolation results in hybrid inviability (HI).

The evolution of postzygotic isolation is crucial to speciation for at least three reasons. First, even though comparative studies have strongly suggested that prezygotic isolation tends to evolve faster than postzygotic isolation, they are often not strong enough to prevent the fusion of nascent species. Postzygotic barriers are more robust and are often crucial to maintaining separation of species. Second, hybrid defects can also influence the evolution of other barriers to gene flow (reviewed in;). For example, in the process of reinforcement, prezygotic isolation becomes stronger in areas of sympatry due to indirect selection on hybrids with deleterious phenotypes. Finally, studying postzygotic isolation, and other traits that reduce fitness in hybrids, can reveal how much functional divergence has occurred between the genomes of the parent species, furthering our understanding of the processes that initiate and maintain separation of species.

### Social selection and the evolution of maladaptation [^c848fee4]. The Journal of Heredity (2022). Medium credibility.

Evolution by natural selection is often viewed as a process that inevitably leads to adaptation or an increase in population fitness over time. However, maladaptation, an evolved decrease in fitness, may also occur in response to natural selection under some conditions. Social selection, which arises from the effects of social partners on fitness, has been identified as a potential cause of maladaptation, but we lack a general rule identifying when social selection should lead to a decrease in population mean fitness. Here we use a quantitative genetic model to develop such a rule. We show that maladaptation is most likely to occur when social selection is strong relative to nonsocial selection and acts in an opposing direction. In this scenario, the evolution of traits that impose fitness costs on others may outweigh evolved gains in fitness for the individual, leading to a net decrease in population mean fitness. Furthermore, we find that maladaptation may also sometimes occur when phenotypes of interacting individuals negatively covary. We outline the biological situations where maladaptation in response to social selection can be expected, provide both quantitative genetic and phenotypic versions of our derived result, and suggest what empirical work would be needed to test it. We also consider the effect of social selection on inclusive fitness and support previous work showing that inclusive fitness cannot suffer an evolutionary decrease. Taken together, our results show that social selection may decrease population mean fitness when it opposes individual-level selection, even as inclusive fitness increases.
