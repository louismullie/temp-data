## Question

Transverse colon dilation on xray

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret transverse colon dilation on abdominal X-ray, including how to measure it, what thresholds matter, how to distinguish mechanical obstruction from pseudo-obstruction, and how to prioritize next steps in diagnosis and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to accurately measure the transverse colon diameter on plain radiography. Then, I should verify adult and pediatric thresholds that define pathologic dilation. Next, I will consider the clinical context and systemic toxicity to separate toxic megacolon from other causes. After that, I need to distinguish mechanical obstruction from acute colonic pseudo-obstruction using imaging patterns. Finally, I will outline immediate actions, escalation triggers, and special populations, and I will double-check where my initial assumptions might be off and correct them as needed.

> Let me first confirm the measurement technique, because mismeasurement leads to misclassification. On a supine abdominal radiograph, I should measure the transverse colon at its maximal diameter perpendicular to the lumen, typically near the hepatic and splenic flexures, and I need to ensure I am not including haustral folds or extraluminal gas in the measurement, as this can artifactually inflate the caliber [^notfound].

> Now, I should verify adult thresholds that signal danger. A transverse colon diameter greater than 5.5 cm is abnormal and, in the right clinical context of systemic toxicity, supports toxic megacolon; this threshold is consistently cited in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease guidance and is the radiographic component of the definition of toxic megacolon in IBD care pathways [^e45e423d] [^4a4b4143] [^416ee663]. Wait, let me verify the pediatric data; in children with IBD-associated toxic megacolon, a transverse colon diameter of 56 mm or more has 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity, which aligns with the adult 5.5 cm threshold when converted, reinforcing its clinical relevance across ages [^5937049d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the clinical context before labeling this as toxic megacolon. Toxic megacolon requires systemic toxicity such as fever, tachycardia, hypotension, altered mental status, or laboratory evidence of systemic inflammatory response, and the colon must be dilated without a mechanical obstruction; if these are absent, I should reconsider the diagnosis and look for other etiologies of dilation [^4a4b4143] [^416ee663]. I should also remember that in severe colitis, additional plain-film markers of severity include thickened colonic wall, loss of haustrations, and mucosal islands, which correlate with higher risk of nonresponse to medical therapy and need for colectomy, so I need to scan the entire film carefully [^e45e423d].

> Next, I should review how to distinguish mechanical large-bowel obstruction from acute colonic pseudo-obstruction, because management diverges. Mechanical obstruction typically shows a transition point with collapsed distal colon and may show air-fluid levels, whereas pseudo-obstruction shows diffuse colonic dilation without a transition point and with preserved haustral markings; CT is the preferred modality to confirm this distinction when the diagnosis is uncertain on plain film [^c78208f8] [^06f8330f]. But wait, what if the volvulus is in the transverse colon rather than the sigmoid or cecum; transverse colon volvulus is rare and lacks classic sigmoid or cecal volvulus signs, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion when there is disproportionate transverse colon dilation with a cut-off and consider contrast enema or CT to confirm the twist and plan operative management [^e5f71aa4] [^95c3f74b].

> I will now examine immediate actions and escalation triggers. If toxic megacolon is suspected, I should place the patient NPO, start aggressive IV fluids, correct electrolytes, initiate high-dose IV corticosteroids if not contraindicated, and arrange urgent surgical consultation; failure to improve within 24–48 hours or any deterioration warrants emergent total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy due to the high risk of perforation and mortality [^4a4b4143] [^c278c7d5]. If acute colonic pseudo-obstruction is diagnosed, I should optimize supportive care, consider neostigmine in appropriate patients, and reserve colonoscopic decompression for refractory cases or when the cecum exceeds high-risk thresholds, recognizing perforation risks and the need for experienced operators [^c78208f8] [^36ce14ff].

> Let me consider special populations and nuances. In children, I should apply the 56 mm threshold for toxic megacolon in IBD and remember that routine abdominal X-ray is not recommended for functional constipation; AXR is reserved for evaluating mechanical obstruction or colonic distention when considering surgery or when history and exam are unreliable, so I need to avoid over-ordering films in pediatric constipation workups [^5937049d] [^3dd5610f]. In the elderly, large-bowel obstruction from obstructing cancer is more common, so if I see transverse colon dilation with a transition point, I should prioritize CT to localize the lesion and plan between initial colectomy versus endoscopic stenting as a bridge, balancing oncologic and physiologic considerations [^95acead0] [^f50f128c].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought a transverse colon diameter of 6 cm might be the universal threshold for toxic megacolon; let me correct that. The consistently cited threshold is 5.5 cm, and while some case reports describe 6–7 cm or larger diameters, those are anecdotal and should not override guideline-based cutoffs used in IBD and surgical decision-making [^e45e423d] [^4a4b4143] [^416ee663]. I should also double-check that cecal diameter carries different risk in pseudo-obstruction; indeed, cecal diameter greater than 12 cm or duration beyond 6 days increases perforation risk in ACPO, which is a different entity than toxic megacolon and should not be conflated with the transverse colon threshold [^216f7847].

> Finally, I need to ensure my documentation captures the measurement, the exact location of maximal dilation, the presence or absence of a transition point, haustral pattern, air-fluid levels, and any free air, alongside the clinical status and vitals, because these elements drive whether I escalate to surgery, pursue endoscopic decompression, or continue medical management with close monitoring [^c78208f8] [^4a4b4143].

Transverse colon dilation on X-ray is **abnormal when > 5.5 cm** [^e45e423d] and signals a serious condition such as toxic megacolon, volvulus, or pseudo-obstruction [^c78208f8]. Immediate **CT is required** to distinguish mechanical obstruction from pseudo-obstruction and to guide urgent management [^c78208f8] [^4812b4da]. Toxic megacolon is a surgical emergency [^c278c7d5]; if there is no improvement within 24–48 hours or if perforation is suspected, colectomy is indicated [^c278c7d5]. Pseudo-obstruction is managed with supportive care, neostigmine, or colonoscopic decompression if refractory [^ce5986b2] [^36ce14ff]. Volvulus needs urgent surgical detorsion and fixation or resection [^95c3f74b].

---

## Normal transverse colon diameter

The normal transverse colon diameter on plain abdominal radiograph is **≤ 5.5 cm** [^e45e423d]. Values above this are considered dilated and pathological, warranting further evaluation and intervention [^e45e423d].

---

## Causes of transverse colon dilation

Several conditions can cause transverse colon dilation, including:

| **Category** | **Condition** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| Inflammatory | Toxic megacolon | Severe colitis with systemic toxicity and colonic dilation ≥ 5.5 cm [^4a4b4143] [^e45e423d] |
| Mechanical | Colonic volvulus | Twisting of the transverse colon causing obstruction and dilation [^e5f71aa4] [^95c3f74b] |
| Functional | Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome) | Massive colonic dilation without mechanical obstruction, often in critically ill patients [^c78208f8] [^216f7847] |
| Infectious | Clostridioides difficile colitis | Severe infection causing colonic dilation and systemic toxicity [^5a3d872f] [^41a532f4] |
| Neoplastic | Colon cancer | Obstructing tumors causing proximal colonic dilation [^95acead0] [^4812b4da] |

## Clinical significance and implications

Transverse colon dilation on X-ray is a **critical finding** that indicates a potentially life-threatening condition. The clinical significance depends on the underlying cause:

- **Toxic megacolon**: Associated with high mortality and risk of perforation; requires immediate medical and surgical management [^c278c7d5] [^4a4b4143].
- **Colonic volvulus**: Requires urgent surgical intervention to prevent ischemia and perforation [^95c3f74b].
- **Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction**: Can lead to perforation if untreated, especially when cecal diameter exceeds 12 cm [^216f7847] [^0f3915df].
- **Clostridioides difficile colitis**: Severe cases can progress to toxic megacolon and perforation, necessitating aggressive management [^5a3d872f] [^41a532f4].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

When transverse colon dilation is identified on X-ray, **further diagnostic evaluation is essential** to determine the underlying cause:

- **Computed tomography (CT)**: Gold standard to differentiate mechanical obstruction from pseudo-obstruction and identify the cause of dilation [^c78208f8] [^4812b4da].
- **Water-soluble contrast enema**: Useful in diagnosing mechanical obstruction, particularly volvulus, when CT is unavailable [^c78208f8] [^0a618348].
- **Laboratory tests**: Complete blood count, electrolytes, renal function, and inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR) to assess systemic involvement and guide management [^c78208f8].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Toxic megacolon**: Aggressive medical therapy with IV corticosteroids, fluids, and close monitoring. Surgery is indicated if no improvement within 24–48 hours or if complications arise [^c278c7d5] [^4a4b4143].
- **Colonic volvulus**: Urgent surgical detorsion, fixation, or resection of the affected segment [^95c3f74b].
- **Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction**: Conservative management with supportive care, neostigmine for refractory cases, and colonoscopic decompression if medical therapy fails [^ce5986b2] [^36ce14ff].
- **Clostridioides difficile colitis**: Discontinuation of offending antibiotics, metronidazole or vancomycin therapy, and surgical consultation for severe cases [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and complications

The prognosis of transverse colon dilation varies with the underlying cause and timeliness of intervention. Delayed diagnosis and management can lead to **severe complications**, including:

- **Perforation**: High mortality, especially in toxic megacolon and pseudo-obstruction [^c278c7d5] [^0f3915df].
- **Sepsis**: Common in infectious etiologies such as C. difficile colitis [^notfound].
- **Ischemia and necrosis**: Particularly in volvulus and severe colitis [^5732d9a9] [^9eed8569].

---

Transverse colon dilation on X-ray is a **significant abnormality** that requires immediate attention. Accurate diagnosis and prompt management are essential to prevent serious complications and improve patient outcomes.

A case of long diverticular colonic duplication producing acute abdominal pain in a 6-year-old girl is presented. Physical examination showed no signs of acute abdomen at the initial presentation. After a pain-free interval, there was a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain and a large tumor in the lower abdomen was observed. A plain x-ray showed an enormously dilated colonic pouch filled with gas. Excision of the T-shaped duplication and small part of the transverse colon was successful. Because of extensive fibrotic changes in the colon near the opening of duplication, a resection margin of at least 2 cm is recommended.

### Transverse colon volvulus in a 15 year old boy and the review of the literature [^e5f71aa4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Case Presentation

A fifteen year old boy presented with a three day history of left sided abdominal pain, constipation and vomiting to the pediatricians. Over the preceding year he had several episodes of intermittent abdominal pain. There was no other significant past medical history. Examination revealed mild tenderness in the epigastrium and left side of the abdomen with moderate distension. Blood investigations revealed normal full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests, and clotting profile. The C-reactive protein (CRP) was four. An abdominal X-ray (AXR) [Fig. 1] revealed a dilated transverse colon. The distribution of the large bowel dilatation should have raised the possibility of proximal descending colon obstruction. However a computer tomography scan (CT) [Fig. 2] was organised. This revealed dilatation of the proximal transverse colon with a cut-off near the splenic flexure. The appearance was suggestive of a colo-colic intussusception or a volvulus. A surgical review was sought following which a water soluble gastrografin enema was performed for both a therapeutic and diagnostic purpose. This highlighted an obstructive lesion in the proximal descending colon [Fig 3]. No contrast passed beyond this point, and the intended therapeutic benefit was not achieved with the procedure. An emergency laparotomy was performed for large bowel obstruction. Intra operative findings were of a transverse colon volvulus [Fig 4] rotated in a three hundred and sixty degrees clockwise direction. The point of twist was found in left upper quadrant [Fig 5], in keeping with the pre operative imaging. The transverse colon was mobilised, resected at the splenic flexure and just short of the hepatic flexure. A side to side anastomosis was performed for establishing bowel continuity because of significant disparity in the size of the obstructed proximal and collapsed distal colon to the site of the volvulus. A loop defunctioning ileostomy was fashioned.

Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO) — initial evaluation should include focused history, examination, laboratories, and diagnostic imaging with preferred modalities to exclude mechanical obstruction. Recommendation 11 states: Initial evaluation should include a focused history and physical examination, baseline laboratory values, and diagnostic imaging. Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Typical signs and symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, altered bowel function, and dilation of the ascending and transverse colon without evidence of mechanical obstruction on imaging, and routine laboratory testing, such as a basic metabolic panel, should be included during the initial evaluation. For diagnosis, computed tomography or water-soluble contrast enema can reliably distinguish ACPO from a mechanical large-bowel obstruction, and unless there is a high suspicion for a distal obstruction, endoscopy is not typically recommended for diagnostic purposes given the associated risk of perforation in the setting of colon dilation.

### Abdominal X-ray in pediatric acute severe colitis and radiographic predictors of response to intravenous steroids [^16156b09]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Abdominal x-ray (AXR) can identify complications in acute severe colitis (ASC) and may assist in selecting high-risk children for early aggressive treatment. We aimed to describe AXR findings in pediatric ASC and to explore radiological predictors of response to intravenous corticosteroid (IVCS) therapy.

Methods

A total of 56 children with ASC were included in a multicenter, retrospective 1-year cohort study (41% boys, mean age 12.1 ± 4.2). Radiographs of responders to IVCS and those requiring second-line salvage therapy by discharge were analyzed independently by 2 blinded radiologists.

Results

A total of 33 responders to IVCS were compared with 23 nonresponders. The day-3 Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) score was significantly higher in nonresponders (63 ± 16 vs 46 ± 21, P = 0.001). The mean transverse colon luminal diameter was 30 ± 16 mm in responders and 38 ± 16 mm in nonresponders (P = 0.94). The upper range of transverse colonic diameter in children < 12 years was ∼40 mm, whereas in older children it was 60 mm as accepted in adults. Ulcerations and megacolon seen on AXR were associated with nonresponse to IVCS (P = 0.006 and 0.064, respectively).

Conclusions

The presence of mucosal ulcerations and megacolon on AXR could be considered in the risk stratification of children with ASC for early aggressive treatment, together with the previously known day-3 and day-5 Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index scores, albumin, and C-reactive protein.

### Toxic megacolon in children with inflammatory bowel disease: clinical and radiographic characteristics [^5937049d]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Toxic megacolon (TMC) denotes a rare clinical syndrome accompanied by colonic dilatation, and is a serious complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study assessed the clinical and radiologic characteristics of TMC in children with IBD.

Methods

A systematic search identified patients with IBD-associated TMC and matched them by age to controls with ulcerative colitis without evidence of TMC. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared with conditional logistic regression. Abdominal X-rays were interpreted by two blinded radiologists and findings were compared with controls.

Results

Ten children with TMC (median age 12.6 [7.3–15.5] yr) were matched with 20 controls (median age 12.8 [6.8–15.2] yr). Altered level of consciousness and hypotension were rare in children with TMC. Fever (P = 0.005), tachycardia (P = 0.0001), dehydration (P = 0.01), and electrolyte abnormalities (P = 0.0002) were more common in children with TMC than controls. Air-fluid levels (P = 0.005), intestinal thickening (P = 0.006), and abnormal colonic haustra (P = 0.012) were more commonly seen on X-rays of TMC cases. Transverse colon luminal diameter ≥ 56 mm was strongly suggestive of TMC (sensitivity 90%, specificity 90%, area under the ROC curve 0.91). No child with TMC died and 70% required colectomy during admission. Two of the three with intact colons at discharge required second-line therapy during the subsequent year.

Conclusions

Colonic dilatation ≥ 56 mm in children with IBD strongly suggests TMC, if clinical signs are present. Mental alteration and hypotension may be less common in children than in adults. TMC in children with IBD is associated with poor outcome, with a high rate of corticosteroid failure.

### The surgical treatment of toxic megacolon in Hirschsprung disease [^e529c082]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Enterocolitis remains the most significant cause of morbidity and mortality in Hirschsprung disease (HD). It could progress into toxic megacolon (TM)-acute dilatation of the colon as accompanying toxic complication of Hirschsprung enterocolitis. It is a devastating complication, especially in infants with so far undiagnosed HD.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of medical records of 4 infants with TM was performed. The diagnosis TM was determined on the basis of clinical information (abdominal pain or tenderness, abdominal distension, diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and constipation), plain x-rays of the abdomen (segmental or total colonic dilation), and the presence of such criteria (fever, high heart rate, increased white blood cell count, C reactive protein, anemia, dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, hypotension). Surgical management and outcome was evaluated by retrospective chart review.

Results

The median duration of symptoms characteristic for TM was 3 days. Toxic megacolon was seen as the first manifestation of previously unknown HD in 3 patients; in 1 newborn, the contrast radiograph was suggestive of HD. In all patients, conservative treatment was failed. Three patients were treated with surgical decompression and ileostomy only. In all these cases, severe complications occurred, consequently 2 of them died. In 1 patient, a resection of the transverse dilated colon additionally was performed. This patient had no complications in postoperative period and survived.

Conclusions

Because of the high mortality in patients with TM that were treated medically or with colonic decompression, a resection of massively distended part of the colon should be performed.

A prolonged post operative ileus developed. This was partially attributed to initial difficulty in adequate pain control with the use of opiate analgesia. A gradually rising CRP to four hundred and nine over the course of a week led to a CT scan being performed. This demonstrated no free fluid or evidence of an anastomotic leak. With the development of sepsis of unknown origin, a decision was taken for a further re-look laparotomy eight days after the initial laparotomy. There was no free fluid in the abdominal cavity and the anastomosis was intact. Discharge from hospital was twenty three days following admission.

### Effect of polyethylene glycol electrolyte balanced solution on patients with acute colonic pseudo obstruction after resolution of colonic dilation: a prospective, randomised, placebo controlled trial [^fa182142]. Gut (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Conservative therapy for patients with acute colonic pseudo obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome) may be successful initially but relapses are common. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) electrolyte balanced solution on the relapse rate of the syndrome after initial resolution with neostigmine or endoscopic decompression.

Patients and Methods

The study was performed on 30 consecutive patients who presented with abdominal distension and radiographic evidence of colonic dilation, with a caecal diameter ≥ 10 cm, that resolved conservatively. Patients then were randomised to receive daily 29.5 g of PEG (n = 15) or similar placebo (n = 15). Patients were monitored daily for a seven day period for stool and flatus evacuations, and colonic diameter on abdominal radiographs. Administration of the test solutions and assessment of patient symptoms and x rays were performed in a blinded fashion. A caecal diameter ≥ 8 cm with a concomitant ≥ 10% increase after initial successful therapeutic intervention was considered as a relapse and these patients, after a second therapeutic intervention, were eligible to receive open label PEG.

Results

Twenty five patients received neostigmine as the initial therapeutic intervention which resulted in resolution of colonic dilation in 88% of cases. Eight patients had successful endoscopic decompression. Five (33.3%) patients in the placebo group had recurrent caecal dilation compared with none in the PEG group (p = 0.04). Therapy with PEG resulted in a significant increase in stool and flatus evacuations (p = 0.001 and 0.032, respectively) as well as in a significant decrease in the diameter of caecum, ascending and transverse colon, and abdominal circumference (p = 0.017, 0.018, 0.014, and 0.008, respectively).

Conclusions

Administration of PEG in patients with Ogilvie's syndrome after initial resolution of colonic dilation may increase the sustained response rate after initial therapeutic intervention.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for small bowel obstruction, more specifically with respect to abdominal CT, WSES 2018 guidelines recommend to obtain a follow-up abdominal X-ray after 24 hours in patients who do not undergo immediate surgery. If the contrast has reached the colon, this is indicative for resolution of the bowel obstruction.

### Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction [^8a73fe4c]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2022). Medium credibility.

Case Summary

A 33-year-old man with a history of chronic alcohol use, generalized anxiety disorder, and hypertension presented to the emergency department after a syncopal event. He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit for alcohol withdrawal, requiring intubation and sedation. On hospital day 7, abdominal x-ray image demonstrated a dilated cecum to 12cm, transverse colon dilation to 7cm, and decompressed distal colon (Fig. 1). CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis confirmed dilation of the cecum and ascending and transverse colons (Fig. 2). Colonoscopy showed no evidence of distal obstruction, but colonic distension persisted, and he subsequently underwent cecal decompression with an open "blow-hole" cecostomy fully matured at skin level via a small right lower quadrant incision. The nasogastric tube was removed on postoperative day 2, and his diet was slowly advanced. Abdominal x-ray image on postoperative day 5 demonstrated no colonic dilation. He was discharged home on postoperative day 7. The patient re-presented to the hospital 3 months later with cecostomy prolapse. He underwent cecostomy takedown with ileocecectomy via circumstomal incision. He was discharged home on postoperative day 2.

### Pancolitis complicated by toxic megacolon in an immunocompetent host [^ec6ab211]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Treatment

He received a single dose of intravenous amoxicillin, metronidazole and gentamicin as empiric therapy, along with intravenous crystalloids to correct his hydration status and symptomatic treatment for his fever, nausea and abdominal pain. Intravenous clarithromycin 500 mg two times a day was initiated as empiric treatment for severe Campylobacter enteritis but no significant clinical improvement was observed after 6 days. Antibiotics were changed to intravenous ertapenem 1 g once a day, but this too did not bring about significant improvement and was stopped after 7 days.

His temperature spiked on day 8 of admission (38.2°C). Repeat abdominal X-ray was suggestive of colitis and dilation in the transverse colon, suspicious of TM. A subsequent CT abdomen-pelvis showed a dilation of 7 cm of the transverse colon. This, combined with signs of systemic toxicity, confirmed the diagnosis of TM. He was immediately kept nil by mouth for a day. A significant drop in CRP was observed over 24 hours from 218.3 mg/L to 128.6 mg/L. Considering this improvement, the surgical team deferred surgical intervention and restarted his feed.

His temperature spiked again on day 16 of admission and he developed excruciating left-sided abdominal pain. CT abdomen-pelvis on the 16th day showed a segmental bowel loop dilation of 9.3 cm (see figure 2). Medical therapy was declared to have failed, and a subtotal colectomy with end ileostomy was planned as a fast-track elective procedure. He was kept on bowel rest and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) was initiated through a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) with a 6 g nitrogen bag at 35 mL/hour. However, a significant improvement in clinical and biochemical parameters (CRP dropped from 248.3 mg/L to 87.2 mg/L) was observed over the next 72 hours. CT abdomen-pelvis showed a reduction in the size of bowel segments for the first time since admission (transverse colon calibre 6.2 cm).

### Symptoms and diagnostic criteria of acquired megacolon-a systematic literature review [^4c3eb1dc]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Physical dimensions

A variety of studies recorded colonic diameters of patients with AMC or provided dimensions used to diagnose its presence (Table 3). Recent contributions on this topic emphasise colonic diameter as a defining feature. Earlier studies referred to length. Twelve studies used barium enema or similar studies. Taylor et al. (1980) was the only study to use abdominal X-rays.

a amongst patients with volvulus

Using 50 double contrast barium enema studies, Preston et al. (1985) concluded a normal diameter of the rectosigmoid at the pelvic brim was less than 6.5 cm. Six studies of this review used this criterion to diagnose AMC. The three studies, Preston et al. (1985), Iantorno et al. (2007) and Koch et al. (1993) calculated mean sigmoid diameters of 10+/− 3.5 cm, 10+/− 2 cm and 10 cm respectively for sigmoid-inclusive AMC.

The presence of colonic reduplications, angulations or loops seen during barium studies or enema-filled sigmoid loops rising above the iliac crests was described by Kantor (1924). Taylor et al. (1980) diagnosed AMC by an increased colonic diameter on radiological imaging and chronic constipation. Ryan (1982) described the recurrence of both colonic dilatation and symptoms in patients who had undergone segmental colectomy for megacolon volvulus of previously non-dilated segments.

Kantor (1924) demonstrated the limitations of simple X-ray techniques, with individual colonic dimensions varying significantly with serial imaging amongst individuals.

### Clostridioides difficile infection in children: recent updates on epidemiology, diagnosis, therapy [^5a3d872f]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical

C. difficile causes a wide spectrum of disease severity, ranging from asymptomatic carriage all the way to life threatening colitis. Diarrhea is thought to primarily result from toxin-mediated intestinal epithelial cytotoxicity and inflammation. Most symptomatic children will have mild-to-moderate diarrhea. Severe CDI, defined by leukocytosis (≥ 15, 000 cells/mm 3) or renal impairment (serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL) in adults, is poorly defined in children, necessitating clinical judgement to diagnose. Severe complications of CDI in children include development of pseudomembranous colitis, pneumatosis intestinalis, toxic megacolon, perforation, peritonitis, and shock with multisystem failure. Severe CDI is less common in children than adults, but does occur, and up to 8% of will develop severe disease. By other estimates, up to 0.1% to 1.2% may require colectomy, and all-cause mortality in children with CDI is about 2% to 4%. Imaging and endoscopic findings of CDI are nonspecific. Disease in children is often cecocolonic or colonic. In severe cases, abdominal imaging may show colonic wall thickening, colonic dilation or free air in the case of perforation (Fig 2).

### Megacolon: constipation or volvulus? [^3bd93585]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2006). Low credibility.

Pediatric abdominal complaints are common presentations in emergency departments, and emergency physicians are challenged every day with a vast array of gastrointestinal disorders. Differentiating the child with a benign abdominal process from the child with a more serious condition can be difficult. We report a case of massive dilatation of the colon due to fecal impaction. Means for distinguishing constipation from alternative diagnoses are discussed.

There is limited evidence with regard to colon dysmotility in critical illness. During sepsis, the colon has its distinct characteristics in comparison with the small bowel, as different types of leukocyte infiltrate, and varying levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 are expressed. Although the amplitude and frequency of both colon and small intestine contraction are suppressed during endotoxin injection (or cecal ligation and puncture), there may be an anatomical explanation for these pathophysiological differences.

Although constipation represents the most common clinical manifestation of colon dysmotility in critically ill patients, colon dysmotility in these patients may rarely present in the form of acute pseudo-obstruction. Acute pseudo-obstruction (ACPO), also referred to as Ogilvie's syndrome, is defined as a clinical syndrome characterized by impairment of intestinal propulsion, which may bear a resemblance to intestinal obstruction, in the absence of a mechanical cause. Acute intestinal pseudo-obstruction may also involve the small intestine and most frequently occurs in patients with stroke, myocardial infarction, peritonitis, sepsis, and postoperatively in orthopedic surgery, cesarean section, cardiovascular or lung surgery. The pathophysiology underlying ACPO remains rather unclear, with the prevailing hypothesis being an imbalance in colonic autonomic innervation in the setting of other predisposing factors. The clinical hallmark of ACPO is the presence of dilation of the colon on a plain radiograph. The dilation favorably involves the cecum and the ascending and transverse colon, although the left colon, including the rectum, may also be affected. The prognosis of acute intestinal pseudo-obstruction varies with the underlying clinical condition.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of Clostridioides difficile infection [^ef33ba07]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2021). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection — radiologic evaluation and CT performance: Radiologic evaluation has limited utility in the setting of CDI. Grade of recommendation: Weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C. The ability for CT scanning to predict the need for surgical intervention is poor (sensitivity 52%–85% and specificity 48%–92%), and in fact, about 40% of patients with CDI have a normal CT scan without radiographic evidence of colitis. A retrospective review of 176 hospitalized patients with CDI found abnormal wall thickening, pancolitis, and bowel dilation on CT associated with colectomy, with wall thickening an independent predictor of 30-day mortality; however, these findings had a low predictive value of 50%.

### Beyond broken spines-what the radiologist needs to know about late complications of spinal cord injury [^6c5bef64]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Fig. 9
a Abdominal radiograph of a 20-year-old female with SCI and abdominal pain shows a dilated ascending and transverse colon (white line) with loss of colonic haustrations (white arrowheads) and pseudo-poly formation of the colonic mucosa (black arrow), concerning for toxic mega colon. b The corresponding coronal CT images confirm radiographic findings of bowel dilatation (white line), bowel wall thickening and oedema (white arrow) and mucosal pseudo-polyps (black arrow) typically associated with toxic megacolon

An unusual complication of SCI is superior mesenteric artery syndrome. This occurs more commonly in patients with cervical SCI. Loss of mesenteric fat occurs in the setting of significant or rapid weight loss, allowing the duodenum to be compressed between the superior mesenteric artery and the spine, leading to symptoms of small bowel or gastric obstruction (Fig. 10). Marked distention of the stomach can occur and, if not appreciated, can progress to ischaemia.

### Congenital segmental dilatation of the colon in a newborn: a radiologic perspective of an unusual entity [^9690d15c]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

A newborn with congenital segmental dilatation of the intestine affecting the colon is presented. This rare condition, unrelated to Hirschsprung's disease, may affect any portion of the bowel and is characterized by focal dilatation of a segment of bowel flanked by normal proximal and distal bowel. While reported in the surgical literature, congenital segmental dilatation of the intestine has not been reported in the pediatric radiology literature even though pediatric radiologists may be the first to encounter imaging suggesting the diagnosis. We therefore present the characteristic imaging findings, including abdominal radiographs and images from a contrast enema, and discuss the clinical presentation, pathology findings, associations, treatment, and prognosis of congenital segmental dilatation of the intestine to increase awareness of this unusual diagnosis.

2) Toxic megacolon

Statement 5.2.1

In patients presenting with toxic megacolon complicated by perforation, massive bleeding (unstable patients), clinical deterioration, and signs of shock, surgery is mandatory (QoE A).

Statement 5.2.2

In patients presenting with toxic megacolon, showing no clinical improvement and biological signs of deterioration after 24–48 h of medical treatment, surgery is mandatory (QoE B).

Recommendation

We recommend not delaying surgery in critically ill patients presenting with toxic megacolon (strong recommendation based on moderate -level evidence 1C).

Summary of evidence and discussion

Toxic megacolon is a rare but severe and potentially fatal complication of colonic inflammation.

Its main characteristics are as follows:
Radiographic evidence of total or segmental colonic distention of > 6 cm
Presence of systemic toxicity
Inflammatory (or infectious) etiology.

In order to avoid colectomy, medical treatment should be carried out aggressively and in a timely fashion (steroids, fluids, transfusions, etc.) and the correct timing for surgery is still controversial. In fact, while some evidence suggests that the initial medical treatment obviates the need for surgery in about 50% of patients, there is a significant body of literature that highlights how a delay in surgical intervention carries the risk of colonic perforation and abdominal compartment syndrome, thus increasing the mortality rate. For these reasons, management of toxic megacolon requires coordination between medical and surgical services with aggressive attempts at medical therapy and early surgical intervention in the absence of improvement, development of complications, or deterioration. Frequent re-evaluations must be performed until the patient's condition has clearly improved or until there is evidence of deterioration, in which case urgent surgery is indicated. Persistent fever after 48–72 h of steroid therapy should raise the possibility of local perforation or abscess. Free perforation, massive hemorrhage, increasing transfusion requirements, increasing signs of toxicity, and progression of colonic dilatation are indications for an urgent operation.

Unlike colonic obstruction, in which cecal dilation with perforation is a concern, the transverse colon is the area of greatest concern in toxic megacolon. Perforation in patients with toxic megacolon is associated with a high mortality rate (27–57%), regardless of whether the perforation is contained or free.

3) Uncontrolled gastrointestinal bleeding

Statement 5.3.1

Pre-operative localization of the bleeding site, with the aim of excluding an upper gastrointestinal or an anorectal bleeding will allow better planning of the surgical strategy (QoE C).

Investigations

On presentation, he had high inflammatory markers (white blood cell count 16.0 × 10 9 /L and C-reactive protein 429.8 mg/L), an electrolyte imbalance (Na 124 mmol/L), low creatinine (56 µmol/L) and low albumin (28 g/L). An abdominal X-ray revealed a dilated transverse and descending colon with no air-fluid levels. Chest X-ray showed normal lung fields with no gas under the diaphragm. CT abdomen-pelvis was suggestive of modest pancolitis with no complicating features. Faeces culture grew C. jejuni. Other common pathogens such as Shigella, Salmonella and Escherichia coli O157 were excluded using various faeces culture media. Stool microscopy excluded Entamoeba. Combined enzyme immunoassays excluded Giardia and Cryptosporidium antigens in stool. Clostridium difficile was also excluded on three consecutive stool enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. He tested negative for HIV. Both blood and urine cultures showed no bacterial growth after 48 hours of incubation.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on the role of endoscopy in the management of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction and colonic volvulus [^36ce14ff]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO) — endoscopic decompression indications, technique, outcomes, and safety are as follows: Colonoscopic decompression has been reserved for patients with persistent and marked colonic dilatation who have failed to respond to conservative measures, those refractory to medical management, or in whom neostigmine is contraindicated, and younger age at the time of diagnosis, abdominal distention as a chief complaint, and greater cecal diameter have been identified as independently associated with poor response to medical treatment. Based on available data, initial and sustained colonic decompression from colonoscopy has been noted in up to 95% of patients. The procedure should be performed by an experienced endoscopist using water infusion and minimal to no insufflation of carbon dioxide rather than air. Sedation with benzodiazepines or other non-narcotic medication is preferred, because narcotics potentiate colonic atony. The colon should also be unprepped, and an attempt should be made to reach at least the distal transverse colon, after which extensive suctioning of air is recommended. There is an approximately 2% risk of perforation with endoscopic decompression and 1% risk of mortality. Repeat colonoscopy is fairly commonplace given 40% risk of recurrence, especially in patients in whom a decompression tube is not placed. It is important to exclude perforation before performing endoscopic decompression with a plain abdominal x-ray performed within several hours before the procedure, especially in those patients with fever, leukocytosis, or worsening abdominal pain.

### Segmental colonic dilation is associated with premature termination of high-amplitude propagating contractions in children with intractable functional constipation [^0b7a8a1b]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Colonic dilation is common in children with intractable functional constipation (FC). Our aim was to describe the association between segmental colonic dilation and colonic dysmotility in children with FC.

Methods

We performed a retrospective study on 30 children with intractable FC (according to the Rome III criteria) who had undergone colonic manometry and contrast enema within a 12-month time period. Colonic diameter was measured at 5 cm intervals from the anal verge up to the splenic flexure. Moreover, the distance between the lateral margins of the pedicles of vertebra L2 was measured to provide a ratio (colonic diameter or length/distance between the lateral margins; "standardized colon size" [SCS]). All manometry recordings were visually inspected for the presence of high-amplitude propagating contractions (HAPCs); a parameter for colonic motility integrity. The intracolonic location of the manometry catheter sensors was assessed using an abdominal X-ray.

Key Results

Colonic segments with HAPCs had a significantly smaller median diameter than colonic segments without HAPCs (4.08 cm vs 5.48 cm, P < .001; SCS 1.14 vs 1.66, P = 0.001). Children with prematurely terminating HAPCs had significantly larger SCS ratios for colonic diameter than children with fully propagating HAPCs (P = 0.008). SCS ratios for the length of the rectosigmoid and the descending colon and the SCS ratio for sigmoid colon diameter were significantly larger in children with FC compared to a previously described normative population (P < .0001, P < .0001 and P = 0.0007 respectively).

Conclusions & Inferences

Segmental colonic dilation was associated with prematurely terminating HAPCs and may be a useful indicator of colonic dysmotility.

### Operative management of acute abdomen after bariatric surgery in the emergency setting: the OBA guidelines [^bfa1a9e1]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

The radiation exposure of a CT scan is a major concern and the risks and benefits should be evaluated. The absolute risks of fetal effects, are small at doses of 100 mGy and negligible at doses of less than 50 mGy. CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis rarely exceed 25 mGy. Because the dose from a single-acquisition CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis poses a small risk to fetal health, CT may be appropriate depending on the clinical situation. However, an attempt should be made to perform this test with the lowest dose possible. The risks associated with radiation exposure of the conceptus during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy are reduced and also should be considered.

In pregnant LRYGB patients, the evaluation of the CT scan by a radiologist experienced in bariatric surgical procedures and by a bariatric surgeon is advised to improve the diagnostic accuracy in detecting IH. Signs on CT that suggest an IH depend on the location. Clustering and crowding of dilated small-bowel loops and congestion may be seen in most of the cases.

The most distinct radiological finding in patients with IH is the "whirlpool sign" that is the swirled appearance of the mesenteric vessels. When the herniated bowel passes through the transverse mesocolon defect, it is located behind the stomach remnant and may produce a mass effect on its posterior wall. If the herniated bowel passes through the jejuno-jejunostomy defect, it is pressed against the abdominal wall, causing central displacement of the colon, with no overlying omental fat. In cases of a Petersen-type hernia, the radiologic diagnosis can be difficult and the only clue may be engorgement and crowding of the mesenteric vessels and evidence of small-bowel obstruction.

Q.4: WHAT IS THE ROLE OF ENDOSCOPY IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF LONG-TERM COMPLICATIONS FOLLOWING BARIATRIC SURGERY IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING?

Statement 4.1

After contrast-enhanced computed tomography with oral contrast administration, the endoscopic evaluation is the first option to be considered for the diagnosis and management of leaks and fistulae related to bariatric surgery in stable patients (QoE: moderate).

Statement 4.2

The endoscopic evaluation should be performed by an expert endoscopist aware of the new anatomy resulting from different surgical bariatric procedures (QoE: moderate).

Statement 4.3

The endoscopic management of leaks and fistulae related to bariatric surgery in stable patients is effective and safe when performed in expert centers (QoE: moderate).

Investigations

All laboratory results were normal except for leucocytosis on complete blood count, which showed a white blood cell count of 12.6 k/uL. Abdominal X-ray showed at least three radiopaque foreign bodies in the abdomen, including a discoid foreign body in the left lower quadrant and two round foreign bodies in the right lower quadrant as before, as well as a non-specific bowel gas pattern with a focally dilated loop of bowel in the upper abdomen (figure 1). He underwent a CT of the abdomen/pelvis that showed thickened small bowel and transverse colon with perienteric fat stranding consistent with an infectious process.

### Bowel obstruction: a narrative review for all physicians [^0a618348]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Water-soluble contrast administration X-ray

A water-soluble contrast enema has 96% sensitivity and 98% specificity in diagnosing large bowel obstruction but cannot distinguish different large bowel obstruction causes.

A small bowel follow-through with water-soluble contrast is widely used in patients for adhesive small bowel obstruction non-operative management. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have established the utility of water-soluble contrast agents in the diagnostic work-up of adhesive small bowel obstruction. If the contrast has not reached the colon on an abdominal X-ray 24 h after administration, then this is highly indicative of non-operative management failure. Multiple studies have shown that the use of water-soluble contrast agents accurately predicts the need for surgery with an active therapeutic role.

The administration of water-soluble contrast agents in adhesive small bowel obstruction is safe in terms of morbidity and mortality, but adverse effects due to their use have been reported. Potential life-threatening complications are aspiration pneumonia and pulmonary edema. To avoid these complications, the contrast medium should be administered when the stomach has been adequately decompressed through a nasogastric tube. Another potential adverse effect is that water-soluble contrast agents, because of higher osmolarity, may further dehydrate a patient with small bowel obstruction, shifting fluids into bowel lumen; in some children and elderly adults, the loss of plasma fluid may be sufficient to cause a shock-like state.

The contrast medium may be administered on the dosage of 50–150 ml, either orally or via nasogastric tube, and can be given both at immediate admission and after an attempt of initial traditional conservative treatment of 48 h. The practice of giving water-soluble contrast at 48 h may reduce both the risk of aspiration pneumonia and of dehydration because the patient should have been adequately rehydrated. In this situation, the contrast material can be diluted with water.

Rare anaphylactoid reactions following the use of oral contrast media have been reported.

Caution in their administration may be warranted in patients at high risk of gastropathy.

Ultrasound

Small bowel obstruction can be diagnosed with ultrasound if there are > 2.5-cm dilated loops of the bowel that are proximal to collapsed loops of bowel and if there is decreased or absent peristalsis activity. Using ultrasound for small bowel obstruction diagnosis has 90% sensitivity and 96% specificity.

Visualization of large bowel obstruction with ultrasound is as good as computed tomography. Computed tomography is clearly superior to ultrasound in terms of the etiologic definition for both small bowel obstruction and large bowel obstruction. Ultrasound performs better than planar abdominal X-ray in large bowel obstruction.

### CT of acute abdomen in the elderly [^95acead0]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

The particularities of the elderly in acute pathologies encountered in the general population

Bowel obstruction

Bowel obstruction is the most common cause of emergency surgery in the elderly. While Small Bowel Obstructions (SBO) are far more common than Large Bowel Obstructions (LBO) in the general population, older patients proportionally exhibit a significantly higher number of LBOs, particularly obstructive colorectal cancer (Table 3). Recent studies indicate that the prevalence of emergency surgery for colorectal cancer increases from 11% in patients under 65 to 29% in those over 85.

LBO due to colon cancer

Most acutely obstructive colon cancers occur on the left side, more commonly in the sigmoid colon, because of its narrow luminal diameter. CT findings include asymmetric and short-segment colonic wall thickening or an enhancing soft-tissue mass centered in the colon that narrows the colonic lumen with or without findings of ischemia and perforation (Fig. 6). Obstructing colon cancers often exhibit a shouldering appearance and may be large enough to have central necrosis or, in rare cases, air may be present within the mass, resembling an abscess. Recognition of proximal colonic dilatation aids in identifying the transition point at the tumor site; however, spasm at the splenic flexure in a normal colon can mimic a fixed narrowing. Dilatation of the ascending and transverse colon with distal collapse can be observed in both LBO and chronic colonic pseudo-obstruction. The accurate assessment of obstructive colon cancer is of importance since different options (Hartmann's procedure, resection with or without primary anastomosis, decompression with proximal colostomy, tube decompression or endoscopic colic stenting) are available for its treatment, depending on the CT results and on the age of the patient. It has been demonstrated in a multicentric national cohort, including 3 groups of patients (< 75 years, 75–84 years, and ≥ 85 years) that the oldest patients had higher morbidity with lower survival.

### Fecal impaction: a cause of isolated small bowel dilatation on abdominal radiographs [^cea75153]. European Journal of Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess the frequency of isolated small bowel dilatation on abdominal radiographs in patients with colonic fecal impaction and also to elucidate the cause of this finding.

Methods

A computerized search of radiology files revealed 515 patients with colonic fecal impaction on abdominal radiographs. The radiologic reports described isolated small bowel dilatation not related to other known causes of ileus or obstruction in 18 (3.5%) of the 515 patients. The films were reviewed to determine the distribution of fecal impaction and the degree and extent of small bowel dilatation. In 16 cases, medical records were reviewed to determine the clinical presentation, treatment, and course. Finally, follow-up radiographs were reviewed in four cases to determine the response to treatment of the impaction.

Results

All 16 patients with available medical records had abdominal symptoms. The average diameter of the dilated small bowel on abdominal radiographs was 3.7 cm. Fourteen patients (78%) had a diffuse colonic fecal impaction (nine) or a predominantly right-sided fecal impaction (five) that involved the cecum, and the remaining four (22%) had a left-sided colonic fecal impaction. All 12 patients with clinical follow-up had resolution of symptoms and all four with follow-up radiographs had resolution of small bowel dilatation after treatment of the underlying impaction.

Conclusion

Fecal impaction should be considered in the differential diagnosis of small bowel dilatation on abdominal radiographs, as treatment of the underlying impaction usually produces a dramatic clinical response with resolution of the small bowel dilatation on follow-up radiographs.

### Rectosigmoid gallstone coleus: a rare emergency presentation [^186e90ef]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

An elderly woman presented with abdominal pain and vomiting, was known to have gallstones. A CT scan was arranged identifying gallstone ileus and cholecystitis. Ensuing sepsis precipitated fast atrial fibrillation delaying the planned laparotomy. Her symptoms subsequently resolved with conservative management. Ten days following admission her abdomen became distended. A repeat CT scan showed large bowel dilation with intramural air suggestive of obstruction and bowel ischaemia. Emergency laparotomy was performed identifying a large 23 mm gallstone impacted at the rectosigmoid junction (gallstone coleus). The stone was milked back to the transverse colon where it was retrieved and a transverse loop colostomy was formed. Gallstone ileus is rare; gallstone coleus is even rarer. On review of the published literature both entities have not been seen in the same patient during the same admission or indeed caused by the same gallstone.

Redundant colon, also referred to as "dolichocolon", is an anatomical variant associated with elongation and redundancy thought to be associated with constipation, abdominal pain, and distention. 1,2 Diagnosis requires radiological visualization of the non-dilated colon in situ via barium enema or abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT). Colonic redundancy is based on 3 criteria: sigmoid loop displaced cranially relative to the iliac crests (type 1); transverse colon caudal to the iliac crests (type 2); and redundant loops at the hepatic or splenic flexure (type 3). 2 Rarely, dolichocolon may meet all 3 criteria. 2.

### Transverse colon volvulus in a 15 year old boy and the review of the literature [^21c95e62]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion transverse colon volvulus is rare, and further more so in the pediatric group. Diagnosis can be challenging and the effective management remains controversial. Many surgeons may never have seen a single case of transverse colon volvulus, and it therefore may not be considered in the differential diagnosis of recurrent intermittent abdominal pain or acute intestinal obstruction. This case highlights that even following repeat biopsies, histology may be normal and hence no identifiable cause to the disease pathology is revealed. Hence this can further complicate the management process in an already unusual and rare case.

### Transverse colon volvulus following normal delivery: report of a rare case and review of the world literature [^72dce32f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Investigations

An abdominal ultrasound scan was first conducted, revealing that the uterus was anterior (112 × 101 × 92 mm), full shape, and had a smooth outline. The internal echo of the myometrium was not uniform, and the endometrium was centered with an uneven echo (approximately 8 mm). A free liquid dark area was also found in the uterine rectal fossa (approximately 22 mm). Next, a whole abdomen CT scan was performed immediately after treatment with antispasmodics. The CT scan results showed an increased uterine volume with a flocculent high-density film, swirling changes in the mesenteric blood vessels, edema and thickening of the small intestine wall, and partial intestinal dilation and gas accumulation. There was also evidence of seroperitoneum and pelvic cavity effusion (Fig. 1 A-C). The results of the blood examination showed mildly abnormal serum biochemical indices (GGT 10U/L, AST:47.0U/L, Urea 10.02mmol/L, Scr 252.7ummol/L, UA 406umol/L). The blood cell routine examination also showed significant abnormalities, with a significantly elevated white blood cell count (WBC 20.3* 10^9/L, NEU% 81.3%, NEU 16.5*10^9/L) and an elevated CRP (169.75 mg/L). There were no abnormalities in the results of the PCT, blood electrolytes, coagulation function, or amylase examinations.

Fig. 3
Contrast-Enhanced Abdominal CT (November 20, 2024)

General surgery consultation was invited, Emergency general surgery consultation identified three critical red flags: Inflammatory indicators increase progressively; CT evidence of non-perfused bowel (absence of mural enhancement); Failure of conservative therapy despite 48-hour intensive monitoring. After general surgery consultation and multidisciplinary evaluation, surgical intervention was determined to be necessary. The patient was transferred to the general surgery ward and underwent exploratory laparotomy on November 20, 2024. Upon initial entry into the abdominal cavity, no inflammatory reaction, effusion, or pus was observed. However, upon retracting the omentum superiorly, segmental necrosis of the splenic flexure of the transverse colon was identified, along with surrounding exudate, as well as dilated and swollen ileum and ascending colon (Fig. 4). Subsequently, a necrotic colon resection with proximal colostomy was performed. After the operation, the patient was transferred to the ICU due to ventilator dependence. After anti-infection, nutritional support and cardiopulmonary function regulation, the patient recovered and was discharged on the 14th day after the operation.

Fig. 4
Intraoperative exploration showed partial necrosis of the transverse colon (November 20, 2024)

Discussion and conclusions

The patient, presenting with intestinal obstruction and significant abdominal distension, underwent open exploratory laparotomy without prior laparoscopic assessment due to restricted abdominal space. Initial intraoperative exploration revealed a clean abdomen without inflammation, explaining the absence of preoperative peritonitis signs. Further examination showed localized necrotizing colitis in the transverse colon, encapsulated by the omentum and mesentery, restricting infection spread and accounting for the patient's atypical presentation of no fever and slow - progressing inflammatory markers.

The transverse colon's blood supply mainly comes from the middle colic artery, a superior mesenteric artery branch, with additional supply from the marginal artery, an anastomotic arch between the left and right colic arteries. The colon has a relatively low blood flow and reduced perfusion during functional inactivity, making it vulnerable to ischemia. The splenic flexure has few vascular collaterals, being the most susceptible to ischemic changes when blood flow decreases. The colonic mucosa and submucosa receive 70% of the mesenteric blood, while the muscularis propria and serosa receive the remaining 30%. Ischemic injury first occurs in the colonic mucosa, most commonly on the anti - mesenteric side.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the surgical management of Crohn's disease [^416ee663]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2020). High credibility.

Severe colitis in Crohn's colitis — definition, evaluation, and initial management: Severe acute colitis and fulminant colitis apply to patients with colitis with frequent stools (≥ 6/day) and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and severe colitis can be classified using modified Truelove and Witts criteria as ≥ 6 bowel movements per day plus at least one of temperature > 37.8°C, pulse > 90 beats per minute, erythrocyte sedimentation rate > 30 mm/h, C-reactive protein > 30 mg/L, or hemoglobin < 10.5 g/dL. Megacolon is often defined as a transverse colon diameter ≥ 5.5 cm and in the setting of SIRS is termed toxic megacolon. When severe Crohn's colitis is suspected, alternative causes (eg, Clostridium difficile, cytomegalovirus) should typically be excluded with stool studies and endoscopic mucosal biopsy via careful flexible sigmoidoscopy; therapeutic drug monitoring may be helpful to guide monoclonal antibody therapy. Laboratory testing including serum C-reactive protein, hemoglobin, creatinine, and albumin, fecal calprotectin, and monoclonal antibody drug levels can help measure response, and given the potentially masking effects of high-dose steroids, patients are usually followed with plain abdominal x-rays to detect megacolon or perforation and these may need to be repeated often, if not daily, until clinical condition improves. Initial treatment includes supportive care, intravenous fluid resuscitation, avoidance of antidiarrheals, limited use of opiates and anticholinergics, and prompt intravenous glucocorticoids (eg, methylprednisolone 60 mg/day); venous thromboembolism prophylaxis beginning on hospital admission is recommended, whereas bowel rest and prophylactic antibiotics are usually not necessary. Response to steroid therapy includes improvement or resolution of SIRS and a decrease in stool frequency (eg, < 6/day) with overall clinical improvement.

### Transverse colon volvulus following normal delivery: report of a rare case and review of the world literature [^8ea44700]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The diagnosis of intestinal obstruction or volvulus is often delayed due to atypical presentation, lack of knowledge about the condition, and hesitation to use radiological investigations. These factors may be attributed to mistaking the clinical features for other pregnancy-related conditions. Therefore, it is crucial to have a high clinical suspicion and to involve both surgeons and obstetricians in the management of these cases. The key to successful treatment is minimizing delays in decision-making and ensuring timely surgery.

### Necrotising colitis related to clozapine? A rare but life threatening side effect [^7be28f1b]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Operative findings

Operative findings during laparotomy were that of a markedly dilated colon extending from the caecum to the proximal transverse colon. The maximum diameter of the large bowel was at the caecum which measured 12 cm. There were patches of serosal ischaemia extending from caecum to transverse colon. The mesenteric vessels were patent with good pulsations. No perforation or soilage was seen.

In view of the haemodynamic lability, the decision was made to perform a right hemicolectomy without primary anastomosis. The terminal ileum was brought out as a Brookes ileostomy and the distal end of the colon was stapled off with an ILA100 stapler and hitched to the ileostomy.

### A review on delayed presentation of diaphragmatic rupture [^5a4dd8bf]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Investigations

The studies published before 1996 have quoted that 12–69% of diaphragmatic ruptures are missed at the pre operative phase. CT scan was not widely used investigation when these papers were published. However, with the introduction of reformatting of images the sensitivity of the CT scan in picking up the diaphragmatic rupture has significantly increased. While audible bowel sounds on the chest auscultation suggests displaced bowel loops, a chest x ray is the first line of investigation, repeated imaging increases sensitivity. Insertion of a naso-gastric tube can decompress the intra-thoracic stomach to delineate a chest x ray interpretation and increase the diagnostic sensitivity to approximately 75%. The sensitivity of chest radiographs is 46% for left sided ruptures and 17% for right sided ruptures. Helical CT with axial, sagittal and coronal reconstruction increases the sensitivity to 73% and the specificity to 90%. A diagnostic laparoscopy and/or diagnostic thoracoscopy could be performed as a semi-elective procedure, the timing planned in accordance with the heamodynamic and respiratory status of the patient. Meticulous inspection and palpation of the diaphragm should be performed during laparotomy in patients with trauma.

The systematic review of literature confirmed chest x ray findings of bowel loops in the left hemithorax, abundant hydropneumothorax, elevation of the left diaphragmatic dome, loculated left pneumothorax, mediastinal shift, free gas under the diaphragm and subdiaphragmatic densities. The abdominal x ray findings reported features of large bowel obstruction. Contrast X ray has been reported as showing large part of the stomach lying in left chest. Intrapleural herniation of large intestine has been reported as CT scan findings of intrapleural herniation of large intestine and abundant pleural effusion, Intrathoracic displacement of liver, intrathoracic spleen with splenic vein thrombosis, large right diaphragmatic rupture with herniation of liver, gall bladder, right kidney, ureter and renal vein. Along with distal ascending colon and proximal transverse colon, Collar Sign (Waist like constriction) is produced by compression of herniated organs. Diaphragmatic discontinuity and dependent viscera sign (abdominal organs set against the posterior ribs) have also been reported. Pleuro-pulmonary sonography has been used in one case to confirm condensed lung with pleural effusion along with interruption of right hemidiaphragm with intrathoracic hepatic parenchyma, dilatation of hepatic veins and collapse of IVC with inspiration. Intraperitoneal injection of technetium sulphur colloid can be used to diagnose rupture of right diaphragm. MR scan has been performed and reported displacement of the liver.

### Transverse colon volvulus in a 15 year old boy and the review of the literature [^cb855841]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

We report a rare case of transverse colon volvulus in a fifteen year old boy with a review of the literature. This brings the total number of pediatric cases reported in the English literature to fifteen. This case is unusual in that no aetiological factor has been found, in contrast to the majority of the pediatric cases. Diagnosis can be challenging and the effective management remains controversial. The various radiological imaging modalities are presented. The epidemiology, aetiology, diagnosis and management of transverse colon volvulus are discussed. It is important to highlight this case and those in the literature, as many surgeons may never have seen a single case of transverse colon volvulus. It may therefore not be considered in the differential diagnosis of recurrent intermittent abdominal pain or acute intestinal obstruction.

### Case report: paralytic ileus: a potential extrapulmonary manifestation of severe COVID-19 [^4ce3ea1c]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

The patient was extubated after 4 days but was re-intubated because of increased oxygen requirements. Examination revealed distended and tense abdomen with epigastric tenderness, exaggerated bowel sounds, and empty rectum. He was noted to have abnormal liver enzymes, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 1,589 U/L, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 1,856 U/L. Abdominal X-ray showed bilateral free air under the diaphragm and distended bowel loops (Figure 1A and B). Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed large bowel dilatation from the cecum down to the rectum with no stricture or transitional area of obstruction, and patent mesenteric vessels (Figure 2A). Surgical evaluation was sought, and emergency laparotomy was performed. The operative findings were pyogenic membranes and purulent fluid in the peritoneal cavity and a 2-mm perforation in the anterior aspect of the mid-transverse colon with three serosal tears of 3–4 cm distal to the perforation; the rest of the bowel was healthy. He underwent primary repair of the perforated colon and lavage. His condition improved, and he was gradually introduced to enteral feeding. Liver enzymes improved over the next week. However, 10 days later, the patient again developed respiratory distress, and repeat CT abdomen showed significant free peritoneal air with fluid contrast layering at the rectovesical pouch, raising suspicion of extra-luminal bowel contrast leak. No bowel dilatation was found. Urgent laparotomy revealed a localized leak of the repaired perforated transverse colon; transverse loop colostomy was performed. The patient's hospital course was also complicated by renal failure, which was attributed to acute tubular necrosis secondary to infection and bowel perforation. He remains hospitalized in intensive care at the time of writing this report.

### Caecal perforation with faecal peritonitis-unusual presentation of bochdalek hernia in an adult: a case report and review of literature [^51c0b157]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Case Report

A 46-year-old male patient presented to our emergency department with a history of generalized abdominal pain of 7 days' duration. The pain had become more localized to the right lower abdomen for the last 2 days. There was a history of constipation lasting for 3 days. There was no vomiting and he did not have any chest or abdominal complaints in the past. There were no known co-morbidities. There was no history of recent trauma or surgery. On physical examination, he was febrile (101 Fahrenheit) and had tachycardia. Abdomen was distended and the liver dullness was obliterated. There was generalized abdominal tenderness in addition to rebound tenderness in the right iliac fossa. The bowel sounds were absent. The haemogram showed leucocytosis (11000/Cu mm). Chest X-ray showed free air under the diaphragm (Fig 1) and abdominal X-rays showed a markedly dilated transverse colon. A preoperative diagnosis of hollow viscus perforation with peritonitis was made and the patient was taken up for emergency laparotomy. On laparotomy, there was caecal perforation with faecal peritonitis (Fig 2). There was marked dilatation of the caecum, ascending colon and transverse colon up to the level of splenic flexure of the colon. The descending colon was collapsed and there was no mass or band causing the obstruction. The dilated transverse colon was followed and it became evident that it was entering the pleural cavity through a postero-lateral defect in the diaphragm (Fig 3). A dilated loop of transverse colon was found in the chest cavity with obstruction at the level of the defect. This loop along with its mesentery was viable and brought down into the abdominal cavity by enlarging the defect in diaphragm (Fig 4). The defect was primarily repaired in one layer with interrupted sutures of No-1 prolene and a left intercostal tube drain (ICD) with negative pressure was placed. The caecal perforation was managed by intracaecal placement of a Foley urethral catheter of 20 French to establish a tube caecostomy. In the postoperative period, ICD was removed on the 5th postoperative day. The patient developed mild infection at the laparotomy wound which was treated by conservative regimen. The caecostomy tube was removed after 3 weeks and the patient was subsequently discharged from the hospital.

### Transverse colon perforation due to carcinoma rectum: an unusual presentation against laplace's law [^102992b0]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

We present a case of distal large bowel obstruction, in the setting of a competent ileocaecal valve, the caecum is the most common site of perforation (for Laplace's law). We describe a case of obstruction at the rectum due to constricting carcinomatous growth, presenting with perforation of transverse colon (against Laplace's law). A 60-year-old women presented to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain. The pain was preceded by 3 days of intestinal obstruction. Clinically there was guarding and rigidity. Straight X-ray of the abdomen revealed free gas under diaphragm. Surgical exploration revealed transverse colon perforation with carcinoma of rectum. Loop transverse colostomy was performed as the patient was very sick. The patient improved slowly in the intensive care unit. To conclude, even though the caecum is the most common site for perforation in case of distal obstruction, perforation of transverse colon can occur otherwise as a unique presentation.

However, from his 30th day, he presented with increasing apnea and vomiting. Contrast gastric X-ray performed on the 40th day revealed gastroesophageal reflux (GER). Treatment of GER was added by dividing enteral feeding and medication. Nevertheless, his quantity of stool gradually decreased, and physical examination showed worsening abdominal distention. Simultaneously, his CRP and WBC levels were slightly elevated up to his 40th day at 2.56 mg/dL and 20,380/μL, respectively. Intravenous cefazolin (100 mg/kg/day) was administered, followed by cefaclor p.o. Abdominal radiography on his 50th day showed a significantly distended intestine with gas (Fig. 1), which urged us to perform contrast X-ray of the colon; the X-ray suggested stenosis of the ascending colon (Fig. 2). In order to decompress the distended bowel, we tried to insert a tube through the narrowed colon resulting in failure. Therefore we decided to perform emergent exploratory laparotomy.

Fig. 1
Timeline. The patient had been treated with antibiotics twice. The intestine on day 50 was distended with air. No specific evidence of air in the bowel wall was found

Fig. 2
Contrast X-ray of the colon on day 50. Beak signs of ascending to the transverse colon suggested colon stenosis

Intraoperative findings included viable loops of bowel, and the terminal ileum remarkably distended in the right lower quadrant (Fig. 3). The appendix was adhered to the ascending colon by approximately 1 cm from the ileocecal junction and was found to be perforated at its root. This part of the colon was narrow and was not dilated by compression from the oral end, while the contents passed through smoothly. Ascites was slightly yellowish and was examined by a culture test, which turned out to be negative. No perforation in the colon or evident peritonitis was observed macroscopically. The ascending colon lesion including the appendix was resected by 3 cm, and then the ileum and remaining ascending colon were anastomosed end to end.

### Assessing colonic anatomy normal values based on air contrast enemas in children younger than 6 years [^51ab742a]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Contrast enemas with barium or water-soluble contrast agents are sometimes performed in children with severe intractable constipation to identify anatomical abnormalities. However there are no clear definitions for normal colonic size or abnormalities such as colonic dilation or sigmoid redundancy in children.

Objective

To describe characteristics of colonic anatomy on air contrast enemas in children without constipation to provide normal values for colonic size ratios in children.

Materials and Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review of children aged 0–5 years who had undergone air contrast enemas for intussusception. The primary outcome measures were the ratios of the diameters and lengths of predetermined colonic segments (lengths of rectosigmoid and descending colon; diameters of rectum, sigmoid, descending colon, transverse colon and ascending colon) in relation to the L2 vertebral body width.

Results

We included 119 children (median age 2.0 years, range 0–5 years, 68% boys). Colonic segment length ratios did not change significantly with age, although the differences for the rectosigmoid/L2 ratio were borderline significant (P = 0.05). The ratios that involved the rectal and ascending colon diameters increased significantly with age, while diameter ratios involving the other colonic segments did not. Differences by gender and race were not significant.

Conclusion

These data can be used for reference purposes in young children undergoing contrast studies of the colon.

### Giant colonic diverticulum: radiographic and MDCT characteristics [^09c18725]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Radiographic characteristics

On plain abdominal radiographs, GCD appears as a smooth-walled, gas-filled structure, round or oval, adjacent to the sigmoid colon (with or without air-fluid levels). Also referred to as the "balloon sign", this finding was evident in the plain abdominal X-rays of 99% (103/104) of patients who underwent radiography and who were included in a review of case studies of GCD. However, our more recent series of 17 patients revealed this sign in only 76% (13/17). This suggests that before the widespread use of CT, radiographs apparently missed cases of GCD.

The larger the diameter of the GCD, the greater the chance that it will be detected on plain films (Figs. 2 and 3). Lack of haustral folds and location in the lower abdomen may assist in differentiating between GCD and sigmoid or caecal volvulus. Upright abdominal X-rays or lateral views can demonstrate fluid level, though these positions are generally not performed. Pneumoperitoneum and pneumomesenterium are indications of perforation of the gastrointestinal tract and appear in about 8% of radiographs of GCD.

Fig. 2
A 55-year-old man with giant sigmoid diverticulum (GSD) associated with acute diverticulitis. Abdominal radiograph (a) shows a large, round, homogenous radiolucency in the right upper quadrant that is smoothly marginated (arrows). Axial (b and c), coronal (d), and sagittal (e) contrast-enhanced CT images through the upper abdomen show a predominantly gas-filled structure in the right upper abdomen, communicating with the sigmoid colon (S) and consistent with GSD. The sigmoid colon is located in the right side of the abdomen (anatomical variant). The arrow demonstrates the neck of the GSD, which connects the diverticular cavity with the adjacent sigmoid colon; this finding is essential for correct diagnosis. The thickened wall of the diverticulum and the surrounding mesentery infiltration denote acute diverticulitis

### Ogilvie syndrome in a 8 year old girl after laparoscopic appendectomy [^8e767581]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Ogilvie's syndrome, or acute colonic pseudo-obstruction, is characterized by decreased gastrointestinal motility, massive dilatation of the colon without signs of mechanical obstruction, and limited small bowel involvement, otherwise affected in postoperative adynamic ileum. It occurs primarily in adult patients, whereas it happens rarely in children. It has been suggested that it could be the result of suppression of sacral parasympathetic nerves' activity together with an increase in sympathetic impulses, resulting in inhibition of colonic motility and hence in colonic dilatation. Other pathogenetic theories include prostaglandin E abnormalities, decreased splanchnic perfusion, side effects of neurotropic medications, metabolic disorders affecting neuromuscular conduction (hypokalaemia, uremia) and herpes zoster virus reactivation. Patients present with recurrent vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain and prominent abdominal distension.

The syndrome tends to occur in adult patients with serious medical and surgical conditions, as myocardial infarction, neoplasia, metabolic disorders, spinal injury, peritonitis, sepsis and shock. In pediatric population it has been described in oncology patients, especially when neutropenic and treated with high-dose vincristine in patients who underwent spinal surgery, after administration of anticholinergic medication, in sickle cell disease, in Kawasaky disease, and after renal transplant.

There are no pathognomonic laboratory tests, but the abdominal x-ray reveals large bowel dilatation, which especially involves cecum and ascending colon, with preservation of haustral markings and with little fluid in the bowel lumen, in contrast to mechanical obstruction, which contains multiple air/fluid levels. Computed tomography imaging is more specific than plain radiography to exclude any cause of mechanical obstruction and often reveals proximal colonic dilatation with a transitional zone adjacent to the splenic flexure.

### Acute mesenteric ischaemia: a pictorial review [^30841c19]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Bowel dilatation

Luminal dilatation and air-fluid levels are quite common in acute bowel infarction (56%–91% of cases).

Bowel dilatation may result from interruption of intestinal peristalsis as a reflex to ischaemic injury or from irreversible and transmural ischaemic damage to the bowel wall. In the colon when only mild mucosal ischaemia occurs, a still viable bowel segment leads to spastic contractions; therefore, bowel dilatation is not usually seen.

In small bowel wall ischaemia caused by venoocclusive disease, the presence of dilated and mainly fluid-filled bowel loops results from additional fluid exudation into the lumen of ischaemic bowel segments (gasless abdomen) (Fig. 6). In exclusive arterial occlusion, the dilated bowel loops seldom contain fluid-filled loops.

Fig. 6
Gasless abdomen. Contrast-enhanced CT image of the abdomen in a 62-year-old female with small bowel wall ischaemia due to venoocclusive disease. Contrast-enhanced CT image of the abdomen shows dilated and mainly fluid-filled bowel loops and gasless abdomen (white arrow). Ascites (*) and vascular engorgement (orange arrow) are also seen

Bowel wall attenuation

An ischaemic bowel segment may manifest with a hypoattenuating or spontaneous hyperattenuating bowel wall.

This is why we should always make assessments on both unenhanced and contrast-enhanced CT images to avoid misinterpretation of high density of the bowel as normal enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT in cases of intramural haemorrhage.

On unenhanced CT images, hypoattenuation of the bowel wall indicates bowel wall oedema, which is more typical in cases of acute bowel ischaemia caused by mesenteric venous occlusions. Otherwise, under these circumstances, hyperattenuation of the thickened bowel wall could also be seen because of intramural haemorrhage and haemorrhagic infarction.

On contrast-enhanced CT images, a highly specific although not sensitive finding for AMI is absent or substantially diminished bowel mural enhancement and has been termed "pale ischaemia" (Figs. 7 and 8). Alternatively, in the postreperfusion period after arterial injury, hyperenhancement of the bowel is present much like "shock bowel" (Fig. 9).

### Disproportionate fat stranding: a helpful CT sign in patients with acute abdominal pain [^7d14afcc]. Radiographics (2004). Low credibility.

Fat stranding adjacent to thickened bowel wall seen at computed tomography (CT) in patients with acute abdominal pain suggests an acute process of the gastrointestinal tract, but the differential diagnosis is wide. The authors observed "disproportionate" fat stranding (ie, stranding more severe than expected for the degree of bowel wall thickening present) and explored how this finding suggests a narrower differential diagnosis, one that is centered in the mesentery: diverticulitis, epiploic appendagitis, omental infarction, and appendicitis. The characteristic CT findings (in addition to fat stranding) of each of these entities often lead to a final diagnosis. Diverticulitis manifests with mild, smooth bowel wall thickening and no lymphadenopathy. Epiploic appendagitis manifests with central areas of high attenuation and a hyperattenuated rim, in addition to its characteristic location adjacent to the colon. In contrast, omental infarction is always centered in the omentum. The most specific finding of appendicitis is a dilated, fluid-filled appendix. Correct noninvasive diagnosis is important because treatment approaches for these conditions range from monitoring to surgery.

### Gastrointestinal perforation: clinical and MDCT clues for identification of aetiology [^0f3915df]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome) usually affects patients with significant comorbidities or postoperatively. CT findings comprise marked diffuse dilatation of colonic and rectal lumen without a transition point to collapsed bowel. Although perforation is a rare complication (1–3%), carrying a 50–71% mortality rate, the risk increases up to 23% when caecal diameter is > 14 cm.

In Ehler-Danlos syndrome, spontaneous perforation is the most common GIT complication, affecting most commonly the sigmoid colon. Perforation usually occurs early in the disease (mean age of presentation 24–26 years), usually precedes arterial or solid organ rupture and can be the first symptom in a young patient otherwise undiagnosed with Ehler-Danlos syndrome.

Perforation from blunt trauma is uncommon, being reported in approximately 0.5% of all major blunt traumas, more commonly in the sigmoid, right colon and cecum. Transverse colon injury may coexist with pancreatic and/or duodenal injury. Oral contrast administration, when not contraindicated in the emergency setting, can increase the detection rate of bowel wall thickening and small mesenteric hematomas. Free fluid typically forms polygonal-shaped collections among loops and within mesenteric folds. Traumatic perforation of a retroperitoneal segment tends to remain localised adjacent to the injury site.

Colonic perforation in inflammatory bowel disease is rare, with free perforation occurring in about 3% of patients with Crohn's, less common compared with sealed-off perforations. Free perforation from ulcerative colitis occurs in about 2% of patients and is associated with toxic megacolon.

Presenting symptoms, imaging and clinical considerations in relation to site and causes of colorectal perforation are summarised (Table 3).

Description

A 24-year-old man with autism spectrum disorder presented to accident and emergency complaining of a 1-week history of abdominal pain and diarrhoea. He had a history of chronic constipation with multiple previous admissions stretching 4 years back. On examination, he had a tender, distended abdomen with quiet bowel sounds. His CT scan on admission (figure 1) showed a dilated (up to 18 cm) rectum and sigmoid colon filled with faeces. The patient was managed conservatively with oral laxatives and regular enemas. However, the patient refused the enemas and was maintained on oral laxatives. Two days later, the patient complained of worsening abdominal pain. On examination, he had a peritonitic abdomen and reduced consciousness level. Biochemical investigations revealed worsening renal function and that the patient was now acidotic. A chest X-ray revealed free air beneath the diaphragm. A repeat CT scan (figures 2 and 3) showed a substantial perforation of the dilated sigmoid colon. The patient was sent to intensive care unit before undergoing an emergency laparotomy where a Hartmann procedure was performed.

### Symptoms and diagnostic criteria of acquired megacolon-a systematic literature review [^ba99b0e6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

For a condition that is sometimes treated surgically, Acquired Megacolon (AMC) is poorly understood and diagnostic criteria remain obscure. The term refers to a colon of increased diameter and increased length, in the absence of organic disease. The colon is often described as distended or dilated. Some authors differentiate 'colonic redundancy' from 'megacolon', by describing increased colonic length with reduplication, opposed to a colon of increased diameter. However, increased length and diameter often co-exist. The definition AMC used in this paper encompasses both increased colonic length and diameter with negligible rectal involvement where possible.

Many symptoms including constipation, distension, abdominal pain and a poor sense of wellbeing are attributed to AMC. Pathophysiology, natural history and effective symptom management, although speculated, are unknown. A large body of evidence exists, including literature reviews, which have analysed surgical outcomes for AMC and the diagnosis of idiopathic megabowel (megarectum-inclusive disease). However, consensus on diagnostic criteria is still lacking.

The objective of this systematic literature review is to refine diagnostic criteria for this condition and to evaluate symptoms and pathophysiology that may be associated with AMC.

### Diverticulitis: a comprehensive review with usual and unusual complications [^acfac3fb]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Bowel obstruction

Severe intestinal obstruction in patients with diverticulitis is rare; however, partial obstruction secondary to wall edema and peripheral inflammation or abscess formation may occur. Intramuscular fibrosis seen in the chronic phase may also lead to obstruction in 10–20% of the cases. In these cases, irregular wall thickening with upstream bowel dilatation is the most common finding (Fig. 8). The main differential diagnosis in cases of acute diverticulitis is an obstructive malignant mass in the colon. While involvement of a long colonic segment (> 10 cm) suggests diverticulitis, it should also be kept in mind that both neoplasm and acute diverticulitis may involve a short bowel segment. The most helpful finding of diverticulitis is the detection of a diverticulum in the involved segment; however, colon cancer cannot be confidently excluded based on this finding, as diverticulosis without any active inflammation is also highly prevalent in the general population. Eccentric wall thickening is more common in colonic carcinoma, while concentric wall thickening is more suggestive of acute diverticulitis. Perilesional mesenteric lymph nodes with a short axis diameter exceeding 10 mm are more common in colon cancer than acute diverticulitis.

Bowel segments proximal to the localization of diverticulitis is dilated. b Axial CT performed 2-months after the first CT reveals thickening of the colonic wall (arrow) leading to intestinal obstruction

Rectal diverticulitis is a very rare form of diverticulitis and may present as a rectal mass with surrounding inflammatory changes and obstructive findings. Jejunal diverticulitis, also rare, typically presents with adhesion of the epiploic band, resulting in subsequent internal hernia.

Chronic diverticulitis is a variant of diverticulitis that is characterized by persisting symptoms such as abdominal pain for 6 months to 1 year and secondary obstructive symptoms. Intestinal obstruction may develop due to chronic inflammatory changes and associated dense fibrosis. Sigmoid colon is the most commonly affected colonic segment in this form. Barium studies demonstrate narrowing of the involved segment, tethered and speculated folds, and tapered margins with diverticula. Circumferential narrowing of involved segment results from chronic inflammation and fibrosis of the colonic wall and surrounding pericolic fat.

### Bidirectional endoscopic and pharmacological approach for the treatment of severe right-sided colonic stool impaction [^a1438708]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Case presentation

A female patient in her 40s from Jamaica with scleroderma, Behçet's disease, gastroparesis, history of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and constipation was referred with severe refractory faecal impaction for 6 weeks. She was unable to tolerate an oral diet and lost 20 pounds over 6 weeks with a failure to thrive. Three months ago, patient had COVID-19 with a gradual improvement in respiratory symptoms but developed constipation with persistent haemorrhoidal bleeding requiring a haemorrhoidectomy. Following surgery, her constipation progressively worsened over 6 weeks, and she remained hospitalised. Opioids were discontinued 3 days after surgery. She also experienced flare-up of her scleroderma. An oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in Jamaica revealed a dilated distal oesophagus. She was unable to tolerate solid diet, managing only a few sips of water, juice, and nutritional drinks with antiemetics.

For the constipation, she received several phospho-soda and milk and molasses enema, bisacodyl orally and rectally, polyethylene glycol and senna orally together with pyridostigmine for several days. This helped to clear rectal stool impaction. However, an X-ray abdomen revealed significant impacted stool in the right and mid colon that was refractory to treatment. She was referred for colectomy, but given her poor general health, and comorbidities they sought a second opinion at our centre and flew to the USA.

She appeared toxic, febrile, was tender over the right lower quadrant, with abdominal distension, a large stool burden in the right colon with a succussion splash and absent bowel sounds. Initial laboratory work revealed anaemia (10.9 g/dL), hypokalaemia (3.1 mEq/HCTL) and hypoalbuminaemia (3.4 g/dL). We administered intravenous fluids and multivitamins. A glucose hydrogen breath test showed high methane values but no rise, possibly as glucose stayed in the stomach from severe gastroparesis. Abdominal X-ray showed extensive proximal and right-sided colonic stool impaction (figure 1).

### Colonic pseudoobstruction: CT findings [^06f8330f]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this review was to define the imaging features of colonic pseudoobstruction and to describe the pathologic findings.

Conclusion

Colonic pseudoobstruction can be diagnosed on the basis of CT findings that show extensive colonic dilatation without an obstructive lesion at the intermediate transitional zone or adjacent to the splenic flexure. Pathologic examination reveals that intramural ganglion damage has a high tendency to occur in cases of chronic colonic pseudoobstruction.

### Assessing colonic anatomy normal values based on air contrast enemas in children younger than 6 years [^0657a902]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

All radiologic images were assessed and measured by one of the authors, a MD, researcher in pediatric gastroenterology (I.J.N.K. 3 years of experience), who was instructed by a pediatric radiologist (B.P.T. 7 years of experience) on how to evaluate these air contrast studies and how to make the measurements. The same pediatric radiologist reviewed the air contrast studies that were measured to check for accuracy of the measurement process (e.g. interpretation of the anatomical structures); no errors were encountered.

The width of the vertebral body of L2 was determined by measuring the distance between the lateral borders of the pedicles. Intestinal length was measured in the middle of the colonic lumen; we measured the rectosigmoid (anal verge up to the center of the colosigmoid junction) and the descending colon (center of colosigmoid junction up to the center of the splenic flexure). These measurements consisted of a combination of multiple straight measurements linked together, following the curvature of the colon in the center of the lumen. The diameters of the rectum, the sigmoid colon, the descending colon, the transverse colon and the ascending colon were determined at the point where they were most distended (Fig. 1). Because the transition from the rectum to the sigmoid colon is not easily identifiable on a contrast study, the maximum rectum diameter was measured close to the anal verge, whereas the maximum sigmoid colon diameter was measured at least 10 cm from the anal verge, usually in the middle of the rectosigmoid, depending where the sigmoid colon was most dilated. For children with multiple contrast studies during the study period, only the first was considered for the primary analysis.

### Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction [^216f7847]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO) is a syndrome of massive dilation of the colon without mechanical obstruction that develops in hospitalized patients with serious underlying medical and surgical conditions. Increasing age, cecal diameter, delay in decompression, and status of the bowel significantly influence mortality, which is approximately 40% when ischemia or perforation is present. Evaluation of the markedly distended colon involves excluding mechanical obstruction and other causes of toxic megacolon such as Clostridium difficile infection and assessing for signs of ischemia and perforation. The risk of colonic perforation in ACPO increases when cecal diameter exceeds 12 cm and when the distention has been present for greater than 6 days. Appropriate management includes supportive therapy and selective use of neostigmine and colonoscopy for decompression. Early recognition and management are critical in minimizing complications.

### Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction [^ce5986b2]. The British Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction is characterized by clinical and radiological evidence of acute large bowel obstruction in the absence of a mechanical cause. The condition usually affects elderly people with underlying co-morbidities, and early recognition and appropriate management are essential to reduce the occurrence of life-threatening complications.

Methods

A part-systematic review was conducted. This was based on key publications focusing on advances in management.

Results and Conclusions

Although acute colonic dilatation has been suggested to result from a functional imbalance in autonomic nerve supply, there is little direct evidence for this. Other aetiologies derived from the evolving field of neurogastroenterology remain underexplored. The rationale of treatment is to achieve prompt and effective colonic decompression. Initial management includes supportive interventions that may be followed by pharmacological therapy. Controlled clinical trials have shown that the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor neostigmine is an effective treatment with initial response rates of 60–90 per cent; other drugs for use in this area are in evolution. Colonoscopic decompression is successful in approximately 80 per cent of patients, with other minimally invasive strategies continuing to be developed. Surgery has thus become largely limited to those in whom complications occur. A contemporary management algorithm is provided on this basis.

### Rare case of rectosigmoid stricture causing transverse colon volvulus [^5732d9a9]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 60-year-old woman with remote history of sleeve gastrectomy presented with altered mental status after an unwitnessed fall. She was found to be hypothermic with lactic acidaemia, leucocytosis, positive urinalysis, and dilated ascending and transverse colon on cross-sectional imaging, initially thought to be secondary to faecal loading. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit for resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics for presumed urinary sepsis. She became acutely altered and underwent urgent flexible sigmoidoscopy by gastroenterology to evaluate for ischaemic colitis. During the procedure, there was concern for iatrogenic colon injury given the friability of the colonic mucosa, so the patient was taken urgently for exploratory laparotomy. Intraoperatively, she was found to have a transverse colon volvulus with large areas of patchy, gangrenous bowel without evidence of gross perforation. A rectosigmoid stricture with associated serosal tear, but no full-thickness injury was identified. An extended left hemicolectomy and end transverse colostomy was performed resulting in improvement in the patient's clinical status and eventual discharge to subacute rehab.

### Transverse colon volvulus in a 15 year old boy and the review of the literature [^95c3f74b]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

The two properties essential to the formation of a volvulus are redundancy and non-fixation. The ascending and descending segments of the colon are fixed, but the sigmoid colon, caecum, and transverse colon are mobile within the peritoneum, tethered by their mesentery. This mobility allows volvulus to occur at these locations. Redundancy of any of these segments further enables the formation of a volvulus. The literature describes two forms of presentation; acute fulminating and subacute progressive. Patients with the acute fulminating type of presentation typically have a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain, rebound tenderness, vomiting, little distension, and rapid clinical deterioration. Bowel sounds are initially hyperactive but may later become absent. The acute form presents in sixty percent of children. Subacute progressive transverse volvulus is associated with massive abdominal distension in the setting of mild abdominal pain without rebound tenderness and little or no nausea or vomiting. Our case was clinically of the subacute presentation, and this was correlated with the histological findings.

A transverse colon volvulus does not have the same classically recognisable radiographic features as sigmoid and caecal volvulus. The gold standard of diagnosis is a contrast enhanced plain film which reveals the 'birds beak' phenomenon characteristic of any volvulus. The abdominal film may reveal a large bowel obstruction with proximal colonic distension, two long air-fluid levels and a 'U-shaped' loop with the apex pointing away from the point of torsion of the colon (bent inner tube appearance).

Whereas sigmoid volvulus can often be decompressed by sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, transverse colon volvulus must be surgically detorsed. The choice of surgical approach in children is a matter of debate. Avoiding an aggressive intervention such as partial colectomy may minimise post surgical complications, and this was the choice from our decision making. Surgical options include: detorsion alone, detorsion with colopexy, resection with primary anastomosis, or resection with colostomy or ileostomy and mucous fistula. Both detorsion and detorsion with colopexy have a higher rate of recurrence than resection. Resection with or without primary anastomosis is the treatment of choice for transverse colon volvulus to prevent recurrence.

### Resuscitation from cardiac arrest with tension gastrothorax due to acquired diaphragmatic hernia [^fa508b07]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Tension gastrothorax is a rare cause of obstructive shock induced by a distended stomach herniating into the thorax through a diaphragmatic defect. We report the process of diagnosis and emergency treatment for tension gastrothorax during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). A 71-year-old woman with multiple surgical histories had nausea and vomiting for two days. She was transferred to our hospital with circulatory failure and loss of consciousness. She presented pulseless electric activity and received CPR immediately after arrival. The right atrium and right ventricle were collapsed in the echocardiography. A chest X-ray demonstrated a dilated intestine extending from the peritoneal cavity to the mediastinum. The nasogastric tube (NGT) drained 1000 mL of stomach content and alleviated the abdominal distension, and spontaneous circulation returned immediately after the drainage. Thoracoabdominal CT showed the stomach and the transverse colon had escaped from the peritoneal cavity to the mediastinum. We diagnosed the situation as tension gastrothorax due to an acquired diaphragmatic hernia. History of multiple surgery and multiple operative scars was the first step of the diagnostic process, and the chest X-ray during CPR was the key to the diagnosis. Tension gastrothorax can be misdiagnosed as other conditions. A chest X-ray should be preceded in non-trauma settings, unlike the setting of a tension pneumothorax in trauma patients. Gastrointestinal decompression with NGT placement could be attempted quickly to improve the hemodynamic condition.

### Right colon, sigmoid colon, and transverse colon diverticulitis in the same patient: report of a case [^25db7ee3]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2005). Low credibility.

Although sigmoid colon diverticulitis is frequently seen, right colon and transverse colon diverticulitis remain rare forms of the disease. This case report examined the disease course of a 46-year-old female who first presented to our institution in 1990 with perforated right-sided diverticulitis. During the next 11 years, she developed sigmoid colon diverticulitis and then transverse colon diverticulitis. The right and sigmoid colon diverticulitis were treated with surgery and the transverse colon diverticulitis was managed conservatively. This is the first reported case of a single patient who had separate episodes of diverticulitis in the right, transverse, and sigmoid colon. The evaluation and management of this patient has mirrored a trend in the literature and clinical practice.

Ulcerative colitis — emergent total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy: Patients with severe medically refractory ulcerative colitis (UC), fulminant colitis, toxic megacolon, or colonic perforation should typically undergo total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy (Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C). Fulminant colitis may involve more than 10 bloody stools per day and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate > 30 mm/h, and toxic megacolon is associated with total or segmental colonic dilation (diameter ≥ 5.5 cm) without mechanical obstruction but with systemic toxicity. In a retrospective series of inflammatory bowel disease patients undergoing colectomy, 89 cases included fulminant colitis (n = 72; 81%) and toxic colitis (n = 17; 19%), with 14 (16%) perforations, most often in the cecum or distal third of the transverse colon; fulminant colitis or toxic megacolon should prompt urgent total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy, and a proctectomy is usually avoided with options such as implanting the rectal stump subcutaneously, creating a mucous fistula, or decompression transanally via a rectal tube.

The images showed a focus of radiotracer activity in the right side of pelvic cavity, which is further confirmed as urinary bladder by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and delayed images. Because of high possibility of mass effect in pelvic cavity, pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, and it revealed an unusual dilatation of rectosigmoid colon with no evidence of pelvic mass.

### Cecal perforation associated with Clostridium difficile infection: a Case report [^41a532f4]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Various complications are reported with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), including fulminant CDI. Fulminant CDI is an underappreciated life-threatening condition associated with complications such as toxic megacolon and bowel perforation.

Case Report

A 79-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department with altered mental status. She was admitted and conservatively treated for a left thalamic hemorrhage. While hospitalized, she developed watery diarrhea due to Clostridium difficile. Although metronidazole was initiated, she developed altered mental status and septic shock. Abdominal x-ray study and computed tomography revealed a significantly dilatated colon and a massive pneumoperitoneum. She underwent subtotal colectomy with a 14-day course of intravenous meropenem. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? This case suggests that we must be aware of the complications that CDI may present and adequately consider surgical management because early diagnosis and surgical treatment is critical to reduce the mortality of fulminant CDI.

### Conditions that mimic Hirschsprung's disease, but that are not Hirschsprung's disease [^f9858997]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Segmental dilatation

Segmental dilatation of the intestine is a rare condition characterized by localized dilatation of the intestines without mechanical bowel obstruction and malformation of the intestinal nerve plexus. Since Swenson and Rathauser reported this condition as a 'new entity' in 1959, various etiologies have been proposed. However, the clinical manifestations and pathological findings are diverse, and a unified disease concept has not been established. Therefore, it may be appropriate to consider it as a group of disorders presenting with localized intestinal dilatation.

Although approximately 50 cases have been reported in the literature in Japan, no large-scale survey has been conducted. A nationwide survey conducted over 10 years from 2001 to 2010 identified 37 cases, including 26 definitive and 9 suspected cases. Based on a secondary survey of these cases, 28 were determined to be definitive, with 2 of the suspected cases added after discussions at meetings of the investigation group and general meetings. The commonly dilated segments were the ileum and colon (ileum 14 cases, colon 10 cases, jejunum 3 cases, duodenum 1 case). The most common onset period was neonatal, with 18 cases, including 7 diagnosed prenatally.

If this disease is not complicated by any other condition, resection of the lesion can significantly improve symptoms. Plain abdominal radiography successfully indicated the presence of lesions. A preoperative diagnosis also requires confirmation of segmental intestinal dilatation using contrast radiography or CT. When the dilatation site is located in the colon, it must be differentiated from HSCR. For the diagnosis of this disease, caliber change should be clearly observed at the oral side of the dilated segment by barium enema. If this is not clear, anorectal manometry or RMB is required for differentiation.

Resection of the dilated segment and end-to-end anastomosis of the intestine provide a good prognosis. Surgery was performed in 27 patients, with 1 patient awaiting surgery. In 26 of the 27 cases, resection of the dilated segment and intestinal anastomosis were performed. Of these 26 cases, enterostomy was performed in 4 cases and gastrostomy in 2 cases. These laparotomies were performed during the neonatal period in 13 cases (48%), during infancy in 4 cases (15%), during childhood in 5 cases (19%), and during school age in 3 cases (11%)

A total of 27 cases had a good prognosis. One patient with cerebral palsy died of sepsis due to a catheter infection.

History A 22-year-old man with a 12-year history of intermittent abdominal pain and diarrhea had an exacerbation of the diarrhea and weight loss. Representative roentgenograms of an air-contrast barium enema examination are illustrated. A single-contrast barium enema study performed five years earlier had shown similar findings. Diagnosis Giant postinflammatory pseudopolyposis of Crohn's colon. Comment The supine roentgenogram from the air-contrast barium enema examination demonstrated multiple sessile- and filiform-appearing polyps in the ascending, transverse, and descending colon. The sigmoid colon and rectum were normal. A spot x-ray film of the hepatic flexure showed a 5-cm polyp that had incorporated several filiform polyps.

The presence of multiple filiform- and sessile-appearing polyps in a patient with a long history of gastrointestinal complaints indicative of inflammatory bowel disease should strongly suggest postinflammatory pseudopolyposis.

Fig. 1
a – c Surgically-proven TMH in a patient with abdominal pain. There is no fat between the fluid-filled dilated small-bowel loop and the anterior abdominal wall (curved arrow in a). The small-bowel loops are placed lateral to the descending colon with medial deviation of it (arrows in b). There is twisting of the bowel loops and mesentery — whirl sign (arrowhead in c)

Transmesenteric hernias are generally more difficult than other IH to diagnose by CT because they lack a confining sac and thus are located potentially anywhere within the abdomen.

Left-sided paraduodenal IH is the leading differential diagnosis of TMH, but has different distinctive characteristics, such as a sac-like mass of dilated bowel lateral to the ligament of Treitz that displaces and indents the transverse colon and stomach.

Volvulus and ischemia of the herniated small bowel are frequent complications of TMH. Typical findings of strangulated closed-loop obstruction are seen (whirl sign, engorged blood vessels, mesenteric edema, ascites and bowel wall thickening).

We report a rare case of large bowel obstruction secondary to a gallstone impacted within the sigmoid colon, in the presence of sigmoid diverticular disease. An 89-year-old woman presented with an 8-day history of increasing abdominal distension, pain and associated nausea. Abdominal X-ray demonstrated large bowel dilation. CT scan revealed a fistula between an inflamed gallbladder and the hepatic flexure of the colon, with a large gallstone in the sigmoid colon. Proximal dilated large bowel was evident to the caecum. Flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed as the least invasive potential treatment method with a view to basket retrieval or fragmentation of the stone. Owing to poor views and risk of diverticular perforation, the procedure was abandoned, hence laparotomy was performed. Antegrade manipulation and per-rectal evacuation were attempted but failed due to a thickened, angulated sigmoid colon. Retrograde milking of the stone to the caecum and retrieval via modified appendicectomy was successful.

### Toxic megacolon [^0ee97697]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Toxic megacolon represents a dreaded complication of mainly inflammatory or infectious conditions of the colon. It is most commonly associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), i.e., ulcerative colitis or ileocolonic Crohn's disease. Lately, the epidemiology has shifted toward infectious causes, specifically due to an increase of Clostridium difficile-associated colitis possibly due to the extensive (ab)use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Other important infectious etiologies include Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Cytomegalovirus (CMV), rotavirus, Aspergillus, and Entameba. Less frequently, toxic megacolon has been attributed to ischemic colitis, collagenous colitis, or obstructive colorectal cancer. Toxic colonic dilatation may also occur in hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) caused by enterohemorrhagic or enteroaggregative Escherichia coli O157 (EHEC, EAEC, or EAHEC). The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to toxic colonic dilatation are incompletely understood. The main characteristics of toxic megacolon are signs of systemic toxicity and severe colonic distension. Diagnosis is made by clinical evaluation for systemic toxicity and imaging studies depicting colonic dilatation. Plain abdominal imaging is still the most established radiological instrument. However, computed tomography scanning and transabdominal intestinal ultrasound are promising alternatives that add additional information. Management of toxic megacolon is an interdisciplinary task that requires close interaction of gastroenterologists and surgeons from the very beginning. The optimal timing of surgery for toxic megacolon can be challenging. Here we review the latest data on the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, laboratory, and imaging modalities and provide algorithms for an evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic approach.

Imaging

Imaging, usually barium enema, has been used. The bowel appears as a grossly elongated and dilated colon with multiple loops. The Preston et al. (1985) study, referenced by six studies in this review, proposes that rectosigmoid diameter at the pelvic brim exceeding 6.5 cm as diagnostic. Gladman et al. (2007) reported weaknesses with this study involving their choice of control group, despite its use by many later reports. A mean sigmoid diameter around 10 cm is suggested. The sigmoid is often involved radiologically, but AMC may exclusively affect the proximal colon, for which this definition is not suitable.

Simple 2D imaging has limitations in assessing colonic diameters and variations occur between serial images. There seems little doubt that the increasing availability of CT colonography using standardised insufflation pressure will optimise the diagnosis of AMC. CT colonography has the advantage of being a quantitative imaging modality and offers an alternative approach to evaluate the colon and rectum following incomplete colonoscopy. Low radiation dose imaging is also possible with modern scanners. CT Colonography allows simple measurement of colonic diameters and length from multiple views, has shorter procedure times, does not require recovery supervision and carries less procedural risks than traditional colonoscopy. It currently has a prominent role following incomplete colonoscopy - a common occurrence amongst patients with AMC. The use of this modality is limited in screening as biopsy and polypectomy cannot be performed.

Colonoscopy

Many colonoscopists seem confident about diagnosing AMC or colonic redundancy, although no objective criteria for diagnosis have been defined. This modality, does however, depend upon subjective interpretation. AMC or colonic redundancy have been associated with incomplete colonoscopy, as a result, may not be the most appropriate investigation for this population group. Hanson et al. (2007), analysed the colonic length of patients with redundant colon during colonoscopy using CT colonography. This study reported patients with incomplete colonoscopy as having colonic lengths exceeding 200 cm, often reported as redundant colon during colonoscopy. Colonic redundancy was defined as elongated and tortuous colons or those with two or more acute flexures. Although the diagnosis of AMC was not pursued in this study, it may suggest that CT colonography is a useful modality to diagnose abnormal colonic dimensions, both in terms of length, diameter and possibly volume.

### Acute colonic disease: how to image in emergency [^63fe8643]. European Journal of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

The diseases affecting the large intestine represent a diagnostic problem in adult patients with acute abdomen, especially when clinical symptoms are not specific. The role of the diagnostic imaging is to help clinicians and surgeons in differential diagnosis for an efficient early and prompt therapy to perform. This review article summarizes the imaging spectrum of findings of colonic acute disease, from mechanical obstruction to inflammatory diseases and perforation, offering keys to problem solving in doubtful cases as well as discussing regarding the more indicated imaging method to use in emergency, particularly MDCT.
