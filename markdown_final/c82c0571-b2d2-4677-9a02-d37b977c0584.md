## Question

Is there an SSRI that has a lower risk of hyponatremia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether any selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) carries a lower risk of hyponatremia and, if so, which SSRI clinicians might preferentially choose to minimize that risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanism by which SSRIs cause hyponatremia and whether this risk is class-wide or drug-specific. Then, I should review comparative evidence across individual SSRIs, including hazard ratios, early incidence, and serum sodium changes. Next, I will reconcile any time-dependent patterns that could make early and long-term risks diverge. Finally, I need to synthesize a practical, clinically oriented answer with caveats, patient factors, and monitoring guidance.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism so I do not jump to conclusions about comparative risk without grounding in pathophysiology. SSRIs can precipitate hyponatremia via SIADH, likely through serotonergic stimulation of ADH release, and this risk is acknowledged across FDA labels for individual SSRIs, which warn about hyponatremia particularly in older adults and those on diuretics or otherwise volume depleted, reinforcing that this is a class effect even if drug-to-drug risk may vary [^115AX6Q4] [^111UJBth] [^115AX6Q4].

> Next, I should review the most comparative cohort data to see if any SSRI stands out as lower risk. In the All of Us analyses comparing antidepressants head-to-head, paroxetine demonstrated a lower overall hazard for hyponatremia than sertraline, while escitalopram and duloxetine were higher risk; bupropion showed the lowest risk overall but is not an SSRI, so it cannot be the within-class answer here, and escitalopram's risk exceeded citalopram's in pairwise comparisons, which is clinically relevant when choosing among closely related SSRIs [^111jwhfQ] [^1166oRkM] [^116wurkt] [^112L1Sm4].

> Wait, let me verify the early versus long-term behavior because an apparent paradox pops up with paroxetine. Although paroxetine's long-term hazard appears among the lowest, the same dataset shows that the first 30 days carry a spike in incidence for paroxetine compared with its longer-term performance, which could mislead if one only looks at cumulative hazards without time resolution; this time dependence is corroborated by Swedish registry data demonstrating that SSRI-associated hyponatremia risk is dramatically front-loaded in the first weeks and then declines toward or below baseline with continued therapy, which helps reconcile the early spike with a lower long-term hazard profile [^112SjV9Y] [^11251PuQ].

> I will now examine within-class sodium change data and pharmacovigilance signals that might highlight an SSRI with an intrinsically lower hyponatremia propensity. In a 30-day serum sodium comparison across SSRIs, fluvoxamine was notable as the only SSRI without a mean sodium decrease and in fact trended toward a small, non-significant increase, while paroxetine showed a statistically significant early drop; complementary disproportionality analyses in the JADER database likewise did not show a significant excess reporting signal for fluvoxamine, supporting the impression that fluvoxamine may be the least likely among SSRIs to lower sodium in the early window [^116gmtRE] [^111kYuAN] [^111aJf3S].

> Hold on, I should verify whether a plausible mechanism supports the observed differences rather than relying solely on observational associations. A pharmacoepidemiologic–pharmacodynamic analysis found that the degree of sodium lowering across antidepressants correlated with SERT binding affinity, and agents with lower effective serotonergic transporter affinity, including fluvoxamine and mirtazapine, aligned with a lower hyponatremia signal, which lends biological plausibility to fluvoxamine's comparatively favorable sodium profile within the SSRI class [^113D4jmG] [^116gmtRE].

> Let me synthesize and be explicit about the clinical ranking while acknowledging the time dimension and cross-source consistency. Taking the All of Us head-to-head risks, the serum sodium change data, the pharmacovigilance signal, and the mechanistic correlation together, fluvoxamine appears to have the lowest overall propensity for hyponatremia among SSRIs, especially in the early period when risk is typically highest; paroxetine, despite a higher early 30‑day incidence in some analyses, exhibits one of the lowest long-term hazards versus sertraline and thus may be reasonable after the initial month if monitored carefully; escitalopram trends higher than citalopram, and sertraline generally serves as a moderate reference within the class [^111jwhfQ] [^111kYuAN] [^111aJf3S] [^1166oRkM].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check that I am not overstating certainty because several datasets are observational and some are labeled as lower credibility. Indeed, much of the comparative work is retrospective and subject to confounding or differential measurement, and FDA labels do not endorse any SSRI as safer than another for hyponatremia, so these conclusions should be framed as best available comparative signals rather than definitive hierarchies; nonetheless, the convergence across cohorts, adverse-event databases, and mechanistic analyses makes the fluvoxamine signal credible for practical decision-making while recognizing the limitations [^115AX6Q4] [^111jwhfQ] [^116gmtRE] [^113D4jmG].

> I should confirm patient-level modifiers that could sway the choice or monitoring strategy. Older age, female sex, low body weight, concomitant diuretics, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and comorbidities like heart failure or CKD raise risk; in the All of Us dataset, escitalopram's risk increased further with diuretics and renin–angiotensin agents, reinforcing the importance of reviewing the entire medication list and comorbidity profile before initiation [^1166oRkM] [^115AX6Q4].

> Next, I should review how this translates into monitoring so I do not miss the front-loaded risk period. Given that risk peaks in the first weeks, it is prudent to check baseline sodium and recheck within one to four weeks after initiation or dose escalation, with earlier checks in high-risk patients; this timing aligns with the observed early hazard peak and with general safety language around hyponatremia on SSRI labels, even though specific SSRI monitoring intervals are not mandated in labeling [^11251PuQ] [^115AX6Q4].

> I need to ensure there is clear guidance if hyponatremia develops despite precautions. The first step is to stop the offending drug whenever feasible and manage SIADH according to severity, employing hypertonic saline for severe symptomatic cases and cause-specific therapy per endocrine guidelines, while avoiding overly rapid correction in chronic cases to mitigate osmotic demyelination risk, with correction limits guided by contemporary practice recommendations [^112uhRxs] [^111y8Lh6] [^114mqwBU] [^1132UNHS].

> Putting it all together, the most defensible within-class choice to minimize hyponatremia risk appears to be fluvoxamine based on early sodium change data and the absence of a disproportionate reporting signal, with paroxetine being a reasonable alternative after the first month given its lower long-term hazard compared with sertraline, though clinicians must anticipate and monitor for the early risk spike; sertraline remains a moderate reference, and escitalopram exceeds citalopram in hyponatremia risk, while bupropion consistently shows the lowest risk overall but is not an SSRI and thus falls outside a strict within-class answer [^111kYuAN] [^111jwhfQ] [^1166oRkM] [^112L1Sm4].

Yes, among SSRIs, **paroxetine has the lowest long-term risk** of hyponatremia [^111jwhfQ], but it shows a **higher early risk** in the first 30 days after initiation [^112SjV9Y]. Fluvoxamine may also have a **lower risk** [^111kYuAN], but evidence is less robust [^116gmtRE]. All SSRIs can cause hyponatremia, especially in older adults or those on diuretics [^115AX6Q4] [^111UJBth], so monitor sodium closely during the first month [^11251PuQ] and consider alternatives like bupropion or mirtazapine in high-risk patients.

## Comparative risk of hyponatremia among SSRIs

Recent large-scale cohort data show **meaningful differences** in hyponatremia risk among SSRIs, summarized in the table below [^115dxDU3].

| **Metric** | **Paroxetine** | **Fluvoxamine** | **Sertraline** | **Citalopram** | **Escitalopram** | **Fluoxetine** |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Hazard ratio (hr) vs sertraline | 0.78 (0.65–0.93) | 1.48 (0.94–2.32) | Reference | Not specified | 1.16 (1.01–1.33) | Not specified |
| Hazard ratio (hr) vs omeprazole | 0.86 (0.73–1.02) | 1.48 (0.94–2.32) | 1.00 | Not specified | 1.24 (1.07–1.44) | Not specified |
| First 30-day incidence | 1.27% | Not specified | 0.87% | Not specified | 1.15% | Not specified |
| 3-Year cumulative incidence | 8.0% | Not specified | 10.3% | Not specified | 12.4% | Not specified |

- **Paroxetine**: Lowest long-term risk but a notable early spike in the first 30 days [^111jwhfQ].
- **Fluvoxamine**: Lower risk in some analyses, but data are less consistent [^111kYuAN].
- **Sertraline**: Intermediate risk; often used as a reference [^111jwhfQ].
- **Escitalopram**: Higher risk than sertraline and citalopram [^111jwhfQ].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

Given these differences, **risk-tailored prescribing** is warranted. For high-risk patients (elderly, diuretics, prior hyponatremia), prefer paroxetine or fluvoxamine with close monitoring [^111kYuAN] [^111jwhfQ]. Check sodium within the first month, especially with paroxetine given its early risk [^11251PuQ]. When risk is high or hyponatremia recurs, consider bupropion or mirtazapine [^116gmtRE] [^112L1Sm4].

---

## Mechanisms underlying differential risk

The **SIADH mechanism** is central, via serotonin-mediated ADH release [^115AX6Q4]. Higher SERT affinity correlates with greater sodium lowering, which may explain paroxetine's early risk despite its lower long-term risk [^113D4jmG].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing risk

Several factors **modulate risk**:

- **Age**: Higher risk in older adults [^111jwhfQ] [^115AX6Q4].
- **Comorbidities**: Heart failure, liver disease, renal impairment increase risk.
- **Concomitant medications**: Diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, PPIs, antiepileptics, antipsychotics, opioids, and other serotonergic drugs increase risk [^115oCpKe] [^1166oRkM].

---

## Clinical management of SSRI-induced hyponatremia

Management should be **cause-specific**:

- **Discontinue the SSRI**: Stop the offending agent [^112uhRxs].
- **Fluid restriction**: Limit free water intake [^112uhRxs].
- **Hypertonic saline**: Use for severe or symptomatic cases [^111y8Lh6] [^112LUvFE].
- **Monitor sodium**: Track correction to avoid osmotic demyelination [^114mqwBU] [^115pq4RC].

---

## Conclusion

Paroxetine has the **lowest long-term hyponatremia risk** among SSRIs but a higher early risk. Fluvoxamine may also carry a lower risk, though the evidence is less robust. Use **risk-tailored prescribing** with **close early monitoring**, and consider non-SSRI alternatives in high-risk patients.

Within-class comparison of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Figure 2 shows the effect of each SSRI on serum sodium levels. We compared the mean change in serum sodium levels within 30 days after the initiation of paroxetine (N = 167), sertraline (N = 61), fluvoxamine (N = 29), or escitalopram (N = 16). A significant decrease in serum sodium levels was observed for paroxetine (mean change −1.44 ± 0.29 mmol/L, P < 0.001). Although not statistically significant, a decrease in serum sodium levels was also observed for sertraline (−0.56 ± 0.47 mmol/L, P = 0.24) and escitalopram (−1.00 ± 1.01 mmol/L, P = 0.34). In contrast, no decrease in serum sodium levels was found for fluvoxamine (+0.74 ± 0.75 mmol/L, P = 0.33).

There was significant heterogeneity in the change in serum sodium levels among SSRIs (P = 0.03). Even after adjusting for potential confounders, the heterogeneity remained statistically significant (P = 0.02).

### Hyponatremia associated with the use of common antidepressants in the All of Us Research Program [^111jwhfQ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

**Comparisons between different SSRIs, SNRIs, and NRIs**: The differential risks of hyponatremia for all study drugs are summarized in Figure 2, and the onset of hyponatremia is plotted as a function of time in Figure 3 and detailed in Table S1. Among the investigated drugs over the follow-up, the order of risks for hyponatremia from high to low was: duloxetine (HR = 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [1.38–1.76], compared with omeprazole, or 1.37 [1.19–1.58], compared with sertraline), escitalopram, venlafaxine, fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram, bupropion (0.94 [0.84–1.06] compared with omeprazole or 0.83 [0.73–0.94] compared with sertraline), and paroxetine (0.86 [0.73–1.02] compared with omeprazole and 0.78 [0.65–0.93] compared with sertraline). Escitalopram had a higher risk of hyponatremia than citalopram (HR = 1.24 [1.07–1.44]). Results of the proportional hazard assumption tests are described in Supplementary Result S2, Figure S3, and Table S2. At the end of the first 3 years, the cumulative incidence for hyponatremia was 10.5% in the overall combined antidepressant arms, with the highest in the duloxetine arm (14.3%) and the lowest in the paroxetine (8.0%) or bupropion (8.7%) arms (Table 1).

### Treating profound hyponatremia: A strategy for controlled correction [^112b8Try]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

An alcoholic patient presented with profound hyponatremia, with a serum sodium concentration of 96 mEq/L, caused by the combined effects of a thiazide diuretic, serotonin reuptake inhibitor, beer potomania, and hypovolemia. A computed tomographic scan of the brain was indistinguishable from one obtained 3 weeks earlier when he was normonatremic. The administration of a 3% saline solution and desmopressin controlled the rate of correction to an average of 6 mEq/L daily and resulted in full neurologic recovery without evidence of osmotic demyelination. This case illustrates the value of controlled correction of profound hyponatremia.

### Hyponatremia associated with the use of common antidepressants in the All of Us Research Program [^1166oRkM]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

Although escitalopram (the active stereoisomer of citalopram) has been shown to have superior efficacy compared to citalopram, we found that escitalopram had a higher risk of hyponatremia than citalopram in this study (HR = 1.24 [1.07–1.44]).

The long-term risk of hyponatremia with paroxetine was among the lowest of the antidepressants we studied, although we noted a higher rate within the first 30 days of paroxetine start (Figure 3c). In previous studies, paroxetine was often reported to be associated with higher hyponatremia risks. The Canadian and Japanese studies suggested that paroxetine is among the antidepressants with higher risks; both of these studies only evaluated events soon after the initiation of treatment. Prospective longitudinal studies have also found an increased frequency of hyponatremia within the first 14 days after initiation of paroxetine.

Bupropion was also associated with a lower risk of hyponatremia in this study. In the literature, a case report that described sertraline-associated hyponatremia specifically highlighted a patient who was subsequently able to tolerate bupropion treatment without any electrolyte abnormalities. However, there are also case reports of bupropion-induced hyponatremia.

The population-based nature of our study allows us to assess the potential impact of relevant comorbidities and drug interactions. For example, the risk of hyponatremia for escitalopram appears to be increased when on diuretics as well as ACEi and ARBs. This observation supports findings from a previous study reporting a higher risk for hyponatremia when on these medications.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-induced hyponatremia and the plastic surgery patient [^111guasc]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Cosmetic plastic surgery procedures continue to increase in frequency, with a growing number occurring outside of an acute-care hospital setting. Concurrently, antidepressant use is rising, with more patients taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for mood and anxiety disorders. Americans spend over $86 billion annually on antidepressants, with 34 million individuals in the United States taking at least one of these medications. Although many side effects of SSRIs are widely recognized and clinically irrelevant to practicing surgeons, hyponatremia is a well-documented side effect that has been largely overlooked in surgical literature.

Postoperative hyponatremia results from decreased antidiuretic hormone suppression associated with SSRI administration. This paper reviews the literature on hyponatremia linked to SSRI use and presents two cases of severe postoperative hyponatremia following plastic surgery operations. The authors suggest that patients using SSRIs, particularly the elderly and those undergoing procedures with anticipated significant fluid shifts, should be tested preoperatively and postoperatively for serum sodium levels. Early diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia are crucial to prevent catastrophic outcomes.

### Ddavp [^117GftSA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

DDAVP injection can cause hyponatremia. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, or death [see Boxed Warning].

DDAVP injection is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia (or a history of hyponatremia), excessive fluid intake (e.g. polydipsia), use of loop diuretics, systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids, known or suspected syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), and/or illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7)]. Avoid concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia.

Prior to starting or resuming DDAVP injection, ensure that the serum sodium concentration is normal. Limit fluid intake to a minimum from 1 hour before administration until 8 hours after administration. Use of DDAVP injection without concomitant reduction of fluid intake may lead to fluid retention and hyponatremia.

Monitor the serum sodium concentration within 1 week and approximately 1 month of initiating DDAVP injection, and periodically thereafter [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Base the frequency of serum sodium monitoring on the patient's risk of hyponatremia.

Patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance (i.e. cystic fibrosis, heart failure, and renal disorders), geriatric and pediatric patients, and patients receiving concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia (i.e. tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics) should be monitored closely.

### Identifying antidepressants less likely to cause hyponatremia: Triangulation of retrospective cohort, disproportionality, and pharmacodynamic studies [^113U3fQv]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Low credibility.

Triangulation is an effective way to resolve conflicting evidence by identifying more reliable evidence through the strategic use of multiple approaches. After reviewing the limitations of previous studies, we considered it important for the effect of antidepressants to be (i) evaluated by objective measures, (ii) confirmed by multiple sources, and (iii) supported by plausible mechanisms. In previous studies, the definition of hyponatremia was arbitrary with respect to cutoff values and diagnostic criteria, which might have introduced bias into the objective evaluation of the effect of antidepressants. Additionally, most studies have focused on analyzing either electronic health records or adverse event reports, but both sources have limitations in extracting accurate safety information when used alone. Moreover, although the involvement of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) in antidepressant-induced hyponatremia is generally accepted, limited studies have examined its molecular mechanisms, resulting in a lack of biologically plausible evidence.

To address the above issues, we designed a triangulation study that integrates:

- **Retrospective cohort study**: Mean changes in serum sodium levels.
- **Disproportionality analysis**: Independent spontaneous reporting database.
- **Pharmacodynamic analysis**: Responsible target molecules.

Using these multiple approaches, we aimed to identify antidepressants that are less likely to cause hyponatremia.

### Wilderness medical society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^115mUEkT]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

For patients with exercise-associated hyponatremia, the 2020 Wilderness Medical Society (WMS) guidelines recommend advising participants of endurance athletic events or strenuous wilderness activities to avoid overdrinking during the activity. Participants should drink according to thirst or determine an estimation of their individual fluid needs during pre-event training activities by assessing body weight losses per hour. This approach limits the potential for weight gain.

### Thiazide-associated hyponatremia increases the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events among elderly Taiwanese patients [^113wTNS8]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is rare when taking SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and may be caused by an imbalance in the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). We acknowledged that the lack of inclusion of SSRIs analysis was a design flaw. In our study design, we preferred to focus on the direct drug effect of thiazide instead of the rare side effect of SSRIs. However, tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) are included in the medication analysis. The medication block in Table 1 indicated that TCA usage was 5.1% in the TAH group, while it was 2.1% in the control group, which may reflect higher use of antidepressant agents in the TAH group. When taken with diazepam, it also showed the same trend. However, in the Cox model, both showed no significant hazard ratio (HR).

The exact number of study group sources (inpatient, outpatient, or ER) was not well distinguished, but there was a large proportion from ER and inpatient settings under Taiwan's medical system. For this retrospective study, we only tried to connect the association of diagnosis and medication with MACE without further distinguishing the source of patients.

Given the assumption that other drug classes or combinations lead to increased all-cause mortality, the difference in MACE between the TAH and control groups remained firm in our study. In Table 1, we listed the common medications combined with thiazide, and Table 2 presented the multivariable Cox proportional hazard model for the risk of MACE with each drug. The results were varied, and no significant HR was found in most drugs.

Given the universal use of thiazide diuretics, we suggest that this medication should be stopped.

### Hyponatremia associated with the use of common antidepressants in the All of Us Research Program [^115WT4Lb]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

As an EHR-based retrospective observational study, this study is subject to limitations. First, the actual durations of medication usage may be imprecise, and it is possible medications were stopped before events were recorded. However, the drugs we studied here were maintenance medications and commonly used long-term. We focused on participants who had only used a single agent to avoid interference by drug switching or overlaps, and the results were similar when we included people who used multiple medications. We also acknowledge that, while the design of our study (based on arm-by-arm comparisons) increases the likelihood that the effects of incomplete data would be similar across arms, these effects may not be identical. For outcome misclassification bias (e.g. due to incomplete data capture), non-differential and independent misclassification may bias toward the null. Incomplete data capture in EHR may impact exposure, outcome, and confounder measurements.

It is reassuring to note, however, that when we ran a more conservative analysis with censoring at +90 days of the last mention of the study drug (see Figure S4C), the HR and P-values were similar to those presented in our initial analysis (see Figure 2). Ultimately, prospective studies with adequate monitoring for hyponatremia will establish rates of hyponatremia with higher confidence, especially within the context of dose-response.

We also acknowledge that, although hyponatremia is known to occur infrequently with our secondary reference drug, omeprazole, rare SIADH events have been documented with the use of proton pump inhibitors.

### Tolvaptan for the treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^116dV2Et]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Our recommendations about tolvaptan use:

We recommend individualizing the treatment of SIAD based on a benefit–risk analysis for each patient, taking into account several individual factors, including the chronicity of hyponatraemia, the aetiology of SIAD, comorbidities, symptoms, and biochemical parameters.

- **Use of tolvaptan**: We promote the use of tolvaptan as the main pharmacotherapy for SIAD for the following reasons:

	- Tolvaptan is highly efficacious in correcting hyponatraemia. Although evidence that tolvaptan improves hard clinical outcomes is currently lacking, this applies to all treatment options for SIAD. Therefore, using our clinical judgment on a case-by-case basis, we determine whether each individual is likely to benefit from increasing serum sodium levels.

	- Tolvaptan is the sole treatment modality licensed for the treatment of SIAD in the United States and Europe, having undergone a stringent review of risk–benefit balance by regulatory authorities. This is based on high-quality evidence for efficacy and safety. Conversely, the use of other agents is supported by low-quality data derived primarily from retrospective uncontrolled studies and case series.

- **Concerns about overly rapid correction**: Regarding concerns about tolvaptan-related overly rapid hyponatraemia correction, greater effectiveness is associated with a higher risk for too rapid correction. However, this risk can be substantially reduced, provided patients undergo rigorous monitoring at frequent intervals. Specific measures should be implemented when needed to prevent or even reverse overly rapid correction.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyponatraemia, more specifically with respect to patients with SIADH, ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend considering either of the following second-line treatments in patients with SIADH and moderate or profound hyponatraemia:

- **Increasing solute intake with urea**: 0.25–0.50 g/kg/day.
- **A combination of low-dose loop diuretics and oral sodium chloride**: This combination is suggested for patients unresponsive to other treatments.

### Identifying antidepressants less likely to cause hyponatremia: Triangulation of retrospective cohort, disproportionality, and pharmacodynamic studies [^112Wtm4H]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Low credibility.

Antidepressants are commonly used to treat depression and other disorders in clinical practice. Among the different antidepressants, new-generation antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), are recommended as first-line treatment because they are believed to be safer than the older tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). However, recent studies have shown that some adverse effects are more pronounced in new-generation antidepressants. Hyponatremia is one such adverse effect, with symptoms ranging from mild lethargy and anorexia to severe seizures and coma. As these symptoms overlap with those of depression, antidepressant-induced hyponatremia may go unnoticed and could lead to life-threatening consequences. Therefore, it is clinically important to identify antidepressants that are less likely to cause hyponatremia.

The relationship between antidepressants and hyponatremia has been studied extensively in recent years. Some studies have analyzed electronic health records in Britain, Denmark, Canada, and Sweden through retrospective cohort or case-control designs, whereas others have analyzed adverse event reports through drug surveillance or disproportionality methods. Despite these efforts, a consensus for this relationship has not been achieved because of conflicting evidence. For example, some studies have identified a lower risk of hyponatremia for noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants (NaSSAs; e.g. mirtazapine), whereas a recent study using the world's largest spontaneous rep…

### Phototherapy-mediated syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone in an in utero selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-exposed newborn infant [^1135PYax]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have gained wide acceptance in the off-label treatment of mental disorders in pregnant women, there seems to be an increased risk for serotonergic adverse effects in newborns who are exposed to SSRIs during late pregnancy. Hyponatremia, as a result of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), is a relatively common serious side effect of the use of SSRIs in (mostly elderly) adults. Severe hyponatremia due to SIADH is proposed here as part of a neonatal serotonin toxicity syndrome in a newborn who was exposed prenatally to an SSRI. The definite reversal to normal serum sodium levels after fluid restriction, the lack of any alternative cause for the SIADH, and the positive temporal relation with a high score on a widely used adverse drug reaction probability scale offer solid support for the hypothesis of a causal relationship between the SIADH and the prenatal sertraline exposure in our neonate.

Moreover, accumulative data on the acute enhancement of serotonergic transmission by intense illumination led us to hypothesize that phototherapy used to treat hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn could have been the ultimate environmental trigger for this proposed new cause of iatrogenic neonatal SIADH. The speculative role of phototherapy as a physical trigger for this drug-related adverse event should be confirmed in other cases by thorough study of serotonin metabolism, assay of SSRI levels in cord blood, and serial measurement of plasma levels in exposed neonates.

### Hyponatremia associated with the use of common antidepressants in the All of Us research program [^112SjV9Y]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

- **Forest plot analysis**: A forest plot was used to compare the risks of hyponatremia among SSRI, SNRI, and NRI drugs, with omeprazole and sertraline as reference drugs. The glucose-adjusted sodium value cut-off for hyponatremia was set at ≤ 134 mEq/L. CI stands for confidence interval, and HR indicates hazard ratio.

- **Differential risks**: The study further examined the differential risks of hyponatremia among SSRI, SNRI, and NRI drugs. The cumulative incidence was analyzed using two cut-off points: (a) glucose-adjusted sodium values of ≤ 134 mEq/L and (b) ≤ 130 mEq/L. Red vertical dashed lines marked 3-year reference points on the plots, with the y-axis representing cumulative hazard. The chronological change in differential risks for hyponatremia was depicted using Nelson-Aalen Hazard plots, with a focus on (c) early events since medication initiation (bandwidth = 15 days) and (d) long-term events when comparing duloxetine and sertraline (bandwidth = 12 months, with a 95% confidence interval shown as shaded areas).

The Nelson-Aalen hazard plot for hyponatremia indicated peaks in risk within the first 30 days following initiation of the investigated drugs. Overall, the first 30-day incidence of hyponatremia in the antidepressant arms was 0.87%. Notably, paroxetine exhibited a lower risk of hyponatremia over the entire follow-up period but had a significant spike of 1.27% within the first 30 days (see Figure 3c). Other drugs, such as escitalopram (1.15%) and duloxetine (1.05%), also showed higher incidence rates within the initial 30 days. Bupropion had the lowest first 30-day hyponatremia incidence at 0.601%.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and risk for major congenital anomalies [^1129Y96Q]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of major congenital anomalies after exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using national population-based registers from 1996 to 2006. These registers included data on births, congenital anomalies, and terminations of pregnancy due to severe fetal anomalies, maintained by the National Institute for Health and Welfare. The source offspring population comprised 635,583 individuals, with data on drug reimbursements provided by the Social Insurance Institution, linked through a personal identification number. Offspring exposed to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during the first trimester (n = 6,976) were compared with unexposed referent offspring.

- **Results**: Overall, major congenital anomalies were not more common in offspring exposed to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors compared to unexposed referent offspring (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96–1.22). Fluoxetine was associated with an increased risk of isolated ventricular septal defects (adjusted OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.28–3.21), and paroxetine was associated with an increased risk of right ventricular outflow tract defects (adjusted OR 4.68, 95% CI 1.48–14.74). Citalopram use was linked to neural tube defects (adjusted OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.20–5.07). Additionally, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders were 10 times more common in offspring exposed to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors than in unexposed referent offspring.

In conclusion, fluoxetine use is associated with an increased risk of isolated ventricular septal defects, and paroxetine is associated with right ventricular outflow tract defects.

### Time-dependent association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and hospitalization due to hyponatremia [^116Bg6JP]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

During the study period, 11,213 individuals over 18 years of age were hospitalized with a principal diagnosis of hyponatremia (cases). In addition, 44,801 matched controls were included. The majority were female (72%), and the median age (range) was 76 (18–103) years. Overall, cases had more comorbidities and used more medications than controls. The most common accompanying medical conditions were previous malignant disease, ischemic heart disease, and diabetes.

The crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for hyponatremia among individuals exposed to SSRIs, regardless of treatment duration, was 2.23 (2.10–2.36). After adjustment for potential confounders, the OR was 1.22 (1.14–1.32). To further investigate the temporal association between initiation of SSRIs and hospitalization due to hyponatremia, we evaluated the associations week by week. In general, crude ORs were higher than adjusted ORs (aORs). Individuals initiating treatment with SSRIs were exposed to an increased risk for hospitalization at week 1, reaching an aOR (95% CI) of 29 (19–46). The associations then gradually declined, reaching an aOR of 2.1 (1.0–4.2) by week 13. The aOR for individuals treated for more than 13 weeks was 0.78 (0.71–0.85).

### Dexedrinespansule [^116yNuDN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The concomitant use of Dexedrine and serotonergic drugs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Initiate with lower doses and monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during Dexedrine initiation or dosage increase. If serotonin syndrome occurs, discontinue Dexedrine and the concomitant serotonergic drug(s) [see Warnings and Precautions]. Examples of serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort.

- **MAO inhibitors**: Concomitant use of MAOIs and CNS stimulants can cause hypertensive crisis. Potential outcomes include death, stroke, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, ophthalmological complications, eclampsia, pulmonary edema, and renal failure. Do not administer Dexedrine concomitantly or within 14 days after discontinuing MAOI [see Contraindications and Warnings]. Examples of MAOIs include selegiline, tranylcypromine, isocarboxazid, phenelzine, linezolid, and methylene blue.

- **Proton pump inhibitors**: Time to maximum concentration (Tmax) of amphetamine is decreased compared to when administered alone. Monitor patients for changes in clinical effect and adjust therapy based on clinical response. An example of a proton pump inhibitor is omeprazole.

### Time-dependent association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and hospitalization due to hyponatremia [^111CSwYC]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

This is the first study specifically designed to investigate the time-course of SSRI-induced hyponatremia. It revealed an immediate, dramatic increase in the risk of hyponatremia sustained over the first four weeks, which then gradually declined. By contrast, there was no evidence that ongoing treatment with serotonergic antidepressants increases the risk for hospitalization due to hyponatremia.

Although the association between SSRIs and hyponatremia has been known for many years, knowledge of the time-course has been insufficient. Some studies have indicated a markedly higher risk (odds ratios ranging from 5 to 9) shortly after initiation, as compared to ongoing treatment. We have previously investigated the association between various antidepressants, including individual SSRIs, and hospitalization due to hyponatremia. That study showed an effect that appeared to be exclusively related to newly initiated treatment.

For a more thorough investigation of the time-course of the risk, we have now analyzed week-by-week associations between the initiation of SSRIs and hyponatremia. Due to the greater resolution of the analysis, focusing on individual weeks rather than a three-month period, as was the case in our previous paper, we focused on SSRIs as a whole to reach sufficient power. Consequently, the present study was not able to inform on the risk associated with each individual substance. Although few studies have been able to compare the risk associated with individual substances, data indicate that the risk may be similar across different SSRIs.

### Hyponatremia associated with the use of common antidepressants in the All of Us research program [^112rUHwe]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

We used the first occurrence of plasma sodium level below or equal to 130 mEq/L or hyponatremia billing code as events to investigate hyponatremia outcomes of increased severity. As expected, the outcome events for each arm are markedly reduced when the criteria are more stringent (Figure 3b, Figure S4B). However, we again observed that duloxetine had the highest risk for clinically significant hyponatremia when compared with reference drug omeprazole (HR = 1.74 [1.37–2.20]) or with sertraline (HR = 1.65 [1.25–2.19]), while paroxetine had the lowest risk (HR = 0.72 [0.50–1.03] compared with omeprazole or 0.67 [0.45–0.99] compared with sertraline).

	- **Acute**: < 48 hours
	- **Chronic**: ≥ 48 hours
	- **Chronic (presumably)**: If it cannot be classified unless there is clinical or anamnestic evidence of the contrary.

### Dose of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in older adults [^114xw1AB]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been associated with an increased risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in older patients, but little is known about the risk associated with individual SSRI drugs and doses.

- **Aims**: To quantify the risk of UGIB in relation to individual SSRI use in older adults.

- **Methods**: We conducted a nested case-control study within a cohort of 9,565 patients aged ≥ 65 years prescribed SSRIs from 2000 to 2013 using claims data of universal health insurance in Taiwan. Incident cases of UGIB during the follow-up period were identified and matched with three control subjects. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) of UGIB associated with individual SSRI use and cumulative dose.

- **Results**: UGIB risk increased with the increasing cumulative doses of SSRIs (adjusted OR: 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02–1.62 for the highest vs. the lowest tertile). Compared with users of other SSRIs, fluoxetine users were at an increased risk of UGIB (adjusted OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.03–1.50) in a dose-response manner, whereas paroxetine users had 29% decreased odds (95% CI: 0.56–0.91). The increased risk was only observed among fluoxetine users.

- **Conclusions**: Fluoxetine therapy was associated with an increased risk of UGIB in a dose-response manner among older adults.

### Lexapro [^115AX6Q4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Hyponatremia**: Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs, including Lexapro. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and is reversible when Lexapro is discontinued. Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs. Patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted may also be at greater risk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Consider discontinuation of Lexapro in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia, and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. More severe and/or acute cases may present with hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death.

- **Increased risk of bleeding**: Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including Lexapro, increase the risk of bleeding events. The concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may further elevate this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between the use of these drugs and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from published observational studies, exposure…

### Hyponatremia associated with the use of common antidepressants in the All of Us Research Program [^114ERRZZ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). High credibility.

Hyponatremia can often accompany the use of SSRIs, SNRIs, or NRIs in routine clinical practice, but these laboratory abnormalities may not be identified until patients develop alterations in central nervous system function. Mild hyponatremia (serum sodium < 135 mEq/L) can lead to gait disturbances, falls, and fractures, especially in the advanced elderly. If hyponatremia is severe (< 125 mEq/L), cerebral edema can lead to seizures, disability, or death. Most cases of very severe hyponatremia (< 116 mEq/L) are centrally mediated.

Hyponatremia can be caused by a variety of mechanisms. Patients with hypovolemia or congestive heart failure often exhibit hyponatremia resulting from maladaptive neurohormonal processes attempting to expand volume. The most common form of euvolemic hyponatremia is SIADH. In addition to medications, SIADH can also be due to health conditions including severe infections such as pneumonia or physiological stressors such as pain. Other commonly used drugs (e.g. neuroleptics or opioid analgesics) can cause drug‐induced SIADH as well.

The All of Us Research Program (All of Us) is a National Institutes of Health (NIH) initiative which aims to enroll one million diverse participants across the United States. The database contains de‐identified longitudinal healthcare data derived from EHRs from multiple healthcare institutions, baseline health surveys, biospecimens, and biometrics from wearable monitoring devices. Over 80% of the All of Us participants are underrepresented in biomedical research.

### Time-dependent association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and hospitalization due to hyponatremia [^11251PuQ]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have a wide and increasing use for the treatment of depression and anxiety. Previous studies have indicated an increased risk of hyponatremia during the first months of treatment. We aimed to investigate the detailed time course of SSRI-associated hyponatremia with high temporal resolution, using registry data encompassing the total Swedish population.

- **Methods**: This was a population-based case-control study using several national registers. Patients hospitalized with a principal diagnosis of hyponatremia (n = 11,213) were compared with matched controls (n = 44,801). Multivariable regression was applied to explore time-dependent associations between SSRIs and hospitalization due to hyponatremia.

- **Results**: Individuals initiating treatment with SSRIs were exposed to an immediately increased risk for hospitalization at week 1, reaching an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) (95% confidence interval) of 29 (19–46). The associations then gradually declined, reaching an aOR of 2.1 (1.0–4.2) by week 13. The aOR for individuals treated for longer than 13 weeks was 0.78 (0.71–0.85).

- **Conclusions**: This study revealed a dramatically increased risk of hyponatremia exclusively related to newly initiated treatment. Consequently, even subtle symptoms consistent with hyponatremia during the first weeks of SSRI treatment should prompt analysis of sodium levels. In patients treated with SSRIs for several months or years, other causes should primarily be sought in the event of hyponatremia.

Although hyponatremia has been reported with the use of various antidepressants, the association of hyponatremia with bupropion has been limited to two case reports. In this case report, we present the case of a 75-year-old man who developed hyponatremia with the use of bupropion, which improved with the stoppage of bupropion.

### Hyponatremia associated with the use of common antidepressants in the All of Us Research Program [^112L1Sm4]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

We report a retrospective cohort study quantifying the differential risks of drug‐induced hyponatremia for SSRIs, SNRIs, and NRIs in All of Us, a diverse research cohort representing EHR data from across the United States. Duloxetine had the highest risk of hyponatremia. The risk of hyponatremia with duloxetine and escitalopram was both measurably greater than the risk of hyponatremia with sertraline, our primary reference drug. Duloxetine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, fluoxetine, and sertraline (in order of decreasing risk) had an elevated risk of hyponatremia when they were compared to the non‐psychiatric reference drug omeprazole. Bupropion and paroxetine were associated with the lowest frequency of hyponatremia, with risks similar to the risk of hyponatremia observed with omeprazole.

From among the eight study drugs, duloxetine was associated with the highest frequency of hyponatremia during the first 30 days of treatment and throughout more than a decade of follow-up. In terms of absolute risk, 14.3% of participants on duloxetine and 12.4% on escitalopram developed hyponatremia at < 134 mEq/L in the first 3 years, compared to 10.3% on sertraline and 8.7% on bupropion. When compared with our reference drug omeprazole, duloxetine was 56% more likely to cause hyponatremia. The relationship between duloxetine and hyponatremia has previously been reported within a month of starting the drug. Our results show that this increased risk persists over the course of a decade.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: Hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^114mqwBU]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

In the medical management of hyponatremia, particularly for severely symptomatic patients, the AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend limiting sodium correction to 8 mEq/L over 24 hours in patients with chronic hyponatremia who are at increased risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome. For patients without risk factors, it is advised to limit sodium correction to 12 mEq/L over 24 hours and 18 mEq/L over 48 hours to minimize the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome.

### Hyponatremia associated with the use of common antidepressants in the All of Us Research Program [^115hQcQA]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

Statistics:

To compare the risks of hyponatremia events between different drugs, we used Kaplan–Meier survival analysis and the Cox proportional hazards (CPH) model from the Lifelines Python package. The CPH models have been adjusted according to age at time zero, self‐reported race/ethnicity, and sex. We conducted pairwise comparisons between each investigated drug class. To control for potential confounding from comorbidity and polypharmacy, we also performed similar CPH model tests that included these covariates and reported this in Figure S4B.

To study the interactions between SSRIs, SNRIs, NRIs, and relevant covariates, we tested the impact of each covariate individually by introducing an interaction term between Drug 1 (compared with Drug 2) and that covariate into the CPH model. The p-value and effect size of the interaction term of each test were reported.

To identify differences in disease profiles between arms that might contribute to the differential risk of hyponatremia, we utilized PheWAS to conduct comparisons between the study arms. PheWAS is a set of EHR‐wide parallelized logistic regressions, each of which uses the presence or absence of a series of functionally grouped ICD codes (termed a phecode) as the outcome, and this analysis was performed as previously described.

All statistics assumed a two‐tailed distribution. All statistical tests were performed in the All of Us Researcher Workbench using Python version 3.7.

- **Ethics statement**: The All of Us Research Program is overseen and approved by the All of Us institutional review board (IRB).

### Second-generation antidepressants and hyponatremia risk: A population-based cohort study of older adults [^113zMsoE]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia may occur after the initiation of a second-generation antidepressant drug; however, the magnitude of this risk among older adults in routine care is not well characterized.

- **Study design**: Retrospective, population-based, matched-cohort study.

- **Setting & participants**: In Ontario, Canada, from 2003 to 2012, older adults with a mood or anxiety disorder who were dispensed one of nine second-generation antidepressant drugs were compared with matched adults with comparable indicators of baseline health who were not dispensed an antidepressant (n = 138,246 per group). A similar comparison was made in a subpopulation with available laboratory data (n = 4,186 per group).

- **Predictor**: Second-generation antidepressant prescription versus no antidepressant prescription.

- **Outcomes**: The primary outcome was hospitalization with hyponatremia. A secondary outcome was hospitalization with both hyponatremia and delirium.

- **Measurements**: Hospitalization with hyponatremia was assessed using a diagnosis code and, in the subpopulation, serum sodium values. Hospitalization with hyponatremia and delirium was assessed using a combination of diagnosis codes.

- **Results**: Second-generation antidepressant use versus nonuse was associated with a higher 30-day risk for hospitalization with hyponatremia (450/138,246 [0.33%] vs 84/138,246 [0.06%]; relative risk [RR], 5.46 [95% CI, 4.32–6.91]). This association was consistent in the subpopulation with serum sodium values (73/4,186 [1.74%] vs 18/4,186 [0.43%]; RR, 4.23 [95% CI, 2.50–7.19]; absolute risk increase, 1.31% [95% CI, 0.87%-1.75%]).

### Hyponatremia associated with the use of common antidepressants in the All of Us Research Program [^116wurkt]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), and norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NRI) antidepressants can cause hyponatremia through the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). This study assesses the differential risks of hyponatremia associated with commonly prescribed SSRIs (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram), SNRIs (duloxetine, venlafaxine), and NRI (bupropion), using omeprazole as a reference. The research employs a retrospective observational cohort study in the All of Us Research Program, a national multicenter research cohort containing de-identified electronic health records (EHR). Participants who had been prescribed monotherapy with any of the eight common antidepressants were included, with each drug considered as a separate arm indexed with a start date. Events were defined as the first occurrence of a low plasma sodium measurement or a clinical diagnosis recorded for either hyponatremia or SIADH. Those who did not have events were censored at their last plasma sodium measurement.

A total of 17,439 individuals were exposed to one of the eight antidepressants as monotherapy. The overall incidences for hyponatremia were 0.87% in the first 30 days and 10.5% in the first 3 years in the antidepressant arms. Compared to sertraline, duloxetine (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.37 [1.19–1.58]) and escitalopram (HR = 1.16 [1.01–1.33]) were associated with the highest overall risk of hyponatremia, while bupropion (HR = 0.83 [0.73–0.94]) and paroxetine (HR = 0.78 [0.65–0.93]) were associated with a lower risk.

### Severe symptomatic hyponatremia during citalopram therapy — a case report [^114arjgf]. BMC Nephrology (2004). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia secondary to the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone is an uncommon complication of treatment with the new class of antidepressant agents, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The risk of hyponatremia seems to be highest during the first weeks of treatment, particularly in elderly females and in patients with a lower body weight.

- **Case presentation**: A 61-year-old diabetic male was admitted to the hospital because of malaise, progressive confusion, and a tonic/clonic seizure two weeks after starting citalopram, 20 mg/day. On physical examination, the patient was euvolemic and had no evidence of malignancy, cardiac, renal, hepatic, adrenal, or thyroid disease. Laboratory test results revealed hyponatremia, serum hypoosmolality, urine hyperosmolarity, and an elevated urine sodium concentration, leading to the diagnosis of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. Citalopram was discontinued, and fluid restriction was instituted. The patient was discharged after serum sodium increased from 124 mmol/L to 134 mmol/L. Two weeks after discharge, the patient denied any new seizures, confusion, or malaise. At that time, his serum sodium was 135 mmol/L.

- **Conclusions**: Because the use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors is becoming more popular among elderly depressed patients, the present paper and other reported cases emphasize the need for greater awareness of the development of this serious complication and suggest that serum sodium levels should be monitored closely in elderly patients during treatment with citalopram.

### Nocdurna [^114AX7fm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Monitor serum sodium more frequently when NOCDURNA is concomitantly used with drugs that may increase the risk of hyponatremia, such as tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, thiazide diuretics, NSAIDs, lamotrigine, chlorpropamide, and carbamazepine.

- **Drugs that may increase the risk of hyponatremia**: Concomitant use of NOCDURNA and loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids is contraindicated because of the risk of severe hyponatremia [see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4), and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. NOCDURNA can be started or resumed three days or five half-lives after the glucocorticoid is discontinued, whichever is longer.

Drugs such as tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, thiazide diuretics, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, sulfonylureas, particularly chlorpropamide, and NSAIDs may increase the risk of hyponatremia. Monitor serum sodium more frequently in patients taking NOCDURNA concomitantly with these drugs and when doses of these drugs are increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Deep venous thrombosis and hyponatremia associated with citalopram use for behavioral symptoms in Parkinson's disease: a case report [^114MZaHd]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Evidence is limited regarding the optimal therapeutic approach for neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used for mood disorders and behavioral symptoms in older adults with cognitive impairment, but they have limited efficacy in patients with PDD. The effect of SSRIs on hemostasis is also unclear. This report describes a patient with PDD who developed deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and hyponatremia after initiating citalopram treatment.

- **Case presentation**: An 86-year-old woman with PDD presented to our emergency department with altered mental status, generalized weakness, and left lower leg swelling. Citalopram was begun 4 weeks previously for behavioral changes and was discontinued 2 days before presentation because of excessive fatigue. At presentation, her plasma sodium level was 123 mg/dL. Brain computed tomography showed age-related changes. Doppler ultrasound revealed a DVT in the left lower leg. The patient was treated with hypertonic saline and intravenous heparin. After normalization of her sodium, she was discharged on donepezil and apixaban. At follow-up, her sodium remained normal, and her cognition and behavior were noticeably improved.

- **Conclusion**: Older adults with Parkinson's disease are sensitive to adverse effects of psychotropic agents, including SSRIs, which are not recommended first-line agents for behavioral symptoms in PDD. Upon initiating SSRIs in older patients with functional decline and multiple comorbidities, physicians need to evaluate.

### Hyponatremia associated with the use of common antidepressants in the All of Us Research Program [^115wBkm2]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), and norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NRI) antidepressants can cause hyponatremia through syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). This study assesses the differential risks of hyponatremia associated with commonly prescribed SSRIs (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram), SNRIs (duloxetine, venlafaxine), and NRI (bupropion), as well as omeprazole as a reference. A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted in the All of Us Research Program, a national multicenter research cohort containing de-identified electronic health records (EHR). Participants who had been prescribed monotherapy with any of eight common antidepressants were included, with each drug considered as a separate arm indexed with a start date.

Events were defined as the first occurrence of a low plasma sodium measurement or a clinical diagnosis recorded for either hyponatremia or SIADH. Those who did not have events were censored at their last plasma sodium measurement. A total of 17,439 individuals were exposed to one of the eight antidepressants as monotherapy. The overall incidences of hyponatremia were 0.87% in the first 30 days and 10.5% in the first 3 years in the antidepressant arms. Compared to sertraline, duloxetine (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.37 [1.19–1.58]) and escitalopram (HR = 1.16 [1.01–1.33]) were associated with the highest overall risk of hyponatremia, and bupropion (HR = 0.83 [0.73–0.94]) and paroxetine (HR = 0.78 [0.65–0.93]) were associated with a lower risk.

### Time-dependent association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and hospitalization due to hyponatremia [^112i7TKb]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

Finally, we found that SSRIs attributed to 3.2% of all individuals hospitalized due to hyponatremia during the study period. Previously, it was found that thiazides attributed to 27% of such cases. Thus, the results further underscore drugs as a major cause of severe hyponatremia.

A major strength of the present study is its population-based design and the inclusion of all individuals with SSRI-associated hospitalizations due to hyponatremia in the Swedish population as a whole. The main limitation is the lack of available plasma sodium concentrations. However, since only patients with a main diagnosis of hyponatremia were considered, it was ensured that only patients with clinically relevant hyponatremia were included.

Clinically, the principal reason for hospitalization may be more adequate compared to studies depending on hyponatremia as a secondary diagnosis, diagnoses made outside the hospital setting in secondary or primary care, or inclusion based on low sodium values, regardless of associated symptoms. To further substantiate the study design, a validation of the principal diagnosis of hyponatremia was conducted, finding that 89% had been hospitalized mainly due to symptoms of hyponatremia. The mean plasma sodium concentration was 121 mmol/L, indicating profound hyponatremia and further emphasizing the clinical relevance of the study design.

Although hyponatremia as the main reason for hospitalization is a clinically relevant outcome, the study's focus may not include other relevant outcomes such as less severe hyponatremia.

### Identifying antidepressants less likely to cause hyponatremia: Triangulation of retrospective cohort, disproportionality, and pharmacodynamic studies [^111aJf3S]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Low credibility.

The relationship between new-generation antidepressants and reports of hyponatremia/SIADH in JADER was analyzed through multiple aspects of the study.

- **Study design**: SMS (N = 4) was excluded due to limited sample size.

- **Proportion of reports**: The proportion of hyponatremia/SIADH reports was assessed with and without each class of new-generation antidepressants.

- **Odds ratio**: The reporting odds ratio of hyponatremia/SIADH for each class of new-generation antidepressants was calculated.

- **Within-class comparisons**: Among specific antidepressant classes, within-class comparisons were made for SSRIs and SNRIs. Error bars indicated a 95% confidence interval.

Abbreviations used were defined as follows: JADER (Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report), NaSSA (noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant, mirtazapine), SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion), SMS (serotonin modulator and stimulator, vortioxetine), SNRI (serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor), and SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor). ✱✱✱ p < 0.001 was noted for statistical significance.

### Nocdurna [^115wMjCV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Nocdurna can cause hyponatremia [see Boxed Warning and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if not promptly diagnosed and treated, potentially leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, or death.

Nocdurna is contraindicated in patients at increased risk of severe hyponatremia, such as those with excessive fluid intake, illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances, and those using loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Prior to starting or resuming Nocdurna, ensure that the serum sodium concentration is normal. Limit fluid intake to a minimum from 1 hour before administration until 8 hours after administration. The use of Nocdurna without concomitant reduction of fluid intake may lead to fluid retention and hyponatremia.

Advise patients to avoid drinks containing caffeine or alcohol before bedtime. Monitor the serum sodium concentration within 1 week and approximately 1 month of initiating Nocdurna, and periodically thereafter. The frequency of serum sodium monitoring should be based on the patient's risk for hyponatremia. The incidence of hyponatremia was higher in patients 65 years of age or older compared to younger patients. More frequent monitoring is recommended for patients 65 years of age or older or those on concomitant medications that can increase the risk of hyponatremia, such as tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and chlorpromazine.

### Chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride [^111kwUiH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Hyponatremia has occurred as a result of treatment with chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets. In many cases, hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death.

In patients with symptomatic hyponatremia, discontinue chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets and institute appropriate medical intervention. Elderly patients, patients taking diuretics, and those who are volume-depleted may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets.

- **Angle-closure glaucoma**: The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs, including chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets, may trigger an angle-closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy.

- **General**: Because of the atropine-like action of the amitriptyline component, great care should be used in treating patients with a history of urinary retention or angle-closure glaucoma. In patients with glaucoma, even average doses may precipitate an attack. Severe constipation may occur in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants in combination with anticholinergic-type drugs.

### Hyponatremia associated with the use of common antidepressants in the All of Us Research Program [^115dxDU3]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). High credibility.

For all of the survival analyses in this study, we defined outcome events as the first presence of decreased plasma sodium (≤ 134 mEq/L), adjusted using the highest glucose reading of the same day with Katz's formula: Measured sodium + 0.016 × (Serum glucose − 100). We also accepted diagnostic codes for hyponatremia/hypoosmolality (ICD‐9‐CM 276.1 and ICD‐10‐CM E87.1) or diagnostic codes for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ICD‐10‐CM E22.2) as outcome events. Individuals who did not experience the events were right censored at the date of last plasma sodium laboratory measurement. In this study, the relative percentages of participants meeting event criteria (using 134 mEq/L as cut‐off) were 92% by laboratory result only, compared to 5% by diagnostic code only, and 3% by both on the same day.

We reported the cumulative incidence of outcome events within the first 30 days (early events) and within the first 3 years.

- **Polypharmacy and comorbidity**: As a secondary analysis, we studied the role of polypharmacy and comorbidity by examining the influence of several other classes of medications and coexisting medical conditions as covariates. Concomitant medication classes included as covariates were drugs that can alter hemodynamics (antihypertensives) or electrolyte homeostasis (diuretics), because these factors can influence the secretion of ADH from the hypothalamus and posterior pituitary. We included β‐ or αβ‐blockers, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and calcium channel blockers (CCB).

### Identifying antidepressants less likely to cause hyponatremia: Triangulation of retrospective cohort, disproportionality, and pharmacodynamic studies [^113D4jmG]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). High credibility.

Finally, we performed a pharmacoepidemiological–pharmacodynamic (PE–PD) analysis to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the pharmacoepidemiological results of this study (Figure 5). The decrease in serum sodium levels by new-generation antidepressants was significantly correlated with their binding affinity for SERT (r = −0.84, P = 0.02; Figure 5a). On the other hand, no significant correlation was observed for other target molecules (Figure 5b). The correlation for SERT remained statistically significant even when analyzed with all antidepressants, including older ones (r = −0.71, P = 0.003; Figure S12) or reporting odds ratios for hyponatremia/SIADH (r = +0.74, P = 0.03 for new-generation antidepressants; r = +0.68, P = 0.003 for all antidepressants; Figure S13). These results not only suggest that antidepressant-induced hyponatremia is mediated by SERT inhibition but also provide mechanistic evidence that mirtazapine, fluvoxamine, and milnacipran are less likely to cause hyponatremia because of their lower binding affinity for SERT.

### Time-dependent association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and hospitalization due to hyponatremia [^116gypAn]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

SSRI dispensations were identified by Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) codes starting with "N06AB", including fluoxetine, citalopram, paroxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, and escitalopram. Drug exposure was defined as a drug dispensation for 13 weeks, as described previously.

In secondary analyses, odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for SSRI exposure regardless of duration and were separated into new (0–90 days) versus ongoing exposure.

To quantify the disease burden and absolute risk of SSRI-associated hyponatremia, further analysis is required.

### Identifying antidepressants less likely to cause hyponatremia: Triangulation of retrospective cohort, disproportionality, and pharmacodynamic studies [^116gmtRE]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). High credibility.

Antidepressants are known to cause hyponatremia, but conflicting evidence exists regarding specific antidepressants. To identify antidepressants less likely to cause hyponatremia, we conducted a triangulation study integrating retrospective cohort, disproportionality, and pharmacodynamic studies. In the retrospective cohort study of patients (≥ 60 years) in Nihon University School of Medicine's Clinical Data Warehouse (2004–2020), a significant decrease in serum sodium levels was observed within 30 days after the initiation of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI; mean change −1.00 ± 0.23 mmol/L, P < 0.001) or serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI; −1.01 ± 0.31 mmol/L, P = 0.0013), whereas no decrease was found for a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (mirtazapine; +0.55 ± 0.47 mmol/L, P = 0.24).

Within-class comparison revealed no decrease in serum sodium levels for fluvoxamine (+0.74 ± 0.75 mmol/L, P = 0.33) among SSRIs and milnacipran (+0.08 ± 0.87 mmol/L, P = 0.93) among SNRIs. In the disproportionality analysis of patients (≥ 60 years) in the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database (2004–2020), a significant increase in hyponatremia reports was observed for SSRIs (reporting odds ratio 4.41, 95% confidence interval 3.58–5.45) and SNRIs (5.66, 4.38–7.31), but not for mirtazapine (1.08, 0.74–1.58), fluvoxamine (1.48, 0.94–2.32), and milnacipran (0.85, 0.45–1.62).

Finally, pharmacoepidemiological–pharmacodynamic analysis revealed a significant correlation between the decrease in serum sodium levels and binding affinity for serotonin.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^115pq4RC]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Subsequently, several studies confirmed that osmotic demyelination was associated with more rapid rates of correction of chronic hyponatremia. Excluding case series on the basis of patient referrals, studies of patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L that include data on correction rates and outcomes are presented in the table. The frequency of osmotic demyelination varied widely among studies, depending on pretreatment serum sodium, correction rate, and method of identifying post-therapeutic neurologic sequelae. However, it is apparent that in patients with chronic hyponatremia, the lower the serum sodium and the larger the increase, the more likely that osmotic demyelination will be identified.

- **Table**
- **Post-treatment neurologic sequelae in studies of patients with serum sodium concentrations ≤ 120 mmol/L**

When osmotic demyelination syndrome was first described, it was widely believed that to avoid potentially fatal neurologic complications of severe symptomatic hyponatremia, it was important to rapidly raise the serum sodium to a "safe" level above 120 mmol/L and, according to some experts, to as high as 130 mmol/L. At a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L, it becomes impossible to both raise the serum sodium to a "safe" level and avoid correction by > 12 mmol/L per day; a choice must be made between the risks of persistent, severe hyponatremia and the risks of osmotic demyelination. Because a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L is uncommon, a letter was sent to all members of the American Society of Nephrology seeking data on patients with a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L who had been recently treated.

### Identifying antidepressants less likely to cause hyponatremia: Triangulation of retrospective cohort, disproportionality, and pharmacodynamic studies [^115pZjaK]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Low credibility.

Antidepressants are known to cause hyponatremia; however, conflicting evidence exists regarding specific antidepressants. To identify antidepressants that are less likely to cause hyponatremia, we conducted a triangulation study integrating retrospective cohort, disproportionality, and pharmacodynamic analyses.

In the retrospective cohort study of patients aged 60 and above from the Nihon University School of Medicine's Clinical Data Warehouse (2004–2020), a significant decrease in serum sodium levels was observed within 30 days after initiation of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI; mean change -1.00 ± 0.23 mmol/L, P < 0.001) or serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI; -1.01 ± 0.31 mmol/L, P = 0.0013). In contrast, no decrease was found for a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant, mirtazapine (+0.55 ± 0.47 mmol/L, P = 0.24).

- **Within-class comparison**: Among SSRIs, fluvoxamine showed no decrease in serum sodium levels (+0.74 ± 0.75 mmol/L, P = 0.33). Similarly, among SNRIs, milnacipran showed no decrease in serum sodium levels (+0.08 ± 0.87 mmol/L, P = 0.93).

In the disproportionality analysis of patients aged 60 and above in the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database (2004–2020), a significant increase in hyponatremia reports was observed for SSRIs (reporting odds ratio 4.41, 95% confidence interval 3.58–5.45) and SNRIs (5.66, 4.38–7.31). However, mirtazapine (1.08, 0.74–1.58), fluvoxamine (1.48, 0.94–2.32), and milnacipran (0.85, 0.45–1.62) did not show a significant increase in reports of hyponatremia.

Finally, pharmacoepidemiological-pharmacodynamic analysis revealed a significant correlation between the decrease in serum sodium levels and binding affinity for serotonin.

### Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone due to desvenlafaxine [^113Gn64Y]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia secondary to the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) is not uncommon in patients receiving treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or venlafaxine. This report details a case involving a 47-year-old man with depression, who developed hyponatremia after commencing treatment with desvenlafaxine. To our knowledge, this is the first case in which desvenlafaxine-associated SIADH was reported since the introduction of the drug. Physicians should be aware of the possibility of desvenlafaxine-associated hyponatremia in patients under the age of 65.

### Hyponatremia associated with the use of common antidepressants in the All of Us Research Program [^114NrBF7]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia has been identified as a potential side effect linked to the use of common antidepressants.

- **Research design**: The study was conducted using data from the All of Us Research Program, aiming to examine the association between antidepressant use and hyponatremia incidence.
- **Research team contributions**: Several researchers contributed to various aspects of the study. Manuscript writing was performed by H.M. Y.C. T.M.F. B.J.W. E. A.L. R. A.W., and J.C.D. The research design involved H.M. T.M.F. D.J.S. J.M.K. E. A.L. R. A.W., and J.C.D. Research activities were undertaken by H.M. Y.C. D.J.S. A.H. A. S.B.G. A.W. A.B., and O.S. Data analysis was performed by H.M. D.J.S., and A.H. A. New analytical tools were contributed by H.M. D.J.S. T.C.T., and J.M.K.

This comprehensive approach underscores the collaborative effort to understand the implications of antidepressant usage on electrolyte balance in patients.

### Time-dependent association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and hospitalization due to hyponatremia [^111dizRt]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte imbalance, affecting up to 30% of hospitalized patients. Its clinical spectrum ranges from mild, non-specific symptoms such as nausea and fatigue to severe symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and even death. One of the most common causes of hyponatremia is drug treatment. Thiazides, antiepileptics, antipsychotics, and several other drugs have been linked to an increased risk of severe hyponatremia. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are important for the treatment of depression and anxiety, with a widespread and increasing use.

Evidence suggests an important time-dependent association that may be exclusively related to more recently initiated treatment. If confirmed, this knowledge may be important to differentiate a causal relationship between SSRI treatment and severe hyponatremia from a spurious association. Furthermore, detailed knowledge of the time course is a prerequisite for an optimal strategy and adequate communication in order to detect SSRI-induced hyponatremia. The aim of the study was to investigate the time course of SSRI-associated hospitalization due to hyponatremia in the Swedish population, with a high temporal resolution.

### Desmopressin acetate [^113Rth2W]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Desmopressin acetate injection can cause hyponatremia. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, or death [see Boxed Warning].

Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia (or a history of hyponatremia), excessive fluid intake (e.g. polydipsia), use of loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids, known or suspected SIADH, and illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7)]. Avoid concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia.

Prior to starting or resuming desmopressin acetate injection, ensure the serum sodium concentration is normal. Limit fluid intake to a minimum from 1 hour before administration until 8 hours after administration. The use of desmopressin acetate injection without concomitant reduction of fluid intake may lead to fluid retention and hyponatremia.

Monitor the serum sodium concentration within 1 week and approximately 1 month of initiating desmopressin acetate injection, and periodically thereafter [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Base the frequency of serum sodium monitoring on the patient's risk of hyponatremia.

- **Conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance**: Patients with conditions such as cystic fibrosis, heart failure, and renal disorders, as well as geriatric and pediatric patients and those receiving concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake.

### A review of drug-induced hyponatremia [^115oCpKe]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia, defined as a serum sodium level of less than 134 mmol/L, is the most common electrolyte abnormality seen in hospitalized patients. Certain drugs, such as diuretics, antidepressants, and antiepileptics, are well-established causes of both asymptomatic and symptomatic hyponatremia. However, hyponatremia may also develop during treatment with drugs commonly used in everyday clinical practice, such as newer antihypertensive agents, antibiotics, and proton pump inhibitors. Physicians may sometimes fail to promptly address undesirable drug-induced hyponatremia. Effective clinical management can be achieved by maintaining awareness of the adverse effects certain pharmaceutical compounds have on serum sodium levels. This review presents clinical information on the incidence of hyponatremia associated with specific drug treatments and discusses the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.

### Identifying antidepressants less likely to cause hyponatremia: Triangulation of retrospective cohort, disproportionality, and pharmacodynamic studies [^112WgAJq]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Low credibility.

In this study, a multifaceted approach was utilized to identify antidepressants that are less likely to result in hyponatremia. The research design combined a retrospective cohort analysis, disproportionality assessments, and pharmacodynamic studies to achieve a comprehensive understanding.

- **Methodology**:
	- The retrospective cohort study involved the analysis of patient records to identify patterns and associations between antidepressant use and the incidence of hyponatremia. Disproportionality analysis provided insights into the relative risk of hyponatremia by examining variations in adverse event reports across different antidepressants. The pharmacodynamic component explored the biochemical interactions that may influence the development of hyponatremia.

- **Findings**:
	- The triangulated approach revealed specific antidepressants with a lower propensity to induce hyponatremia. Recommendations can be made based on these findings to inform clinical decision-making and enhance patient safety concerning the prescription of antidepressants.

- **Conclusion**:
	- Integrating multiple research methodologies offers a robust framework for evaluating drug safety profiles. The study's findings underline the importance of such triangulation in potentially guiding safer prescribing practices for antidepressants.

### Fluoxetine [^111UJBth]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The pupillary dilation that occurs following the use of many antidepressant drugs, including fluoxetine, may trigger an angle-closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy.

- **Hyponatremia**: Hyponatremia has been reported during treatment with SNRIs and SSRIs, including fluoxetine. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported and appeared to be reversible when fluoxetine was discontinued. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SNRIs and SSRIs. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume-depleted may be at greater risk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Discontinuation of fluoxetine should be considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia, and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. More severe and/or acute cases have been associated with hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death.

- **Anxiety and insomnia**: In US placebo-controlled clinical trials for MDD, 12% to 16% of patients treated with fluoxetine and 7% to 9% of patients treated with placebo reported anxiety, nervousness, or insomnia. In US placebo-controlled clinical trials for OCD, insomnia was reported in 28% of patients treated with fluoxetine.

### Identifying antidepressants less likely to cause hyponatremia: Triangulation of retrospective cohort, disproportionality, and pharmacodynamic studies [^116e7UQh]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Low credibility.

The third approach in this triangulation study was a pharmacoepidemiological–pharmacodynamic (PE–PD) analysis, which is a novel method for exploring the mechanisms of adverse drug events by combining pharmacoepidemiological results and pharmacodynamic properties. The present study assessed the correlation between mean changes in serum sodium levels or reporting odds ratios for hyponatremia/SIADH and binding affinities to various target molecules. The pKi values (negative logarithm to the base 10 of the inhibition constant Ki) were used as a measure of the strength of binding affinity. Therapeutic drug concentration and protein binding were not considered in this study as recent studies did not support a dose-dependent increase in the risk of antidepressant-induced hyponatremia. The pKi values used in this study are summarized in Table S3. These pKi values were adopted from previous PE–PD studies by Mazhar et al, Nguyen et al, and Siafis et al, in this priority order. These studies retrieved human/mouse pKi values from IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY, PDSP Ki database, DrugBank, and ChEMBL and calculated the geometric mean when multiple values were available for the same target. The present PE–PD analysis included the following molecules whose pKi values were available for more than half of the antidepressants investigated in this study: serotonin transporter (SERT); norepinephrine transporter (NET); dopamine transporter (DAT); serotonin 5‐HT 1A, 5‐HT 2A, and 5‐HT 2C receptors; α 1 and α 2 adrenergic receptors.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for hyponatremia, specifically with respect to severity grading based on symptoms, ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend classifying hyponatremia based on the symptomatic presentation:

- **Moderate symptoms**: Any biochemical degree of hyponatremia in the presence of moderate symptoms, such as nausea without vomiting, confusion, or headache.

- **Severe symptoms**: Any biochemical degree of hyponatremia in the presence of severe symptoms, like vomiting, altered level of consciousness, seizures, or cardiorespiratory distress.
