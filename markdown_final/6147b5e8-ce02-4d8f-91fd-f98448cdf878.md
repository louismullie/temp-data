## Question

A 34-year-old man presents with multiple painful ulcers on his penis. He says that the ulcers all appeared suddenly at the same time 3 days ago. He reports that he is sexually active with multiple partners and uses condoms inconsistently. He is afebrile and his vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals multiple small shallow ulcers with an erythematous base and without discharge. There is significant inguinal lymphadenopathy present. Which of the following is the most likely etiologic agent of this patient's ulcers?
A. Human papillomavirus
B. Treponema pallidum
C. Haemophilus ducreyi
D. Herpes simplex virus

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which pathogen is most likely responsible for a 34-year-old man with sudden-onset multiple painful, shallow penile ulcers and significant inguinal lymphadenopathy, and to choose among HPV, Treponema pallidum, Haemophilus ducreyi, and HSV. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and which STI patterns it matches. Then, I should verify how each option's classic presentation aligns or conflicts with the case. Next, I will weigh the differential, including chancroid, LGV, and mpox, and check for any atypical features that would shift probabilities. Finally, I will confirm the most likely diagnosis and outline the immediate diagnostic steps and why the other options are less likely, anchoring to guidelines and high-quality reviews.

> Let me first confirm the syndrome: multiple, painful, shallow genital ulcers arising abruptly with tender inguinal lymphadenopathy in a sexually active man are most consistent with primary genital herpes, which classically presents with clustered painful vesicles that ulcerate and are frequently accompanied by inguinal lymphadenopathy during primary infection [^116ziajn] [^111dH5pm].

> Now, I will examine each option against this phenotype. HPV typically causes warts rather than ulcers, so HPV is not a good fit for an acute painful ulcer syndrome; wait, let me verify that I'm not missing an HPV-related ulcerative entity — no, HPV lesions are papillomatous growths, not shallow painful ulcers, so HPV is unlikely here [^116HVPUJ]. Treponema pallidum causes primary syphilis, classically a solitary, painless, indurated chancre with non-tender regional lymphadenopathy; multiple painful shallow ulcers contradict that classic picture, although I should acknowledge that atypical syphilis can occur, especially with coinfections or HIV, but even then the "painful plus multiple" pattern is atypical for primary syphilis [^111dxTSU] [^114byRiw]. Haemophilus ducreyi causes chancroid, which is indeed painful and may be multiple, but the ulcers are typically deep, ragged, and undermined with suppurative inguinal buboes; the description of "small shallow ulcers" is less characteristic for chancroid, though I need to be cautious not to overstate this because chancroid is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion in many settings [^116gVNFj] [^114wH37N]. HSV matches the acute, painful, shallow, multiple ulcers with tender inguinal nodes seen in primary genital herpes, which fits this case most closely [^116ziajn] [^111dH5pm].

> Hold on, I should verify the differential beyond the listed options. Lymphogranuloma venereum can produce tender inguinal lymphadenopathy and sometimes a transient, often painless primary papule or ulcer that heals before presentation; the prominence of multiple painful shallow ulcers makes LGV less likely here, though I should keep it in mind if lymphadenopathy predominates or if there is proctitis or MSM risk factors [^115KjozA] [^1146uDt4]. Mpox can present with genital lesions and lymphadenopathy, but the lesions are typically umbilicated papules or pseudopustules that evolve through a synchronous centrifugal progression; the description of shallow ulcers without umbilication or pustular evolution does not fit mpox as well as HSV in this case [^113tJPNw] [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize the competing diagnoses. The combination of multiple, painful, shallow ulcers with tender inguinal nodes points most strongly to primary genital HSV, whereas syphilis is less likely because the ulcers are painful and multiple rather than solitary and painless, and chancroid is less likely because the ulcers are described as shallow rather than deep and ragged; still, I should double-check that chancroid remains a consideration if HSV testing is negative and the clinical course is atypical, since chancroid is a diagnosis of exclusion in many U.S. settings [^116gVNFj] [^11257c3A] [^114wH37N].

> Next, I should review immediate diagnostic steps to avoid premature closure. I need to ensure HSV PCR is obtained from the base of an active ulcer, because NAAT is the most sensitive test for HSV and can distinguish HSV-1 from HSV-2; I should also obtain syphilis serology with treponemal and non-treponemal assays, and consider NAATs for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis including LGV if epidemiologically or clinically suggested, while remembering that definitive chancroid testing is limited by availability and sensitivity [^111dQMhd] [^114wH37N] [^1146uDt4].

> Putting this together, the most likely etiologic agent is herpes simplex virus, given the acute, painful, multiple shallow ulcers with tender inguinal lymphadenopathy that are characteristic of primary genital herpes, whereas HPV is inconsistent with ulcers, Treponema pallidum is unlikely due to the painful and multiple nature of the lesions, and Haemophilus ducreyi is less likely because the ulcers are shallow rather than deep and undermined, though chancroid remains a consideration if HSV testing is negative and the epidemiology fits [^116ziajn] [^111dH5pm] [^116gVNFj] [^114wH37N].

---

The most likely etiologic agent is **herpes simplex virus (HSV)** [^111dQMhd], given the sudden onset of multiple painful, shallow ulcers with significant inguinal lymphadenopathy and a history of multiple sexual partners. HSV is the most common cause of **genital ulcers** in the United States [^111dQMhd] and typically presents with painful, shallow ulcers and tender inguinal lymphadenopathy. Syphilis presents with a painless, indurated ulcer and non-tender lymphadenopathy [^111dxTSU], while chancroid is less common and typically presents with deep, ragged ulcers and suppurative inguinal lymphadenopathy (buboes) [^116gVNFj]. HPV does not cause ulcers [^116HVPUJ]. HSV is the best fit for this clinical presentation.

---

## Differential diagnosis of genital ulcers

The differential diagnosis of genital ulcers includes infectious and noninfectious etiologies [^111dQMhd]. The most common infectious causes are **HSV, syphilis, and chancroid** [^notfound]; HPV typically presents as warts rather than ulcers [^116HVPUJ].

| **Etiologic agent** | **Clinical features** | **Lymphadenopathy** | **Pain** |
|-|-|-|-|
| HSV | Multiple shallow ulcers with erythematous base | Tender inguinal lymphadenopathy | Painful |
| Treponema pallidum (syphilis) | Single, painless, indurated ulcer (chancre) | Non-tender inguinal lymphadenopathy | Painless |
| Haemophilus ducreyi (chancroid) | Deep, ragged ulcers with undermined edges | Suppurative inguinal lymphadenopathy (buboes) | Painful |
| Human papillomavirus (HPV) | Warts, not ulcers | None | Painless |

---

## Clinical features supporting HSV as the likely etiologic agent

The patient's presentation — multiple painful, shallow ulcers with significant inguinal lymphadenopathy and sudden onset — is **highly suggestive of HSV** [^115GSFvb]. Key features supporting this diagnosis include:

- **Multiple shallow ulcers**: HSV typically presents as multiple shallow ulcers with an erythematous base, consistent with the patient's lesions [^115GSFvb].

- **Painful ulcers**: HSV lesions are typically painful, which aligns with the patient's symptoms [^116ziajn].

- **Significant inguinal lymphadenopathy**: HSV commonly causes tender inguinal lymphadenopathy, particularly during primary infection [^113xDmDx].

- **Sudden onset**: HSV lesions typically appear suddenly and may be accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever and malaise [^notfound].

---

## Epidemiological considerations

The patient's history of multiple sexual partners and inconsistent condom use increases the risk of sexually transmitted infections, including HSV [^116ziajn]. HSV is highly prevalent, particularly among sexually active individuals with multiple partners [^116ziajn].

---

## Laboratory confirmation

While clinical features strongly suggest HSV, **laboratory confirmation is recommended** [^116yEryu]. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of lesion exudate or swabs is the most sensitive and specific method for diagnosing HSV infection [^notfound]. Serological testing for HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies may also be performed to confirm infection and differentiate between primary and recurrent infection [^115GSFvb].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Based on the clinical presentation and epidemiological risk factors, **the most likely etiologic agent** of the patient's genital ulcers is **herpes simplex virus (HSV)** [^111dQMhd]. Laboratory confirmation with PCR testing is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and guide management [^116krnmh].

A 32-year-old otherwise healthy male presented to the dermatology clinic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with a 2-day history of multiple painful, non-pruritic ulcers in the genital and facial regions, fever, odynophagia, headache, and fatigue. Physical examination revealed pustules and vesicles with central umbilication at the same stage of development and targetoid crusted ulcers on the right inguinal area (Fig 1), base of the penis, right gluteal region, and left cheek along with bilateral painful inguinal adenopathy. The oropharynx showed erythematous patches and erosions with white exudate.

Question 1: Based on the clinical presentation, what is the most likely etiology of the patient's ulcers?
A. Treponema pallidum
B. Monkeypox virus
C. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)
D. Candida albicans
E. Non-infectious inflammation

Answers:

A. Treponema pallidum – Incorrect. Primary syphilis infection is classically characterized by a painless genital ulcer, often associated with non-tender inguinal lymphadenopathy. Serologies for syphilis were negative in this case.
B. Monkeypox virus – Correct. Upon further questioning, the patient reported frequent unprotected sexual intercourse with alternating male partners and recent contact with symptomatic partners. After 7 days, the patient developed additional lesions on the bilateral thighs, face, right anterior neck, and buttocks. Lesions evolved to erosions with overlying crusts, with spontaneous resolution of all lesions after 3 weeks. Monkeypox is a zoonotic Orthopoxvirus. Beginning in May of 2022, a rapid increase in the number of monkeypox cases emerged. Historically, lesions began on the face and spread across the trunk and extremities. In the current outbreak, it has been observed that lesions begin primarily in the genital region in men who have sex with men.
C. HSV – Incorrect. Genital herpes presents as painful grouped vesicles or ulcers. Disseminated HSV could present as facial and genital ulcers in an immunocompromised patient. Serologies for HIV were negative.
D. Candida albicans – Incorrect. Cutaneous candidiasis presents as bright red erythema surrounded by satellite pustules and papules in moist areas. Deep fungal infections can cause genital ulcers but C. albicans is not the typical pathogen.
E. Non-infectious inflammation – Incorrect. Behcet syndrome is characterized by recurrent oral apthae associated with genital ulcers. The precise etiology is unknown, but an autoimmune etiology has been proposed. The classic triad includes uveitis as well.

Multiple unprotected heterosexual contacts were reported. The family doctor misdiagnosed primary syphilis with the following laboratory results: negative findings on the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test, positive findings on the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (titer 1:1280), and IgM negative on the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay. The patient was treated with penicillin G for the diagnosis of indeterminate latent syphilis and initially denied authorization for a skin biopsy. After 2 weeks, fast enlargement of the lesion was documented. He underwent skin biopsy, and the histopathologic examination revealed squamous cell carcinoma, and polymerase chain reaction for human papillomavirus 16 was positive.

The myriad presentations of ulcerative sexually transmitted infections, other than genital herpes and syphilis, challenge even the most astute clinician given the considerable overlap in clinical presentation and lack of widely available diagnostic resources, such as nucleic acid testing, to confirm the diagnosis. Even so, case prevalence is relatively low, and incidence of chancroid and granuloma inguinale are declining. These diseases still cause substantial morbidity and increased chance for HIV acquisition, and with the recent advent of mpox as a cause, it remains imperative to identify and treat accurately.

### Necrotising granulomatous mass of the foreskin with inguinal lymphadenopathy: a rare presentation of syphilis [^116HVPUJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Penile lesions can arise from the epithelium of the foreskin, glans or shaft. They are a diagnostic challenge largely guided by clinical presentation and physical examination. The broad differential for penile lesions includes sexually acquired and non-sexually acquired infections, malignant and premalignant lesions, inflammatory conditions, trauma and, rarely, iatrogenic causes (such as reactive inflammation due to foreign body material). Infectious aetiology includes viral, parasitic and bacterial infections, with the most prevalent being human papilloma virus (HPV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), scabies and syphilis. Infectious penile lesions have vastly different appearances: HPV-induced condyloma appears as soft, papillomatous growths; HSV presents as genital ulceration; scabies causes papules with multiple linear burrows; and syphilis typically presents as a solitary, painless ulcer with well-defined margins and indurated base. Penile carcinoma is rare but should be considered in men with suspicious mass or ulcer of the penis. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) accounts for the majority of penile cancers. Other penile cancers include melanoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, basal cell carcinoma and lymphoma. Carcinoma in situ often presents as solitary, painless lesions, similar to invasive SCC. Definitive diagnosis of penile carcinoma requires tissue biopsy for histopathological confirmation. Although most penile SCCs arise de novo, some are preceded by premalignant lesions, such as cutaneous horn and lichen sclerosus. Cutaneous horn presents as overgrowth and cornification of epithelium, creating a solid protuberance, whereas lichen sclerosus appears as a phimotic, hypopigmented foreskin or glans.

The current resurgence of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) has drawn most attention to its potential for causing proctitis; however, this case highlights the need for awareness of LGV as a cause of isolated painful bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy in a high-risk population and the importance of routine screening for LGV. We describe a case of a 37-year-old HIV positive man, in the population of men who have sex with men (MSM) who presented with bilateral enlarged inguinal lymph nodes and no other symptoms or signs. Urine nucleic acid amplification test was positive for chlamydia LGV-specific DNA. Tests from other sites were negative.

What symptoms should alert me to this diagnosis?

While syphilis causes protean symptoms (box 1), the diagnosis should be considered in any sexually active patient with genital lesions or with rashes.

Box 1
Symptoms of syphilis by stage of infection (see fig 1)

Primary syphilis — Patients with primary syphilis (fig 1) have a chancre at the site of inoculation — classically a solitary, painless, indurated, non-exudative ulcer (fig 2). While often on the glans, corona, labia, fourchette, or perineum, it may occur in the mouth (fig 3), rectum, or vagina. Chancres can be inconspicuous (fig 4) and resolve in 3–10 weeks, possibly explaining why 60% of patients do not recall this lesion. Chancres may be multiple, painful, or atypical due to coinfection with other bacteria or herpesvirus. Depending on inoculum size, chancres appear 10–90 days after exposure (mean 21 days). Localised painless adenopathy may occur.

Secondary syphilis — Secondary syphilis is a manifestation of bacterial dissemination and classically presents as a diffuse, symmetric, copper, maculopapular, possibly pruritic rash of any morphology except vesicular (fig 5). A rash on the palms or soles is common (11–70%, fig 6). Mucus lesions (fig 7), patchy alopecia, fever, headaches, and generalised painless adenopathy may also occur. Early neurosyphilis develops in 25–60% of people (box 1). Secondary symptoms appear 2–24 weeks after infection, concurrently with or up to eight weeks after chancres, and disappear spontaneously after several weeks with or without marking.

### Myocarditis attributable to monkeypox virus infection in 2 patients, United States, 2022 [^117DXN6K]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

The Study

Both patients in this study provided informed consent for publication of deidentified medical information. Patient 1 was a healthy 32-year-old man who sought care at a hospital for his diagnosis of monkeypox. He reported having a sexual encounter with a new male partner 15 days earlier. Seven days after that encounter, he had onset of a viral illness with cervical lymphadenopathy, followed by a disseminated rash and a painful penile lesion. Two days before his hospital visit, a nonvariola orthopoxvirus DNA PCR test on a skin lesion specimen was positive. In the hospital, the patient reported ongoing chest pain and dyspnea for 1 day (Figure 1). He reported prior treatment for syphilis. He did not report recent SARS-CoV-2 vaccination or infection and was unvaccinated for smallpox. Physical examination revealed multiple erythematous vesiculopapular and pustular lesions with erythematous borders, left inguinal lymphadenopathy, and ulceration at the base of the glans penis.

Figure 1
Timeline of events for 2 immunocompetent patients with monkeypox complicated by myocarditis, United States. A) A healthy 32-year-old man (patient 1) had chest pain and shortness of breath 7 days after a prodrome of headache, fatigue, malaise, and cervical lymphadenopathy and 2 days after the rash. Symptoms resolved after 10 days of illness onset and 1 day after initiation of tecovirimat. The patient received supportive care only for myocarditis. B) A healthy 37-year-old man (patient 2) had shortness of breath and decreased exercise tolerance 6 days after illness onset with bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy and 4 days after the rash. Shortness of breath improved after 12 days of illness onset, and exercise tolerance normalized after 20 days. The patient received supportive care only for both monkeypox and myocarditis.

Outcome and follow-up

He was subsequently referred to the sexual health clinic. Serological screening showed positive treponemal-specific antibody tests and a rapid plasma regain titre of 1:8, consistent with infectious syphilis. Serology was negative for hepatitis B, HIV and HSV type 2. Screening for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae by urine PCR testing was negative. Subsequently, the lymph node was reviewed and found to be syphilis PCR-positive. A revised sexual history revealed an additional female sexual partner approximately 6 months prior to symptom onset. The patient was treated with benzathine penicillin. The lymphadenopathy resolved and he was clinically well at 1-month follow-up review.

### Clinical features and novel presentations of human monkeypox in a central london centre during the 2022 outbreak: descriptive case series [^113tJPNw]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Novel presentations

We describe presentations of monkeypox infection in the participants that are not commonly reported. Some symptoms were severe and required hospital admission. Images represent both a range of presentations and a series of progression, giving an insight into the clinical course of the disease in an outbreak largely centred on gay, bisexual, and other men and men who have sex with men.

Penile oedema

Of the 31 participants who reported penile oedema, five had documented paraphimosis or phimosis.

One participant, a 34-year-old circumcised man, presented with multiple penile lesions with clinically significant associated oedema. He had a history of Crohn's disease and was receiving adalimumab. He initially described multiple small, vesicular lesions on the penile shaft, coronal sulcus, and scrotum, which enlarged over the next two days, becoming umbilicated, flesh coloured papules (fig 1). The lesions then became more indurated, and the patient developed fever and cervical lymphadenopathy. On day 5 of symptoms, he developed erythema and swelling that extended from the mid-penile shaft to the glans. Overnight the swelling progressed rapidly, and the patient was admitted to hospital for assessment.

Fig 1
Progression of penile lesions and penile oedema

On examination, 14 large, umbilicated lesions were identified along the penile shaft, coronal sulcus, and scrotum. There was associated subcutaneous oedema with no evidence of necrosis, and the skin was not tense or painful. Single pustular lesions on the participant's arm, back, and hip were also noted, along with inguinal lymphadenopathy. He was able to urinate. Results of a Treponema pallidum particle assay and rectal swab for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis nucleic acid amplification tests were negative, respectively. The urology team advised conservative management with cold compression and massage, and analgesia including topical lidocaine gel, ibuprofen, and oral morphine sulphate. Over the next 48 hours the swelling remained unchanged, with bruising extending from the glans towards the penile base. The swelling subsequently subsided gradually, and the patient was discharged on day 13. By day 16 the swelling had largely resolved, and the penile lesions had crusted over.

### Necrotising granulomatous mass of the foreskin with inguinal lymphadenopathy: a rare presentation of syphilis [^115ieQXk]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We report the case of a 24-year-old man who presented with a 5-week history of painful right inguinal lymphadenopathy, weight loss and non-ulcerative foreskin mass. The patient's symptoms progressed despite initial antibiotic therapy. The foreskin mass was clinically suspicious for squamous cell carcinoma; however, histopathology of both the foreskin mass and inguinal lymph node showed necrotising granulomatous inflammation. Extensive immunohistochemistry testing was inconclusive and could not identify a causative microorganism. Ultimately, serology was positive for Treponema pallidum and he was treated with intramuscular benzathine penicillin. This is an unusual case, which highlights the importance of extensive investigation for differential diagnoses of penile mass and exemplifies the resurgence of syphilis in developed countries.

### Necrotising granulomatous mass of the foreskin with inguinal lymphadenopathy: a rare presentation of syphilis [^112zg279]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Case presentation

A 24-year-old urban indigenous Australian heterosexual man was admitted with a 5-week history of painful right inguinal lymphadenopathy and foreskin mass. He reported penile pain, which he initially attributed to sustaining a physical blow to his groin, but did not notice a mass at the time. He noted some dysuria but denied any haematuria or penile discharge. He reported a 2-week history of constitutional symptoms, including low-grade fevers, chills and rigours, night sweats, anorexia and unintentional weight loss of ~5 kg.

In the 2 weeks leading up to admission, he presented multiple times to both a general practitioner and emergency department. He underwent an inguinal ultrasound that showed an enlarged inguinal lymph node measuring 2.0×2.3×3.4 cm with increased vascularity. The findings were suggestive of lymphadenitis. He completed two courses of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, but his symptoms progressed. He eventually represented with worsening inguinal lymphadenopathy and new penile pain.

He reported life-long phimosis. He is otherwise healthy with no other significant medical or family history. He reported being sexually active with one regular female partner, and no additional risk factors for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) were identified.

His observations were unremarkable and he was afebrile on presentation. On examination, there was a hard, nodular mass on the ventral aspect of his distal foreskin. He had a tight, non-retractable phimosis and the foreskin was mildly erythematous. He had bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy, right more prominent than left. The lymph nodes were hard, fixed and exquisitely tender.

Diagnostic Considerations

A definitive diagnosis of chancroid requires identifying H. ducreyi on special culture media that is not widely available from commercial sources; even when these media are used, sensitivity is < 80%. No FDA-cleared NAAT for H. ducreyi is available in the United States; however, such testing can be performed by clinical laboratories that have developed their own NAAT and have conducted CLIA verification studies on genital specimens.

The combination of one or more deep and painful genital ulcers and tender suppurative inguinal adenopathy indicates the chancroid diagnosis; inguinal lymphadenitis typically occurs in < 50% of cases. For both clinical and surveillance purposes, a probable diagnosis of chancroid can be made if all of the following four criteria are met: 1) the patient has one or more painful genital ulcers; 2) the clinical presentation, appearance of genital ulcers and, if present, regional lymphadenopathy are typical for chancroid; 3) the patient has no evidence of T. pallidum infection by darkfield examination or NAAT (i.e. ulcer exudate or serous fluid) or by serologic tests for syphilis performed at least 7–14 days after onset of ulcers; and 4) HSV-1 or HSV-2 NAAT or HSV culture performed on the ulcer exudate or fluid are negative.

Treatment

Successful antimicrobial treatment for chancroid cures the infection, resolves the clinical symptoms, and prevents transmission to others. In advanced cases, genital scarring and rectal or urogenital fistulas from suppurative buboes can result despite successful therapy.

Recommended Regimens for Chancroid
Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose
or
Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM in a single dose
or
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 3 days
or
Erythromycin base 500 mg orally 3 times/day for 7 days

Azithromycin and ceftriaxone offer the advantage of single-dose therapy. Worldwide, several isolates with intermediate resistance to either ciprofloxacin or erythromycin have been reported. However, because cultures are not routinely performed, and chancroid is uncommon, data are limited regarding prevalence of H. ducreyi antimicrobial resistance.

### A case of mpox reinfection [^115yknsw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

CASE REPORT

A 34-year-old man in good general health presented in May 2022 with 4 umbilicated lesions on the penis. He was on preexposure prophylaxis for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and reported having had condomless sex with men, including receptive anal intercourse. He did not report previous smallpox infection or vaccination. On physical examination, no lymphadenopathy was found, and oropharyngeal and anal inspection was normal. The patient did not report fever or any other symptoms. Skin lesions and pharyngeal swabs tested positive for MPXV by real-time Orthopoxvirus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with cycle threshold (Ct) values of 16.5 and 35.3, respectively. He was also diagnosed with asymptomatic urinary Chlamydia trachomatis infection. Within 2 weeks, skin lesions spontaneously resolved without complications.

On 1 December 2022, the patient reported persistent perianal pain without bleeding nor discharge. Symptoms had started 2 weeks before, on his return from Brazil in November 2022, where he had engaged in condomless anal intercourse with multiple male partners. No other complaints or symptoms were reported. He related a last receptive anal intercourse 2 weeks before the presentation. The patient did not recall any signs or symptoms of mpox among his partners, nor was he aware of an MPXV infection among them. Clinical examination found no skin lesion in the perianal region or other body parts. Apart from a slightly palpable painless right inguinal lymphadenopathy, the medical examination was normal. Four weeks after symptom onset, a proctologic examination revealed a small anal fissure but no typical mpox lesion.

Sexually transmitted infectious diseases were screened using standard diagnostic tests. The anal swab done on 1 December 2022 came back positive for MPXV with a Ct of 27 and for C. trachomatis (non–lymphogranuloma venereum). The latter was treated with a 7-day course of doxycycline. HIV serology and viremia were negative, and syphilis was serology negative for acute infection. On 13 December 2022, rectal and pharyngeal swabs were collected again and turned out negative. Orthopoxvirus PCR was also negative in the blood and urine on 13 December 2022. Total MPXV antibodies were tested (Custom Monkeypox Human ELISA Kit, RayVio, Georgia) on sera collected prior to the first episode in May 2022 and after the second in December 2022: they came back negative and positive, respectively. Unfortunately, no serum had been collected between the 2 episodes.

### Isolated, unilateral inguinal tuberculous lymphadenitis [^114vNxE7]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

A 17-year-old heterosexual man presented with a 3-month history of a painless, enlarging inguinal lymph node and multiple discharging sinuses. There had been no clinical improvement despite multiple empirical antibiotic treatments for other infections which share similar clinical presentations, such as lymphogranuloma venereum. Specific details in reference to diagnosis and treatment could not be obtained (Figure 1). There was no history of recent unprotected sexual intercourse, previous tuberculosis (TB) exposure, symptoms suggestive of other systemic illnesses, fever, weight loss, cough, sore throat, urethral discharge, genital ulcer, or trauma to the lower extremities. On physical examination, an enlarged, 4 × 3-cm inguinal lymph node was noted; the remainder of the examination was unremarkable. The chest X-ray showed no abnormalities and a test for human immunodeficiency virus was negative. The patient was evaluated for syphilis, but not for other sexually transmitted diseases, given that he had no history of recent unprotected sexual exposure, no urethral discharge, or genital ulcer. Histologic examination of tissue obtained by an excisional biopsy showed granulomas with multinucleated giant cells (Figure 2) and acid-fast bacilli (Figure 3); culture grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Standard antituberculous treatment for 6 months was initiated. Clinical response was observed after 2 months of treatment.

In the initial diagnosis of inguinal lymphadenitis, it is important to consider the potential etiologies, both infectious and noninfectious diseases. Painless lymphadenitis is usually due to toxoplasmosis, cat-scratch disease, syphilis, and TB; however, it can be painful at the beginning, and it can occur bilaterally. Painful unilateral lymphadenopathy can be caused by Chlamydia trachomatis and Haemophilus ducreyi; however, these are usually associated with urethral discharge or a genital ulcer. Other potential etiologies include secondary bacterial infection of genital scabies or pediculosis pubis, plague, pyogenic infection of the leg, atypical mycobacterial infections, and persistent generalized lymphadenopathy of AIDS. Noninfectious causes must also be considered, such as metastatic lymph node lesions and lymphoma.

Best of five questions

Question 1

A 23-year-old man presented with an 8-week history of bloody diarrhoea, severe anorectal pain and low-grade pyrexia. On further questioning he also complained of malaise, myalgia and arthralgia. He admitted to unprotected receptive anal sexual intercourse with two male partners in the preceding 6 months. Perianal and rectal examination revealed two fluctuant, tender areas of induration adjacent to the anal verge suggestive of abscesses. An urgent flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed inflamed, friable rectal mucosa with several large ulcers and spontaneous bleeding. Rectal swabs sent for NAAT and genotyping revealed the presence of C trachomatis genotype L1.

Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment regimen:
A — Doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 7 days
B — Erythromycin 250 mg four times a day for 21 days
C — Olfloxacin 400 mg a day for 7 days
D — Erythromycin 500 mg twice a day for 7 days
E — Doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 21 days

Question 2

A 32-year-old man presents with a 6-week history of diarrhoea, anorectal pain and maculopapular rash affecting the trunk, hands and feet. Two years previously he had been investigated for possible Crohn's disease after presenting with several perianal and anal verge ulcers. These had resolved spontaneously and no formal diagnosis had been made. On further questioning he admitted to a 4-week history of perianal swelling and several oral ulcers with a snail track distribution on inspection. Perianal inspection is demonstrated in figure 3.

C — N gonorrhoea
D — C trachomatis
E — Human papilloma virus

Question 3

A 40-year-old male patient of Turkish origin presented to ophthalmology as an emergency with acute painless reduced visual acuity in both eyes. Further questioning revealed a several year history of intermittent diarrhoea, recurrent oral and penile ulceration, with orogenital scarring evident on examination. He also complained of painful red nodules on the extensor aspects of both forearms. One year previously he had been diagnosed with anterior uveitis requiring prolonged steroid use. Slit lamp retinal examination revealed multiple intraretinal haemorrhages, soft exudates and macular oedema in both eyes.

What is the most likely diagnosis:
A — Crohn's disease
B — Sarcoidosis
C — Behçet's syndrome

### Necrotising granulomatous mass of the foreskin with inguinal lymphadenopathy: a rare presentation of syphilis [^112eNhp7]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We report the case of a 24-year-old man who presented with a 5-week history of painful right inguinal lymphadenopathy, weight loss and non-ulcerative foreskin mass. The patient's symptoms progressed despite initial antibiotic therapy. The foreskin mass was clinically suspicious for squamous cell carcinoma; however, histopathology of both the foreskin mass and inguinal lymph node showed necrotising granulomatous inflammation. Extensive immunohistochemistry testing was inconclusive and could not identify a causative microorganism. Ultimately, serology was positive for Treponema pallidum and he was treated with intramuscular benzathine penicillin. This is an unusual case, which highlights the importance of extensive investigation for differential diagnoses of penile mass and exemplifies the resurgence of syphilis in developed countries.

### Amivantamab, the first epidermal growth factor receptor and mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor inhibitor, associated with penile and inguinal ulcers and paronychia [^111QEecQ]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 57-year-old man with a history of advanced non–small cell lung cancer with distant metastasis presented to the clinic with painful lesions in the inguinal folds and toenails. Six weeks prior to the visit, amivantamab was started. At the time of presentation, he had already received 5 infusions. Two weeks after starting treatment, he developed small ulcers in the groin and swollen toenails. After each subsequent infusion, new ulcers appeared in the same sites and the penile area. Other associated symptoms included cracked lips and dry mouth. Prior to the initial visit, lesions had been treated with potent topical steroids and antifungals with minimal response. The patient denied having any family members with similar lesions, previous episodes of similar lesions, or systemic symptoms. Physical examination revealed multiple, tender, oval ulcers with scalloped borders on bilateral inguinal folds and penile shaft (Fig 1). There was erythema and swelling with an underlying hemorrhagic crust on the proximal nailfolds of the first, second, and third toes bilaterally (Fig 2). No inguinal lymphadenopathy was identified. Laboratory study results were negative for Epstein–Barr virus IgG and immunoglobulin M, cytomegalovirus, HIV, herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2 IgG and immunoglobulin M, rapid plasma reagin test, and Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test. A skin biopsy specimen from an active lesion on the groin showed an ulcer with a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate (Fig 3). Based on the clinical presentation, we suspected the possibility of drug-related toxicity, and amivantamab was held for 1 month. During this interval, paronychia resolved with clobetasol and mupirocin cream, and the ulcers showed significant improvement with re-epithelization. However, due to the patient's malignancy, the oncologist resumed amivantamab. After subsequent infusion, there was a recurrence of ulcers in the same sites, and perianal erythema. To rule out chancroid ulcers, the patient completed a 3-week course of azithromycin, and lesions persisted. Therefore, a diagnosis of amivantamab-induced inguinal and penile ulcers and paronychia was established.

### Penile cancer: clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^111nnKvs]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2013). Medium credibility.

NCCN penile cancer — management overview states that squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the penis mandates prompt medical/surgical intervention and patient adherence to therapy; the initial step is a thorough history and physical examination followed by a biopsy of the primary lesion to establish a pathologic diagnosis, and accurate clinical staging allows a comprehensive treatment approach to be devised, optimizing therapeutic efficacy and minimizing treatment-related morbidity. Prognostic factors help predict if lymph node metastases are suspected in the absence of any palpable inguinal lymphadenopathy, and when clinically indicated an ILND has curative potential, particularly when performed early, with contemporary surgical series demonstrating reduced morbidity. For recurrent or metastatic disease, the Panel recommends participation in well-designed clinical trials when applicable and available, and best supportive care remains an option for advanced cases or cases refractory to systemic therapy, RT, or chemoradiotherapy.

### Trousseau syndrome presenting with penile gangrene [^113sPAbp]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Case report

A 64-year-old Chinese man with poorly controlled, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia was referred for a 2-month history of glans penis gangrene. He had no known drug allergies. He had a history of prostate adenocarcinoma with bony metastases [stage T3, N4, M1, Gleason 9 (score 4+5)], serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of 272 μg/L (normal range, 0–4 μg/L) and had undergone bilateral subcapsular orchidectomy 6 years ago with improvement of serum PSA levels to 0.8 μg/L postoperatively. He defaulted follow-up for 5 years and re-presented with castrate-resistant prostate cancer with a PSA of 126.6 μg/L. He was started on bicalutamide (antiandrogen) tablets.

The penile lesions started as painful erosions surrounding the penile meatus, which gradually became necrotic over 2 months. There were no vesicles or bullae. The patient attempted to self-medicate with topical Baneocin powder (Bacitracin Zinc, Neomycin Sulfate). He also experienced worsening pain and required multiple courses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and tramadol. He denied any urinary symptoms or systemic symptoms before or during the onset of the erosions. There were no recent changes in his regular medication. His last sexual contact was more than 10 years ago.

Clinically, the patient was afebrile and had near-circumferential dry gangrene involving the glans penis associated with severe swelling of the foreskin and paraphimosis (Fig 1, A and B). The penile shaft and scrotal skin were unremarkable, with no significant dermatologic signs elsewhere. There were multiple small palpable inguinal lymph nodes.

### Perianal ulcer and proctocolitis in an immunocompromised patient [^1154a3g9]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely cause of the proctocolitis?
A. Lymphogranuloma venereum
B. KS
C. Herpes simplex virus
D. Cytomegalovirus
E. Mpox

Answers:

A. Lymphogranuloma venereum – Correct. Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is an infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis serovars L1, L2, or L3. LGV is characterized by painful inguinal lymphadenopathy and proctocolitis, most commonly in men who have sex with men or in patients with a history of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Ulcerations at the site of inoculation are also characteristic findings. As our patient had already received a partial antibacterial course of therapy for a prior positive urine NAAT for Chlamydia, negative rectal swab NAAT does not exclude LGV.
B. KS – Incorrect. Cutaneous KS presents as vascular plaques frequently affecting the extremities or oral mucosa, and gastrointestinal involvement can cause hemorrhagic nodules, tenesmus, and diarrhea that can mimic ulcerative colitis.KS does not account for the histopathology or the perianal ulceration.
C. Herpes simplex virus – Incorrect. In an immunocompromised individual, herpes simplex virus can be complicated by disseminated infection, erosions, or proctocolitis. Biopsy from the edge of the perianal ulcer was not performed. However, the absence of viral cytopathic changes on histopathology of rectal biopsy makes this a less likely explanation for the proctocolitis.
D. Cytomegalovirus – Incorrect. Cytomegalovirus manifests in immunocompromised individuals as anogenital ulcerations or, more rarely, as nodules or maculopapular eruptions. It can cause proctitis with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bleeding. However, the absence of viral cytopathic changes on histopathology makes this a less likely explanation.
E. Mpox – Incorrect. Mpox colitis presents with rectal pain accompanied by perianal ulcers or rectal bleeding following a viral prodrome of fever, myalgia, or pharyngitis. Negative polymerase chain reaction for Mpox excludes this diagnosis.

### Unusual presentation of early lymphogranuloma venereum in an HIV-1 infected patient: effective treatment with 1 g azithromycin [^1161TQXF]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2003). Low credibility.

The incidence of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is low in the western world. Early LGV is characterised by bubonic disease following a painless papule or small ulcer. We report a white bisexual male who presented with a painful perianal ulcer, inguinal lymphadenitis, and concomitant infection with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). Chlamydia trachomatis serovar L2 was identified as the cause after polymerase chain reaction and genotyping the major outer membrane protein by restricted fragment length polymorphism. Treatment with a single dose of 1 g azithromycin was effective. This case illustrates that early LGV may mimic other genital ulcer diseases, such as genital herpes or chancroid, especially in HIV infected patients. In the western world, LGV must still be included in the differential diagnosis of bubonic disease with or without sexually acquired ulcers.

### Chancroid: clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management [^111iBfm3]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2003). Low credibility.

Chancroid is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by the Gram negative bacterium Haemophilus ducreyi and is characterised by necrotising genital ulceration which may be accompanied by inguinal lymphadenitis or bubo formation. H ducreyi is a fastidious organism which is difficult to culture from genital ulcer material. DNA amplification techniques have shown improved diagnostic sensitivity but are only performed in a few laboratories. The management of chancroid in the tropics tends to be undertaken in the context of syndromic management of genital ulcer disease and treatment is usually with erythromycin. A number of single dose regimens are also available to treat H ducreyi infection. Genital ulceration as a syndrome has been associated with increased transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in several cross sectional and longitudinal studies. Effective and early treatment of genital ulceration is therefore an important part of any strategy to control the spread of HIV infection in tropical countries.

### Developing a symptoms-based risk score for infectious syphilis among men who have sex with men [^117EiTiH]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2023). Medium credibility.

In a multivariable analysis including all symptoms (and a partner notification for syphilis) included in the expert-based risk score (model A), the following symptoms were strongly associated with an infectious syphilis diagnosis: painless penile ulcer with palpable regional lymph nodes (adjusted OR (aOR) 85.8, 95% CI 36.6 to 201.0), painless anal ulcer with palpable regional lymph nodes (aOR 63.8, 95% CI 4.1 to 991.8) and non-itching rash (aOR 54.3, 95% CI 32.7 to 90.2) (table 2). In model B, which is similar to model A, but with non-significant symptoms omitted, the same symptoms were strongly associated with an infectious syphilis diagnosis: painless penile ulcer with palpable regional lymph nodes (aOR 85.7, 95% CI 36.6 to 200.6), non-itching rash (aOR 64.8, 95% CI 40.4 to 103.7) and painless anal ulcer with palpable regional lymph nodes (aOR 63.6, 95% CI 4.1 to 989.3). Because a painless penile ulcer was strongly associated with infectious syphilis regardless of palpable regional lymph nodes, and also a painful penile ulcer was strongly associated with infectious syphilis regardless of palpable regional lymph nodes, we made model C in which 'painless penile ulcer' and 'painful penile ulcer' were included rather than the four separate items. In this optimised model C, a painless anal ulcer with inguinal lymph nodes (aOR 65.4, 95% CI 4.4 to 981.1), non-itching rash (aOR 64.8, 95% CI 40.5 to 103.7) and painless penile ulcer (aOR 36.1, 95% CI 25.2 to 51.6) were most strongly associated with an infectious syphilis diagnosis.

### Umbilicated vesicles and multiple pustules on the genital area in a man [^112CinX8]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

A 61-year-old HIV-negative, man presented with itchy lesions on his genital area, that had developed 3 days before the consultation. Seven days before the eruption, he attended a party where he had unprotected sexual intercourse with men. Physical examination showed 3, 3 to 4 mm, asymptomatic, umbilicated vesicles and multiple pustules on the penis shaft and pubis, accompanied by bilateral lymphadenopathy (Fig 1, A). On follow-up after 10 days, the vesicles and pustules spontaneously resolved, leaving some crusted lesions (Fig 1, B). Dermoscopy of an umbilicated vesicle revealed a trizonal pattern, characterized by a central ulceration-crust, a white peripheral halo with dotted hemorrhagic vessels and a paler pink zone at the periphery (Fig 2). Histopathology showed a cluster of pallor and ballooning degeneration of keratinocytes, with scattered eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions (Fig 3).

### Toxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae-associated genital ulceration [^1136ji6t]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Only few cases of cutaneous diphtheria are reported in Germany, and they are strongly associated with defined risk factors, especially contact, during endemic circulation, associated with traveling, migration, zoonotic reservoirs, or poor socioeconomic conditions. In this case, the clinical manifestion of the genital ulcer with typical symptoms of sexually transmitted infections, such as painful unilateral inguinal nodules, supports the likelihood of sexually transmitted diphtheria, although we were not able to verify the patient's medical or sexual history. We did not isolate any other pathogen, in contrast with another case of male urethritis in which toxigenic C. diphtheriae was part of a polymicrobial infection and sexual transmission was assumed. This case shows that unusual manifestations of diphtheria are conceivable on various body sites. Clinicians should consider this easily overlooked disease in the differential diagnosis for similar cases. This awareness might lead to an increase in confirmed cases, improve outcomes, and prevent disease through subsequent public health actions.

### Sclerosing lymphangitis of the penis [^113UrPvb]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Nonvenereal sclerosing lymphangitis is a rare penile lesion consisting of a minimally tender, indurated cord involving the coronal sulcus and occasionally adjacent distal penile skin. This disorder most often occurs after vigorous sexual activity and resolves spontaneously. However, as evidenced by 2 of the 3 cases reported, this condition also may be associated with underlying sexually transmitted disease that necessitates specific therapy.

### Head and neck manifestations of lymphogranuloma venereum [^115uCF5q]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) — caused by Chlamydia trachomatis serovars L1, L2, or L3 — rarely occurs in the United States. The disease clinically manifests in three stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary. The primary manifestation, a self-limited genital ulcer at the site of inoculation, often is absent by the time the patient seeks medical attention. The most common clinical manifestation of LGV is evident in its secondary stage: unilateral tender inguinal and/or femoral lymphadenopathy. However, proctocolitis or inflammatory involvement of perirectal or perianal lymphatic tissues resulting in fistulas and strictures may also occur. The diagnosis of LGV is usually made serologically and by exclusion of other causes of inguinal lymphadenopathy or genital ulcers. Doxycycline is the preferred treatment; it cures the infection and prevents ongoing tissue damage. This case highlights an unusual manifestation of LGV infection — cervical lymphadenopathy following suspected oropharyngeal infection with C trachomatis. Head and neck manifestations of LGV may become an increasing problem in the future if sexual practices such as orogenital contact become more widespread.

### Myocarditis attributable to monkeypox virus infection in 2 patients, United States, 2022 [^112UGBXU]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Patient 2 was a previously healthy 37-year-old man evaluated in the hospital for rash, fever, dyspnea, and decreased exercise tolerance 13 days after a sexual encounter with multiple partners. Five days after that encounter, he had onset of bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy, followed by multiple skin lesions in both arms and a lesion at the base of the penis 2 days later. The next day, he had fatigue, low-grade fever, and chills. Two days before he sought care at the hospital, he had difficulty breathing and decreased exercise tolerance without chest pain. He reported dyspnea after climbing a single flight of stairs, a marked decrease from his baseline (Figure 1). He had a history of treated syphilis, was taking HIV preexposure prophylaxis, and reported that his mother died at age 40 from coronary artery disease. He did not report recent SARS-CoV-2 vaccination or infection and was unvaccinated for smallpox.

Physical examination showed multiple skin lesions with central umbilication in the lower pubic and inguinal areas with smaller vesicular lesions on upper extremities. Laboratory results were notable for an elevated serum troponin I (0.35 ng/mL [reference < 0.07 ng/mL]); serial measurements at 4 and 8 hours were stable (0.34 and 0.39 ng/mL, respectively). B-type natriuretic peptide level was 49 pg/mL (reference < 100 pg/mL). An electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm, with T wave inversions in the inferior and anterolateral leads (Figure 2). Subsequent tracings showed improvement in the repolarization abnormality. Echocardiography showed normal biventricular size and systolic function with normal regional wall motion, and diastolic indices were age-appropriate.

### Amivantamab, the first epidermal growth factor receptor and mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor inhibitor, associated with penile and inguinal ulcers and paronychia [^111pDGCA]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

After a literature review, apart from clinical trials, a single case of amivantamab-induced adverse cutaneous reactions was found. A 53-year-old man developed facial, scalp, buttocks, and lower limb lesions after 3 weeks of treatment. Notably, the patient developed erosive erythema in the perianal region, erythematous papules on the scrotum, and paronychia-like changes, similar to our patient. Therapy was continued with lesions recurring following each infusion. However, lesions improved with kangfuxin liquid, compound polymyxin B ointment, and recombinant human epidermal growth factor gel.

The differential diagnosis of genital ulcers in an immunocompromised patient includes chancroid, syphilis, cytomegalovirus, Behçet disease, lymphogranuloma venereum, and herpes simplex virus. The absence of viral cytopathic changes on histology makes a viral infection less likely. However, given the unavailability of polymerase chain reaction results in our case, the possibility of herpes zoster virus cannot be entirely excluded. Negative infectious workup, nonspecific histologic findings, unresponsiveness to azithromycin, presence of paronychia, dryness, and temporal relationship with drug ingestion support the diagnosis of EGFR-inhibitor cutaneous toxicity. Among other differential diagnoses, the possibility of monkeypox in immunocompromised patients presenting with genital ulcers cannot be overlooked, which has resurged in the past year and a half.

Herein, we present a case of penile and inguinal ulcers and paronychia following amivantamab administration. Although rare, health care providers should be aware of genital ulcers as a potential cutaneous side effect associated with amivantamab and possibly other EGFR and MET targeting therapies and consider prompt interruption of therapy, if feasible.

### It's here, monkeypox: a case report [^113mcbyn]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 31-year-old man developed fatigue and fever after returning from a vacation in Miami, Florida. Two days later, he developed uncomfortable blisters on his entire body, which prompted him to visit an urgent care center, where the lesions were swabbed for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. He was not given specific instructions on what to do until the PCR results were available. Hence, he continued to engage in his daily activities, including attending work and large-scale social events. Because the patient's lesions did not resolve, he presented at our dermatology practice 4 days later for an evaluation.

The patient reported that he was previously "healthy", with unremarkable medical and surgical history. The patient identified himself as gay, although a detailed sexual history was not obtained. The patient's vitals were stable, and he was afebrile. Physical examination revealed that the patient had approximately 20 pink umbilicated papules, 2 to 8 mm in diameter, in the same stage of development, with surrounding erythema distributed across the entire body, including the face, trunk, and both arms and legs (Fig 1). He also had approximately 5 to 6 mm wide, pink, deep-seated vesicles with erosion on the palms and soles (Fig 2). The patient had bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. No lesions were observed in the mucosal membranes of the mouth or the genitals.

### Genital ulcers in an immunocompromised man [^111Demce]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 72-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes, renal transplant, long-term immunosuppression with prednisone and tacrolimus, and a recent diagnosis of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder, presented with a 2-week history of worsening headaches and blurry vision. Physical examination was notable for a left facial droop and 4 genital ulcerations: 2 on the left medial thigh and 2 on the left lateral scrotum. The ulcerations had well-defined pink raised borders and a thin yellow membrane overlying the base (Fig 1). Results of a punch biopsy are shown (Fig 2).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Chancroid
B. Syphilis
C. Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
D. Behcet disease
E. Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV)
A. Chancroid – Incorrect. Haemophilus ducreyi causes genital ulcers in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts, but is associated with lymphadenopathy, not focal neurologic deficits.
B. Syphilis – Incorrect. Treponema pallidum causes genital ulcers and neurologic symptoms from primary and tertiary syphilis, respectively. Primary and tertiary syphilis do not occur concurrently and are typically separated by years. Given the patient's acute presentation with both neurologic and cutaneous, syphilis is less likely than CMV. Histopathology of primary syphilis typically shows acantholysis of the epidermis and lymphocytic infiltrate with numerous plasma cells. CMV inclusion bodies would not be present.
C. CMV – Correct. Cutaneous presentations of CMV in the immunocompromised individual include petechial, nodular, urticarial, vesiculobullous, and papulopustular eruptions, as well as mucosal ulcerations. Of these presentations, genital ulcerations are the most common and well described in the immunosuppressed population. Histopathology (Fig 2, B) shows a dermal cell with an enlarged nucleus containing a round, eosinophilic globule and granular cytoplasm. This inclusion body is characteristic of CMV infection.
D. Behcet disease – Incorrect. Behcet disease can cause genital aphthae and central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis but is not associated with immunosuppression. Generally, patients present with oral apthae, uveitis, or cutaneous vasculitis. The patient's ongoing treatment with prednisone and tacrolimus would have therapeutic activity against Behcet disease.
E. LGV – Incorrect. Chlamydia trachomatis manifesting as LGV is more common in HIV-infected individuals than renal transplant recipients. LGV is associated with local lymphadenopathy and not CNS disease.

LGV is caused by C. trachomatis serovars L1, L2, or L3. LGV can cause severe inflammation and invasive infection, in contrast with C. trachomatis serovars A — K that cause mild or asymptomatic infection. Clinical manifestations of LGV can include GUD, lymphadenopathy, or proctocolitis. Rectal exposure among MSM or women can result in proctocolitis, which is the most common presentation of LGV infection, and can mimic inflammatory bowel disease with clinical findings of mucoid or hemorrhagic rectal discharge, anal pain, constipation, fever, or tenesmus. Outbreaks of LGV proctocolitis have been reported among MSM with high rates of HIV infection. LGV proctocolitis can be an invasive, systemic infection and, if it is not treated early, can lead to chronic colorectal fistulas and strictures; reactive arthropathy has also been reported. However, reports indicate that rectal LGV can also be asymptomatic. A common clinical manifestation of LGV among heterosexuals is tender inguinal or femoral lymphadenopathy that is typically unilateral. A self-limited genital ulcer or papule sometimes occurs at the site of inoculation. However, by the time persons seek care, the lesions have often disappeared. LGV-associated lymphadenopathy can be severe, with bubo formation from fluctuant or suppurative inguinal or femoral lymphadenopathy. Oral ulceration can occur and might be associated with cervical adenopathy. Persons with genital or colorectal LGV lesions can also experience secondary bacterial infection or can be infected with other sexually and nonsexually transmitted pathogens.

### Cellulitis of the penis: a case report [^111JaJfb]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis of the penis is an uncommon clinical condition, most often seen in young men, and presents with local and systemic signs that progress rapidly in the absence of treatment. It needs to be differentiated from sexually transmitted infections and dermatological conditions. The present report concerns a case of penile cellulitis in a young, heterosexual man, following sexual intercourse. The clinical presentation, aetiology and management are discussed. Penile swelling in any age group should be viewed with high index of suspicion and sexually transmitted infections should be excluded in young men. Group B haemolytic streptococci are the usual causative organisms, although less virulent organisms should be considered in patients who are immunocompromised. Administration of appropriate antibiotics resolves the local and systemic symptoms and avoids complications.

HIV Risk Among Men Who Have Sex with Men

MSM are disproportionately at risk for HIV infection. In the United States, the estimated lifetime risk for HIV infection among MSM is one in six, compared with heterosexual men at one in 524 and heterosexual women at one in 253. These disparities are further exacerbated by race and ethnicity, with African American/Black and Hispanic/Latino MSM having a one in two and a one in four lifetime risk for HIV infection, respectively. For HIV, transmission occurs much more readily through receptive anal sex, compared with penile-vaginal sex. Similar to other STIs, multiple partners, anonymous partners, condomless sex, and substance use are all associated with HIV infection. Importantly, other STIs also might significantly increase the risk for HIV infection. An estimated 10% of new HIV infections were attributable to chlamydial or gonococcal infection. A substantial number of MSM remain unaware of their HIV diagnosis. Clinical care involving MSM, including those who have HIV infection, should involve asking about STI-related risk factors and routine STI testing. Clinicians should routinely ask MSM about their sexual behaviors and symptoms consistent with common STIs, including urethral discharge, dysuria, ulcers, rash, lymphadenopathy, and anorectal symptoms that might be consistent with proctitis (e.g. discharge, rectal bleeding, pain on defecation, or pain during anal sex). However, certain STIs are asymptomatic, especially at rectal and pharyngeal sites, and routine testing is recommended. In addition, clinicians should provide education and counseling regarding evidence-based safer-sex approaches that have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing STI incidence (see HIV Infection, Detection, Counseling, and Referral).

Conclusion

When evaluating a patient with either new-onset disease, proctitis that has not responded to standard treatments for Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, or in the presence of atypical clinical or laboratory features, there are several differential diagnoses outlined by this paper that must be considered. Box 2 describes common or key discriminating features of these conditions with respect to Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Box 3 outlines risk factors for STIs that should be considered by clinicians, and box 4 advises on taking a sexual history in the gastroenterology clinic. Sexual health experts should be consulted in cases of confirmed or suspected STI, when further screening for co-infection including HIV, hepatitis B and C should then be undertaken, along with tests of cure and partner identification as appropriate.

### Chancroid [^1145gfcA]. Clinics in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Chancroid, caused by Haemophilus ducreyi, is a sexually transmitted genital ulcerative condition associated with inguinal bubo formation. The relative prevalence of chancroid has dramatically declined based on surveillance findings in those few endemic settings where the appropriate diagnostic tools exist; however, laboratory-based diagnostics are lacking to assist clinical management and support etiological surveillance in most parts of the world. Recent yaws surveys within the Western Pacific region indicate that H. ducreyi has re-emerged as a frequent cause of chronic skin ulceration. Although there have been no antimicrobial susceptibility studies for three decades, it is assumed that a cure remains possible with extended-spectrum cephalosporins, macrolides, or fluoroquinolones. HIV-1-infected patients require careful follow-up due to reports of treatment failure with single dose regimens. Buboes may need additional treatment with either aspiration or excision and drainage.

### Epidemiology of Haemophilus ducreyi infections [^111zUcVz]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Haemophilus ducreyi, a fastidious gram-negative bacterium, is the causative agent of chancroid, a genital ulcer disease (GUD). The organism is usually spread during sexual intercourse through microabrasions, and the disease usually manifests as multiple painful superficial ulcers associated with inguinal lymphadenitis. As a result of the painful nature of the lesions, patients usually seek immediate treatment, and asymptomatic carriage is therefore uncommon. In addition to causing GUD, H. ducreyi has been found in several recent studies to be a major cause of chronic skin ulceration in children from developing countries.

The global epidemiology of chancroid is poorly documented, and it is not included in World Health Organization estimates of the global incidence of curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs). There are some key challenges in interpreting data on the epidemiology of H. ducreyi as a causative agent of GUD. First, genital herpes cases are easily misdiagnosed as chancroid on clinical examination. Thus, reports based only on clinical diagnosis can be erroneous. Second, laboratory culture is technically difficult, and the highly sensitive and specific nucleic acid amplification tests, such as PCR, are rarely available outside national reference laboratories or specialized STI research settings, which makes it difficult to confirm clinical diagnoses.

Determination of the true global incidence of chancroid is made more difficult by widespread adoption of syndromic management for bacterial GUD (i.e. treatment with antimicrobial drugs effective against syphilis and chancroid) without microbiological confirmation in many countries. Therefore, countries often report only the total number of GUD cases. In addition, identification of GUD etiology is rarely conducted in resource-poor countries to validate syndromic management for which chancroid could also be common.

Earlier studies of tropical skin ulcers did not generally test for H. ducreyi, with the exception of a small number of case reports. There are major limitations in describing the prevalence of causative agents in tropical skin lesions that typically occur in children in rural areas where there is no access to laboratory facilities. Pathogens such as Fusobacterium fusiforme, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes have been reported from Gram staining of exudative material collected from tropical ulcers. However, cultures or PCR testing for definitive identification of fastidious pathogens involved has not been traditionally conducted. The purpose of this study was to improve our understanding of the epidemiology of H. ducreyi infection through a systematic review of published data on the proportion of genital and skin ulcers caused by this bacterium.

Diagnostic Considerations

A definitive LGV diagnosis can be made only with LGV-specific molecular testing (e.g. PCR-based genotyping). These tests can differentiate LGV from non–LGV C. trachomatis in rectal specimens. However, these tests are not widely available, and results are not typically available in a time frame that would influence clinical management. Therefore, diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion, epidemiologic information, and a C. trachomatis NAAT at the symptomatic anatomic site, along with exclusion of other etiologies for proctocolitis, inguinal lymphadenopathy, or genital, oral, or rectal ulcers. Genital or oral lesions, rectal specimens, and lymph node specimens (i.e. lesion swab or bubo aspirate) can be tested for C. trachomatis by NAAT or culture. NAAT is the preferred approach for testing because it can detect both LGV strains and non–LGV C. trachomatis strains. Therefore, all persons presenting with proctocolitis should be tested for chlamydia with a NAAT performed on rectal specimens. Severe symptoms of proctocolitis (e.g. bloody discharge, tenesmus, and rectal ulcers) indicate LGV. A rectal Gram stain with > 10 white blood cells (WBCs) has also been associated with rectal LGV.

Chlamydia serology (complement fixation or microimmunofluorescence) should not be used routinely as a diagnostic tool for LGV because the utility of these serologic methods has not been established, interpretation has not been standardized, and validation for clinical proctitis presentation has not been done. It might support an LGV diagnosis in cases of isolated inguinal or femoral lymphadenopathy for which diagnostic material for C. trachomatis NAAT cannot be obtained.

### Selected sexually transmitted diseases and their relationship to HIV [^112uPtaF]. Clinics in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Although sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are underreported and underrecognized, they are a major source of morbidity, mortality, and represent a major socioeconomic cost in developing and industrialized nations. Individuals who develop STDs are often coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Coinfection with HIV both facilitates the natural history of STDs and worsens the clinical picture. The objective of this article is to provide a review to the practicing clinician on the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, methods of diagnosis, and treatment for four cutaneous STDs — chancroid, genital herpes, granuloma inguinale, and lymphogranuloma venereum — in coinfected HIV patients.

### Scrotal and penile edema in a patient with incomplete Kawasaki disease: a case report and brief literature review [^116jPAZn]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Kawasaki disease (KD) is a common, medium artery vasculitis that predominantly affects children under the age of 5. It is usually self-limiting, although if left untreated, can lead to coronary artery aneurysms, myocardial infarct, heart failure, and arrhythmias. Kawasaki is diagnosed in patients with a fever lasting longer than 5 days and in those that have 4 out of the following criteria: conjunctivitis, rash, mucocutaneous changes, cervical lymphadenopathy, and peripheral extremity changes including erythema or edema. In patients with a prolonged fever and 2–3 of the clinical criteria, the presence of 3 supplemental lab criteria can be used to diagnose incomplete KD. The supplemental lab criteria include anemia for age, platelet count over 450,000 after day 7 of disease, albumin less than 3 g/dL, elevated ALT, leukocytosis over 15,000/mm³, and sterile pyuria. Here, we present a case of incomplete KD accompanied by penile edema, an uncommon finding in KD patients.

Syphilis

Caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum, the incidence of syphilis both in men and women has steadily risen in recent years, especially so in MSM. Primary syphilis presents within 3 months of exposure (on average within 2–3 weeks), with a painless solitary ulcer (chancre, see figure 1) and regional lymphadenopathy that may affect the genitalia, mouth or rectum. These ulcers are typically indurated with a clean base and discharge serous fluid. If unidentified, primary disease can progress to secondary syphilis typically in 6–12 weeks (but up to 2 years) later, in which bacteraemia leads to multisystem disease that may include peripheral neuropathy, maculopapular rash (typically palmoplantar, see figure 2), hepatitis, glomerulonephritis, meningitis or anterior uveitis. Secondary syphilis can also manifest with oral ulceration (typically with a snail tract distribution), proctitis and condylomata lata, which are wart-like papules commonly perianal or genital in anatomical origin. Covered in a greyish exudate, condylomata lata are highly infectious. Tertiary syphilis, which may occur several years following primary or secondary disease, can have major neurological or cardiovascular sequelae. These include dementia, paresis, seizures, aortitis or aneurysms. Tertiary syphilis may also feature gumma, which are granulomatous nodules or ulcers of the gastrointestinal tract or buttocks.

Figure 1
Solitary syphilitic chancre affecting (a) male and (b) female external genitalia. A chancre is the archetypal feature of primary syphilis. These ulcers are classically anogenital, solitary, indurated and painless; however, in atypical cases they may be multiple and painful, and can occur at extra-anogenital sites.

Figure 2
Palmoplantar rash in secondary syphilis. The skin eruption associated with secondary syphilis characteristically has a palmoplantar distribution, is pink or dark red and not pruritic.

Early infection up to 2 years after acquisition without any manifestations of primary or secondary stages is described as early latent syphilis. Primary, secondary and early latent stages of syphilis are infectious, whereas the later stages of tertiary syphilis are largely non-infectious. Emphasis should therefore be placed on diagnosing and treating primary, secondary and early latent syphilis promptly so as to avoid later complications.

### Sexual history: its importance in averting detrimental misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis [^117X1EuB]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Two cases where the sexual history proved important in reaching the diagnosis are presented. Case 1 concerns a 37-year-old HIV positive homosexual man, who presented with symptoms of rectal pain associated with bleeding. He was unsuccessfully treated for Crohn disease. A subsequent review of his sexual history led to investigations for venereal infections. A final diagnosis of proctitis secondary to lymphogranuloma venereum was made. The patient was successfully treated with doxycycline and spared an unnecessary colectomy. Case 2 concerns a 22-year-old Caucasian woman under investigation for possible lymphoma. However, the doctor carrying out the biopsy experienced a needle stick injury and the ensuing investigations revealed the patient's HIV positive status and thus the explanation for her hitherto undiagnosed lymphadenopathy. A prior review of her sexual history could have hastened the diagnosis and prevented the need for invasive tests.

Case presentation

A 59-year-old Caucasian man with a long history of treated HIV infection presented to a sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinic in October 2019 with complaints of rectal pain and fever. He was initially diagnosed with HIV infection in 2010 with a low CD4 T cell count of 60×10⁶/L and plasma HIV viral load of 151 000 copies/mL and was successfully treated with emtricitabine, tenofovir and raltegravir. He was later diagnosed with cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma (KS) with bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy in 2012 and with HHV8-positive but EBV-negative EC-PEL with cutaneous involvement in 2014. He was treated with liposomal doxorubicin (LD) for his KS and with four cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, oncovin and prednisone) for his lymphoma, as previously described. His CD4 T cell count remained below 100×10⁶/L on the same antiretroviral therapy (ART), and although he had recurrences of his lymphoma (2015–2017) involving the skin and tonsils without lymphadenopathy he had been in remission since October 2017.

His rectal pain developed 3 weeks after a single episode of receptive anal sexual intercourse with another man, precisely on 29 June 2019. On 7 October 2019, he presented to an STI clinic in Montreal with worsening rectal pain, tenesmus, mucoid discharge, constipation alternating with diarrhoea, and fever (38.4°C). He also complained of severe constitutional symptoms, including drenching night sweats, weight loss (about 9 kilogram) and extreme fatigue. He denied any bright red blood per rectum, melaena or vomiting. Physical examination of his palms, soles, torso, penis, anus, mouth, spleen and lymph nodes was unremarkable, and no lesion or ulcer was identified.

### A male in his mid-40s presenting with diffuse lymphadenopathy and multiple pulmonary nodules [^111YUkNC]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection produced by the spirochaete Treponema pallidum accompanied by a broad array of clinical features as the infection can disseminate systemically. Despite this clinical heterogeneity, acquired syphilis rarely manifests with pulmonary involvement. Since 2020, cases of syphilis have increased in the United States and commonly present without urogenital symptoms, making early detection challenging. We present the case of acquired secondary syphilis presenting with multiple solid pulmonary nodules and cervical, axillary and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

Sclerosing lymphangitis of the penis is a benign, under-reported condition consisting of a asymptomatic firm cord-like swelling around the coronal sulcus of the penis usually affecting men in the second or third decade of life. Penile oedema and erosions are rarely reported. Clinical signs may be remarkable contrasting with the self-limited character of the disease. We report a new case of sclerosing lymphangitis of the penis occurring in a 59-year-old patient marked by penile swelling and several overlying skin erosions, and discuss the clinical features and the pathogenesis aspects of the disease.

### Disseminated Lyme disease presenting with nonsexual acute genital ulcers [^1147tqwR]. JAMA Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Nonsexual acute genital ulceration (NAGU) is a rare vulvar skin condition typically affecting girls and young women, characterized by acute onset of singular or multiple painful vaginal ulcers. The etiology of this ulcerative dermatosis has not been identified, although it has been associated with systemic infections. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an association with Lyme disease.

Observations

A case of a woman with early disseminated Lyme disease presenting with NAGU is reported. A thorough workup ruled out other causes of genital ulceration, and the ulcers completely resolved after treatment with topical steroids and oral doxycycline.

Conclusions and Relevance

Although the etiology of NAGU is unknown, the vulvar ulcers may result from an exuberant immune response to infection. Most patients with NAGU exhibit nonspecific symptoms such as myalgias and fever, suggesting an infectious agent, but the majority have no identifiable pathogen. In addition to previously reported associations with systemic infection, which are reviewed herein, Lyme disease should be considered in women presenting with acute-onset genital ulcers.

### Genital ulcers caused by Epstein-Barr virus [^113vskbm]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

In North America, the most common cause of vulvar ulcers is infection with herpes simplex virus. However, Epstein-Barr virus can also cause vulvar ulcers, and may be underrecognized. Unlike herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus is not necessarily sexually transmitted. Therefore, it is particularly important to include in the differential diagnosis of genital ulcers for patients for whom a diagnosis of a venereal infection has important psychosocial consequences. We report three cases of acute primary Epstein-Barr virus infection in which the presenting symptoms were vulvar ulceration.

### Penile cancer: clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1119aTKY]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2013). Medium credibility.

Penile cancer — inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND) triage for palpable disease emphasizes diagnostic clarification and minimally invasive options: palpable lymphadenopathy at the time of diagnosis does not warrant an immediate ILND, since of the patients with palpable disease, 30% to 50% will be secondary to inflammatory lymph node swelling instead of metastatic disease. Although the distinction has traditionally been done with a 6-week course of antibiotics, percutaneous lymph node biopsy is the favored approach among penile cancer experts for patients with palpable nodes, and an antibiotic course may still be used but is limited to the setting of an overlying infection. Data on robotic ILND are limited, although a systematic review has reported that the robotic approach is safe and effective, with lower morbidity than open surgery when carefully selecting for patients with non-palpable or non-bulky inguinal nodes.

### Syphilis: an unusual manifestation? [^112xRDG2]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Syphilis is a widely investigated infectious venereal disease with varied presentations frequently mimicking other diseases. It progresses in distinct, well-characterised stages: early (primary and secondary), latent, and late (tertiary), each stage having its own unique presentations. However, there has been increasing evidence of atypical presentations. We describe one such presentation of early syphilis in its secondary stage. A man in his late 20s presented with a rash (which is typical of the secondary stage) and with bone pain with multiple lytic lesions (which is rare in the secondary stage but more typical of the tertiary stage). The patient was successfully treated for secondary syphilis. On the basis of our case, and on analysis of other case reports and research of early-stage syphilitic bone involvement, we conclude that the true incidence of bone involvement in early-stage syphilis may be higher than has been previously appreciated, and thus may be under-recognised and underdiagnosed.

### Syphilis [^112XFLft]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

What you need to know

Incidence rates of syphilis have increased substantially around the world, mostly affecting men who have sex with men and people infected with HIV
Have a high index of suspicion for syphilis in any sexually active patient with genital lesions or rashes
Primary syphilis classically presents as a single, painless, indurated genital ulcer (chancre), but this presentation is only 31% sensitive; lesions can be painful, multiple, and extra-genital
Diagnosis is usually based on serology, using a combination of treponemal and non-treponemal tests. Syphilis remains sensitive to benzathine penicillin G
Staging syphilis is important because it is the basis of management (treatment, expected treatment response, follow-up periods, and partner follow-up)
Patients with syphilis should be screened for HIV, gonorrhoea, and chlamydia

Caused by the bacteria Treponema pallidum, syphilis is transmitted through direct (usually sexual) contact with infected mucosal lesions. Other bodily fluids are also infectious when patients are bacteraemic. With infectivity up to 10–30% per sexual contact or 60% per relationship, syphilis rates have risen 300% since 2000 in many Western countries. While most infections involve men who have sex with men, infections among people with opposite sex partners also occur. In addition to increasing rates, syphilis can cause early complications such as irreversible loss of vision, so awareness of the infection is important for primary care clinicians.

### Genital herpes [^111dH5pm]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on genital herpes:

- **Definition**: Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted viral infection characterized by primary and recurrent genital inflammation and lesions.
- **Pathophysiology**: Genital herpes is mostly caused by HSV-2 and HSV-1 transmitted through sexual contact.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of genital herpes in North America is estimated to range from 5,000 to 24,000 per 100,000 people per year.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include lesions of mucous membrane presenting as bilateral clusters of macules, papules, followed by vesicles, pustules, and ulcers on the external genitalia with symptoms of pain, itching, burning, dysuria, lymphadenopathy, fever, cervicitis (women), and proctitis (homosexual men). Complications in women include aseptic meningitis and urinary retention. Recurrent episodes may show prodromal symptoms of paresthesia and pains in the area of lumbosacral dermatomes. Asymptomatic genital shedding without any clinical symptoms is quite frequent. The disease increases psychological stress with frequent recurrences.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Untreated pregnancy-related genital herpes is associated with a mortality of 0.062 per 1,000 births in neonates.

### Vulvar ulcers as a rare manifestation of hematologic malignancy [^115TKr5A]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Multiple vulvar lesions are most frequently found in the setting of sexually transmitted infections but pose a diagnostic challenge once these are excluded. A complete clinical history and physical examination are determinant to focus the search for a cause. Nevertheless, when the diagnosis is still unclear, complementary examinations, including a skin biopsy, can be of uttermost importance. In our patient, histopathologic analysis of the vulvar ulcers revealed a neutrophilic dermatosis in the spectrum of Sweet syndrome and pyoderma gangrenosum that, in the setting of persistent hematologic abnormalities, prompted continued investigation for an underlying hematologic malignancy. Acute promyelocytic leukemia is a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia which mostly presents with pancytopenia or a life-threatening coagulopathy. A paraneoplastic neutrophilic dermatosis consisting of vulvar lesions has only been rarely reported in association with acute promyelocytic leukemia, but was, in this case, an important diagnostic clue that enabled timely treatment. Drug induced ulcers should also be considered, such as in the context of all-trans retinoic acid therapy. However, timing and response to therapy are helpful to differentiate both conditions. To conclude, interdisciplinary evaluation was essential to help determine the cause of the vulvar ulcers in our patient and, ultimately, to guide adequate treatment.

Genital ulcers may be located on the vagina, penis, and anorectal or perineal areas and may be infectious or noninfectious. Herpes simplex virus is the most common cause of genital ulcers in the United States. A diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection is made through physical examination and observation of genital lesions. The 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted disease guidelines provide strategies for the management of patients with genital ulcer disease. Specific testing includes a polymerase chain reaction test for herpes simplex virus; syphilis serology and darkfield microscopy or a direct fluorescent antibody test for Treponema pallidum; and/or culture for Haemophilus ducreyi in settings where chancroid is highly prevalent. Rarely, cases of Epstein-Barr virus may present with genital ulcers. Syphilis and chancroid cause genital ulcers and are mandatory reportable diseases to the local health department. In some cases, no pathogen is identified. It is important to consider noninfectious etiologies such as sexual trauma, psoriasis, Behçet syndrome, and fixed drug eruptions. Genital ulcers are symptomatic by definition, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for syphilis infection for those at risk, early screening for syphilis infection in all pregnant women, and against routine serologic screening for genital herpes simplex virus infection in asymptomatic adolescents and adults, including those who are pregnant.

### Prostate adenocarcinoma presenting with inguinal lymphadenopathy [^114MkUvv]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

The lymphatic spread of prostate adenocarcinoma most often involves the iliac, obturator, and hypogastric nodes. Inguinal lymphadenopathy is very rare during the early stages of this disease, especially in the absence of pelvic lymphadenopathy or other metastases. We present a case of prostate adenocarcinoma with inguinal node involvement during the initial presentation, emphasizing the importance of a complete physical examination and the consideration of other concurrent diseases.

Primary and secondary syphilis — presentation and timing in HIV: Primary syphilis commonly presents as a single painless nodule at the site of contact that rapidly ulcerates to form a classic chancre, but multiple or atypical painful chancres may occur and primary lesions may be absent or missed in people with HIV; progression to secondary syphilis typically follows 2 to 8 weeks after primary syphilis, though overlap of primary and secondary manifestations can occur, with secondary syphilis featuring mucocutaneous lesions that may involve the palms and soles and systemic symptoms, mpox lesions can have a similar appearance and can occur simultaneously with early syphilis, non-focal CNS symptoms and CSF abnormalities can occur in secondary syphilis, and signs and symptoms can overlap or persist from a few days to several weeks before resolving with possible recurrence.

### It's not behçet' s! [^114h8owh]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

A healthy 28 year-old man with isolated oral candidiasis at 17 and 26 years, on no medications, and having a recent URI 1 week before, presented with acute-onset progressive, painful oral mucositis and odynophagia (Fig. 1). His temperature was 101.6°F. The white blood cell count was 19.5, with 4.4% lymphocytes, 226CD4. Oral nystatin and IV caspofungin were started. Subsequently, the patient developed injected sclera with bilateral subconjunctival hemorrhages (Fig. 2) and marginated, erythematous, targetoid genital papules with vesicular centers (Fig. 3). His oral, ocular and genital lesions corresponded to the classic distribution of Behçet's syndrome, initially placing this at the top of the differential diagnosis, followed by erythema multiforme (EM) and herpes simplex. However, generalized oral mucositis, conjunctivitis and, most importantly, targetoid lesions are not common in Behcet's syndrome. Behcet's syndrome frequently presents with aphthous ulcers sparing the outer lips, genital ulcers and uveitis. Subsequent biopsy of the targetoid lesions demonstrated EM, with vacuolizing keratinocytes and tagging lymphocytes. Skin lesions and pain resolved after 1 week of high-dose methylprednisolone without complications. Repeat complete blood count (CBC) showed resolution of the lymphocytopenia. EM is a self-limited hypersensitivity reaction to external triggers, most notably HSV, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and medications. In this patient, HIV, HSV, M.pneumonia and Legionella studies were negative. Traditionally, EM has been placed within the hypersensitivity reaction spectrum, which includes Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. However, there is suggestive evidence that EM may be a distinct entity. Treatment targets underlying infection and removing offending agents. Currently, systemic steroids are frequently used, but remain controversial.

Syphilis — clinical manifestations in people with HIV: In most people with HIV and syphilis, the clinical manifestations are similar to those in people without HIV, but infection with HIV may affect the presentation, with atypical or multiple genital lesions more apparent and accelerated progression in advanced immunosuppression; primary or secondary syphilis may cause a transient decrease in CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell count and an increase in HIV viral load that improves with recommended syphilis treatment regimens, and previous syphilis can attenuate the clinical and laboratory manifestations of incident infection with T. pallidum.

### The clinical manifestations and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases in human immunodeficiency virus-positive men [^116HYUzB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) occur commonly in sexually active human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive men. STDs may have atypical presentations, can cause significant morbidity in persons with HIV infection, and may increase the risk of HIV transmission. Thus, the appropriate diagnosis and treatment of STDs in this population are extremely important. The clinical manifestations and treatment of several common STDs in HIV-positive men are reviewed. Further research is needed to define effective management and screening strategies for STDs in men with HIV infection.

### Epstein-Barr virus-associated genital ulcers: an under-recognized disorder [^116n2VuS]. Pediatric Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Infectious mononucleosis is the best-known syndrome associated with primary Epstein-Barr virus infection. Although a variety of cutaneous and mucosal manifestations are recognized in infectious mononucleosis, genital ulcers have only rarely been described. We describe an otherwise healthy 14-year-old girl in whom painful genital ulcers developed during an episode of serologically-confirmed primary Epstein-Barr virus infection. Clinical, serologic, and histopathologic evaluation failed to disclose evidence of any other etiologic explanation for her lesions. The patient remains well, without recurrence. To date, only 13 instances of genital ulceration in females attributable to Epstein-Barr virus infection have been reported.

### 55-year-old man with ulcers in inguinal fold and intergluteal cleft found to have systemic Langerhans cell histiocytosis [^116BbjKT]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Case

A 55-year-old man presented to the Veterans Affairs New York Harbor Hospital for evaluation of ulcers in his left inguinal and intergluteal folds that had been progressing over several months (Fig 1). During a screening colonoscopy for workup of worsening anemia 1 month prior, a polyp was excised and pathology revealed an unusual histiocytic infiltration seen on pathology. Positron emission tomography–computed tomography revealed hypermetabolic cutaneous foci involving the left inguinal and perianal regions corresponding to sites of cutaneous ulceration. The patient described the ulcers as asymptomatic and gradually enlarging in size. He did not have drainage or pain from the affected areas. He also had no sexual activity, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, blood in stool, fevers, weight loss, or other constitutional symptoms.

Fig 1
A and B, Well-demarcated inguinal and intergluteal ulcers found during physicial examination were nontender on palpation.

Examination of the patient's left inguinal fold and intergluteal cleft revealed well-demarcated ulcers with rolled cobblestoned borders and fibrinous granulation tissue at the ulcer base. The lesions were nontender on palpation without an associated odor, erythema, or vesicles. There was shotty inguinal lymphadenopathy. On the soft oral palate, exophytic verrucous plaques were noted.

A complete blood count with differential analysis, basic metabolic panel, and rapid plasma reagin were unremarkable. On histopathologic examination, both skin and colon biopsies showed a dense proliferation of histiocytes and lymphocytes. Immunostaining was positive for S100, CD1a, and CD4 and weakly positive for CD45 and CD68 (Fig 2). CD20 and CD3 were negative. Electron microscopy of the skin biopsy showed Birbeck granules within the cytoplasm of a Langerhans cell (Fig 3). The skin lesion was negative for BRAF V600 mutations, including V600E, V600K, V600D, V600R, V600A, V600G, and V600M. A bone marrow biopsy was negative for CD1a and S100.

Regarding medical management for penile cancer - NCCN, more specifically with respect to management of inguinal lymph nodes (palpable non-bulky), NCCN 2013 guidelines recommend to perform percutaneous lymph node biopsy (ultrasound- or CT-guided biopsy of the most accessible node, inguinal or pelvic) in patients with unilateral lymph node(s) < 4 cm (mobile) and low-risk primary lesion. Offer the following treatment options based on biopsy results:

- **Negative**: Excisional biopsy or surveillance; offer treatment as for positive if positive on excisional biopsy

- **Positive**: Bilateral inguinal lymph node dissection; Consider offering neoadjuvant paclitaxel, ifosfamide, cisplatin chemotherapy followed by inguinal lymph node dissection.

### Diagnosis and management of genital ulcers [^116krnmh]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus infection and syphilis are the most common causes of genital ulcers in the United States. Other infectious causes include chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum, granuloma inguinale (donovanosis), secondary bacterial infections, and fungi. Noninfectious etiologies, including sexual trauma, psoriasis, Behçet syndrome, and fixed drug eruptions, can also lead to genital ulcers. Although initial treatment of genital ulcers is generally based on clinical presentation, the following tests should be considered in all patients: serologic tests for syphilis and darkfield microscopy or direct fluorescent antibody testing for Treponema pallidum, culture or polymerase chain reaction test for herpes simplex virus, and culture for Haemophilus ducreyi in settings with a high prevalence of chancroid. No pathogen is identified in up to 25 percent of patients with genital ulcers. The first episode of herpes simplex virus infection is usually treated with seven to 10 days of oral acyclovir (five days for recurrent episodes). Famciclovir and valacyclovir are alternative therapies. One dose of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine is recommended to treat genital ulcers caused by primary syphilis. Treatment options for chancroid include a single dose of intramuscular ceftriaxone or oral azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, or erythromycin. Lymphogranuloma venereum and donovanosis are treated with 21 days of oral doxycycline. Treatment of noninfectious causes of genital ulcers varies by etiology, and ranges from topical wound care for ulcers caused by sexual trauma to consideration of subcutaneous pegylated interferon alfa-2a for ulcers caused by Behçet syndrome.

### Atypical mucocutaneous manifestations of MPOX: a systematic review [^115Nayji]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

3 CLASSIC CLINICAL PRESENTATION

The incubation period of the infection ranges from 4 to 10 days. More than 90% of patients present with skin manifestations consisting of whitish papules on an erythematous inflammatory base appearing mainly within the area of virus inoculation (in recent outbreaks, such areas coincide with areas involved in sexual contact). Such erythema may not be noticeable in patients of color. The lesions have been termed pseudopustules as they are solid lesions containing no purulent material. Over the next few days, they develop central umbilication with subsequent centrifugally progressive necrosis until the entire lesion is covered (Figure 1a). Eventually, the necrotic crust falls off, leaving residual erythema or a varioliform scar. Some authors have compared the lesions to a flower in the so‐called Pansy sign. Ulcers in mucosal areas present with maceration and a dirty background(Figure 1b).

FIGURE 1
(a) Clustered pseudopustules at the base of the penis. Note the necrotic central ulceration in the larger lesion. (b) On mucosal surfaces, lesions may show a dirty nonspecific appearance.

Previous African endemic cases affected patients of different ages and both sexes, but during the 2022–2024 global outbreak, a dominant sexual route of transmission was identified. A predilection for men who have sex with men (MSM) has been found, as well as a higher frequency of lesions located in genital and perianal areas, compared with the more monomorphic patterns with truncal predominance and centrifugal spread previously seen in Africa. Furthermore, infection in the current outbreak has a better prognosis and higher infectivity. The most frequent systemic manifestations include fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, headache, and arthromyalgia. A nonnegligible percentage of cases have been associated with odynophagia, proctitis, and urethritis. Myocarditis, encephalitis, respiratory, and gastrointestinal disorders have been reported as systemic complications.

3.1 Solitary lesions

Between 8.5% and 11% of patients present with solitary lesions, most frequently located in the genital area. This presentation can be a diagnostic challenge and poses a differential diagnosis with other sexually transmitted infections such as syphilis.

### Haemophilus ducreyi causing chronic skin ulceration in children visiting Samoa [^112EY7gY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Chancroid is a sexually transmitted infection associated with genital ulceration and lymphadenopathy caused by Haemophilus ducreyi. Localized skin infections, in the absence of genital lesions, have not been previously reported. We report 3 cases of lower limb ulceration in children caused by H. ducreyi and postulate that H. ducreyi may be a previously unrecognized cause of chronic skin ulceration.

This article discusses the differential diagnosis of vulvar ulcers and describes a general clinical approach to this common but nonspecific examination finding. The differential diagnosis includes sexually and nonsexually transmitted infections, dermatitides, trauma, neoplasms, hormonally induced ulcers, and drug reactions. Patient history and physical examination provide important clues to the cause of a vulvar ulcer. However, laboratory testing is usually required for accurate diagnosis because the clinical presentation is often nonspecific and may be atypical due to secondary conditions.

Abstract

Lipschütz ulcers represent an acute, painful, nonsexually transmitted ulceration on genital skin that has been linked to Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, mumps, some salmonella species, toxoplasmosis, mycoplasma, ureaplasma, and other infective agents. Lipschütz ulcers in young sexually inactive and sexually active women are often underdiagnosed, and the work-up leads to significant patient and caregiver distress because the focus is often on sexually transmitted infections. Here we describe 2 young sexually active female patients with nonsexually acquired vulvar ulcerations secondary to mycoplasma and ureaplasma infection with corresponding histopathology findings and a representative clinical image.
