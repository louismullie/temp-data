## Question

can atorvastatin be taken when having alochol abuse

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether atorvastatin can be taken in the setting of ongoing alcohol use or alcohol use disorder, and under what conditions the benefits outweigh hepatic risks. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context of alcohol-associated liver disease and the hepatic handling and risks of atorvastatin. Then, I should verify the primary safety concern, namely drug-induced liver injury, and how alcohol modifies that risk. Next, I will review regulatory labels and liver society guidelines. After that, I should examine the evidence base from trials and observational studies, including alcohol-related subgroups. Then, I need to stratify risk by stage of liver disease, outline a monitoring plan, and weigh individual patient factors and drug–drug interactions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation with clear thresholds for action [^114wyEgr] [^113sT2zS].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Alcohol use disorder spans steatosis, alcoholic hepatitis, and cirrhosis, and atorvastatin is a hepatically metabolized HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor with a low but real risk of hepatotoxicity; importantly, labels caution use in substantial alcohol consumption and contraindicate use in acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis, so I need to keep those absolute exclusions front of mind [^114wyEgr] [^1151GhV1].

> I need to check the primary safety concern. Both alcohol and atorvastatin can raise aminotransferases, and the overlapping signal raises concern for drug-induced liver injury; labels warn of increased hepatic injury risk with heavy alcohol and advise baseline enzymes with symptom-triggered monitoring, while DILI criteria and workflow emphasize that true DILI typically meets thresholds such as ALT ≥ 5× ULN or ALP ≥ 2× ULN, with bilirubin or symptoms lending specificity, so minor, isolated elevations should not be overcalled as DILI [^113DGsLV] [^112d9ThN] [^1142Ngsv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review authoritative guidance. AASLD DILI guidance indicates baseline liver biochemistry is reasonable but routine periodic monitoring is unnecessary unless clinically indicated, and it notes statins are generally safe even in compensated chronic liver disease, with signals for reduced decompensation and HCC risk; EASL DILI guidance aligns on DILI thresholds and against routine LFT checks; ACC/AHA cholesterol guidance lists impaired hepatic function or unexplained ALT ≥ 3× ULN as predisposing to adverse effects, prompting dose downtitration or closer follow-up; and Baveno VII advises restricting statins in Child-Pugh C cirrhosis due to unproven benefit and potential harm, which I should treat as a practical contraindication alongside the FDA label [^113sT2zS] [^112d9ThN] [^115MujGV] [^112iHyrw].

> Wait, let me verify the actual hepatotoxicity signal in the literature. Case series and registries show that clinically apparent statin DILI is rare, variable in pattern, and sometimes autoimmune, with DILIN capturing 22 cases among 1,188 DILI entries and Swedish pharmacovigilance estimating roughly 1.2 per 100,000 users, while re-exposure can reproduce injury; large meta-analyses indicate modest, dose-related transaminase elevations with atorvastatin, but persistent ALT > 3× ULN is uncommon and severe liver injury is exceedingly rare in real-world safety databases, which supports cautious use rather than avoidance [^113my4Ax] [^115fzvGQ] [^117VDSBK] [^11519pqP].

> Next, I should review whether statins might actually benefit liver outcomes in alcohol-related disease. Let me consider observational data: a nationwide Swedish cohort of noncirrhotic CLD found lower risk of severe liver outcomes with statin use, with a striking association in alcohol-related CLD, and Taiwanese data in cirrhosis suggested dose-dependent reductions in decompensation and mortality across viral and alcoholic etiologies; an editorial perspective has proposed that it may be time to consider statins to slow liver disease progression, though evidence quality is largely observational, so I should be careful not to overstate causality [^115fECTU] [^114D2ArT] [^112Symxu].

> I should now stratify by stage of alcohol-associated liver disease. For normal LFTs or mild steatosis, standard dosing with baseline labs and symptom-triggered checks is acceptable; for persistent mild transaminase elevation up to 3× ULN without jaundice, I would start low (e.g., 10 mg) and recheck within 4–12 weeks, titrating if stable; for compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A–B), use is not contraindicated and potential benefits may extend to reduced decompensation, but I need closer follow-up; for decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh C) or acute alcoholic hepatitis/acute liver failure, I should avoid statins per label and portal hypertension consensus; active heavy drinking increases DILI risk, so risk counseling and alcohol reduction are integral adjuncts to prescribing [^114wyEgr] [^113sT2zS] [^112iHyrw].

> Let me outline a monitoring strategy, balancing safety and pragmatism. I should obtain baseline ALT, AST, ALP, and bilirubin, reassess at 8–12 weeks if starting in a low-risk context, and thereafter only as clinically indicated; if baseline enzymes are mildly elevated, I should recheck earlier at 4–6 weeks; if ALT or AST rise beyond 3× ULN in conjunction with bilirubin increase or symptoms such as jaundice, dark urine, fatigue, or RUQ pain, I will hold atorvastatin and evaluate for alternative causes including alcohol relapse, viral hepatitis, and acetaminophen toxicity; routine periodic monitoring in an asymptomatic, stable patient is not mandated by liver society guidance, though a one-time early check can be reassuring [^113sT2zS] [^117VDSBK] [^114wyEgr].

> I need to ensure I account for individual risk factors and interactions. Elevated ASCVD risk strongly favors initiation given high cardiovascular benefit, but in adults over 75 I may prefer moderate intensity with shared decision-making; concomitant hepatotoxic or myotoxic drugs and CYP3A4 inhibitors can raise statin exposure, and grapefruit juice moderately increases atorvastatin levels, so I should review the medication and dietary history carefully; if interacting therapy is unavoidable, I should use the lowest effective dose and monitor closely, and I must watch for additive risks such as hypothyroidism or renal impairment that increase myopathy risk [^116pbNh9] [^115MujGV] [^112KYicR] [^114hYJqh].

> I will now translate this into a practical plan. Screen for severity of liver disease and exclude decompensated cirrhosis or acute liver failure before prescribing; if acceptable to proceed, start atorvastatin at 10–20 mg daily based on ASCVD risk and tolerance, obtain baseline LFTs, counsel strongly on alcohol reduction and symptom vigilance, recheck LFTs at 4–12 weeks depending on baseline status, and titrate toward LDL-C goals while maintaining symptom-triggered monitoring; if clinically significant liver injury is suspected or ALT/AST exceed 3× ULN with bilirubin rise or symptoms, stop the drug, evaluate, and only consider rechallenge after resolution and alternative causes are addressed [^11754hxY] [^114wyEgr] [^113sT2zS].

> But wait, what if I initially assumed that alcohol use alone was a contraindication? Let me reconsider; labels and guidelines do not support a blanket prohibition in compensated disease, and emerging data suggest potential hepatic benefit in noncirrhotic alcohol-related liver disease, so my earlier reflex to avoid statins outright in any drinker would have been too conservative; instead, I should tailor use to disease stage, monitor appropriately, and prioritize alcohol cessation support while delivering guideline-concordant cardiovascular prevention [^114wyEgr] [^115fECTU] [^113sT2zS].

> In summary, I should confirm no decompensated cirrhosis or acute hepatic failure, start low and go slow with baseline and symptom-driven monitoring, and counsel on alcohol reduction; in many patients with alcohol use or compensated alcohol-related liver disease, atorvastatin's cardiovascular benefit and possible liver-protective association outweigh the low risk of serious hepatotoxicity when managed carefully, whereas in Child-Pugh C or acute alcoholic hepatitis, avoidance is prudent and label-concordant [^114wyEgr] [^113sT2zS] [^115fECTU].

Yes, **atorvastatin can be used** in patients with alcohol use disorder when cardiovascular risk is high, but it should be prescribed with caution and close monitoring [^113DGsLV]. Baseline and periodic **liver function tests** [^1151GhV1] are essential, and atorvastatin should be avoided in acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [^114wyEgr]. If ALT/AST rise to > 3× ULN or symptoms of liver injury occur, stop the drug [^111Yh8sk]. The cardiovascular benefits generally outweigh the low risk of hepatotoxicity, but patients should be counseled to reduce alcohol intake and report symptoms promptly [^116rdxEi] [^11519pqP].

---

## Hepatic considerations

- **Hepatic metabolism**: Atorvastatin is metabolized in the liver [^114wyEgr]; chronic alcohol use can impair hepatic function and increase hepatotoxicity risk [^113DGsLV].

- **Liver enzyme elevations**: Mild, transient ALT/AST elevations occur in 0.5–2% of patients [^117VDSBK], usually within 3 months and often resolve without stopping therapy [^111Yh8sk].

- **Severe hepatotoxicity**: Persistent ALT/AST > 3× ULN occurs in ~0.7% of patients [^114wyEgr]; clinically significant hepatotoxicity is rare but can be severe [^113my4Ax] [^114QJqa1].

- **Alcohol-related risk**: Chronic alcohol use increases hepatic injury risk [^113DGsLV]; monitor liver enzymes closely in these patients [^1151GhV1].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Baseline assessment**: Obtain baseline liver enzymes [^113DGsLV] before starting atorvastatin in patients with alcohol use disorder [^113sT2zS].

- **Monitoring**: Check liver enzymes periodically after initiation and dose changes [^1151GhV1]; monitor closely if alcohol use continues [^113DGsLV].

- **Discontinuation criteria**: Stop atorvastatin if ALT/AST > 3× ULN [^111Yh8sk] or if symptoms of hepatic injury (jaundice, fatigue, abdominal pain) occur [^113sT2zS].

- **Contraindications**: Do not use atorvastatin in acute liver failure [^114wyEgr] or decompensated cirrhosis [^111PrrP1].

---

## Cardiovascular benefits versus hepatic risks

When balancing **cardiovascular benefits** against **hepatic risks**, atorvastatin reduces cardiovascular events and mortality in high-risk patients, including those with alcohol use disorder. Hepatic risks are generally low — severe hepatotoxicity occurs in ~0.7% of patients, though rates may be higher with chronic alcohol use — and, with appropriate monitoring, the benefits often outweigh the risks [^11519pqP].

---

## Alternative lipid-lowering therapies

Pravastatin undergoes **less hepatic metabolism** and may be preferred in patients with significant hepatic impairment. Ezetimibe has **minimal hepatic metabolism** and can be used as monotherapy or with a lower-dose statin [^114QJqa1]. PCSK9 inhibitors have minimal hepatic metabolism and are options for **high-risk patients intolerant to statins**.

---

## Clinical management strategies

- **Patient education**: Counsel on alcohol reduction and adherence to therapy [^113sT2zS].

- **Regular monitoring**: Schedule periodic liver enzyme tests and clinical reviews [^1151GhV1].

- **Dose adjustments**: Use the lowest effective dose; adjust based on liver function and tolerance [^115MujGV].

- **Multidisciplinary approach**: Coordinate care with hepatology, cardiology, and addiction specialists [^116Z9MFz].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| - Mild alcohol use disorder <br/> - Normal liver enzymes | Atorvastatin can be used with routine monitoring |
| - Chronic alcohol use <br/> - Mild liver enzyme elevation | Use atorvastatin cautiously with close monitoring [^113DGsLV] |
| Severe hepatic impairment (acute liver failure, decompensated cirrhosis) | Contraindicated [^114wyEgr] |
| Persistent ALT/AST > 3× ULN or symptomatic hepatic injury | Discontinue atorvastatin immediately [^111Yh8sk] |

---

Atorvastatin can be used in patients with alcohol use disorder when cardiovascular risk is high, but requires **careful monitoring** [^113sT2zS]. The cardiovascular benefits generally outweigh the low risk of hepatotoxicity, but close monitoring and patient education are essential [^11519pqP].

### Amlodipine and atorvastatin [^114wyEgr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Hepatic dysfunction**: Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of atorvastatin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In most cases, these changes appeared soon after initiation, were transient, were not accompanied by symptoms, and resolved or improved on continued therapy or following a brief interruption in therapy. Persistent increases to more than three times the ULN in serum transaminases have occurred in approximately 0.7% of patients receiving atorvastatin in clinical trials. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin. Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Consider liver enzyme testing before atorvastatin initiation and when clinically indicated thereafter. Atorvastatin is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see Contraindications (4)]. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue atorvastatin.

- **Increased angina and myocardial infarction**: Worsening angina and acute myocardial infarction can develop after starting or increasing the dose of amlodipine, particularly in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease.

- **Hypotension**: Symptomatic hypotension is possible with use of amlodipine, particularly in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Because of the gradual onset of action, acute hypotension is unlikely but should be monitored.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of atorvastatin calcium PO (also known as Lipitor, Atorvaliq):

- **Exacerbation of hepatic dysfunction**: Use caution in patients with alcohol use disorder or a history of hepatic disease. Consider testing liver enzymes before treatment and monitoring thereafter. Discontinue in case of symptoms of serious hepatic injury, jaundice, or hyperbilirubinemia.

- **Hemorrhagic stroke**: Use caution when using high-dose (80 mg) atorvastatin in patients with a recent history of hemorrhagic stroke.

- **Increased blood glucose, increased HbA1c, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as an increased risk has been reported in patients receiving statins.

- **Statin-induced myopathy, rhabdomyolysis**: Use caution in patients with uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, taking other drugs increasing myopathy risk, or aged ≥ 65 years. Discontinue in case of a marked increase in CK levels or suspected or diagnosed myopathy. Discontinue temporarily in case of an acute or serious condition predisposing to renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis, such as sepsis, severe hypovolemia, major trauma or surgery, or severe electrolyte disorders.

### Amlodipine and atorvastatin [^112BwxnZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Take amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets exactly as your healthcare provider instructs. Do not alter your dose or discontinue use without consulting your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider may conduct blood tests to monitor your cholesterol levels during treatment, and your dosage may be adjusted based on these results. Take the tablets daily, at any time, with or without food. Do not break the tablets before taking them; consult your healthcare provider if you have difficulty swallowing pills.

Your healthcare provider may recommend a cholesterol-lowering diet prior to starting amlodipine and atorvastatin. Continue this low-fat diet while taking the medication. If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If more than 12 hours have passed since the missed dose, skip it and take the next dose at your regular time. Never take two doses at once. In the event of an overdose, contact your doctor, the Poison Control Center at 1–800–222–1222, or proceed to the nearest emergency room immediately.

Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, particularly with respect to elderly patients, risk stratification according to the AGS/NLA 2025 guidelines recommends engaging in shared decision-making regarding the initiation of statin therapy in patients aged 76–80 years. This is advised for those with LDL-C levels of 70–189 mg/dL and a coronary artery calcium (CAC) score of ≥ 100 or ≥ the 75th percentile compared with age, sex, and race-matched patients.

### What should we recommend to our patients with NAFLD regarding alcohol use [^1136vprR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

It is generally recommended that patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) not consume alcohol. However, because these patients are at increased cardiovascular risk and light to moderate alcohol consumption may have hepatic benefits in people with or at risk for NAFLD, this recommendation may be ill-advised. We reviewed the literature on alcohol consumption and NAFLD and conclude that:

- **Heavy consumption**: Heavy alcohol consumption has many harmful effects, including those on the liver, and should be discouraged whether a person has NAFLD or not.
- **Cardiovascular and metabolic benefits**: It is unknown whether the cardiovascular and metabolic benefits of light to moderate consumption observed in the general population extend to those with NAFLD.
- **Epidemiological and cohort studies**: Studies suggesting that light to moderate drinking may have hepatic benefits are largely cross-sectional and used surrogate endpoints.
- **Further data**: Until further data from rigorous prospective studies become available, people with NAFLD should avoid alcohol of any type or amount.

### An unusually impressive atorvastatin-induced elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase [^111W7L2Y]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A 90-year-old woman is referred six months following a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) with asymptomatic cholestatic liver function test (LFT) derangement. Following the TIA, atorvastatin and clopidogrel therapy are initiated. This is added to pre-existing once-daily nifedipine for hypertension. Nifedipine (a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 and competing substrate) and clopidogrel (a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4) may have affected the metabolism of atorvastatin, resulting in the elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase levels to over six times the upper limit of normal. More often, statin therapy elevates serum alanine aminotransferase levels. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) was deemed 'probable' as judged by the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method score. Statin therapy remains overwhelmingly safe, with benefits outweighing risks in the vast majority. The UK recommended LFT monitoring regime facilitates early recognition of DILI. Case reports are examined where similar drug combinations resulted in severe morbidity and mortality.

### Baveno VII - Renewing consensus in portal hypertension [^112iHyrw]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for statin-induced myopathy, particularly among patients with chronic liver disease, the Baveno VII 2022 guidelines recommend restricting the use of statins in patients with Child-Pugh C cirrhosis, as their benefit in these patients has not yet been proven.

### Adverse effects of statin therapy: Perception vs. the evidence - focus on glucose homeostasis, cognitive, renal and hepatic function, haemorrhagic stroke and cataract [^111Yh8sk]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Routine periodic monitoring of liver enzymes during statin therapy is not supported by evidence and is thus not recommended in asymptomatic patients. Routine monitoring could identify patients with isolated increased ALT, AST, or GGT levels, prompting physicians to reduce or discontinue statin therapy, thereby placing patients at increased risk for cardiovascular events. It is reasonable to measure hepatic function if symptoms suggestive of hepatotoxicity arise, such as unusual fatigue or weakness, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, dark-colored urine, or yellowing of the skin or sclera. If the patient develops ALT levels greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN), or lower when combined with a new increase in bilirubin levels, the statin should be discontinued. Other potential causes should be considered before assuming that the elevated liver enzymes are due to the statin.

- **Take-home messages**: Mild ALT elevation in isolation in asymptomatic statin users is not clinically relevant. In patients with mild ALT elevation due to steatosis or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, statin therapy does not worsen liver disease. Clinically apparent liver injury with statin therapy is very rare and likely to be a class effect of statins. Routine periodic monitoring of liver enzymes is not justified. Liver enzymes should be measured in the rare patient who develops symptoms suggestive of hepatotoxicity.

### Lipid-lowering therapy and the patient with multiple risk factors: What have we learned from the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) [^116rdxEi]. American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) was the first trial of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) to assess the benefits of lipid lowering in the primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients with hypertension who were not deemed to have dyslipidemia by conventional measures. A total of 19,342 patients with hypertension and at least three cardiovascular risk factors, but without CHD, were enrolled in ASCOT. Of these, 10,305 patients with a serum cholesterol level of 250 mg/dL (≤ 6.5 mmol/L) or lower were randomized to either atorvastatin (10 mg/day) or placebo in the ASCOT lipid-lowering arm (ASCOT-LLA).

The planned follow-up was an average of five years. However, the ASCOT-LLA was stopped after 3.3 years due to the superiority of atorvastatin 10 mg over placebo in reducing the primary endpoint of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) and fatal CHD. Patients receiving atorvastatin experienced a significant reduction in total cholesterol (50 mg/dL [1.3 mmol/L]) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (46 mg/dL [1.2 mmol/L]) levels after one year compared with those who received a placebo. Cholesterol lowering with atorvastatin was associated with a highly significant reduction in the primary endpoint of nonfatal MI and fatal CHD (36%, P = 0.0005). The observed benefit was consistent across the secondary endpoints and the 18 prespecified subgroups. The ASCOT-LLA findings have influenced lipid-lowering guidelines and support the concept that treatment strategies to reduce cardiovascular disease should be based on assessment.

### Statins: A brief summary [^116pxaDQ]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Despite substantial evidence indicating the clear benefits of statin therapy in both secondary and primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), a large number of additional trials are currently planned or underway. These trials aim to enhance our understanding, treatment, and prevention of CVD. Both monotherapy and combination statin regimens are being studied to optimize patient treatment and assess the mechanisms and benefits of various components of the total lipid profile.

### Advicor [^115CTEtr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk-factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Drug therapy is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol, along with other nonpharmacologic measures, has been inadequate.

Advicor: Advicor (niacin extended-release and lovastatin) is indicated for use when treatment with both Niaspan and lovastatin is appropriate. As described in the labeling for Niaspan and lovastatin, the components of Advicor are both indicated for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Patients receiving treatment with Advicor should be on a standard cholesterol-lowering diet and should continue on this diet during treatment.

Niaspan (niacin extended-release):

- **Hypercholesterolemia**: Niaspan is indicated as an adjunct to diet for the reduction of elevated total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and triglyceride (TG) levels, and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia when the response to an appropriate diet has been inadequate.

- **Secondary prevention of cardiovascular events**: In patients with a history of myocardial infarction and hypercholesterolemia, niacin is indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction.

- **Hypertriglyceridemia**: Niacin is also indicated as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of adult patients with very high triglyceride levels.

### First-degree relatives with behavioural adverse effects on statins [^111gvxet]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Irritability, aggression, and other adverse behavioural effects have been associated with the use of statins (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) and other drug classes. Numerous studies have also linked low cholesterol with aggression and violence. This paper presents the cases of two first-degree male relatives (father and son) identified by self-referral to the University of California, San Diego Statin Effects Study. Both patients experienced behavioural adverse effects on statins, including irritability and aggression; however, neither patient recognized a significant change in their behaviour. This may be the first report of behavioural adverse effects manifested on statins by first-degree male relatives, suggesting a possible familial or biological predisposition. These cases also highlight the issue of externalization by patients regarding the origin of interpersonal discord, which may serve as an obstacle to adverse effects reporting and lead to negative outcomes for patients and those around them.

### Amlodipine and atorvastatin [^113YmVVT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Postmarketing experience**: The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of amlodipine and atorvastatin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

- **Amlodipine**: The following postmarketing event has been reported infrequently where a causal relationship is uncertain: gynecomastia. In postmarketing experience, jaundice and hepatic enzyme elevations (mostly consistent with cholestasis or hepatitis), in some cases severe enough to require hospitalization, have been reported in association with use of amlodipine. Postmarketing reporting has also revealed a possible association between extrapyramidal disorder and amlodipine. Amlodipine has been used safely in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, well-compensated congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and abnormal lipid profiles.

- **Atorvastatin**:
	- **Gastrointestinal disorders**: Pancreatitis
	- **General disorders**: Fatigue
	- **Hepatobiliary disorders**: Fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure
	- **Immune system disorders**: Anaphylaxis
	- **Injury**: Tendon rupture
	- **Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders**: Rhabdomyolysis, myositis

	- There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use.

	- **Nervous system disorders**: Dizziness, peripheral neuropathy

	- There have been rare reports of cognitive impairment (e.g. memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia).

### A prospective study of hepatic safety of statins used in very elderly patients [^116gDjf1]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Statins play an important role in the care of patients with cardiovascular disease and have a good safety record in clinical practice. Hepatotoxicity is a barrier that limits the ability of primary care physicians to prescribe statins for patients with elevated liver transaminase values and/or underlying liver disease. However, limited population-based data are available on the use of statin therapy and on the hepatotoxicity of statins in very elderly patients. This prospective study evaluated the liver enzyme elevation during statin therapy in very elderly patients (≥ 80 years old).

- **Methods**: Patients with hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C levels ≥ 3.4 and < 5.7 mmol/L), atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease (CHD), or a CHD-risk equivalent were enrolled and received once-daily statin treatment. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to study the impact of age, gender, hepatitis B infection, fatty liver disease, biliary calculus, other chronic diseases, drug kinds, alcohol abuse, statin variety, and statin dose variables.

- **Results**: A total of 515 consecutive patients ranging from 80 to 98 years old were included in the analysis. These patients were treated with simvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, or atorvastatin. Twenty-four patients (4.7%, 95% CI 2.7–6.6) showed an increase in their hepatic aminotransferase levels. No significant difference in hepatic aminotransferase elevation rates was observed in different statin treatment groups. The incidence of mild, moderate, and severe elevation of aminotransferase levels was 62.5% (15/24), 29.2% (7/24).

### Statin-associated adverse effects beyond muscle and liver toxicity [^113pL5zS]. Atherosclerosis (2007). Low credibility.

Randomized controlled trials with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have consistently demonstrated significant reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Statins are currently the most widely used drugs in many countries. The most important adverse effects are associated with muscle and liver toxicity. However, with increased use and dose of statins and their over-the-counter availability in some countries, more cases of other rare side effects may be seen in clinical practice. In the present article, we review the literature concerning the statin-related adverse effects other than muscle and liver injury and provide insight into their clinical relevance and possible underlying mechanisms.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of pitavastatin PO (also known as Livalo):

- **Increased liver enzymes**: Use caution in all patients, especially those with a history of liver disease and/or using alcohol.

- **Statin-induced myopathy, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, myalgia**: Use caution in patients age 65 or greater, those with uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs, and higher pitavastatin dosage.

### Who should receive a statin these days? Lessons from recent clinical trials [^116QSDBx]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or statins, are the most successful cardiovascular drugs of all time. By interrupting cholesterol synthesis in the liver, they activate hepatocyte low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors and produce consistent and predictable reductions in circulating LDL cholesterol. This results in reproducible improvements in cardiovascular risk by retarding or even regressing the march of atherosclerosis in all major arterial trees (coronary, cerebral, and peripheral).

Clinical trials have demonstrated their capacity not only to extend life but also to improve its quality by retarding the progression of diabetes mellitus and chronic renal disease, and by enhancing central and peripheral blood flow. They are among the most extensively investigated pharmaceutical agents in clinical use. In cardiovascular endpoint trials, they have proven ability to help prevent the first and all-important myocardial infarction and to reduce the likelihood of recurrence in those who do succumb. They are equally effective in men and women of all ages and at all levels of cardiovascular risk, whether caused by hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, or metabolic syndrome.

In addition, they improve the outlook of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia whose LDL receptor function is deficient or defective; all of this comes at minimal risk to the recipient. Their most important potential side effect is myopathy, which on very rare occasions may lead to rhabdomyolysis. Clinical experience shows…

### A prospective study of hepatic safety of statins used in very elderly patients [^117FS89D]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Statins play an important role in the care of patients with cardiovascular disease and have a good safety record in clinical practice. Hepatotoxicity is a barrier that limits the ability of primary care physicians to prescribe statins for patients with elevated liver transaminase values and/or underlying liver disease. However, limited population-based data are available on the use of statin therapy and on the hepatotoxicity of statins in very elderly patients. This prospective study evaluated the liver enzyme elevation during statin therapy in very elderly patients (≥ 80 years old).

- **Methods**: Patients with hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C levels ≥ 3.4 and < 5.7 mmol/L), atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease (CHD), or a CHD-risk equivalent were enrolled and received once-daily statin treatment. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to study the impact of age, gender, hepatitis B infection, fatty liver disease, biliary calculus, other chronic diseases, drug kinds, alcohol abuse, statin variety, and statin dose variables.

- **Results**: A total of 515 consecutive patients ranging from 80 to 98 years old were included in the analysis. These patients were treated with simvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, or atorvastatin. Twenty-four patients (4.7, 95% CI 2.7–6.6) showed an increase in their hepatic aminotransferase levels. No significant difference of hepatic aminotransferase elevation rates was observed in different statin treatment groups. The incidence of mild, moderate, and severe elevation of aminotransferase levels was 62.5% (15/24), 29.2% (7/24).

### Grapefruit juice and statins [^112KYicR]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

We determined the validity of medical advice to avoid grapefruit juice consumption while taking three widely used statins. A daily glass of grapefruit juice increases blood levels of simvastatin and lovastatin by about 260% if taken at the same time (about 90% if taken 12 hours apart), and atorvastatin by about 80%. Simvastatin 40 mg, lovastatin 40 mg, and atorvastatin 10 mg daily reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in a 60-year-old man with an LDL cholesterol of 4.8 mmol/L by 37%, reducing ischemic heart disease risk by 61%. When simvastatin or lovastatin are taken at the same time as grapefruit juice, the estimated reduction in LDL cholesterol is 48%, and in heart disease is 70%. If the juice is taken 12 hours before these statins, the reductions are, respectively, 43% and 66%, and for atorvastatin, 42% and 66%. The increased rhabdomyolysis risk from grapefruit juice consumption due to the increased effective statin dose is minimal compared with the greater effect in preventing heart disease. Grapefruit juice should not be contraindicated in people taking statins.

### Statins for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^112KJLAL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are common causes of elevated liver enzymes in the general population. NASH, and to some extent NAFLD, have been associated with increased liver-related and all-cause mortality. No effective treatment is yet available. Recent reports have shown that the use of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, in patients with elevated plasma aminotransferases may result in the normalization of these liver enzymes. However, whether this is a consistent effect or whether it can lead to improved clinical outcomes beyond the normalization of abnormal liver enzymes is not clear.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of statins (including lovastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and fluvastatin) on all-cause and liver-related mortality, adverse events, and histological, biochemical, and imaging responses in patients with NAFLD or NASH.

- **Search methods**: We performed a computerized literature search in the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded up to March 2013. We conducted fully recursive searches from the reference lists of all retrieved relevant publications to ensure a complete and comprehensive search of the published literature. We did not apply any restrictions regarding the language of publication or publication date.

### A current approach to statin intolerance [^116YGjzg]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Statins are the first-line pharmacotherapy for cholesterol reduction. The use of these drugs in large randomized clinical trials has consistently shown significant reductions in major vascular events, including death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularization. The updated guidelines for the treatment of high blood cholesterol from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) will lead to an increase in the number of patients taking statins. Hence, the number of cases of statin intolerance may subsequently increase, emphasizing the need to understand and treat this important problem.

### Spectrum of statin hepatotoxicity: Experience of the drug-induced liver injury network [^113my4Ax]. Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are widely prescribed for patients with hyperlipidemia and are generally well tolerated. Mild elevations in serum aminotransferases arise in up to 3% of treated patients, but clinically apparent drug-induced liver injury is rare. The aim of this study is to report the presenting features and outcomes of 22 patients with clinically apparent liver injury due to statins. Among 1,188 cases of drug-induced liver injury enrolled between 2004 and 2012 in a prospective registry by the U.S. Drug Induced Liver Injury Network, 22 were attributed to a statin. All patients were evaluated in a standard fashion and followed for at least 6 months after onset. The median age was 60 years (range 41–80), and 15 (68%) were female. The latency to onset of liver injury ranged from 34 days to 10 years (median = 155 days). Median peak levels were alanine aminotransferase 892 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 358 U/L, and total bilirubin 6.1 mg/dL. Nine patients presented with cholestatic hepatitis and 12 patients presented with hepatocellular injury, of which six had an autoimmune phenotype. Nine patients were hospitalized, four developed evidence of hepatic failure, and one died. All commonly used statins were implicated. Four patients developed chronic liver injury, of which three had an autoimmune phenotype of liver injury.

- **Conclusion**: Drug-induced liver injury from statins is rare and characterized by variable patterns of injury, a range of latencies to onset, autoimmune features in some cases, and persistent or chronic injury in 18% of patients.

### Refining statin prescribing in lower-risk individuals: Informing risk/benefit decisions [^1122Jvkr]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, as well as those from the Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense and the Joint British Societies, all recommended treating more people with statins than previous guidelines. In each guideline, the decision-making process began with an assessment of overall cardiovascular risk. Each group proposed updated treatment thresholds, and all of them lowered the threshold compared with earlier guidelines. Since the release of these new guidelines in 2013 and 2014, additional evidence has emerged to suggest a rationale for extending statin consideration to an even larger proportion of asymptomatic adults — even those with a 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk below 7.5%. This review discusses new findings since 2013 and proposes strategies emanating from the guidelines to help clinicians and patients make more informed decisions about long-term statin use, especially pertinent to lower-risk patients.

### Statins and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in the era of precision medicine: More friends than foes [^114n97Hr]. Atherosclerosis (2019). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) describes a spectrum of alcohol-like hepatic histological changes that occur in the absence of any competing causes of chronic liver disease, notably including significant alcohol consumption. A close and bi-directional relationship links NAFLD with metabolic syndrome (MetS), and MetS will hasten the progression to more severe forms of NAFLD, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients with NAFLD typically exhibit atherogenic dyslipidemia and increased cardiovascular risk (CVR).

Statins are among the most widely prescribed lipid-lowering drugs. Their use has historically been hampered in individuals with liver disease due to fears of hepatotoxicity. However, studies suggest that statins are not only effective in reducing cardiovascular events, but may also exert multiple beneficial effects on the liver. CVR in those with NAFLD has been extensively covered by our group and others. This updated clinical narrative review critically examines the effects of statins on the pathogenesis of NAFLD, including the key elementary pathological lesions of NAFLD, i.e. steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, and its liver-related complications, i.e. cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and HCC.

### Adverse effects of statin therapy: perception vs. the evidence - focus on glucose homeostasis, cognitive, renal and hepatic function, haemorrhagic stroke and cataract [^111isjAT]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The effects on hepatic function are challenging to determine, especially regarding the role of statins in the extremely rare cases of severe liver injury associated with their use. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is the most frequent cause of acute liver failure and the need for liver transplantation in Western countries. The most common biomarkers for DILI include alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), serum total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP).

Hepatocellular injury is generally detected by elevations in serum ALT or AST. An elevated ALP marks injury to cells in the bile excretory ducts, and elevated serum total or conjugated bilirubin indicates reduced excretory function of the liver. In most cases, DILI is rare, idiosyncratic, and unpredictable. Moreover, estimating the frequency of DILI is challenging due to potential genetic, epigenetic, environmental, and clinical factors that may confound accurate diagnosis. Liver-mediated drug metabolism and transport have also been implicated in mechanisms underlying DILI. These interacting factors, along with the rarity of severe liver toxicity associated with statins, contribute to the difficulty in assessing the role of statins in DILI.

- **Take-home message**: The cardiovascular benefit of long-term statin therapy far outweighs potential risks.

### Rhabdomyolysis with simvastatin [^115dRJKJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

As 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors ('statins') are increasingly prescribed for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, this case report describes adverse effects of statin therapy, which can sometimes be fatal. It highlights the need for physicians to be aware of individual patient risk factors predisposing them to statin-induced myopathy. Furthermore, it underscores the necessity for further research into cholesterol-lowering drugs that do not have such side effects. When prescribing statins for patients, we must also explain potential side effects following the initiation of therapy and with dose titrations.

### Pravastatin sodium [^115cgVw1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hepatic dysfunction**: Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with the use of pravastatin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In most cases, these changes appeared soon after initiation, were transient, were not accompanied by symptoms, and resolved or improved on continued therapy or following a brief interruption in therapy. Persistent increases to more than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in serum transaminases have occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving either pravastatin or placebo in clinical studies. Marked persistent increases of hepatic transaminases have also occurred with pravastatin. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including pravastatin.

	- Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury.

	- Consider liver enzyme testing before pravastatin initiation and when clinically indicated thereafter. Pravastatin is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see Contraindications (4)]. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue pravastatin.

This was a potentially life-threatening complication. Fortunately, she recovered with conservative management and did not require haemofiltration. This case reminds us of the risks of statins and the caution that needs to be exercised when prescribing these medications to patients with a history of intolerances.

### Drug-induced liver injury: recent advances in diagnosis and risk assessment [^1142Ngsv]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

- **Role of currently performed liver tests in assessing DILI**: Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) most often presents as an acute viral hepatitis-like syndrome, without symptoms that specifically point to the drug aetiology unless rash or other cutaneous manifestations reinforce the suspicion of drug toxicity. The clinical spectrum of DILI can mimic almost every other liver disorder. Accompanying blood eosinophilia is uncommon in large series of patients with DILI but is clearly suggestive of drug allergy. Histopathological findings in DILI can resemble many other liver disorders, thereby limiting the value of liver biopsy in DILI diagnosis. However, biopsy can be of use to establish an alternative diagnosis when the underlying liver disease worsens (i.e. alcoholic hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)).

A diagnostic workflow for assessing cases of suspected DILI is shown in figure 3. Serum aminotransferases, that is, ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and total bilirubin (TB) levels, although not specific for DILI, remain the hallmark for detecting and classifying liver damage. Minor increases in aminotransferases that can result from adaptive and reversible liver responses to the drug (e.g. statins) or from pre-existing liver disease (e.g. fatty liver) should not be classified as DILI. An international expert group proposed the following thresholds for a diagnosis of DILI: (a) ALT value ≥ 5× ULN, (b) ALP value ≥ 2× ULN.

### Editorial: Statins and liver disease: Is it time to recommend statins to prevent liver disease progression [^112Symxu]? The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Evidence is emerging that statins may reduce liver-related adverse outcomes in individuals with chronic liver disease. In this issue of the American Journal of Gastroenterology, Kamal et al. found in their meta-analysis that statin use was associated with a reduced risk of fibrosis progression, decompensated cirrhosis, and mortality. These encouraging findings suggest beneficial liver effects of statins. However, the overall quality of the evidence is low because 9 of the 10 studies included in the meta-analysis were observational. More robust studies, including randomized trials and research on safety in patients with advanced liver disease, are needed before statins can be routinely recommended for prevention of liver-related morbidity and mortality.

### Do statins lower testosterone and does it matter [^111ZFdeB]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The relationship between statins and testosterone levels has been a topic of considerable debate. While some studies suggest that statins may lower testosterone, others find no significant impact. Understanding this relationship is crucial as testosterone plays a vital role in men's health, influencing factors such as mood, energy levels, and muscle mass. Further research is necessary to conclusively determine the effects of statins on testosterone levels and to assess the clinical significance of any potential changes.

### Unintended effects of statins from observational studies in the general population: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^1157qbcc]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The apparent protective effect of statin use on cognitive function was linked with the ApoE4 genotype in one study among individuals under 80 years. Further research is needed to assess the possible interaction of statin use and ApoE genotype on the risk of Alzheimer's disease or dementia.

Our analysis gave higher estimates than RCTs for myopathy, which may reflect differences in the diagnostic criteria used and the populations studied. Myopathy is more likely to occur with higher doses of statins and in situations that raise statin blood levels, including advanced age, frailty, deterioration of renal function, and the presence of interacting drugs, all common exclusions for RCTs. A blinded, controlled trial among healthy statin-naïve people showed that high-dose atorvastatin for six months had no effect on muscle strength or exercise performance but confirmed that statins increase muscle complaints and increased average creatine kinase, suggesting that statins produce mild muscle injury even among asymptomatic subjects. An observational study using military personnel records found that musculoskeletal conditions, arthropathies, injuries, and pain were more common among statin users than among propensity score-matched nonusers.

No increased risk of renal disease attributable to statin treatment was found in our review. Recent systematic reviews of trials have demonstrated lower mortality and cardiovascular events in persons with early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on statins, but little or no effect in persons receiving dialysis, and uncertain effects in kidney transplant recipients.

### Patients with elevated liver enzymes are not at higher risk for statin hepatotoxicity [^1141HZDQ]. Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Studies evaluating the risk of hepatotoxicity from statins in hyperlipidemic subjects with elevated baseline serum transaminases are lacking. We conducted a study to test the hypothesis that patients with elevated baseline liver enzymes have a higher risk of statin hepatotoxicity.

- **Methods**: Our study consisted of the following three cohorts of patients seen between January 1, 1998, and June 31, 2002: Cohort 1 included 342 hyperlipidemic patients with elevated baseline enzymes (AST > 40 IU/L or ALT > 35 IU/L) who were prescribed a statin. Cohort 2 comprised 1437 hyperlipidemic patients with normal transaminases who were prescribed a statin. Cohort 3 consisted of 2245 patients with elevated liver enzymes but who were not prescribed a statin. The effect of statins on liver biochemistries was assessed over a 6-month period after statins were prescribed. Elevations in liver biochemistries during follow-up were categorized into mild-moderate or severe based on predefined criteria.

- **Results**: The incidence of mild-moderate elevations and severe elevations in liver biochemistries in cohort 1 was 4.7% and 0.6%, respectively. Compared with cohort 1, individuals in cohort 2 had a lower incidence of mild-moderate elevations (1.9%, P = 0.002) but not severe elevations (0.2%, P = 0.2). However, between cohorts 1 and 3, there were no differences in the incidence of mild-moderate elevations (4.7% vs. 6.4%, respectively, P = 0.2) or severe elevations (0.6% vs. 0.4%, respectively, P = 0.6). Statin discontinuation during the follow-up was similar between cohorts 1 and 2 (11.1% vs. 10.7%, respectively, P = …

### Statins decrease the risk of decompensation in hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis: A population-based study [^114D2ArT]. Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Statin use decreases the risk of decompensation and mortality in patients with cirrhosis due to hepatitis C virus (HCV). Whether this beneficial effect can be extended to cirrhosis in the general population or cirrhosis due to other causes, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection or alcohol, remains unknown. Statin use also decreases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic HBV and HCV infection. It is unclear whether the effect can be observed in patients with pre-existing cirrhosis. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of statin use on rates of decompensation, mortality, and HCC in HBV, HCV, and alcohol-related cirrhosis.

Patients with cirrhosis were identified from a representative cohort of Taiwan National Health Insurance beneficiaries from 2000 to 2013. Statin users, defined as having a cumulative defined daily dose (cDDD) ≥ 28, were selected and served as the case cohort. Statin nonusers (< 28 cDDD) were matched through propensity scores. The association between statin use and risk of decompensation, mortality, and HCC were estimated.

A total of 1350 patients with cirrhosis were enrolled. Among patients with cirrhosis, statin use decreased the risk of decompensation, mortality, and HCC in a dose-dependent manner (P for trend < 0.0001, < 0.0001, and 0.009, respectively). Regression analysis revealed a lower risk of decompensation among statin users with cirrhosis due to chronic HBV (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.25–0.62) or HCV infection (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.29–0.93).

### Adverse effects of statin therapy: Perception vs. the evidence - focus on glucose homeostasis, cognitive, renal and hepatic function, haemorrhagic stroke and cataract [^11519pqP]. European Heart Journal (2018). High credibility.

Drug-induced liver injury is a concern with statin therapy. Idiosyncratic liver injury associated with statins is rare but can be severe. Previous studies of drug-related adverse events have suggested that statins may be implicated in 1–3% of all drug-induced liver injury (DILI) cases. In a real-world setting using the United Kingdom General Practice Research Database (1997–2006), moderate to severe hepatotoxicity (bilirubin > 60 μmol/L, AST or ALT > 200 U/L, or ALP > 1200 U/L) was reported in 0.09% (71/76,411) of patients on atorvastatin versus 0.06% (101/164,407) on simvastatin, with a hazard ratio for atorvastatin of 1.9 (95% CI 1.4–2.6).

A similar pattern of liver injury was produced on re-exposure after recovery. Despite the increasing prescription of statins since the late 1990s, the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database did not identify any increase in the rates of fatal or severe liver injury cases caused by statin use. Reports of statin-associated serious liver injury were extremely low (≤ 2 per one million patient-years). There were 75 reports of severe liver injury, including the requirement for liver transplant (n = 11) or death (n = 37), of which 30 (14 deaths, 7 liver transplantations, and 9 cases of severe liver injury) were assessed as possibly or probably associated with statin therapy. No cases were assessed as highly likely.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^113sT2zS]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Statins are among the seven 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, commonly known as "statins", used daily by millions of patients with hyperlipidemia. Generally, statins are safe; however, myalgias and myopathy can lead to early dose reduction or termination in up to 10% of treated patients. Initially, there was concern regarding self-limited serum aminotransferase elevations in up to 20% of patients receiving statins, but clinically significant hepatic dysfunction is very uncommon. In the DILIN study, only 22 of 1,188 (1.8%) consecutively enrolled patients with drug-induced liver injury (DILI) were attributed to statins over an eight-year period.

Both acute cholestatic and hepatocellular injury were observed, with fewer patients exhibiting autoimmune features. Several randomized controlled trials have demonstrated no significant increase in the incidence of persistently elevated serum aminotransferase levels between statin and placebo therapy, even in patients with known chronic liver disease. Moreover, other studies have suggested that statins in patients with compensated chronic liver disease and cirrhosis may reduce the risk of hepatocellular cancer and decompensation.

In 2012, the FDA modified the product labels of available statins, recommending baseline liver biochemistry assessments but indicating that on-treatment liver biochemistry monitoring is unnecessary unless clinically indicated. Consequently, we do not recommend checking liver biochemistries in patients receiving statins unless new or unexplained symptoms of hepatitis arise. However, statins should be avoided in patients presenting such symptoms.

### Adverse effects of statin therapy: perception vs. the evidence - focus on glucose homeostasis, cognitive, renal and hepatic function, haemorrhagic stroke and cataract [^117VDSBK]. European Heart Journal (2018). High credibility.

Elevation in liver enzymes

Mild elevation in liver transaminases occurs in 0.5–2.0% of patients on any statin, usually within three months of initiation of therapy. This may not differ significantly from placebo and, in isolation, is unlikely to be clinically relevant. A systematic meta-analysis of 135 RCTs involving more than 246,000 patients reported that statins as a class produced approximately 50% higher risk of transaminase elevation compared with control or placebo. There was a clear dose–response relationship for atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin. These elevations were transient and usually normalized with continuing therapy. Clinically relevant ALT elevations are rare. An analysis of 49 trials involving more than 14,000 patients reported persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases [> 3× upper limit of normal (ULN)] in 0.1%, 0.6%, and 0.2% of patients on atorvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, and placebo.

- **Summary of evidence for possible adverse effects of statin treatment on hepatic function**: In patients with mild ALT elevation due to steatosis or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, statin therapy does not result in worsening of liver disease, although caution may be needed in patients with pre-existing primary biliary cirrhosis. Moreover, the cardiovascular benefits of statin therapy are likely to outweigh any potential safety issues, as highlighted by the Joint Task Force guidelines. Indeed, an updated meta-analysis in more than 120,000 patients with chronic liver disease showed that statin use was associated with a lower risk of hepatic decompensation.

### Statins in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and chronically elevated liver enzymes: a histopathological follow-up study [^1125KWMK]. Journal of Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

The effect of statins on hepatic histology in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is not well-known. This study explores hepatic histology in NAFLD patients before and after the initiation of statin therapy and compares the histological outcome with NAFLD patients who had not been prescribed statins.

- **Methods**: Sixty-eight NAFLD patients were re-evaluated with a follow-up ranging from 10.3 to 16.3 years. Subjects underwent clinical investigation, and a repeat liver biopsy was obtained. No patient was taking statins at baseline, while 17 patients were treated with statins at follow-up.

- **Results**: At baseline, patients who were later prescribed statins had a significantly higher BMI and more pronounced hepatic steatosis. At follow-up, patients on statin medication continued to have a significantly higher BMI. Diabetes was significantly more common among patients on statin medication, and they had significantly more pronounced insulin resistance. However, they exhibited a significant reduction in liver steatosis at follow-up compared to patients not taking statins. Despite having a high-risk profile for the progression of liver fibrosis, only four patients on statin treatment progressed in fibrosis stage.

- **Conclusions**: Statins can be prescribed to patients with elevated liver enzymes due to NAFLD.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and cardiovascular disease are independently associated. Due to the efficacy of 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, increasing interest has been shown in establishing the safety of these drugs in NAFLD. In this study, the relationship between statin use, hepatic triglyceride content (HTGC), and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels was examined in 2,264 Dallas Heart Study participants who were using no lipid-lowering agent (n = 2,124) or using only a statin for lipid management (n = 140).

Statin use was not associated with a greater frequency of hepatic steatosis (38% vs. 34%) or elevated serum ALT (15% vs. 13%) by a pair-matched analysis. Statin use was also not associated with a greater prevalence of elevated serum ALT among subjects with hepatic steatosis (n = 638). This finding persisted when controlling for possible sample bias as a result of prescribing practices for statins. Among subjects with serum lipid abnormalities who were not using a statin, hepatic steatosis was present in 60% of those with mixed hyperlipidemia and 83% of those with both mixed hyperlipidemia and an elevated serum ALT.

In conclusion, statin use was not associated with a higher frequency of hepatic steatosis or serum ALT abnormalities, even among those with hepatic steatosis. Individuals meeting criteria for statin therapy are likely to have coexistent hepatic steatosis.

### Atorvastatin has a dose-dependent beneficial effect on kidney function and associated cardiovascular outcomes: Post hoc analysis of 6 double-blind randomized controlled trials [^116XQ5pP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

This large-scale post hoc analysis, including individual data from six long-term cardiovascular outcome trials, demonstrates that in patients at risk or with cardiovascular disease (CVD), atorvastatin modestly improves kidney function over time in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, this analysis shows that kidney function improvement is strongly associated with lower cardiovascular risk, independent of treatment, whereas a decrease in kidney function is associated with worse cardiovascular outcomes. For each standard deviation increment in the slope of kidney function, we observed a 13% to 14% reduction in major cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality while being treated with atorvastatin (either 10 or 80 mg daily).

Our data therefore indicate that the efficacy of cardiovascular protection over the long term obtained with atorvastatin is reflected by its effects on the course of kidney function over time. Furthermore, our results emphasize the bidirectional connection between the cardiovascular system and the kidneys (i.e. the cardiorenal axis) in treating cardiovascular disease. This implies that both CVD reduction and renoprotection are achieved by treating patients at risk or with CVD with atorvastatin. Conversely, a renoprotective strategy, as represented by atorvastatin treatment according to our data, translates into better cardiovascular risk management. In daily clinical practice, one may therefore consider incorporating kidney function trajectories as a readout for the success of cardiovascular risk management regimens, in addition to the control of traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure.

### Statin toxicity [^112ToQMH]. Circulation Research (2019). Low credibility.

There is now overwhelming evidence to support lowering LDL-c (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Statins are a class of drugs frequently prescribed to lower cholesterol. However, despite their widespread use, discontinuation and nonadherence remain a major gap in both the primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The major reason for statin discontinuation is the development of statin-associated muscle symptoms, though a range of other statin-induced side effects also exist.

Although the mechanisms behind these side effects have not been fully elucidated, there is an urgent need to identify those at increased risk of developing side effects and provide alternative treatment strategies. This article reviews the mechanisms and clinical importance of statin toxicity, focusing on the evaluation and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms.

### Considerations for safe use of statins: Liver enzyme abnormalities and muscle toxicity [^112QSXWb]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Statins play an important role in the care of patients with cardiovascular disease and have a good safety record in clinical practice. The risk of hepatic injury caused by statins is estimated to be about 1 percent, similar to that of patients taking a placebo. Patients with transaminase levels no more than three times the upper limit of normal can continue taking statins; often the elevations will resolve spontaneously. Coexisting elevations of transaminase levels from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and stable hepatitis B and C viral infections are not contraindications to statin use.

Although myalgias are common with statin use, myositis and rhabdomyolysis are rare. When prescribed at one-half the recommended maximal dosage or less, statins are associated with an incidence of myopathy similar to that of placebo; therefore, routine monitoring of creatine kinase levels in asymptomatic patients is not recommended. Myopathic symptoms usually resolve approximately two months after discontinuing the statin, and the same statin can be restarted at a lower dosage, or patients can try a different statin. Clinically important drugs that interact with statins and increase the risk of adverse effects include fibrates, diltiazem, verapamil, and amiodarone.

### 2013 ACC/AHA guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk in adults: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines [^115MujGV]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for statin-induced myopathy, and more specifically with respect to pretreatment assessment, the ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend deciding on the choice of the appropriate statin and dose based on patient characteristics, level of ASCVD risk, and potential for adverse effects to maximize the safety of statins. Offer moderate-intensity statin therapy to patients who otherwise require high-intensity statin therapy if they have characteristics that predispose them to statin-associated adverse effects.

- **Characteristics predisposing patients to statin adverse effects include but are not limited to**:
	- Multiple or serious comorbidities, including impaired renal or hepatic function
	- History of previous statin intolerance or muscle disorders
	- Unexplained ALT elevations ≥ 3 times the ULN
	- Patient characteristics or concomitant use of drugs affecting statin metabolism
	- Age > 75 years

### Overcoming challenges with statin therapy [^114sVU5x]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Factors contributing to increased adverse effects by raising statin exposure are varied. Several mechanisms affect drug exposure in patients and are inherently linked to the risk of dose-dependent adverse events, such as myopathy. These mechanisms include:

- **Pharmacokinetic interactions**: These interactions can lead to increased levels of statins in the blood.
- **Pharmacogenomic factors**: Genetic variations may result in higher concentrations of statins in hepatic and muscle tissue.

Understanding and addressing these factors are crucial in managing and minimizing the risk of adverse effects in patients undergoing statin therapy.

### Statin use and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in at risk individuals [^1112cD1K]. Journal of Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

The excess hepatic free cholesterol contributes to the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and statins reduce cholesterol synthesis. The aim of this study was to assess whether statin use is associated with histological liver damage related to steatohepatitis.

- **Methods**: The relationship between statin use, genetic risk factors, and liver damage was assessed in a multi-center cohort of 1201 European individuals who underwent liver biopsy for suspected non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

- **Results**: Statin use was recorded in 107 subjects and was associated with protection from steatosis, NASH, and fibrosis stage F2-F4, in a dose-dependent manner (adjusted p < 0.05 for all). In 100 treated patients matched 1:1 for modality of recruitment, gender, presence of IFG or type 2 diabetes, PNPLA3 I148M risk alleles, TM6SF2 E167K variant, age, and BMI, statin use remained associated with protection from steatosis (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01–0.32; p = 0.004), steatohepatitis (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.13–0.47; p < 0.001), and fibrosis stage F2-F4 (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20–0.8; p = 0.017). Results were confirmed in a second analysis, where individuals were matched within the recruitment center (p < 0.05 for all). The protective effect of statins on steatohepatitis was stronger in subjects not carrying the I148M PNPLA3 risk variant (p = 0.02 for interaction), as statins were negatively associated with steatohepatitis in patients negative (p < 0.001), but not in those positive for the I148M variant (p = n.s.).

- **Conclusions**: Statin use was associated with protection towards the full spectrum of liver damage.

### Statins are associated with a decreased risk of severe liver disease in individuals with noncirrhotic chronic liver disease [^115fECTU]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

Little is known about the potential impact of statins on the progression of noncirrhotic chronic liver diseases (CLDs) to severe liver disease.

- **Methods**: Using liver histopathology data in a nationwide Swedish cohort, we identified 3862 noncirrhotic individuals with CLD and statin exposure, defined as a statin prescription filled for 30 or more cumulative defined daily doses. Statin users were matched to 3862 nonusers with CLD through direct 1:1 matching followed by propensity score matching. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the primary outcome of incident severe liver disease, a composite of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver transplantation/liver-related mortality.

- **Results**: A total of 45.3% of CLD patients had nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, 21.9% had alcohol-related liver disease, 17.7% had viral hepatitis, and 15.1% had autoimmune hepatitis. During follow-up evaluation, 234 (6.1%) statin users vs. 276 (7.1%) nonusers developed severe liver disease. Statin use was associated with a decreased risk of developing severe liver disease (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.48–0.74). Statistically significantly lower rates of severe liver disease were seen in alcohol-related liver disease (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.19–0.49) and in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.45–1.00), but not in viral hepatitis (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.51–1.14) or autoimmune hepatitis (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.48–1.58). Statin use had a protective association in both prefibrosis and fibrosis stages at diagnosis.

### Vitamin E for people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^113yQVVH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

The methods section of the review has been updated since the publication of the protocol. For rare events, such as the critical outcomes of all-cause mortality and serious adverse events, we presented the risk ratio and used the Peto odds ratio in sensitivity analysis.

For the important outcome of biochemical response, we found no data on the proportion of participants without a decrease in liver enzymes. Fifteen out of the 16 included trials reported data on changes in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatases (ALP), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels; as these results were within the scope of biochemical response, we reported them in our review.

### Niacor [^117VipXn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Nicotinic acid, alone or in combination with a bile-acid binding resin, is indicated as an adjunct to diet for the reduction of elevated total and LDL cholesterol levels in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (Types IIa and IIb) when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate (see also the NCEP treatment guidelines). Prior to initiating therapy with nicotinic acid, secondary causes for hypercholesterolemia (e.g. poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, dysproteinemias, obstructive liver disease, other drug therapy, alcoholism) should be excluded, and a lipid profile should be performed to measure total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides.

Nicotinic acid is also indicated as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of adult patients with very high serum triglyceride levels (Types IV and V hyperlipidemia) who present a risk of pancreatitis and do not respond adequately to a determined dietary effort to control them. Such patients typically have serum triglyceride levels over 2,000 mg/dL and have elevations of VLDL cholesterol as well as fasting chylomicrons (Type V hyperlipidemia). Subjects who consistently have total serum or plasma triglycerides below 1,000 mg/dL are unlikely to develop pancreatitis.

### Lypqozet [^114QJqa1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Liver enzymes**: Statins, like atorvastatin and some other lipid-lowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (> 3 times the upper limit of normal, ULN, occurring on 2 or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2%, 0.2%, 0.6%, and 2.3% for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg atorvastatin, respectively.

	- One patient in clinical trials of atorvastatin developed jaundice; however, increases in liver function tests (LFTs) in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Notably, eighteen of thirty patients with persistent LFT elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of atorvastatin.

- **Ezetimibe**: In controlled clinical studies, the incidence of consecutive elevations (≥ 3 times ULN) in hepatic transaminase levels was similar between ezetimibe (0.5%) and placebo (0.3%). In controlled clinical combination studies of ezetimibe coadministered with atorvastatin, the incidence of consecutive elevations (≥ 3 times ULN) in hepatic transaminase levels was 0.6% for patients treated with ezetimibe administered with atorvastatin. These elevations in transaminases were generally asymptomatic, not associated with cholestasis, and returned to baseline after discontinuation of therapy or with continued treatment.

- **Ezetimibe and atorvastatin tablets**: It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be conducted prior to initiation and periodically thereafter when tablets are used in therapy.

### Lipid-lowering efficacy of atorvastatin [^112k2swe]. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

This represents the first update of this review, which was published in 2012. Atorvastatin is one of the most widely prescribed drugs and the most widely prescribed statin in the world. It is therefore important to know the dose-related magnitude of effect of atorvastatin on blood lipids.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective was to quantify the effects of various doses of atorvastatin on serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides in individuals with and without evidence of cardiovascular disease. The primary focus of this review was the determination of the mean percent change from baseline of LDL cholesterol.
	- **Secondary objectives included**:
		- To quantify the variability of effects of various doses of atorvastatin
		- To quantify withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs) in placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCTs)

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 11, 2013), MEDLINE (1966 to December Week 2, 2013), EMBASE (1980 to December Week 2, 2013), Web of Science (1899 to December Week 2, 2013), and BIOSIS Previews (1969 to December Week 2, 2013). We applied no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled and uncontrolled before-and-after trials evaluated the dose response of different fixed doses of atorvastatin on blood lipids over a duration of three to 12 weeks.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed eligibility criteria for studies to be included and extracted data.

### SPL drug information for fluvastatin sodium ER [^1114344o]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of fluvastatin sodium ER PO (also known as Lescol XL) in patients with substantial chronic alcohol consumption, use with caution. Monitor serum concentrations and serum aminotransferases regularly, and titrate the dosage slowly. Liver function tests should be performed at baseline, 8 weeks after the initiation of treatment, and after any increase in dose.

Unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of fluvastatin; if such a condition develops during therapy, the drug should be discontinued. Only if LDL-C levels are not available should Total-C be used to monitor therapy.

### Recommendations for (discontinuation of) statin treatment in older adults: Review of guidelines [^116bdFN9]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020). High credibility.

- **Methods**: Following consultation with an experienced health research librarian, we conducted systematic electronic searches in PubMed, Emcare, and Embase for references published from January 1, 2009 (search date April 23, 2019). We combined thesaurus terms and free text to define "statins", "cardiovascular diseases", "cholesterol", and "lipids" and terms for the concept "guideline" (Supplementary Text S1 provides the complete strategies). We additionally searched the following websites of guideline development organizations and guideline repositories: Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN), Guidelines International Network (G-I-N), National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC), Canadian Clinical Practice Guidelines Infobase, and UpToDate. For the search, we used the same terminology on April 24, 2019, with the exception of the G-I-N database (access date April 12, 2018) due to the inaccessibility of the G-I-N database from July 2018.

- **Study selection**: After removal of duplicate records, one reviewer (M.P.) assessed the initial eligibility of the retrieved studies based on the title and abstract by checking the following exclusion criteria: (a) publication is not a guideline; (b) publication is not about statin treatment; (c) publication does not regard a general adult population (e.g. disease- or population-specific guidelines, such as "patients with diabetes" or "patients with stroke"); guidelines for the general adult population that also include recommendations for secondary prevention were not excluded.

### Hepatotoxicity associated with statins: Reports of idiosyncratic liver injury post-marketing [^115fzvGQ]. Journal of Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Limited data exist on drug-induced liver injury (DILI) associated with statins. Reports on adverse reactions suspected to be due to statins received by the Swedish Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee from 1988 to 2010 were analyzed. Only cases with aminotransferases greater than five times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and/or alkaline phosphatase greater than two times the ULN were included.

The most common types of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) suspected were DILI in 124 out of 217 (57%) cases. Of these, 73 out of 124 (59%) cases had at least a possible relationship, with a median age of 64 years (range 57–73), and 55% of these individuals were male. Meanwhile, 25 out of 124 cases (20%) were excluded due to mild elevations of liver tests, and 26 were excluded due to an unlikely relationship and/or lack of data. A statin-related DILI episode was reported in 1.2 out of 100,000 users. Atorvastatin was implicated in 30 out of 73 (41%) cases, simvastatin in 28 (38%), and fluvastatin in 15%, among others. Notably, two patients died of acute liver failure, one underwent liver transplantation, and 25 (34%) experienced jaundice. Three patients were rechallenged with the same statin, producing similar patterns of liver injury.

The median duration of therapy was 90 days (range 30–120), 120 days (range 39–248) for atorvastatin, and 75 days (range 30–150) for simvastatin (not significant). Cholestatic/mixed injury was more common with atorvastatin, occurring in 17 out of 30 (56%) cases, than with simvastatin, occurring in 7 out of 28 (24%) cases (p = 0.018).

Idiosyncratic liver injury associated with statins is rare but can be severe. After recovery, a similar pattern of liver injury may be reproduced upon re-exposure. Most patients experience liver injury three to four months after the start of therapy. Atorvastatin is mostly associated with these findings.

### Amlodipine and atorvastatin [^115Cx5RJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Data from a drug-drug interaction study involving 10 mg of amlodipine and 80 mg of atorvastatin in healthy subjects indicate that the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not altered when the drugs are co-administered. The effect of amlodipine on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin showed no effect on the Cmax: 91% (90% confidence interval: 80 to 103%), but the AUC of atorvastatin increased by 18% (90% confidence interval: 109 to 127%) in the presence of amlodipine, which is not clinically meaningful.

No drug interaction studies have been conducted with amlodipine and atorvastatin and other drugs, although studies have been conducted in the individual amlodipine and atorvastatin components, as described below:

- **Impact of other drugs on amlodipine**:

	- **CYP3A inhibitors**: Co-administration with CYP3A inhibitors (moderate and strong) results in increased systemic exposure to amlodipine and may require dose reduction. Monitor for symptoms of hypotension and edema when amlodipine is co-administered with CYP3A inhibitors to determine the need for dose adjustment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

	- **CYP3A inducers**: No information is available on the quantitative effects of CYP3A inducers on amlodipine. Blood pressure should be closely monitored when amlodipine is co-administered with CYP3A inducers.

	- **Sildenafil**: Monitor for hypotension when sildenafil is co-administered with amlodipine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

- **Impact of amlodipine on other drugs**:

	- **Immunosuppressants**: Amlodipine may increase the systemic exposure of cyclosporine.

### A prospective study of hepatic safety of statins used in very elderly patients [^113QNzac]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Low credibility.

- **Cardiovascular disease (CVD)**: Cardiovascular disease was the leading cause of death, with a higher prevalence in older adults. Greater than 80% of CVD-related mortality occurs in patients ≥ 65 years old. Many reports suggest that lowering LDL-C reduces the risk of CVD. Statins are first-line therapies for dyslipidemia and specify target LDL-C levels, but they are all hepatically cleared and can cause elevations in liver biochemistries. The potential risk for hepatotoxicity limited the use of statins, especially for patients over 80 years old. Thus, there is a treatment paradox in the elderly: the more the risk of vascular disease, the less frequently statin therapy is initiated. To ascertain the role of age in the risk of hepatotoxicity during statin therapy, our study selected very elderly patients, aged 80 to 98 years (mean age of 83.8 years). We found no correlation between age and liver enzyme elevation during statin therapy in patients older than 80 years. This is supported by multiple studies in different countries within other age ranges.

- **Multimorbidity in the elderly**: Elderly people often suffer from more than one chronic disease such as diabetes, heart failure, and cognitive impairment. The co-occurrence of two or more medical conditions within a single person is called multimorbidity. Drug-induced liver injury is a major cause of liver injury. Drug metabolism, distribution, and elimination change with age. The elderly experience increased drug distribution and decreased hepatic clearance, which makes them more sensitive to polypharmacy.
