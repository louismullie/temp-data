## Question

How is malaria diagnosed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how malaria is diagnosed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching diagnostic goal and the requirement for parasitological confirmation. Then, I should evaluate test modalities in order of clinical utility: microscopy, rapid diagnostic tests, and molecular methods. Next, I will adapt the diagnostic strategy to endemic versus non-endemic settings and special populations. After that, I need to assess severity criteria and quality assurance. Finally, I will integrate emerging technologies and synthesize a pragmatic diagnostic algorithm and recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic aims so I don't miss the fundamentals. The core objective is parasitological confirmation of malaria with detection of parasites in blood, species identification — especially distinguishing Plasmodium falciparum from non-falciparum — and quantification of parasitemia to guide severity assessment and treatment, which aligns with WHO's directive to test all suspected cases before treatment and BSH's emphasis on microscopy-based confirmation [^116X7EmR] [^113rUP4T].

> I will now examine the gold standard. Light microscopy of thick and thin peripheral smears remains the reference standard; thick films maximize sensitivity for detection, and thin films allow species determination and parasitemia quantification. Wait, I should verify the operational details: BSH 2022 recommends two trained observers and at least 200 high-power fields on thick films, with Giemsa staining at pH 7.2 for optimal morphology, which matches long-standing methodological evidence on detection limits and staining methods [^1144D1FA] [^113rUP4T] [^111YUeF6].

> Next, I should review rapid diagnostic tests and not overstate their capabilities. RDTs detecting HRP2 and/or pLDH provide results in minutes and have high sensitivity for P. falciparum but lower sensitivity for P. vivax and poor performance for P. ovale and P. malariae, cannot quantify parasitemia, and may be confounded by antigen persistence, pfhrp2 gene deletions, and prozone effects; still, in non-endemic practice, RDTs can achieve high negative predictive value, expediting care when combined with smears, particularly for falciparum infection [^111akgQY] [^114o8ykC] [^115jGzoS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before considering molecular tests. PCR offers the highest analytical sensitivity with limits of detection down to approximately 0.004 parasites per microliter, whereas LAMP provides near-PCR sensitivity with simpler workflows and has proven useful to resolve discordance and reduce microscopy workload in low-incidence settings; however, these are generally reserved for reference or problem-solving rather than frontline field use due to infrastructure and cost constraints [^111YUeF6] [^114wjnGq] [^113goyYe].

> I need to adapt the pathway to setting. In endemic regions, a test-before-treat policy is standard; where microscopy is not available, community health workers can use RDTs effectively, while facility-level care should incorporate microscopy for species ID and quantification and consider LAMP or PCR when results are discordant or suspicion remains high. Let me verify combined strategies: adding LAMP to microscopy and RDT in a non-endemic cohort achieved 100% sensitivity, supporting layered approaches in selected contexts and reinforcing WHO's test-first principle and Cochrane review findings on community mRDTs improving appropriateness of treatment [^116X7EmR] [^114wjnGq] [^112zjmht].

> For non-endemic settings and imported malaria, I should confirm the initial workup. Concurrent thick and thin smears with an RDT accelerates diagnosis and is standard practice; if smears and RDT are negative but suspicion persists, repeat smears or perform PCR, noting that most diagnoses are made on the first set when RDTs are used. Wait, let me double-check pediatric operational impact: RDT implementation markedly reduced time to positive result and time to therapy in a US pediatric cohort, and adult practice guidelines in non-endemic settings emphasize rapid testing plus species confirmation to prevent delays [^114tUCzt] [^112N33uk] [^111qeRem].

> Let me consider special populations before proceeding. In pregnancy, placental sequestration lowers peripheral parasite densities, so qPCR may detect substantially more infections than peripheral microscopy or HRP2-based tests; undetected infections correlate with maternal anemia, and obstetric guidance underscores microscopy for species identification and parasitemia estimation while recognizing RDT limitations in this group [^111kTcwF] [^1147uCNH].

> Now, I should assess severity because this shapes urgency and treatment setting. Initially, I thought to apply hyperparasitemia thresholds as > 10,000 parasites per microliter with severe anemia and jaundice criteria tied to higher parasite counts; but wait, I should verify because thresholds vary by guideline and epidemiology. Correction: WHO defines severe malaria by specific clinical and laboratory criteria, while in non-endemic settings a parasite count exceeding approximately 2% infected red cells is often taken as a severity marker; thus, I need to integrate both frameworks alongside other criteria such as impaired consciousness, acidosis, hypoglycemia, renal impairment, shock, pulmonary edema, and multiple convulsions when determining severity and disposition [^111w3t9z] [^115bQmEa].

> Next, I should review quality assurance so the diagnostic system is reliable. Microscopy accuracy depends on standardized staining, adequate field examination, and experienced readers; BSH advises two independent observers and referral of positives or discrepant results to a reference lab, while molecular laboratories require validated protocols and participation in proficiency testing; where RDTs are used, storage conditions, expiry control, and vigilance for pfhrp2 deletions are essential. Let me confirm the workload implication: introducing LAMP as a screen can reduce microscopy burden by an estimated 520 work-hours annually in low-incidence settings, which is operationally meaningful [^1144D1FA] [^112syaLn] [^113rUP4T] [^115UoFWK] [^112Wc3ii] [^111akgQY].

> I will now examine emerging technologies but keep their limitations in mind. Magneto-optical haemozoin detection devices such as Gazelle show high sensitivity and specificity against microscopy in field evaluations and can be battery-operated, while deep-learning classifiers for digitized films approach expert-level performance and could support telemicroscopy; ultrasensitive RDTs improve low-density detection somewhat but remain inferior to PCR, and elimination settings will still need nucleic-acid-based tools in combination with field diagnostics [^1148ERFa] [^1178N2Sa] [^1124Y9X4] [^114v5bSC].

> Let me construct and sanity-check the diagnostic algorithm across settings. For any suspected malaria, obtain immediate parasitological testing with thick and thin smears plus an RDT; if microscopy is positive, report species and quantify parasitemia, assess severity, and initiate species-appropriate therapy. If the RDT is positive but microscopy is negative, consider low-density infection or non-falciparum species and repeat microscopy within 12–24 hours or perform PCR or LAMP. If all initial tests are negative yet clinical suspicion remains high, repeat smears at intervals or send molecular testing, recognizing that when RDTs are incorporated most cases are detected on the first set; refer positive or discrepant results to a reference laboratory to secure speciation and quality control [^116X7EmR] [^115jGzoS] [^114tUCzt] [^112syaLn].

> Finally, I should synthesize practical recommendations and check alignment with guidelines. WHO mandates parasitological confirmation before treatment, BSH underscores microscopy as the gold standard with rigorous QA and referral pathways, and in endemic communities mRDTs improve appropriateness of therapy while facilities should maintain microscopy capacity and access to molecular methods for complex or low-density cases; elimination programs will depend on layered diagnostics, including NAATs, to capture asymptomatic reservoirs [^116X7EmR] [^113rUP4T] [^112zjmht] [^114v5bSC].

Malaria diagnosis relies on **microscopy as the gold standard** [^113rUP4T] for species identification and parasitemia quantification [^1144D1FA], while **RDTs for rapid screening** [^114o8ykC] are essential in resource-limited settings [^114truh1]. Molecular methods (PCR, LAMP) offer high sensitivity for low-density or mixed infections [^114wjnGq] but require specialized resources [^112Wc3ii]. WHO recommends **parasitological confirmation for all suspected cases** [^116X7EmR], with RDTs as the primary tool where microscopy is unavailable. Limitations include operator dependence, low parasitemia detection [^114v5bSC], and HRP2 deletions [^111akgQY]; emerging technologies like magneto-optical devices [^1148ERFa] and AI-assisted microscopy [^1178N2Sa] may improve future diagnostics.

---

## Microscopy

Microscopy remains the **gold standard** [^113rUP4T] for malaria diagnosis, providing detailed information on parasite species, stage, and density [^1144D1FA]. Thick films are more sensitive for low parasitemia detection [^113rUP4T], while thin films enable accurate species identification and quantification [^1144D1FA]. The British Society for Haematology (BSH) recommends [^1144D1FA] that two trained observers examine thick films, each reviewing at least 200 high-power fields, and that thin films be used for species identification if thick films are positive.

---

## Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)

RDTs detect malaria antigens (HRP2, pLDH, aldolase) [^114o8ykC] and provide results within 15–20 minutes [^114v5bSC], making them valuable in resource-limited settings [^114truh1]. HRP2-based RDTs are **highly sensitive for Plasmodium falciparum** [^1136FC2k] [^114o8ykC] but may yield false negatives due to HRP2 gene deletions or low parasitemia [^111akgQY]. They are less sensitive for non-falciparum species, especially Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium malariae [^114o8ykC] [^114YC6DK].

---

## Molecular methods

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) are **highly sensitive and specific**, capable of detecting low-density and mixed infections [^114wjnGq] [^112Wc3ii]. PCR is the reference standard for detecting asymptomatic and low-density infections [^114wjnGq], whereas LAMP provides a simpler, faster alternative suitable for field settings [^112Wc3ii].

---

## Emerging diagnostic technologies

Emerging technologies, such as magneto-optical devices (e.g. Gazelle) [^1148ERFa] and artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted microscopy [^1178N2Sa], show promise for improving malaria diagnosis. Magneto-optical devices detect hemozoin crystals produced by malaria parasites [^1148ERFa], providing rapid, accurate results without the need for skilled microscopists [^115uBoof]. AI-assisted microscopy can automate **parasite detection and quantification** [^1178N2Sa], reducing operator dependence and improving accuracy.

---

## WHO recommendations

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends **parasitological confirmation of all suspected malaria cases** using microscopy or RDTs [^116X7EmR]. RDTs are the primary tool in resource-limited settings where microscopy is unavailable or impractical [^116X7EmR]. Molecular methods are recommended for reference laboratories and research settings, particularly to detect low-density or asymptomatic infections [^113qsuGz].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Malaria diagnosis faces several challenges, including **operator dependence** [^117DcSAo], limited sensitivity at low parasitemia [^114v5bSC], and false negatives due to HRP2 deletions [^114o8ykC]. Diagnostic accuracy also varies by species [^114o8ykC], with non-falciparum infections often underdiagnosed [^114xq69s]. Emerging technologies [^1148ERFa] and improved training [^116bYaYP] are essential to address these limitations.

---

Malaria diagnosis relies on microscopy [^113rUP4T], RDTs [^1136FC2k], and molecular methods [^111YUeF6], each with strengths and limitations. WHO recommends **parasitological confirmation for all suspected cases** [^116X7EmR], with RDTs as the primary tool in resource-limited settings. Emerging technologies like magneto-optical devices and AI-assisted microscopy may improve future diagnostics [^1178N2Sa].

Regarding diagnostic investigations for malaria infection, specifically in relation to laboratory tests, the BSH 2022 guidelines recommend assessing good-quality thick and thin films for the diagnosis of malaria. Thin films should be stained with a Giemsa stain, while thick films may be stained with either a Giemsa or a Field stain. It is advised to use Giemsa at a pH of 7.2.

### Use of loop-mediated isothermal amplification in a resource-saving strategy for primary malaria screening in a non-endemic setting [^112Wc3ii]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). High credibility.

Malaria is traditionally diagnosed by blood smear microscopy, which requires continuous resource-demanding training. In areas with only a few cases of malaria, a simple and rapid test that can reliably exclude malaria could significantly reduce the need for microscopy and training. We evaluated whether loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for screening malaria parasites could reduce the workload in the diagnosis of malaria.

Loop-mediated isothermal amplification was used to analyze 38 ethylene-diamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA) blood samples from 23 patients who had previously been tested for malaria by microscopy, antigen-based rapid diagnostic test (antigen-RDT), and in-house real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The samples included blood with low-level parasitaemia and samples with discrepancies between the results of the different methods. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification detected malaria parasites in 27 of 28 samples that were positive according to in-house RT-PCR. There were negative microscopy results in 10 of these and negative antigen-RDT results in 11. The sample with a negative LAMP result and positive in-house RT-PCR result was from a patient who had recently been treated for low-level Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasitaemia. We found LAMP to be reliable for malaria screening and suitable for replacing microscopy without loss of performance. The low number of LAMP-positive samples needing microscopy can be handled by a limited number of trained microscopists. The time saved on training and documentation was estimated to be 520 working hours.

### Malaria rapid diagnostic tests [^114o8ykC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Global efforts to control malaria are more complex than those for other infectious diseases, in part because of vector transmission, the complex clinical presentation of Plasmodium infections, the presence of more than one Plasmodium species causing infection, the geographic distribution of vectors and infection, and drug resistance. The World Health Organization approach to global malaria control focuses on two main components: vector control, and diagnosis and treatment of clinical malaria.

Although microscopy performed on peripheral blood smears remains the most widely used diagnostic test and the standard against which other tests are measured, rapid expansion of diagnostic testing worldwide will require the use of other diagnostic approaches. This review will focus on the malaria rapid diagnostic test (MRDT) for detecting malaria parasitemia, both in terms of performance characteristics of MRDTs and how they are used under field conditions. The emphasis will be on the performance and use of MRDTs in regions of endemicity, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, where most malaria-related deaths occur.

### British Society for Haematology guidelines for the laboratory diagnosis of malaria [^1144D1FA]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for malaria infection, more specifically with respect to laboratory tests, the BSH 2022 guidelines recommend examining thick films by two trained observers, each viewing a minimum of 200 high-power fields (hpfs). If thick films are positive, the species should be determined by examining a thin film, also by two observers.

### First successful field evaluation of new, one-minute haemozoin-based malaria diagnostic device [^1148ERFa]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). High credibility.

Early and accurate diagnosis of malaria is critical to the success of malaria elimination. However, the mainstay of malaria diagnosis in the field, such as light microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), has limitations due to low parasite density or mutations in diagnostic markers.

- **Methods**: We evaluated an inexpensive, robust, rapid, malaria diagnostic device called Gazelle, which employs magneto-optical detection to identify haemozoin (Hz) crystals produced by all species of human malaria parasites in infected individuals. A beam of polarized light is passed through the lysed diluted blood sample under the influence of high (~0.55T) and low magnetic fields. The difference in light transmission through the sample between the high and low magnetic fields indicates the presence of Hz, suggesting possible malarial infection. A total of 300 febrile patients were screened at the malaria clinic of the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Research in Tribal Health (ICMR-NIRTH), Jabalpur, India, from August 2018 to November 2018. Malaria diagnosis was done using four diagnostic methods: Gazelle, light microscopy, RDT, and malaria-specific Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Measures of diagnostic accuracy were compared.

- **Findings**: Out of 300 febrile patients enrolled and tested for the presence of malaria parasites, 262 patient samples were included in the final analysis. The sensitivity and specificity of Gazelle were 98% and 97% in comparison to light microscopy, 82% and 99% to PCR, and 78% and 99% to RDT, respectively. The results of the four diagnostic methods suggest that Gazelle is highly effective in accurately diagnosing malaria in the field.

### Expert-level automated malaria diagnosis on routine blood films with deep neural networks [^1178N2Sa]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Low credibility.

Over 200 million malaria cases globally lead to half a million deaths annually. Accurate malaria diagnosis remains a challenge. Automated imaging processing approaches to analyze Thick Blood Films (TBF) could provide scalable solutions for urban healthcare providers in the holoendemic malaria sub-Saharan region. Although several approaches have been attempted to identify malaria parasites in TBF, none have achieved negative and positive predictive performance suitable for clinical use in the West sub-Saharan region. While malaria parasite object detection remains an intermediary step in achieving automatic patient diagnosis, training state-of-the-art deep-learning object detectors requires the human-expert labor-intensive process of labeling a large dataset of digitized TBF.

To overcome these challenges and achieve a clinically usable system, we show a novel approach. It leverages routine clinical-microscopy labels from our quality-controlled malaria clinics to train a Deep Malaria Convolutional Neural Network classifier (DeepMCNN) for automated malaria diagnosis. Our system also provides total Malaria Parasite (MP) and White Blood Cell (WBC) counts, allowing parasitemia estimation in MP/μL, as recommended by the WHO. Prospective validation of the DeepMCNN achieves sensitivity/specificity of 0.92/0.90 against expert-level malaria diagnosis. Our approach's PPV/NPV performance is 0.92/0.90, which is clinically usable in our holoendemic settings in the densely populated metropolis of Ibadan, located in Nigeria, the most populous African country.

### Performance evaluation of different strategies based on microscopy techniques, rapid diagnostic test and molecular loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for the diagnosis of imported malaria [^114wjnGq]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Low credibility.

Malaria is one of the most common tropical diseases encountered in travelers and migrants. It requires an urgent and reliable diagnosis considering its potential severity. In this study, the performance of five diagnostic assays was evaluated in a non-endemic region and compared prospectively to quantitative PCR (qPCR).

A prospective study was conducted at Toulouse Hospital from August 2017 to January 2018, including all patients with initial Plasmodium screening. Thin and thick blood smears (TnS, TkS), quantitative buffy coat (QBC), rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), and commercial loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) were independently performed on each blood sample and compared to our qPCR reference standard.

The study encompassed 331 patients, mainly returning from Africa. qPCR detected 73 Plasmodium-positive samples (including 58 falciparum). Individually, LAMP had a 97.3% (71/73) sensitivity, far ahead of TnS (84.9%, 62/73), TkS (86.3%, 63/73), QBC (86.3%, 63/73), and RDT (86.3%, 63/73). RDT demonstrated high sensitivity for falciparum (98.3%, 57/58) but missed all ovale, malariae, and knowlesi infections. Specificity was excellent for all techniques (99.6–100%).

- **Diagnosis strategies**:
	- The most sensitive diagnosis strategies were TnS + RDT (95.9%, 70/73), TnS + LAMP (97.3%, 71/73), and TnS + RDT + LAMP (100%, 73/73), about 10% higher than strategies using exclusively microscopy, TkS + TnS (87.7%, 64/73), or QBC + TnS (87.7%, 64/73).
	- TnS remains necessary for Plasmodium species identification and quantification. Adding sequentially TnS only on LAMP-positive samples is crucial for effective diagnosis.

### WHO guidelines for malaria [^116X7EmR]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for malaria infection, specifically in relation to laboratory tests, the WHO 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining a parasitological test (microscopy or rapid diagnostic test) in all patients with suspected malaria to confirm the diagnosis.

### Guidelines for the treatment of malaria [^111w3t9z]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2015). High credibility.

The clinical calculator, "Diagnostic Criteria for Severe Malaria", is a clinical tool designed to identify patients with severe manifestations of malaria, a potentially life-threatening condition. The criteria are used to stratify patients based on the severity of their symptoms and the presence of specific clinical and laboratory findings, thereby guiding appropriate treatment strategies.

- **Clinical findings**: Prostration or impaired consciousness, multiple convulsions, pulmonary edema, compensated or decompensated shock, and significant bleeding.

- **Laboratory findings**: Jaundice with a parasite count greater than 100,000/mcL, severe anemia with a parasite count greater than 10,000/mcL, hypoglycemia, acidosis, renal impairment, and hyperparasitemia.

The severity of malaria is determined by the presence of any one of these criteria. A patient is considered to have severe malaria if they exhibit any one of the listed clinical or laboratory findings. Conversely, a patient does not meet the criteria for severe malaria if they do not exhibit any of the listed findings.

This diagnostic criteria is crucial in the clinical setting as it aids in the early identification of severe malaria, enabling the prompt initiation of appropriate treatment and potentially improving patient outcomes.

### How hidden can malaria be in pregnant women? Diagnosis by microscopy, placental histology, polymerase chain reaction and detection of histidine-rich protein 2 in plasma [^111kTcwF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Accurate diagnosis of malaria infection during pregnancy remains challenging because of low parasite densities and placental sequestration of Plasmodium falciparum. The performance of different methods to detect P. falciparum in pregnancy and the clinical relevance of undetected infections were evaluated.

- **Methods**: P. falciparum infections were assessed in 272 Mozambican women at delivery by microscopy, placental histology, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and detection of histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) in plasma by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a rapid diagnostic test (RDT). The association between infection and delivery outcomes was determined.

- **Results**: Among the 122 women qPCR-positive for P. falciparum in peripheral and/or placental blood samples, 87 (71.3%) did not receive a positive diagnosis by peripheral microscopy, 75 (61.5%) by HRP2 ELISA, and 74 (60.7%) by HRP2 RDT in plasma. Fifty-seven of the 98 qPCR-positive placental infections (58.2%) were not detected by histology. Women who were qPCR-positive but negative in their peripheral blood by microscopy or HRP2 RDT in plasma (n = 62) were at increased risk of anemia, compared with negative women (n = 141; odds ratio, 2.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–3.83; p = 0.029).

- **Conclusions**: Microscopy, placental histology, and HRP2-based plasma diagnostic methods fail to identify the majority of the P. falciparum infections detected by qPCR in peripheral and placental blood. Undetected infections were associated with maternal anemia, highlighting the urgent need for more accurate malaria diagnostic tools during pregnancy.

### Rapid diagnostic tests versus clinical diagnosis for managing people with fever in malaria endemic settings [^1126J3A7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Microscopy positive patients not prescribed antimalarials: Only one trial conducted microscopy on all participants in both intervention arms, allowing identification of malaria cases 'missed' by the RDT-supported protocol, or 'false negatives' (Ansah 2010 GHA). This trial was conducted in Ghana, where 63% of RDTs were positive for malaria. The proportion of reference slide-positive patients not prescribed antimalarials was higher with the use of RDTs, but this did not reach statistical significance (1280 participants, one trial, Analysis 1.8).

In addition, the three trials from Uganda conducted microscopy on just the participants in the arms using RDT-supported diagnosis. The proportion of microscopy-positive patients not given antimalarials due to a negative RDT result was 2.0% in the very high endemic setting (95% CI 1.2% to 2.8%, 1187 participants), 4.5% in the high endemic setting (95% CI 2.3% to 6.6%, 357 participants), and 17.2% in the area of medium endemicity (95% CI 11.6% to 22.8%, 174 participants). Table 5 examines how these figures translate into negative and positive predictive values in the different settings. In the area of medium endemicity, the accuracy of RDTs performed by health workers was not as high as in settings of high and very high endemicity, with a sensitivity of 82.8% and specificity of 72.2%. Consequently, the negative predictive value of a negative RDT in this setting is 0.93, which means that for every 100 patients with a negative RDT result, seven patients will have malaria parasites demonstrated by microscopy (false negatives).

### Adding rapid diagnostic tests to community-based programmes for treating malaria [^112GBUDv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

This review aims to evaluate community-based management strategies for treating malaria or fever. These strategies incorporate both a definitive diagnosis using a malaria rapid diagnostic test (mRDT) and appropriate antimalarial treatment.

### Managing malaria in the intensive care unit [^115bQmEa]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Microscopic examination of a blood film remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of malaria (Fig. 3). This allows speciation, quantification of parasitaemia, and detection of other markers of severity, such as the presence of schizonts. In a non-endemic setting, a parasite count greater than 2% of infected red cells is usually considered a marker of severe disease, although lower counts do not exclude this. Both thick and thin films should be examined. Thick films have a higher sensitivity for diagnosis, while thin films allow more accurate speciation and quantification of parasitaemia.

Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are used in many settings. RDTs detect circulating parasite-associated proteins and enzymes. Most tests detect both a pan-species target and a falciparum-specific target. RDTs allow diagnosis of malaria without a trained microscopist but do not usually provide speciation or quantification of parasitaemia. As such, these tests should be considered an adjunct rather than a replacement for blood film analysis. The use of PCR to diagnose malaria remains a research tool but may occasionally be useful, particularly when there is doubt about the infecting species, for example, in the differentiation of P. knowlesii from P. malariae.

### Diagnostic performance of rapid diagnostic tests versus blood smears for malaria in US clinical practice [^115jGzoS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Approximately 4 million US travelers to developing countries are ill enough to seek health care, with 1,500 malaria cases reported in the United States annually. The diagnosis of malaria is frequently delayed due to the time required to prepare malaria blood films and lack of technical expertise. An easy, reliable rapid diagnostic test (RDT) with high sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV), particularly for Plasmodium falciparum, would be clinically useful. The objective of this study was to determine the diagnostic performance of an RDT approved by the US Food and Drug Administration compared with traditional thick and thin blood smears for malaria diagnosis.

- **Methods**: This prospective study tested 852 consecutive blood samples that underwent thick and thin smears and blinded malaria RDTs at three hospital laboratories during 2003–2006. Polymerase chain reaction verified positive test results and discordant results.

- **Results**: Malaria was noted in 95 (11%) of the 852 samples. The RDT had superior performance compared to the standard Giemsa thick blood smear (p = .003). The RDT's sensitivity for all malaria was 97% (92 of 95 samples), compared with 85% (81 of 95) for the blood smear, and the RDT had a superior NPV of 99.6%, compared with 98.2% for the blood smear (p = .001). The P. falciparum performance was excellent, with 100% rapid test sensitivity, compared with only 88% (65 of 74) by blood smear (p = .003).

- **Conclusions**: This operational study demonstrates that the US Food and Drug Administration-approved RDT for malaria is superior to a single set of blood smears.

### Adding rapid diagnostic tests to community-based programmes for treating malaria [^111PzNUc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

- **Summary of findings**:

	- Malaria rapid diagnostic test (mRDT) compared to clinical diagnosis in community‐based malaria programmes.

	- Malaria rapid diagnostic test (mRDT) in community‐based care versus health facility care for people with suspected malaria.

### WHO guidelines for malaria [^112UwCv2]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2024). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for malaria infection, the WHO 2024 guidelines recommend against mass testing and treatment as a strategy to reduce malaria transmission. This recommendation also applies to patients who have an increased risk of infection compared to the general population.

### Adding rapid diagnostic tests to community-based programmes for treating malaria [^112zjmht]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

The spectrum of activities involved in home- and community-based management of suspected malaria is quite broad. Winch summarized interventions for the case management of children with malaria or pneumonia outside health facilities into seven models, six of which are relevant to the management of malaria. These models are constructed depending on who assesses the sick child (family versus CHW), method of diagnosis (microscopy, mRDT, or clinical assessment), provision of an antimalarial by CHW or family, and method of referral to the nearest health facility. The duties of those involved often include prevention and health promotion specific to malaria, as well as case identification and management. Other providers of antimalarials include registered or unregistered drug shops operating a private service with varying levels of diagnostic and case management capacity or training.

The WHO guidelines for the management of malaria have evolved considerably since 2006. Although ACTs have remained the recommended treatment for uncomplicated malaria, the guidelines increasingly emphasize the utility of parasitological testing of malaria using RDTs or microscopy prior to treatment. The aims of this approach are to improve care in parasite-positive people, identify parasite-negative people who may have other conditions so that they may also receive appropriate treatment, and thereby ensure rational use of antimalarials.

### A systematic literature review of microscopy methods reported in malaria clinical trials [^117DcSAo]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

Early and accurate parasitological diagnosis is the cornerstone of malaria treatment and control strategy. Light microscopy performed on peripheral blood smears remains the reference standard for malaria diagnosis. Malaria rapid diagnostic tests are often in use in routine care in malaria-endemic regions. Microscopy offers the advantages of differentiating malaria parasite species and stage, along with the quantification of peripheral blood parasitemia. However, light microscopy is not easy to adapt to settings where laboratory infrastructure and resources for quality assurance are limited, as is often the case in malaria-endemic areas. Standardization is further hindered by variability in the quality and procedures for slide preparation and staining, as well as differences in the number of thick film fields examined or white blood cells (WBCs) counted to detect or quantify parasitemia, leading to considerable variation in the performance of field-based malaria microscopy.

Microscopic examination of stained blood smears has become the standard of malaria diagnosis since the introduction of Giemsa's solution in 1904. Giemsa stain's stability and its persistent staining quality made it preferable over other stains, such as Leishman, Field, Romanowsky, or Wright stain.

- **Staining methods**: There are two methods of staining with Giemsa stain: rapid and slow methods. The rapid method (10% Giemsa solution, stain for 10–15 minutes) is generally used in outpatient clinics and busy laboratories where a quick result is required to determine a patient's malaria status. The slow method (3–5% Giemsa solution, stain for several hours) is used when more detailed examination is necessary.

### First successful field evaluation of new, one-minute haemozoin-based malaria diagnostic device [^113goyYe]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

Malaria is primarily diagnosed by microscopy and/or rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) at primary and community health centers in India. Though microscopy is considered the gold standard for malaria diagnosis, its use requires a well-functioning light microscope, clean glass slides, immersion oil with appropriate optical properties, fresh filtered reagents for staining, and most importantly, a skilled microscopist. Furthermore, microscopy is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and its accuracy is affected by low parasitemia.

Due to ease of handling, RDTs are increasingly used to diagnose malaria in resource-poor settings and field conditions. A total of 276 million RDTs for malaria were sold worldwide in 2017. RDTs provide qualitative results for malaria and are limited in the number of malaria species they can diagnose. RDTs are also less effective in cases of low parasitemia and infection with P. falciparum lacking histidine-rich protein-2 (Pfhrp2) in malaria-endemic regions.

Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a relatively new technique that employs the rapid amplification and detection of DNA. This method has been successfully demonstrated to detect malaria with promising results compared to microscopy, RDT, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), even though it is not suitable for field conditions. PCR is a highly sensitive and specific technique that can detect low-level parasitemia, but it is relatively expensive and requires advanced laboratory equipment and skilled execution.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for diagnosing uncomplicated non-falciparum or Plasmodium vivax malaria in endemic countries [^114YC6DK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

A diagnostic test which is simple to perform, rapid, and accurate is important in many situations to ensure prompt specific treatment, reduce misdiagnosis of non‐malarial illness as malaria, limit the development of drug resistance, and reduce drug wastage. The WHO lists some of the situations where rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can be particularly useful: in remote areas without access to expert microscopy, complex emergencies, and severe malaria, where rapid diagnosis is essential to save lives.

The WHO 2010 guidelines recommend chloroquine for P. vivax malaria in areas where parasites remain sensitive to this drug, although they are currently considering recommending artemisinin‐based combination therapies (ACTs) for all P. vivax infections as they are effective. Primaquine may be added to immediate treatment of P. vivax (and P. ovale) to effect a radical cure and prevent relapse. Therefore, in areas where both P. falciparum and P. vivax are endemic, it is often useful to be able to distinguish between the two species.

### How to manage adult patients with malaria in the non-endemic setting [^111qeRem]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). High credibility.

The diagnosis and management of malaria in non-endemic countries present a continuing challenge. Plasmodium falciparum, which is capable of rapidly inducing severe and life-threatening multiorgan disease, is the species most frequently diagnosed in Europe and North America.

- **Objectives**: To summarise the more relevant diagnostic findings and clinical features of malaria observed in non-endemic settings and to provide an update of the key management decision points using three illustrative clinical scenarios of uncomplicated and severe malaria.

- **Sources**: The discussion is based on a relevant literature search spanning the last 20 years. Recommendations are based on available clinical guidelines, including those of the WHO, observational studies conducted in non-endemic settings, and, when available, extrapolation from randomised studies from malaria-endemic settings.

- **Content**: The following topics are covered: diagnosis, including the use of molecular biology; clinical characteristics; management with a specific focus on complicated (severe) and uncomplicated malaria; and areas of resistance to available antimalarial drugs.

- **Implications**: Malaria imported to non-endemic settings, especially P. falciparum malaria, is sometimes initially overlooked and the delayed diagnosis is responsible for preventable deaths each year. This review aims to raise awareness of malaria outside endemic countries and to provide clinicians with a practical guide for efficient diagnosis and targeted therapy for the different species involved.

### Malaria diagnostics in clinical trials [^115UoFWK]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2013). Low credibility.

Malaria diagnostics are widely used in epidemiologic studies to investigate the natural history of the disease and in drug and vaccine clinical trials to exclude participants or evaluate efficacy. The Malaria Laboratory Network (MLN), managed by the Office of HIV/AIDS Network Coordination, is an international working group with mutual interests in malaria disease, diagnosis, and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome clinical trials. The MLN considered and studied the wide array of available malaria diagnostic tests for their suitability for screening trial participants and/or obtaining study endpoints for malaria clinical trials, including studies of HIV/malaria co-infection and other malaria natural history studies.

The MLN provides recommendations on microscopy, rapid diagnostic tests, serologic tests, and molecular assays to guide the selection of the most appropriate test(s) for specific research objectives. In addition, this report provides recommendations regarding quality management to ensure reproducibility across sites in clinical trials. Performance evaluation, quality control, and external quality assessment are critical processes that must be implemented in all clinical trials using malaria tests.

### When is "malaria" malaria? The different burdens of malaria infection, malaria disease, and malaria-like illnesses [^111QtwMf]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2007). Low credibility.

In this review, we discuss the different meanings of the term "malaria" and urge writers and readers to distinguish accurately between them. This distinction is important in clinical practice, clinical trials, epidemiology, and the evaluation of control programs. Both overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis of malaria as the cause of a disease episode are inevitable; overdiagnosis is common in high-transmission areas while underdiagnosis is common in areas with little or no transmission. Parasite density thresholds, attributable fractions, and clinical algorithms have played important but only partial roles in strengthening diagnosis. Methods by which malaria infection could be confidently identified as the cause, rather than an irrelevant accompaniment, of illness are important targets for research. One such "signature" is a distinctive retinopathy that occurs in severe malaria but not in clinically similar diseases. Other indicators of a malarial etiology of clinical disease are needed to strengthen clinical and scientific approaches to the control of malaria.

### Rapid diagnostic tests versus clinical diagnosis for managing people with fever in malaria endemic settings [^117DACaz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

We have presented a summary of the risk of bias assessment in Figure 3.

- **Risk of bias summary**: Review authors' judgments about each risk of bias item for each included trial. Green indicates a low risk of bias, red indicates a high risk of bias, and yellow indicates an unclear risk of bias.

- **Allocation**: Only one trial adequately described both sequence generation and allocation concealment to be considered at low risk of selection bias (Ansah 2010 GHA). The remaining six trials were at unclear risk due to inadequate descriptions of allocation concealment.

- **Blinding**: Blinding of participants and health workers to the use of RDTs was not possible. However, blinding of the outcome assessment was possible in all trials but was not described in any of them.

- **Incomplete outcome data**: Attrition bias was at low risk of bias (≤ 3%) in six trials, and in one trial, the attrition rate was high (30%) and unequal in the two arms (Skarbinski 2009 KEN).

- **Selective reporting**: All trials reported outcomes that were pre-specified in the methods sections of their protocols and reports. The risk of selective reporting was low.

- **Other potential sources of bias**: Three trials (Ansah 2010 GHA; Skarbinski 2009 KEN; Yeboah-Antwi 2010 ZAM) acknowledged baseline imbalance in the number or quality of the health workers enrolled into the trial, which were adjusted for using different methods.

See Table 1 for a summary of the results and GRADE appraisal of the quality of evidence.

### First successful field evaluation of new, one-minute haemozoin-based malaria diagnostic device [^115uBoof]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

- **Research in context**:

	- **Evidence before this study**: Microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests are widely employed diagnostic tools for malaria in field and resource-poor healthcare settings. However, the diagnosis of malaria by microscopy is often not feasible because of the lack of infrastructure, unavailability of skilled microscopists, and erratic power supply. Furthermore, the performance of rapid diagnostic tests is affected by low-density parasitemia and Pfhrp-2 gene deletion. We searched PubMed for alternative diagnostic tools that can be used in place of or in combination with existing tools for malaria diagnosis in resource-poor settings. Even though several alternative diagnostic tools were found, none were suitable for field conditions, community health centers, primary health centers, or community surveys.

	- **Added value of this study**: In the present study, we conducted a successful field evaluation of a magneto-optical device (Gazelle) for the diagnosis of malaria. The performance (sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy) of the device Gazelle was similar to microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests. Furthermore, it is a quick, battery-operated, physically rugged device with a digital interface that can be operated with little training in resource-poor settings with erratic power supply.

	- **Implications of all the available evidence**: The device Gazelle may be an important alternative diagnostic tool in areas where Pfhrp-2 deletion is prevalent. Further, it may be an essential diagnostic tool in mass surveys and resource-poor field settings. The device may be a useful remedy for the lack of skilled microscopists, which compromises malaria diagnosis across the globe.

### Adding rapid diagnostic tests to community-based programmes for treating malaria [^111uHvvN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

We attempted to identify all relevant trials regardless of language or publication status (published, unpublished, in press, and in progress) to explore the impact of adding rapid diagnostic tests to community-based programs for treating malaria.

- **Electronic searches**: We searched the following databases using the search terms and strategy presented in Appendix 1: Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (14 September 2021); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2021, Issue 9, published in the Cochrane Library); MEDLINE PubMed (1946 to 14 September 2021); Embase Ovid (1947 to 14 September 2021); Social Science Citation Index‐Expanded (Web of Science, 1900 to 14 September 2021); CINAHL EBSCOHost (1982 to 14 September 2021); PsycINFO EBSCOHost (1967 to 14 September 2021). We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov for trials in progress on 14 September 2021, with the search terms 'malaria', 'home‐based', 'community‐based', and 'presumptive treatment'.

- **Searching other resources**: We hand-searched relevant conference proceedings, including MIM Pan‐Africa Malaria and ASTMH Conferences from 2011 to 2021, and checked the reference lists of all identified studies and other relevant reviews.

- **Data collection and analysis - Selection of studies**: Two review authors independently assessed the titles and abstracts obtained from the searches to identify potentially eligible studies using a study selection form. We resolved any discrepancies through discussion and, when required, consulted a third person.

### Requirements for diagnosis of malaria at different levels of the laboratory network in Africa [^114truh1]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

The rapid increase of resistance to cheap, reliable antimalarials, the increasing cost of effective drugs, and the low specificity of clinical diagnosis have increased the need for more reliable diagnostic methods for malaria. The most commonly used and reliable method remains the microscopic examination of stained blood smears. This technique requires skilled personnel, precision instruments, and ideally a source of electricity. Microscopy has the advantage of enabling the examiner to identify the species, stage, and density of an infection.

An alternative to microscopy is the rapid diagnostic test (RDT), which uses a labeled monoclonal antibody to detect circulating parasitic antigens. This test is most commonly used to detect *Plasmodium falciparum* infections and is available in a plastic cassette format. Both microscopy and RDTs should be available at all levels of laboratory service in endemic areas. However, in peripheral laboratories with minimally trained staff, the RDT may be a more practical diagnostic method.

### Is serial testing required to diagnose imported malaria in the era of rapid diagnostic tests [^114tUCzt]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2013). Low credibility.

Exclusion of malaria traditionally requires three negative serial thick and thin blood films. However, many clinical laboratories now routinely perform rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) in addition to blood films when malaria is suspected. We sought to determine whether serial testing is necessary in this setting. We examined 388 cases of malaria diagnosed during 1999–2010 at three laboratories in Melbourne, Australia. For each case, we ascertained whether the diagnosis was made on initial or follow-up testing.

Nine cases (3.5%) were diagnosed following a negative initial blood film and RDT: 7 Plasmodium vivax, 1 P. ovale, and 1 P. falciparum. Of four case-patients with P. vivax in which clinical data were available, all had recent exposure to antimalarial medication. Our data suggest that among patients who have not received recent antimalarial therapy, and when RDTs are performed and blood films are prepared, most malaria diagnoses are made by using the first set of tests.

### Malaria diagnosis across the International Centers of Excellence for Malaria Research: Platforms, performance, and standardization [^1134LooG]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2015). Low credibility.

Diagnosis is defined as "the act of identifying a disease, illness, or problem by examining someone or something". When an individual with acute fever presents for clinical attention, accurate diagnosis leading to specific, prompt treatment often saves lives. In the context of malaria, not only is individual patient diagnosis important, but assessing population-level malaria prevalence using appropriate diagnostic methods is also essential for public health purposes. Similarly, identifying fake antimalarial medications prevents the use of counterfeit drugs that can have disastrous effects. Therefore, accurate diagnosis in broad areas related to malaria is fundamental to improving health-care delivery, informing funding agencies of malaria situations, and aiding in the prioritization of regional and national control efforts.

The International Centers of Excellence for Malaria Research (ICEMR), supported by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has collaborated on global efforts to improve malaria diagnostics by working to harmonize and systematize procedures across different regions where endemicity and financial resources vary. In this article, the different diagnostic methods used across each ICEMR are reviewed and challenges are discussed.

The British Society for Haematology (BSH) 2022 guidelines emphasize the importance of laboratory quality control in the context of malaria infection. They specifically recommend that laboratory personnel remain vigilant for the differential diagnosis of babesiosis. This is particularly crucial when intra-erythrocytic parasites are observed, but the patient's travel history or results from rapid diagnostic tests do not indicate a diagnosis of malaria.

### Rapid diagnostic tests versus clinical diagnosis for managing people with fever in malaria endemic settings [^112TetDc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

The included trials were all conducted in first-level health facilities in rural areas of Africa, where the majority of malaria cases occur and where rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) offer the only feasible alternative to presumptive treatment of malaria based on clinical symptoms alone. These trials are from settings with a range of levels of malaria endemicity, and the findings could reasonably be applied to other similar African settings.

The main concern of health workers regarding the use of RDTs is the risk of missing malaria cases and sending children home without antimalarials when the result of the RDT is a false negative. Reassuringly, this review found no difference in patient health outcomes when RDTs are introduced, and the trend is in the direction of benefit. However, only one trial adequately evaluated the risk of false negative results by applying the gold standard light microscopy to all fever patients in both treatment arms, and although the result did not reach statistical significance, the trend was towards higher numbers of missed cases when RDTs were used.

The additional trial from Uganda, which reported decreased RDT sensitivity in the setting with the lowest endemicity, adds to this concern. In this setting, of 404 patients with negative RDTs, 30 (7%) had malaria parasites following microscopy analysis. This risk may be considered too high by some patients and health workers unless adequate measures are taken to ensure the safety of these patients.

### A systematic literature review of microscopy methods reported in malaria clinical trials [^116u8CfT]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

Microscopy of stained blood films is essential for the diagnosis of malaria, differentiation of parasite species, and estimation of parasite density conducted for assessments of antimalarial drug efficacy. The accuracy and comparability of these measures over time and space are vital to discern the emergence or spread of antimalarial drug resistance. Although evidence-based guidelines for malaria microscopy methods exist, the traditional microscopy techniques used for parasitological assessments are subject to considerable methodological variations. This review aimed to critically explore how microscopy methods were reported in published malarial studies between 2013 and 2017, focusing on outlining the methodological differences and improving reporting standards in practice.

### Rapid diagnostic tests versus clinical diagnosis for managing people with fever in malaria endemic settings [^117MDK7b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

In 2010, the World Health Organization recommended that all patients with suspected malaria be tested for malaria before treatment. In rural African settings, light microscopy is often unavailable, so diagnosis has relied on detecting fever, and most people were given antimalarial drugs presumptively. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) provide a point-of-care test that may improve management, particularly of people for whom the RDT excludes the diagnosis of malaria.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate whether introducing RDTs into algorithms for diagnosing and treating people with fever improves health outcomes, reduces antimalarial prescribing, and is safe, compared to algorithms using clinical diagnosis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Disease Group Specialized Register; CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library); MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; LILACS; and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials for eligible trials up to 10 January 2014. We contacted researchers in the field and reviewed the reference lists of all included trials to identify any additional trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Individual or cluster randomized trials (RCTs) comparing RDT-supported algorithms and algorithms using clinical diagnosis alone for diagnosing and treating people with fever living in malaria-endemic settings.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently applied the inclusion criteria and extracted data. We combined data from individual and cluster RCTs using the generic inverse variance method. We presented all outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

### Rapid diagnostic tests for diagnosing uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in endemic countries [^1136FC2k]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for Plasmodium falciparum malaria utilize antibodies to detect either HRP-2 antigen or pLDH antigen. These tests can improve access to diagnostics in developing countries.

- **Objective**: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of RDTs for detecting P. falciparum parasitaemia in individuals living in endemic areas who present to ambulatory healthcare facilities with symptoms suggestive of malaria, categorized by type and brand.

- **Search strategy**: A comprehensive search was conducted through databases including the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, MEDION, Science Citation Index, Web of Knowledge, African Index Medicus, LILACS, and IndMED, up to January 14, 2010.

- **Selection criteria**: Studies comparing RDTs with a reference standard (microscopy or polymerase chain reaction) were selected. These studies involved blood samples from a random or consecutive series of patients attending ambulatory health facilities in P. falciparum endemic areas with symptoms suggestive of malaria.

- **Data collection and analysis**: For each study, two authors independently extracted a standard set of data using a tailored data extraction form. Comparisons were grouped hierarchically by target antigen, type, and brand of RDT, and combined in a meta-analysis where appropriate.

- **Main results**: We identified 74 unique studies as eligible for this review. The studies were categorized according to the antigens they detected. Types 1 to 3 include HRP-2 (from P. falciparum) either by itself or with other antigens, while Types 4 and 5 included pLDH (from P. falciparum) either alone or with other antigens. In comparison, studies revealed…

### Malaria rapid diagnostic tests in elimination settings — can they find the last parasite [^114v5bSC]? Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria have improved the availability of parasite-based diagnosis throughout the malaria-endemic world. Accurate malaria diagnosis is essential for malaria case management, surveillance, and elimination. RDTs are inexpensive, simple to perform, and provide results in 15–20 minutes. Despite high sensitivity and specificity for Plasmodium falciparum infections, RDTs have several limitations that may reduce their utility in low-transmission settings: they do not reliably detect low-density parasitaemia (≤ 200 parasites/μL), many are less sensitive for Plasmodium vivax infections, and their ability to detect Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium malariae is unknown. Therefore, in elimination settings, alternative tools with higher sensitivity for low-density infections, such as nucleic acid-based tests, are required to complement field diagnostics. New highly sensitive and specific field-appropriate tests must be developed to ensure accurate diagnosis of symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers.

As malaria transmission declines, the proportion of low-density infections among symptomatic and asymptomatic persons is likely to increase, which may limit the utility of RDTs. Monitoring malaria in elimination settings will probably depend on the use of more than one diagnostic tool in clinical care and surveillance activities. The combination of tools utilized will need to be informed by regular monitoring of test performance through effective quality assurance.

### Adding rapid diagnostic tests to community-based programmes for treating malaria [^111jXxuP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

The results of our investigation are presented through a comprehensive analysis of studies comparing rapid diagnostic tests with clinical diagnoses in community-based interventions. For a detailed overview, please refer to Tables 4 and 5.

- **Study flow diagram**: Figure 3 illustrates the study flow diagram. Initially, 3060 records were retrieved through database searches. After removing duplicates, 2080 records remained. Through title and abstract screening, we excluded 2011 records, leaving 69 full-text articles for eligibility assessment. Of these, 61 articles were excluded, and one study is ongoing. This review update incorporates seven new studies alongside one study from the original Cochrane Review by Okwundu (2013).

- **Included studies and settings**: Among the eight studies included, six were conducted in various African countries: Ghana (Ansah 2015), Uganda (Cohen 2015; Ndyomugyenyi 2016), Tanzania (Mubi 2011), the Democratic Republic of Congo (Swana 2016), and Senegal (Thiam 2012). The other two studies were performed in Afghanistan (Leslie 2017) and Myanmar (Ohnmar 2012). Each study indicated a rural setting, though malaria endemicity and transmission intensities varied among them.

### Clinical impact of malaria rapid diagnostic testing at a US children's hospital [^112N33uk]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2020). High credibility.

Children who develop malaria after returning to a setting in which the disease is not endemic are at high risk for critical delays in diagnosis and initiation of antimalarial therapy. We assessed the clinical impact of the implementation of malaria rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) on the management of children with malaria at an urban US children's hospital that serves a large immigrant population.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective cohort study of all children diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed malaria at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) between 2000 and 2014. RDT using a US Food and Drug Administration-approved immunochromatographic assay was introduced at CHOP on August 1, 2007. We compared clinical management and outcomes of patients with malaria diagnosed before and after RDT introduction.

- **Results**: We analyzed 82 pediatric malaria cases (32 before and 50 after RDT implementation). The majority of these patients had traveled to West Africa (91.5%) and were infected with Plasmodium falciparum (80.5%). The mean time to a positive result decreased from 10.4 to 0.9 hours (P < .001) after the introduction of RDT for patients with P. falciparum. The mean time to antimalarial therapy decreased from 13.1 to 6.9 hours (P = 0.023) in hospitalized patients. We found no significant reduction in the mean number of clinical signs of severe malaria between 0 and 48 hours of hospitalization and no difference in the need for exchange transfusion, time to resolution of parasitemia, or length of hospital stay.

- **Conclusions**: Implementation of RDT for malaria was associated with improved timing in diagnosis and treatment initiation for pediatric patients in our setting.

### Multicenter study to evaluate the OptiMAL test for rapid diagnosis of malaria in U.S. hospitals [^1144c3aj]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2003). Low credibility.

More than 1,000 cases of malaria are diagnosed each year in the United States. However, reported numbers may be artificially low because many clinicians fail to consider the diagnosis upon presentation. U.S. hospital laboratory technologists have very limited experience in detecting and identifying malaria parasites, and the reporting of malaria to state health departments is sporadic in many states.

In this study, a rapid malaria diagnostic test, the OptiMAL test (DiaMed; under license from Flow Inc, Portland, Oreg.), was evaluated in six U.S. hospitals and compared with results of microscopy. The OptiMAL test is a 15-minute rapid immunochromatographic test that identifies and differentiates Plasmodium falciparum from non-P. falciparum malaria parasites based on the detection of parasite lactate dehydrogenase in a drop of patient blood.

A total of 216 specimens from patients suspected of having malaria were tested. Results indicated that 43 samples (20%) were positive for malaria parasites by microscopy (32 P. falciparum, 11 non-P. falciparum), while 42 (19%) were positive by OptiMAL (31 P. falciparum, 11 non-P. falciparum). The sensitivity of the OptiMAL test was 98%, and its specificity was 100%, with positive and negative predictive values of 100% and 99%, respectively.

Participating hospital physicians and laboratory directors independently reported that the OptiMAL rapid malaria test was accurate, easy to use, and well accepted by those working in their diagnostic laboratories. The overall conclusion was that integration of the OptiMAL rapid malaria test into U.S. hospitals could enhance the diagnosis and management of malaria.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for diagnosing uncomplicated non-falciparum or Plasmodium vivax malaria in endemic countries [^111YUeF6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

Microscopic examination of Giemsa‐stained thick and thin blood films remains the conventional laboratory method and is still regarded as the 'gold standard'. Microscopic examination provides good sensitivity and specificity. It allows for species and stage differentiations and quantification of parasites, all of which are important in assessing the disease severity and prescribing appropriate therapy. Intensive examination is more likely to reveal parasitaemia, so the test is carried out with a fixed number of fields examined. Infections may be missed if slides are not examined carefully. Very low parasitaemia may be missed even by good quality microscopy; the limit of detection of thick smear microscopy has been estimated at approximately four to 20 asexual parasites per µL, although under field conditions a threshold of 50 to 100 asexual parasites per µL is more realistic. False positive results are also possible; if blood slides are not prepared carefully, artefacts may be formed which can be mistaken for Plasmodium parasites.

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which is a molecular method based on DNA amplification, is the most accurate method of detecting parasites in the blood. Compared to microscopy, PCR is less prone to observer error and more sensitive at low levels of parasitaemia. For PCR, the limit of detection may be as low as 0.004 asexual parasites per µL. However, whether this increased ability to detect low level parasitaemia makes it…

Other biases we considered for cRCTs were recruitment after randomization and contamination. For recruitment after randomization, baseline imbalance was minimal, and we therefore assessed all studies as having some concerns. While few studies mentioned the possibility of contamination, the description of the study sites did not suggest a high risk of bias. The exception was Mubi 2011, where the cross‐over design naturally lends itself to more potential for bias. It was also unclear how the significant difference in baseline parasite prevalence between groups in Swana 2016 affected this outcome measurement. Not all studies reported on the uptake of the mRDTs.

Effects of interventions

- **Comparison 1: Malaria rapid diagnostic test versus clinical diagnosis in community‐based care**. All the studies in this comparison were cRCTs; Mubi 2011 was the only study with a cross‐over cluster design.

- **All‐cause mortality**: Two studies reported deaths (Ansah 2015; Mubi 2011), although the single death reported in Ansah 2015 actually occurred after the study period. Given the very low number of deaths and the fact that these data were not adjusted for cluster or cross‐over designs, meta‐analysis was not possible. We do not know whether community use of mRDTs compared to clinical diagnosis affects mortality. In Mubi 2011, four participants died: three children under five years old.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for diagnosing uncomplicated non-falciparum or Plasmodium vivax malaria in endemic countries [^114WCHEq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Two review authors independently extracted data and resolved any discrepancies by discussion. In cases where only a subgroup of participants met the review inclusion criteria, we extracted and presented data only for that subgroup. Where two versions of one reference standard were used, such as local clinic and expert standard microscopy or field versus laboratory RDT testing, we only included the one most likely to yield the highest quality results.

For each study, we systematically extracted data on the characteristics of the study. We also extracted data relating to the sensitivity of the RDT at different levels of parasitaemia (asexual parasites per µL of blood) as presented by the study authors. For each comparison of index test with reference test, we extracted data on the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives in the form of a two-by-two table. RDT results are dichotomous; microscopy results were deemed positive at any level of asexual parasitaemia; and PCR results used the cut‐off points presented by the study authors. Gametocyte-only parasitaemia was considered negative; where a study was unclear on how they had classed gametocyte-only parasitaemia, they were assumed to have used the same classification as ourselves, and we included the data in the study.

We extracted data for each study using manufacturers' instructions in interpreting the RDT results. P. falciparum malaria only was considered as negative for RDT results.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for diagnosing uncomplicated non-falciparum or Plasmodium vivax malaria in endemic countries [^113WUweR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

- **Methods**:

	- **Criteria for considering studies for this review**:

		- **Types of studies**: Studies sampling a consecutive series of patients, or a randomly selected series of patients, were eligible. Where the report did not explicitly state that sampling was consecutive, but we judged that consecutive sampling was most probable, we included the report. We excluded studies if they did not present sufficient data to allow us to extract absolute numbers of true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives. Due to resource constraints, we also excluded studies if the report did not present enough information to allow a full assessment of eligibility or if the study was reported only in a non-English language.

	- **Participants**: Studies recruiting people living in P. vivax, P. ovale, or P. malariae endemic areas attending ambulatory healthcare settings with symptoms of uncomplicated malaria were eligible.

		We excluded studies if participants:

		- were non-immune people returning from endemic countries or were mainly recent migrants or displaced populations from non-endemic or very low endemicity areas;
		- had been treated for malaria and the test was performed to assess treatment outcome;
		- had symptoms of severe malaria;
		- did not have symptoms of malaria;
		- were recruited through active case finding (for example, door-to-door surveys).

		In studies where only a subgroup of participants was eligible for inclusion in the review, we included the study provided that we could extract relevant data specific to that subgroup. If studies included some patients with severe malaria, and we could not extract data specific to those with uncomplicated malaria, the study was excluded.

### The diagnosis and treatment of malaria in pregnancy: Green–top guideline no. 54b [^115xZ9C5]. RCOG (2010). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for malaria infection, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients (obstetric care), the RCOG 2010 guidelines recommend obtaining standard microscopy of thick and thin blood films at birth and weekly blood films for 28 days for screening of malaria in all neonates whose mothers developed malaria in pregnancy.

### Rapid diagnostic tests versus clinical diagnosis for managing people with fever in malaria endemic settings [^112spCLy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

Data extraction and management

JO and PG independently extracted outcomes data from the included trials, guided by a standard data extraction form. We resolved any disagreements by referring to the original paper and through discussions. Where necessary, we sought clarification from trial authors by contacting them directly to provide relevant data missing from the included trials (for example, number of participants by age group, number of health centres excluded from analysis).

- **Assessment of risk of bias in included studies**: JO and PG independently assessed and judged the quality of the selected papers using the standard criteria [Higgins 2011]. We assessed risk of bias against seven items: (1) how allocation sequence was generated; (2) how allocation was concealed to participants, investigators, and outcome assessors; (3) blinding of participants and investigators; (4) blinding of outcome assessors; (5) completeness of outcomes data (number analysed relative to number randomized); (6) selective reporting: whether all pre‐specified outcomes are reported; and (7) other sources of bias.

- **Measures of treatment effect**: For all the included outcomes, we calculated a risk ratio (RR) and presented the results alongside the 95% confidence interval (CI).

### Malaria diagnosis across the international centers of excellence for malaria research: Platforms, performance, and standardization [^112tyriu]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2015). Low credibility.

Malaria control and elimination strategies depend on providing appropriate treatment for parasitologically confirmed clinical malaria cases as well as asymptomatic carriers. Such specific treatment relies not only on accurate diagnostics but also on effective and pure, or "valid", drugs. Throughout the malaria-endemic world, *Plasmodium falciparum* has developed resistance to many antimalarial drugs, and chloroquine-resistant *Plasmodium vivax* has been reported in some regions.

To address multidrug-resistant malaria parasites, the WHO has recommended the use of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) to treat *P. falciparum* in most malaria-endemic regions. In areas of *P. vivax* chloroquine resistance, ACTs are also recommended or deployed for the treatment of vivax malaria. Due to the high demand and market value, there has been an issue with counterfeit ACTs. A field-deployable method to test drug potency is needed to help prevent the emergence of parasite drug resistance.

Recent work by the Southeast Asia ICEMR aims to develop an assay to verify the quality of artemisinin class antimalarials, as discussed later in the section on RDT to check the quality of artemisinin class antimalarials.

### Malaria rapid diagnostic tests in travel medicine [^111akgQY]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2013). Low credibility.

Malaria is a serious condition in the non-immune traveller, and its prognosis depends on timely diagnosis. Although microscopy remains the cornerstone of diagnosis, malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are increasingly used in non-endemic settings. These tests are easy to use, provide results rapidly, and require no specific training or equipment.

Reported sensitivities vary between different RDT products but are generally good for Plasmodium falciparum. RDTs that detect the P. falciparum antigen histidine-rich protein-2 (PfHRP2) score slightly better than those detecting P. falciparum-lactate dehydrogenase (Pf-pLDH). Sensitivity is lower for Plasmodium vivax (66.0–88.0%) and poor for Plasmodium ovale (5.5–86.7%) and Plasmodium malariae (21.4–45.2%).

Rapid diagnostic tests have several limitations, including the persistence of the PfHRP2 antigen, cross-reactions of P. falciparum with the non-falciparum test line and vice versa, and (rare) false-positive reactions due to other infectious agents or immunological factors. False-negative results may occur in cases of low parasite densities, the prozone effect, or pfhrp2 gene deletions. Additionally, errors in interpretation occur, partly due to inadequacies in the instructions for use. Finally, RDTs do not provide information about parasite density.

In the diagnostic laboratory, RDTs are a valuable adjunct to, but not a replacement for, microscopy for the diagnosis of malaria in returned travellers. In malaria-endemic settings, special groups of travellers, such as those travelling for long periods, expatriates, and short-stay frequent travellers, require particular consideration.

### Detecting malaria hotspots: A comparison of rapid diagnostic test, microscopy, and polymerase chain reaction [^114EUZiQ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Malaria control strategies need to respond to geographical hotspots of transmission. Detection of hotspots depends on the sensitivity of the diagnostic tool used.

- **Methods**: We conducted cross-sectional surveys in three sites within Kilifi County, Kenya, that had variable transmission intensities. Rapid diagnostic test (RDT), microscopy, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to detect asymptomatic parasitemia, and hotspots were detected using the spatial scan statistic.

- **Results**: Eight thousand five hundred eighty-one study participants were surveyed in three sites. There were statistically significant malaria hotspots by RDT, microscopy, and PCR for all sites except by microscopy in one low transmission site. Pooled data analysis of hotspots by PCR overlapped with hotspots by microscopy at a moderate setting but not at two lower transmission settings. However, variations in the degree of overlap were noted when data were analyzed by year. Hotspots by RDT were predictive of PCR/microscopy at the moderate setting, but not at the two low transmission settings. We observed long-term stability of hotspots by PCR and microscopy, but not RDT.

- **Conclusion**: Malaria control programs may consider PCR testing to guide asymptomatic malaria hotspot detection once the prevalence of infection falls.

### Adding rapid diagnostic tests to community-based programmes for treating malaria [^112hMTPw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Certainty of the evidence was assessed by integrating risk of bias for each meta-analyzed outcome using the GRADE approach. This resulted in very low-certainty evidence for the primary mortality outcomes due to extremely serious imprecision. However, there was moderate-certainty evidence for the outcome of antimalarial use in microscopy- or PCR-negative people and high-certainty evidence for the outcome of appropriateness of treatment.

We downgraded the certainty of evidence on antimalarial use in microscopy- or PCR-negative people for serious inconsistency, though subgroup analysis partially explained the heterogeneity. The certainty of the evidence related to the number of people treated with an antimalarial was downgraded by two levels due to risk of bias concerns, lack of blinding, an overall unclear to high risk of bias, and inconsistency. On the use of antibiotics following a negative mRDT result, the certainty of evidence was downgraded by one level to moderate due to serious imprecision, as the 95% CI included a trivial effect despite meeting the optimal information size.

- **Potential biases in the review process**: Strengths of this review include the use of recognized Cochrane methods and tools, the absence of language or publication date filters in the search, and the overall completeness of data. Where appropriately adjusted effect estimates were not available, we adjusted our effect estimates for binary outcomes by dividing both the numerator and denominator by the relevant factor.

### Malaria: An update for physicians [^1166bmwm]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Malaria remains the most important parasitic infection in humans. There have been significant advances in the treatment of both nonsevere and severe malaria with the advent of artemisinin combination therapies and parenteral artesunate, but the optimum supportive management of severe malaria is unclear. A broadly acceptable therapy for the prevention of relapses in Plasmodium vivax infection has not been discovered. Globally, the priority remains to prevent infection in the vulnerable, to move toward elimination where feasible, and to ensure that effective treatment is available to all. In developed settings, prevention of infection and its early recognition are crucial.

### Rapid diagnostic tests versus clinical diagnosis for managing people with fever in malaria endemic settings [^117NuwRC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

We analysed the data using Review Manager (RevMan). Where we had pooled data, we used the generic inverse variance method, which allows for meta-analysis of both individual and cluster randomized trials. When we detected moderate levels of heterogeneity, we combined trials using the random-effects model, which assumes the trials are estimating different but related intervention effects.

- **Quality of evidence**: We assessed the quality of evidence across each outcome measure using the GRADE approach. The quality rating across trials has four levels: high, moderate, low, or very low. RCTs are initially categorized as high quality but can be downgraded after assessment of five criteria: risk of bias, consistency, directness, imprecision, and publication bias.

- **Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity**: Where we detected moderate heterogeneity, we performed subgroup analyses by stratifying results by the level of health worker adherence to the RDT result, the level of malaria endemicity, and the age group of the targeted population.

### Limited level of accuracy provided by available rapid diagnosis tests for malaria enhances the need for PCR-based reference laboratories [^112XqHnB]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2001). Low credibility.

The rise of imported malaria cases and the high fatality rate in Europe make the search for new and easy diagnostic methods necessary. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are, in part, developed to address the lack of diagnostic experience. Unfortunately, our data suggest that the accuracy of RDTs is insufficient and could increase the number of incorrect malaria diagnoses.

### Performance of ultrasensitive rapid diagnostic tests for detecting asymptomatic [^1124Y9X4]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

Proposed interventions for eliminating drug-resistant *Plasmodium falciparum* malaria include targeting asymptomatic carriers through screening and treatment. We report on the diagnostic performance of the recently developed ultrasensitive rapid diagnostic test (uRDT) compared with conventional rapid diagnostic tests (cRDT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) under field conditions in Cambodia, involving a total of 2,729 individuals. The *P. falciparum* positivity by quantitative PCR (qPCR) was 3.8% (26/678) in those screened during active case detection and 0.5% (10/2,051) in the cross-sectional survey. Compared with qPCR, the sensitivity of the uRDTs was 53.8% (95% CI: 33.4–73.4%) during active case detection and 60.0% (95% CI: 26.2–87.8%) in the cross-sectional survey. The uRDTs did not show a significant improvement in diagnostic performance over cRDTs when used for active case detection and during a malaria prevalence survey in this low-transmission setting.

### Rapid diagnostic tests versus clinical diagnosis for managing people with fever in malaria endemic settings [^116gPYkN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

In 2010, the World Health Organization recommended that all patients with suspected malaria be tested before treatment. In rural African settings, light microscopy is often unavailable, so diagnosis has relied on detecting fever, with many people given antimalarial drugs presumptively. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) offer a point-of-care test that may improve management, particularly for those without malaria according to the RDT.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate whether introducing RDTs into diagnostic and treatment algorithms for people with fever improves health outcomes, reduces antimalarial prescribing, and is safe compared to algorithms relying solely on clinical diagnosis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Disease Group Specialized Register; CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library); MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; LILACS; and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials for eligible trials up to 10 January 2014. Contact with researchers in the field was made, and the reference lists of all included trials were reviewed to identify any additional trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Individual or cluster randomized trials (RCTs) comparing RDT-supported algorithms with those using only clinical diagnosis for diagnosing and treating people with fever in malaria-endemic settings.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently applied the inclusion criteria and extracted data. We combined data from individual and cluster RCTs using the generic inverse variance method, presenting all outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

### Imported malaria: an update [^112f1MX2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Evidence suggests that imported malaria poses a diagnostic challenge, with initial misdiagnosis rates of 40% or greater. Given that prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment are the only interventions proven to prevent progression to severe malaria and death, these figures are concerning. The purpose of this clinical review is to provide the most up-to-date and practical information on the diagnosis and treatment of imported malaria for the emergency healthcare provider.

- **Common pitfalls, errors, and mistakes**: We highlight frequent issues in arriving at the correct diagnosis.
- **Three key aspects to avoid progression to severe disease**: Emphasizing rapid diagnosis, prompt initiation of treatment, and the appropriate choice of antimalarial treatment is crucial.

### A diagnostic accuracy study to evaluate standard rapid diagnostic test (RDT) alone to safely rule out imported malaria in children presenting to UK emergency departments [^113MdG4U]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2023). High credibility.

Microscopy is the gold standard for malaria diagnosis but relies heavily on trained personnel. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are the primary diagnostic tool in endemic areas lacking access to high-quality microscopy. This study aimed to evaluate whether RDT alone could effectively rule out imported malaria in children presenting to UK emergency departments (EDs).

The study was a UK-based, multi-center, retrospective, diagnostic accuracy study. It included any child under 16 years presenting to ED with a history of fever and travel to a malaria-endemic country, between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2017. Diagnosis included microscopy for malarial parasites (clinical reference standard) and RDT (index test). The UK Health Research Authority approved the study under reference 20/HRA/1341.

There were 47 cases of malaria out of 1,414 eligible cases (prevalence 3.3%) in a cohort of children with a median age of 4 years (IQR 2–9), of whom 43% were female. Cases of Plasmodium falciparum totaled 36 (77%, prevalence 2.5%). The sensitivity of RDT alone to detect malaria infection due to any Plasmodium species was 93.6% (95% CI 82.5–98.7%), with a specificity of 99.4% (95% CI 98.9–99.7%). The positive predictive value was 84.6% (95% CI 71.9–93.1%), and the negative predictive value was 99.8% (95% CI 99.4–100.0%). Sensitivity of RDT to detect P. falciparum infection was 100% (90.3–100%), with a specificity of 98.8% (98.1–99.3%). The positive predictive value was 69.2% (54.9–81.2%, n = 46/52), and the negative predictive value was 100% (99.7–100%, n = 1,362/1,362).

In conclusion, RDTs were 100% sensitive in detecting P. falciparum malaria. However, they exhibited lower sensitivity for other malaria species.

### Machine learning approaches classify clinical malaria outcomes based on haematological parameters [^113BvV4z]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Fever is the most common symptom reported in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA), and correct diagnosis of the implicated pathogen is of high importance for precision medicine. Personalized treatment reduces overtreatment, decreases malaria mortality, and antimalarial resistance. This report demonstrates proof-of-principle that machine learning (ML) can be used to distinguish clinical malaria from non-malarial illness (nMI) using routine haematological data.

Case-by-case analysis showed that the models can make classifications based on a combination of three parameters: platelet and red blood cell (RBC) counts, lymphocyte counts/percentage, and mean platelet volume. These parameters could be used for precision diagnosis of an individual's risk of having malaria, to inform the need for confirmatory diagnosis by microscopy, or to prompt investigation for other diagnoses when malaria is unlikely.

Further work is needed to calibrate and improve the classification capability of the model using more data from other geographical and transmission settings, demographic groups, co-infections, and different disease severities. Our findings hold promise for the design of clinical software to support the diagnosis of malaria in the WHO African region and might also prove useful for the diagnosis of malaria in returning travelers from non-endemic countries.
